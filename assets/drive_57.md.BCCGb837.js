Our love then grew through a 5-year long-distance relationship. We were able to survive despite our pursuit to become a doctor and a lawyer. He was at the University of Michigan School of Medicine and I was at the University of Maryland School of Law. We encouraged each other. David proposed to me on May 15, 2011 in front of both of our families. It was amazing! I graduated from law school on that day David proposed and we got married the day after he graduated from medical school. David and I really didn't have much money to have a huge wedding, but we wanted the wedding of our dreams. We decided to plan everything ourselves. For decoration, I tried to create as many ideas as I could. We had a signature drink called \\"The Huxtable\\". We used mostly orchids as our flowers. We made our own seating chart by downloading a free template and printing it out on a huge foam board. We could not afford a backdrop to go behind the bridal party, so we made one out of tissue and two enormous peg boards. It was awesome. Many people wanted to buy our backdrop, but I gave it to our linen designer because he gave us crazy discounts. David designed our guestbook by using the Apple iphone photobook application. It was awesome. He came up with the title \\"Witness to love: David and Susan's Wedding Day\\" for the cover and then on the inside he stated this, in part, \\"Bearing Witness: Thank you for being a witness to our covenant with God as we commit ourselves to join as one...\\" I was moved deeply by his beautiful words. We make our ceremony programs. We had a couple of gifts for guests. We gave them a handkerchief with our initials at the church, candy from the self-made candy bar display and stainless steel measuring spoons that said \\"love beyond measure\\". We had a great wedding and the guests enjoyed themselves. By sharing my wedding story, I just want to tell you that you can have a wedding that you want within budget.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?

To provide a more detailed analysis of why people behave this way, I'll further break down the possible reasons and factors contributing to this behavior: 1. **Convenience**: Some people might find it more convenient to ask questions on a platform like Quora, which facilitates interactions and discussions, rather than merely relying on search engine results. They may be already using Quora for other purposes and prefer to keep their inquiries consolidated within the same platform. 2. **Personalized answers**: When asking a question on Quora, users may receive responses tailored specifically to their concerns. Search engines can provide a vast array of information, but not all of it may be relevant or personalized to the individual asking the question. Quora allows them to obtain more context-specific answers from people with unique experiences and perspectives. 3. **Human connection**: Engaging in conversations and asking questions on platforms like Quora fosters a sense of community and connection with other users. Instead of simply obtaining information from search engines, individuals can interact with others who have shared experiences or expertise in a specific field. This creates a more human, and often more satisfying, learning experience. 4. **Subjective opinions**: Certain questions may call for subjective viewpoints or opinions, rather than objective facts. Quora is a suitable platform for soliciting diverse perspectives from different people, whereas search engines can sometimes present predominantly factual, objective information. 5. **Clarity and comprehension**: Some users may struggle to understand or interpret the raw information provided by search engines. In such cases, asking a question on Quora allows them to receive detailed explanations and examples. Quora's responses tend to be in a conversational format, which can make complex information more palatable and accessible. 6. **Up-to-date information**: Quora can also expedite access to information by providing users with the most recent updates and developments on a topic, as many users actively participate to share fresh insights. Conversely, search engines may occasionally offer outdated resources or information. 7. **Confirmation bias**: Lastly, it is possible that some users gravitate towards Quora to seek confirmation of their pre-existing beliefs. Engaging with others who share similar opinions can reinforce their convictions and provide them with a sense of validation. In essence, while search engines are invaluable tools for swiftly delivering information, platforms like Quora offer the unique opportunity for users to engage with others, receive personalized answers, and foster a sense of community while learning. These different factors contribute to the popularity of Quora as a platform for asking questions that may be just as efficiently answered through search engines."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians.

Article:They are angry that the NHS is considering merging Scotland's two facilities, in the east and west, into one clinic based in Glasgow. The Cleft Lip and Palate Association has called for more detail about why the move to a single centre is needed. The Scottish government said no final decisions have been made. Almost 100 babies are born every year in Scotland with a cleft lip or palate. Surgery can help them talk and eat. Scotland has two clinics - in Edinburgh and Glasgow - which specialise in these surgical procedures. A public consultation is currently taking place about plans to merge them into one surgical centre, based at the new Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. Parents opposed to the plan have started a petition and gathered more than 3,500 signatures. They argue the service in Glasgow has poorer results but senior NHS managers have insisted the single-handed surgical service in Edinburgh is not sustainable. A public consultation meeting is being held in Edinburgh later, with another due to take place in Glasgow on Thursday. The Cleft Lip and Palate Association, a voluntary organisation offering advice and support to those affected by the condition, said it was important that the views of patients were heard in the consultation process. It previously said it wanted the surgical service to remain on two sites because of \\"a lack of evidence to show that the existing structure wasn't working\\". It has urged the NHS to provide further detail \\"on either the issues with the current two centre model or the structure of a service based at one centre\\". A spokeswoman said: \\"We will continue to ask for clear and transparent sharing of information regarding the review and its recommendation to move to a single centre, and we are also vigilant on the potential erosion of services across cleft teams as NHS budgets come under increasing pressure. \\"We actively encourage all those in the cleft community, children and adults, to respond to the consultation process and to include CLAPA (Scotland) in their correspondence so we can continue to monitor the situation and ensure a broad spectrum of voices are heard at this crucial time in the consultation process.\\" Health Secretary Shona Robison said the review was an \\"on-going process\\" and that no final decisions had been made. She added: \\"A consultation is underway, and the views of patients and families, are not just welcome, but an extremely important part of the process. \\"It's important to state that this review applies only to specialist surgery services. It does not impact on other important cleft unit services such as orthodontist treatment, speech and language therapy and dentistry, which will continue to be provided locally throughout Scotland.\\" A spokesman for NHS National Services Scotland said: \\"It is essential to have a service that can be properly staffed and resourced that can provide a high quality, resilient and sustainable service for the long term for NHS Scotland. \\"Specialist services like cleft lip and palate with a few complex operations a year often benefit from concentrating surgical skills in one place.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Parents and the Cleft Lip and Palate Association (CLAPA) in Scotland have expressed anger over plans by the NHS to merge the country's two cleft lip and palate clinics into one facility in Glasgow.

Movie title: Life of Brian Movie plot: Brian Cohen is born in a stable a few doors down from the one in which Jesus is born, a fact which initially confuses the three wise men who come to praise the baby Jesus, as they must put up with Brian's boorish mother Mandy until they realize their mistake.Brian grows up to be an idealistic young man who resents the continuing Roman occupation of Judea, even after learning his father was a Roman Centurion - Naughtius Maximus. While attending Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, he becomes attracted to a young female rebel, Judith. His desire for Judith and hatred for the Romans lead him to join the People's Front of Judea, one of many factious and bickering separatist movements, who spend more time fighting each other than the Romans.The group's cynical leader Reg gives Brian his first assignment as a rebel: an attempt at scrawling some graffiti (\\"Romanes eunt domus\\", poorly translated Latin for \\"Romans Go Home\\") on the wall of the governor's palace. He is soon confronted by a passing Centurion who, in disgust at Brian's faulty Latin grammar, forces him to write out the grammatically correct message (\\"Romani ite domum\\") one hundred times. The walls of the fortress are literally covered in text by dawn.When the Roman guards change shifts at daybreak, the new guards immediately try to arrest Brian. After a series of misadventures, the fugitive winds up in a motley group of mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced to come up with something plausible in order to blend in, he babbles pseudo-religious nonsense which quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience.

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, Brian does get crucified in the movie \\"Life of Brian.\\" Towards the end of the film, after numerous comedic misadventures, Brian is captured by the Romans. He is then sentenced to be crucified along with several others. In a satirical take on crucifixion, the scene showcases upbeat singing and an ironic theme of looking at the bright side of life, despite the dire circumstances. As the movie progresses, Brian becomes an unwilling and accidental messiah figure, with people mistakenly believing him to have divine powers. This culminates in his crucifixion – an event that bears a parallel to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, albeit in a highly satirical and comedic manner. The film \\"Life of Brian\\" has been hailed by some as a classic comedy, but has also been criticized for its controversial religious themes.

Police procedurals depict a number of police-related topics such as forensics, autopsies, the gathering of evidence, the use of search warrants, and interrogation. - Jonathan Glassner is a Norwegian - American television writer , director , and producer .

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. It may seem corny to you at first, but repeating self-affirmations to yourself will help you practice self-compassion. As you brush your teeth or get ready for work, repeat a mantra that is meaningful to you and expresses kindness to yourself. For example, you might say something like, “I accept myself today for who I am” or “I love myself completely.” If you have particular areas of weakness, such as anxiety or body image issues, try focusing your self-affirmations on those. For example, if you experience frequent anxiety, a helpful self-affirmation might be “I will do the best that I can do today. I cannot do more than my best. I cannot control others’ actions.” If you experience body image issues, try finding something positive to focus on: “I will be kind to my body today, because I deserve kindness” or \\"I look happy and healthy today.\\" Confidence is key when becoming emotionally stronger. Being confident in the fact that you are a unique and worthy individual will help you feel more in control of your emotions. When something bad happens, remind yourself that you have the ability to overcome this obstacle, whatever it may be. Remind yourself that even the difficulties you have gone through are learning experiences. You can draw strength and courage from knowing that you have made it through tough times, and you can do it again. Make a list of things you like about yourself. These could be skills, personal strengths, achievements...anything. Don't minimize your abilities and good qualities. If you're having trouble thinking of things, ask a friend to help you. They probably see many wonderful things about you that you might not even be aware of. Set yourself a (reasonable) challenge to accomplish. For example, you could learn to cook a meal for your friends, or learn a few new poses in yoga, or learn to take artsy photographs. If you love to exercise, train for a 5k or 10k. Once you have accomplished this goal, celebrate it! Honor your successes, no matter how small they may seem to you. Don't compare yourself to others. This is a surefire way to damage anyone's self-confidence. Only you are the unique person who is you. The only person whose approval you need to seek is yours. Set goals that matter to you, and don't worry if they're not the same as everyone else's. Your physical health can directly affect your emotional health, and vice versa. Caring for your physical health can help you feel less stressed. It can also increase your feelings of well-being and make it easier for you to handle your emotions. Exercising is an important part of staying emotionally healthy. When you exercise, your body releases endorphins that make you happy. Next time you find yourself getting upset, go on a walk, run, or to the gym. Studies have shown that regular, moderate exercise makes you feel calmer and happier. ” You can develop emotional strength by focusing on positive emotions such as compassion and gratitude. Maintaining a compassionate, grateful attitude will help you understand that many of your fears and anxieties are shared by others. This will allow you to be kind to yourself and to others. Research has shown that people who regularly practice active gratitude are more resilient in handling trauma. It can also help you interpret even the suffering and negative things in life as learning and survival experiences that have contributed to the self you are now. Gratitude can help keep you from judging others. Gratitude is more than feeling grateful. We often cannot control what feelings appear. Trying to control those feelings can overwhelm us. Instead, gratitude is an active exercise in recognizing and savoring the positive. Keeping a gratitude journal, learning prayers of gratitude in your spiritual tradition, and stopping to savor a beautiful or positive experience can all help you practice gratitude. Exercising empathy for others can help you build stronger, healthier relationships. It can also help you develop healthier ways of dealing with your own emotions and feelings. Studies have shown that “loving-kindness” or “compassion” meditation can be a good way to exercise your empathy muscles.Compassion meditation not only enhances your feelings towards others, it has also been shown to decrease depressive symptoms. There are many ways to practice compassion meditation, although several methods stem from Buddhist traditions. Read novels. Fiction can encourage you to imagine what it would be like to experience emotions and situations unlike you own. Some studies suggest that reading novels can increase your ability to empathize with others. Avoid jumping to conclusions. Studies have shown that when we think about what others “deserve,” we feel less empathy for them. Try not to assume that others “deserve” or are responsible for their suffering. Extend that same compassion to yourself, too. We’re all human. Uncertainty can be scary, and it can be the cause of a lot of emotional trouble. Being unable to live with uncertainty can cause you to constantly worry, avoid uncertain situations, and become overly reliant on others’ reassurance. Uncertainty is also an unavoidable fact of human life. You can develop your emotional strength by practicing accepting uncertainty. “Intolerance of uncertainty” plays a large role in anxiety. When you have a low tolerance for uncertainty, you find it difficult to accept that it is not impossible for something negative to happen. You may ask “What if” questions or overestimate the risks and consequences of a negative situation or event. You may find yourself consumed with worry. Keep a journal throughout the day of times when you feel uncertain or anxious. Write down, as specifically as possible, what triggered these feelings. How did you respond to them? Rank your uncertainties. Try to place things that make you feel uncomfortable or anxious on a scale from 0-10. For example, “going shopping without a list” might rank as a 2, but “delegating a project to someone else at work” might be an 8 or 9. Practice tolerating uncertainty. Start safe and small. Learn to manage your fear of uncertainty by exposing yourself to it in safe, manageable situations. For example, if you only ever go to one restaurant because you’re worried you wouldn’t like the food somewhere else, try to pick a new place and eat something you have never tried before. You may or may not enjoy the food. However, you will have shown yourself that you can handle uncertainty and come out okay on the other side. Work up to bigger uncertainties gradually. Record your responses. When you try out something uncertain, record what happened when you did this. What did you do? How did you feel while you were doing it? How did it turn out? If things didn’t go as planned (and this will happen), how did you respond? Were you able to handle the unexpected outcome? Ruminating is a common response to many emotions, especially feelings of sadness or anger. When you ruminate, you obsess about things. You think about a particular situation, thought, or feeling over and over again. It’s like a broken record that keeps playing the same 5 seconds of a song. Ruminating can keep you from coming up with a helpful solution to a problem. It can also trap you in a cycle of negative thinking that can lead to depression and stress. Perfectionism can foster ruminating. So can an “excessive relational focus,” where you overvalue your relationships so much that you will do anything to keep them, even when that is costly or unhealthy. Part of a ruminating loop is getting stuck on the same negative thought. Rather than allowing yourself to think the same thoughts over and over, challenge those negative thoughts! Reframe the negative thoughts in positive terms. For example, if you have recently broken up with a romantic partner, it can be easy to focus on everything that went wrong. These thoughts can become exaggerated, to where you might feel like the situation was all your fault. You might rehearse “what if” thoughts. You might feel like you’re a failure and you can’t do anything right. Instead, try to focus on a productive, realistic thought. For example: “My relationship with that person ended. I didn’t want that to happen, but I can form another healthy relationship. I can use all I've learned from this one to have a stronger relationship with the next person.” Ruminating often focuses on abstract, unanswerable questions such as “Why does this always happen to me?” or “What’s wrong with me?” Rather than focus on huge, vague ideas that may not even be accurate, try to think about specifics you can do to address your problem. For example, if you’re worried that your work isn’t going well, make a list of specific actions you can take to address that situation. Call a friend or someone you trust for help, if you can’t think of anything on your own. As another example, perhaps you are frustrated because your romantic relationships always seem to end up the same way. Think specifically about what traits you look for in a romantic partner. What sorts of people are you attracted to? What do you tend to do in relationships with them? What do they tend to do? Are any of these elements related to how your relationships end up? Feeling emotionally weak might make it more difficult for you express your feelings, thoughts, and needs to others. Practicing assertive communication will help you make sure that you are clearly communicating your needs and desires. It may also help you feel more confident in yourself. Being assertive is very different from being arrogant. Being assertive about your emotions doesn’t mean that you don’t consider others’ feelings. In fact, you respect others’ emotions and needs. You also respect your own emotions and needs. By establishing communication based on mutual respect and openness, you will become a stronger communicator. Arrogant people often base their strength and confidence on external factors, such as how others think of them. This can cause arrogant individuals to prioritize their own feelings over others’. Being assertive means that you know that you have self-worth on your own. You can communicate your feelings openly, honestly, and respectfully because you are not worried how others will judge you. Use “I”-statements. This will help you own your emotions without “mind-reading” or making others feel blamed. For example, if your partner forgot your birthday, don’t assume that it is because s/he doesn’t care about you and react based on that. Instead, use an “I”-statement to state how you feel: “I felt hurt when you forgot my birthday. I’d like to talk about what happened.” Rather than assigning blame and making the other person defensive, you’ve expressed your feelings and invited the other person to share their experience. If you wait until you feel like making a change in your emotional life, you may wait a long time. Practice behaving as if you already have made progress. Learning to tolerate the discomfort and uncertainty from new ways of thinking and behaving is a great way to become stronger emotionally. For example, if you feel isolated and sad because you tend to be shy and not approach new people, choose to behave differently. You may not “feel like” going out or striking up a conversation at first, but you will become more comfortable with practice. Even more importantly, you will know that you are taking steps to become stronger and healthier. It’s a common myth that therapy is only for people whose issues are so \\"serious\\" that they have no other option. This isn’t true. A therapist or counselor can help you learn to understand and process your emotions. They can help you learn coping techniques and how to become a stronger, healthier person. There are many types of health professionals. Psychiatrists and Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners are usually the only ones who prescribe medication. They may also offer counseling. Clinical Psychologists, Licensed Clinical Social Workers, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, and Licensed Professional Counselors can all offer counseling services. Many services offer counseling and therapy. Talk with your doctor or insurance company to find someone in your location.","completion":"Repeating self-affirmations, practicing gratitude and empathy, accepting uncertainty, reframing negative thoughts, communicating assertively, and seeking professional help can contribute to building emotional strength and improving mental well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The detained man, reported to be a Swedish national, has a history of psychiatric problems, the Spanish interior minister said. Barcelona's city hall said the truck had been stolen. Police started pursuing the vehicle after the driver, who was travelling at high speeds, failed to stop when ordered to do so, regional police chief Joan Carles Molinero said. The driver then turned to make his way along the wrong side of a ring road in the city, finally coming to a stop when the truck hit a wall at about 11:00 local time (10:00 GMT). Around 20 officers and at least six police cars arrived quickly on site, where several gas bottles were later seen lying on the ground. At least one gunshot was visible on the windscreen of the truck, although officials have not said whether there were any injuries following the incident. Spanish national television TVE reported that the truck had rammed several cars before police fired several times to stop it. Spain's interior minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said in a tweet that the incident on Tuesday was \\"not a case of a terrorist act\\". \\"The detained driver of the stolen butane gas truck has a psychiatric history,\\" Mr Zoido said. Mireia Ruiz, who witnessed the incident, said the driver ignored others who were urging him to stop. \\"When people shouted at him, he would laugh and make offensive gestures with his hand,\\" she told AFP.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: John couldn't arise from his position, so he remained at his desk. What might his position be? Possible A: get down, kneeling, lie down, lay down, sitting down Why is \\"sitting down\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Sitting down\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons, which will be discussed in detail below: 1. Context: In the given context, John is described to be at his desk. It is most likely that someone at a desk would be in a seated position. Desks are commonly designed to be utilized while sitting down on chairs or stools. Therefore, given the context, human common sense would associate the position with sitting down, rather than other possible positions. 2. Social and cultural norms: In many societies and cultures, the standard practice when working at a desk or an office environment involves sitting down. Humans have been conditioned to expect that a person would be sitting while working at a desk. Hence, common sense would again guide one towards choosing \\"sitting down\\" as a likely position of John. 3. Ergonomics and practicality: Desks and chairs are commonly designed with ergonomics in mind, offering a comfortable and efficient workspace for an individual. Most desks are built at a height meant for the use of a chair. Attempting to work at a desk from a position like kneeling, lying down, or laying down would be impractical and uncomfortable, making it less likely for John to be in these positions while at his desk. 4. Frequency and probability: The position of \\"sitting down\\" is a more frequently observed position at a desk compared to the other given options. Human common sense is influenced by the frequency and likelihood of encountering various situations in daily life. Since it is more common to observe people sitting down at desks in most settings, this position would be considered more aligned with human common sense. 5. Language and idiomatic usage: The question's phrasing, \\"John couldn't arise from his position,\\" suggests that John was in a position that required some effort or assistance to stand up from. Comparatively, sitting down is an easier position to arise from than lying or kneeling positions, making it more likely that common sense would lead to the conclusion that he was sitting down. Additionally, \\"remaining at his desk\\" is a phrase that is frequently used to imply that an individual continues to perform their work in a seated position, which further reinforces the idea of sitting down being the common sense answer. In summary, the answer \\"sitting down\\" is aligned with human common sense due to the context of the question, social and cultural norms, ergonomics and practicality, frequency and probability of observed positions, and the language and idiomatic usage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Donald Trump and the Central Park Five: the racially charged rise of a demagogue Yusef Salaam was 15 years old when Donald Trump demanded his execution for a crime he did not commit. Nearly three decades before the rambunctious billionaire began his run for president – before he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, for the expulsion of all undocumented migrants, before he branded Mexicans as “rapists” and was accused of mocking the disabled – Trump called for the reinstatement of the death penalty in New York following a horrific rape case in which five teenagers were wrongly convicted. The miscarriage of justice is widely remembered as a definitive moment in New York’s fractured race relations. But Trump’s intervention – he signed full-page newspaper advertisements implicitly calling for the boys to die – has been gradually overlooked as the businessman’s chances of winning the Republican nomination have rapidly increased. Now those involved in the case of the so-called Central Park Five and its aftermath say Trump’s rhetoric served as an unlikely precursor to a unique brand of divisive populism that has powered his rise to political prominence in 2016. Related: Media outlets dare to call Donald Trump a liar, racist and misogynist “He was the fire starter,” Salaam said of Trump, in his first extended interview since Trump announced his run for the White House. “Common citizens were being manipulated and swayed into believing that we were guilty.” It was 1989. The crack epidemic had torn through New York as poverty soared to 25% and the city’s elites reaped the rewards of a booming Wall Street. The murder rate had risen to 1,896 killings a year; 3,254 rapes would be reported in the five boroughs, but only one captured the city’s extended attention and later exposed bias in its criminal justice system and media establishment. On the evening of 19 April, as 28-year-old investment banker Trisha Meili, who was white, jogged across the northern, dilapidated section of Central Park, she was brutally attacked – bludgeoned with a rock, gagged, tied and raped. She was left for dead but discovered hours later, unconscious and suffering from hypothermia and severe brain damage. The New York police department believed they already had the culprits in custody. That same night, a group of more than 30 youths had entered the park from East Harlem. Some engaged in a rampage of random criminality, hurling rocks at cars, assaulting and mugging passersby. Among the group was Salaam, along with 14-year-olds Raymond Santana and Kevin Richardson, 15-year-old Antron McCray and 16-year-old Korey Wise. The teenagers – four African American and one Hispanic – would become known collectively as the Central Park Five. They would all later deny any involvement in criminality that night, but as they were rounded up and interrogated by the police at length, they said, they were forced into confessing to the rape. “I would hear them beating up Korey Wise in the next room,” recalled Salaam. “They would come and look at me and say: ‘You realise you’re next.’ The fear made me feel really like I was not going to be able to make it out.” Four of the boys signed confessions and appeared on video without a lawyer, each arguing that while they had not been the individual to commit the rape they had witnessed one of the others do it, thereby implicating the entire group. The city erupted. The case came to embody not only fears that accompanied the dramatic rise of violent crime in New York, but also its perceived racial dynamics. The case of a black woman, raped the same day in Brooklyn by two men who threw her from the roof of a four-story building, received little media attention. Just two weeks after the Central Park attack, before any of the boys had faced trial and while Meili remained critically ill in a coma, Donald Trump, whose office on Fifth Avenue commanded an exquisite view of the park’s opulent southern frontier, intervened. He paid a reported 85,000 to take out advertising space in four of the city’s newspapers, including the New York Times. Under the headline “Bring Back The Death Penalty. Bring Back The Police!” and above his signature, Trump wrote: “I want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples so that others will think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence.” Salaam, now 41, cannot remember exactly where he was when he first saw the ads. He had no idea who Trump was. “I knew that this famous person calling for us to die was very serious,” he recalled. “We were all afraid. Our families were afraid. Our loved ones were afraid. For us to walk around as if we had a target on our backs, that’s how things were.” All five minors had already been paraded in front of the cameras and had their names and addresses published, but Salaam said he and his family received more death threats after the papers ran Trump’s full-page screed. On a daytime TV show two days later, a female audience member called for the boys to be castrated and echoed the calls for the death penalty if Meili died. Pat Buchanan, the former Republican White House aide, called for the oldest of the group, Wise, to be “tried, convicted and hanged in Central Park by June 1”. “Had this been the 1950s, that sick type of justice that they wanted – somebody from that darker place of society would have most certainly came to our homes, dragged us from our beds and hung us from trees in Central Park. It would have been similar to what they did to Emmett Till,” Salaam said. All five boys pleaded not guilty at trial the following year. The prosecution’s case rested almost entirely on the confessions they had given shortly after the incident. As would become crucial later on, there was no DNA evidence linking any of them to the crime scene and Meili, who made a miraculous recovery and testified in court, could not remember any details of the attack. The jury found all five boys guilty. The court condemned them to prison to serve sentences ranging from five to 10 years and five to 15 years. Wise, who had remained in the city’s notorious Rikers Island jail, was sentenced as an adult. Michael Warren, the veteran New York civil rights lawyer who would later come to represent the Central Park Five, is certain that Trump’s advertisements played a role in securing conviction. “He poisoned the minds of many people who lived in New York and who, rightfully, had a natural affinity for the victim,” said Warren. “Notwithstanding the jurors’ assertions that they could be fair and impartial, some of them or their families, who naturally have influence, had to be affected by the inflammatory rhetoric in the ads.” A spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign declined to comment. For many who have studied Trump’s rise to prominence, the Central Park case provided an early glimpse into how his racially charged views entered his political and tactical mindset. “He has this penchant for what you might call otherising,” said Michael D’Antonio, the author of Never Enough, a recently published Trump biography. “I think he knew what he was doing by taking a side, and I think he knew he was aligning himself with law and order, especially white law and order. I don’t think that he was consciously saying ‘I’d like to whip up racial animosity’, but his impulse is to run into conflict and controversy rather than try to help people understand what might be going on in a reasoned way.” I think he knew what he was doing by taking a side, and I think he knew he was aligning himself with white law and order Two years before the Central Park case, Trump had briefly considered a run for president that most dismissed as a naked attempt to drum up publicity for his book The Art of the Deal, released later that year. But he couldn’t resist the opportunity to speak in New Hampshire at the invitation of the Portsmouth Republican committee, using the platform to single out allies in Saudi Arabia and Japan while critiquing US foreign policy in the Persian Gulf. He employed the same tactics as he would in 1989, publishing full-page ads in three of America’s biggest newspapers that called for the US to impose taxes on these allies, whom he argued were “taking advantage of the United States”. In February 2000, when Trump was again flirting with a run for the White House, he took out anonymous ads in local upstate New York newspapers, in an effort to shut down a rival casino backed by a group of Native Americans. Beneath a picture of needles and drug paraphernalia, the ad stated: “Are these the new neighbors we want?” It added: “The St. Regis Mohawk Indian record of criminal activity is well documented.” Trump later apologised, but his biographer argued the incident underlined a “willingness to use rhetoric that other people won’t use under the guise of talking straight” that is now a fixture on the campaign trail. After declaring in his campaign announcement that Mexico was “bringing crime” and “rapists” to the US, Trump quickly seized on the murder case of a 32-year-old white woman in San Francisco in which an undocumented Mexican migrant is the chief suspect. He has since frequently condoned and incited violence against protesters at his rallies, and has vowed to bring back waterboarding of terror suspects. In referencing a promise to issue an executive order to mandatorily execute anyone in the US who kills a police officer, he said: “We just can’t afford any more to be so politically correct.” But examples of overt racism were perhaps kept behind closed doors in the late 1980s. One year after the Central Park Five were convicted, John O’Donnell, a former executive who ran Trump Plaza hotel and casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, published a tell-all alluding to his former boss’s casual racism behind closed doors. He quoted Trump as saying: “I’ve got black accountants at Trump Castle and at Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.” In a later interview with Playboy magazine, Trump labelled his former employee a “fucking loser” but added: “The stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.” But Barbara Res, a member of Trump’s inner circle through much of the 1980s who served as his executive vice-president in 1989, told the Guardian she never witnessed any signs of racism throughout her time at his company and was “surprised” by his inflammatory rhetoric today. “I think he got angry when he saw what happened to that woman, and I think he reacted to it,” she said of the Central Park jogger case. “I think we were all horrified at what happened. I think everybody basically supported Donald. I don’t think he was trying to be racist – I think he was trying to be a proponent of law and order.” For Salaam, however, the intent was explicit: “If we were white, would Donald Trump had written this in the paper?” In 2002, after Salaam had served seven years in prison, Matias Reyes, a violent serial rapist and murderer already serving life inside, came forward and confessed to the Central Park rape. He stated that he had acted by himself. A re-examination of DNA evidence proved it was his semen alone found on Meili’s body, and just before Christmas that year, the convictions against each member of the Central Park Five were vacated by New York’s supreme court. By this point, Trump had gotten his wish: the death penalty had been reinstated in New York since 1995, at great cost to the state. It was subsequently abolished in 2007, without a single execution carried out. Following a 14-year court battle, the Central Park Five settled a civil case with the city for 41m in 2014. But far from offering an apology for his conduct in 1989, Trump was furious. In an opinion piece for the New York Daily News, he described the case as the “heist of the century”. “Settling doesn’t mean innocence, but it indicates incompetence on several levels,” Trump wrote, alluding to how police and prosecutors initially involved in the case have long maintained the five boys were involved in the rape, even after the convictions were thrown out. D’Antonio, the biographer, met with Trump shortly after the settlement was announced. The billionaire was once again considering a shot at the presidency and would, this time, actually run. Trump was asked if he worried that his publicly confrontational style would affect his political prospects. He retorted instantly with a reference to the Central Park Five. “I think it will help me,” he said. “I think people are tired of politically correct. I just attacked the Central Park Five settlement. Who’s going to do that?” The biographer was shocked by what he heard. “His insensitivity and inability to adjust to reality is sometimes shocking,” D’Antonio said of Trump. “But I don’t think that he is necessarily interested in reality as others experience it or as it’s determined by the courts. “There have been few cases of injustice that are as clear and profound as this one is, but he’s not able to consider that.” Salaam, who said he had been scarred for life by his experiences in prison, also felt insulted. But it was the announcement last June that Trump had finally decided to run for president that was, in a way, more alarming. “To see that he has not changed his position of being a hateful person, to see that he has not changed his position of inciting people, to see that he’s still the same person and in many ways he has perfected his sense of being that number-one inciter, you know, I was scared,” Salaam said. He was unsurprised that Trump currently leads polling averages by nearly 20 points in South Carolina, a state that votes for the Republican nomination on Saturday and where only last year the Confederate flag was withdrawn from the state house grounds. (A survey released this week suggests 70% of Trump’s supporters in south Carolina believe that decision was wrong and 38% of his supporters wish the south had won the civil war.) “I thought for a moment: What would this country look like with Donald Trump as being a president? That’s a scary thing,” Salaam said. “That’s a very scary thing.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article examines the Central Park Five case and its aftermath, arguing that Donald Trump's intervention in the case, including placing full-page newspaper advertisements calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty, contributed to divisive populism which has fueled Trump's later political career.

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The drama begins in an asylum in Whitby, England. A mysterious patient escapes from his cell and intrudes upon a small party hosted by Dr. Seward, referring to the guest of honorâCount Draculaâas \\"Master.\\" Moments later he insists he does not know the Count and is led back to his cell. In conversation, it emerges the Count is sensitive to sunlight, has only recently arrived from abroad, and that Seward's fiancee Lucy finds him fascinating. Dr. Van Helsing comes to consult on the case, and manages to hypnotize the patient, so he recounts in flashback events in Transylvania, including an attack by Dracula's brides. Denholm Elliott and Susan George Lucy, meanwhile, greets her old friend Mina Harker, who is distraught over the disappearance of her husband, Jonathan. She is puzzled when Dracula insists that Harker left unharmed months ago. Later, the mysterious patient catches sight of Mina and calls her by name. He is the missing Jonathan Harker. Dracula visits Lucy at night, feeding on her blood and forcing the two doctors to perform a blood transfusion. Van Helsing recognizes the signs of a vampire attack, but at first refrains from explaining this to Seward. When he does, the English scientist balks, but later comes to suspect Count Dracula of being the vampire. Despite Helsing's efforts, Dracula controls Mrs. Weston to remove the garlic from Lucy's bed. Through Harker, they find out Dracula has attacked her. By the time they get back, it's too late, Lucy dies and begins turning into a vampire. Lucy is soon buried and Mina goes to pay her respects to her grave. Mina sees Lucy, unaware she is now a vampire, who insists she is happy and ecstatic, offering her the same \\"joy\\" as she bites her friend. Lucy vanishes and Dracula appears, offering Mina a chance to be one of the \\"elect.\\" Meanwhile, Van Helsing proves to Seward that Lucy has risen from the grave and drives a wooden stake through her heart.

Possible answers: - unacceptable. - acceptable.","completion":"The sentence \\"The Emperor's every wish was immediately carried out.\\" would be considered acceptable by the strictest standards of a linguist. Here is a detailed explanation: 1. Subject: \\"The Emperor's every wish\\" - It is a proper subject, using the possessive form (\\"Emperor's\\") to indicate that the wishes belong to the Emperor. The word \\"every\\" is an adjective which emphasizes that all the wishes are being discussed. 2. Verb: \\"was immediately carried out\\" - The verb tense used in this sentence is the passive voice of the verb \\"carry out.\\" The use of the passive voice is appropriate here since the action (carrying out the wishes) is more important than the doer of the action. The adverb \\"immediately\\" further describes the promptness with which the wishes were carried out. 3. Syntax: The sentence follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) order, which is common in English sentences. This order makes the sentence easy to comprehend for most English speakers. 4.

I have a new situation: With my previous cell phone, in order to charge it I would have a plug the charger into the wall and the plug the cord into my phone to connect it to the electric source. With my new phone, I just place the phone into the charging dock and my phone is charge wirelessly. But I can use this background: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. What is an answer for this question: Was my new cell phone being charge using induction or conduction? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Your new cell phone is being charged using induction. This is because wireless charging, as you described with your new phone and charging dock, works on the principle of electromagnetic induction. In this method, an electric current is generated in the phone's internal charging coil by a changing magnetic field produced by the dock's charging coil. The generated electric current then charges the phone's battery. There is no direct physical contact between the phone and the charging dock, which is a key characteristic of charging by induction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The ruins of Moore, Oklahoma, a town destructed for the fourth time in 14 years by a major tornado , are a reminder that current building codes can't do much to prevent property destruction and loss of life, especially when a powerful tornado cuts through town. But the total death number can be reduced when people take shelter in underground storm bunkers and hardened safe rooms. The tornado that carved a path of destruction through Moore took 24 lives. Its winds were clocked at 400 kilometers per hour. With only 15 minutes' warning, residents fled town or took refuge in the firmest corners of their homes. The luckiest were able to climb into shelters or move to safe rooms. In Moore those rooms saved lives. But at two schools destroyed by Monday's tornado, no such shelter was available. Leslie Chapman Henderson is CEO of a non-profit group called the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes. She's an advocate for tornado safe rooms. \\"The safe room is an interior room of the home that has been reinforced and tested to withstand high wind. In fact, we've already heard of stories of survival of people who were in safe rooms, either above or below ground,\\" she said. Better storm forecasts give people more time to react. But they need someplace safe to go. Buildings can be built to resist strong winds, but not like those in the F-5 tornado that touched down in Moore. Chapman Henderson says even the building codes that do exist are not widely adopted or enforced. As its residents prepare to rebuild, Moore's mayor is pushing for an order to make safe rooms compulsory in all new construction. Similar proposals were made following each of the previous tornado strikes, but none were adopted. Question: According to Chapman Henderson, which of the following does she probably agree with? - Building codes make a difference in preventing property destruction. - If people take shelter in safe rooms, nobody will die. - It is urgent to build tornado safe rooms. - Safe rooms can be built only underground. The answer to this question is:","completion":"It is urgent to build tornado safe rooms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I read this background article the other day: Carbon dioxide is the most significant long-lived greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere. Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. Carbon dioxide also causes ocean acidification because it dissolves in water to form carbonic acid. I am facing a new situation today: Milton has just discovered two new planets while looking through his telescope. Luckily, he has invented a device that allows him to analyze far away planets from the comfort of his own home. He boots up the device and discovers that while these two planets are very similar, planet A has much more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet B. While looking through his telescope, he is also able to see that there is the same race of intelligent creatures on both planets. Milton plans to write to his local observatory about his discovery. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which planet probably has less trees? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Planet A probably has less trees. Step 1: Understanding the link between trees and carbon dioxide Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it during the process of photosynthesis. This helps in reducing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Step 2: Considering the difference in carbon dioxide levels between the two planets Planet A has much more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet B. This indicates a higher concentration of the greenhouse gas on planet A. Step 3: Relating the level of carbon dioxide to the presence of trees If there are more trees on a planet, they will absorb more carbon dioxide, thus reducing its concentration in the atmosphere. As a result, a planet with less trees will likely have a higher concentration of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere. Step 4: Identifying the planet with less trees Since planet A has a higher concentration of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet B, it can be inferred that planet A probably has less trees than planet B. This is because the presence of more trees on planet B has helped in reducing the carbon dioxide concentration in its atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November. What is probably true about Rick Saccone?

(CNN) -- It is perhaps the most iconic sports photograph ever taken. Captured at the medal ceremony for the men's 200 meters at the 1968 Mexico Olympics, U.S. sprinter Tommie Smith stands defiantly, head bowed, his black-gloved fist thrust into the thin air. Behind him fellow American John Carlos joins with his own Black Power salute, an act of defiance aimed at highlighting the segregation and racism burning back in their homeland. It was an act that scandalized the Olympics. Smith and Carlos were sent home in disgrace and banned from the Olympics for life. But they were treated as returning heroes by the black community for sacrificing their personal glory for the cause. History, too, has been kind to them. \\"I had known they had gone through with their plans when a voice in the crowd sang the","completion":"national anthem,\\" recalls Australian athlete Peter Norman, who stood alongside Smith and Carlos on the podium, having won the silver medal for his country. The three men had discussed their intentions before the ceremony, and although Norman did not raise his fist, he supported his fellow athletes' protest by wearing an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge on his tracksuit – an act of solidarity that, back in Australia, would subject him to criticism and affect his own athletic career for years to come. As the last strains of the \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" faded away, the stadium was filled with a mix of cheers and boos, reflecting the divisive nature of the protest. For Smith and Carlos, it was a moment of vindication and empowerment, knowing that they had made a powerful statement on an international stage, at a time when racial tensions in the U.S. were at a boiling point. Their actions reverberated around the world, inspiring generations of activists and athletes to use their platforms to challenge injustice and inequality. Over the decades, the image of Smith and Carlos' raised fists has become synonymous with the fight for civil rights and social justice. While detractors saw it as an unpatriotic, political act that had no place at the Olympic Games, supporters lauded their bravery and willingness to take a stand for what they believed in. Today, more than 50 years since that seminal moment, the debate over the role of protest and activism in sports continues, fueled by the actions of athletes like Colin Kaepernick, who took a knee during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality in the United States. And while the consequences faced by Smith and Carlos in 1968 were undoubtedly severe, they have since been acknowledged and celebrated for their courage and the impact their actions had on the civil rights movement. \\"I don't have any regrets about what we did,\\" Tommie Smith said years later. \\"It was a time in our lives when we had to make a stand, and we did it to the best of our ability.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Social Life: A significant part of a student's overall experience at school involves the connections they form and the memories they create with their peers. Finnish schools have earned high praise for fostering an open, inclusive, and friendly environment that is conducive to building lasting friendships. After evaluating these factors, we can conclude that the average rating of our former students when asked about their overall stay at a school in Finland is quite high, falling somewhere between 8 and 9 out of 10. The strong performance in the areas of teaching, learning environment, student support, extracurricular activities, and social life have contributed to this impressive rating. This testament to the Finnish education system highlights the reasons it is held in high regard and serves as a successful model for other countries to follow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The film begins with middle-aged C.C. receiving a note during a rehearsal for her upcoming Los Angeles concert. She leaves the rehearsal in a panic and tries frantically to travel to her friend's side. Unable to get a flight to San Francisco because of fog, she rents a car and drives overnight, reflecting on her life with Hillary. It is 1958, a rich little girl Hillary (Marcie Leeds) meets child performer C.C. (Mayim Bialik) under the boardwalk on the beach in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Hillary is lost and C.C. is hiding from her overbearing stage mother (Lainie Kazan). They become fast friends, growing up and bonding through letters of support to each other. A grown-up Hillary goes on to become a human rights lawyer, while C.C.'s singing career is not exactly taking off. They write to each other regularly and give updates on their lives. Hillary shows up at the New York City dive bar where C.C. is performing, their first meeting since Atlantic City. She moves in with C.C. and gets a job with the ACLU. C.C. is now performing singing telegrams, leading to a job offer from John (John Heard), the artistic director of the Falcon Players, after she sings his birthday telegram.

Article: Located along California's San Andreas Fault, the city of San Francisco is likely to take precautions(,) in the event of the next big earthquake. According to aNew York Timesreport, emergency planners in San Francisco are not only thinking of human evacuation(,) plans in the event of an earthquake, but also of how to care for pets during a natural disaster. Ideally, the planners will be able to train pet-disaster responders who work to evacuate dogs, cats and other household pets from the disaster site to one of the 125 temporary animal shelters that will be set up or, if the pet is injured, it will be brought to an emergency animal medical unit where there will be people on hand to tend to the pet's injury. The city's \\"no-pets-left-behind\\" policy results from the great number of pet deaths during the destruction of Hurricane Katrina. As emergency responders arrived to rescue people isolated in their homes during Katrina, hurricane victims were told that they could not take their pets along with them when evacuating; thus, many pet owners were forced to make the heart-breaking decision to save themselves while leaving their pets behind to perhaps meet their deaths. Since then, the U.S. has passed the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006, allocating federal funds for animal disaster planning projects. Yet, not all counties are as progressive as San Francisco has been in the effort to protect pets in the event of a natural disaster. Pets are after all, a large part of San Francisco's population -- overnumbering the number of school age children in the city. Over the last three years, San Francisco has received 350,000 in federal funds _ to animal disaster preparedness efforts in order to protect animals in the case of a disaster such as an earthquake.

US Marines end command in Iraq after 7 years; Biden visits Baghdad Saturday, January 23rd 2010, 4:15 PM RAMADI, Iraq - The U.S. Marines marked the end of nearly seven years in Iraq on Saturday by handing the Army their command of Anbar province, once one of the war's fiercest battlefields but now a centerpiece of U.S.-Iraqi cooperation. The changing of the guard - overseen by military brass and some of Anbar's influential Sunni sheiks - signals the start of an accelerated drawdown of American troops as the U.S. increasingly shifts its focus to the war in Afghanistan. American commanders are trumpeting security gains in places such as the western Anbar province as a sign that their partnership with Iraqi security forces is working, and that the local troops can keep the country safe. But fears are growing about a possible resurgence in sectarian tensions - fed by the Shiite-dominated government's plans to blacklist more than 500 parliamentary candidates over suspected links to Saddam Hussein's regime. In Baghdad, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden met with Iraq's leaders Saturday to try to alleviate the pressures. While he kept expectations of a breakthrough low - telling reporters after a meeting with President Jalal Talabani it was up to the Iraqis, not him, to resolve the issue - his visit alone underscored Washington's concern. The White House worries the bans could raise questions over the fairness of the March 7 parliamentary election, which is seen as an important step in the American pullout timetable and a way to break political stalemates over key issues such as dividing Iraq's oil revenue. \\"I am confident that Iraq's leaders are seized with this problem and are working to find a just solution,\\" Biden said during his visit. The Marines formally handed over U.S. responsibility for Sunni-dominated Anbar, Iraq's largest province, to the Army during a ceremony at a base in Ramadi, the scene of some of the war's most intense fighting. Overall control of the province shifted from the U.S. military to Iraq in September 2008, but the U.S. continues to provide support for Iraqi forces. Iraqi and American color guards stood together at attention as both countries' national anthems were played by a U.S. military band. As many as 25,000 Marines were in Iraq at the peak of the fighting, mostly in Anbar province. Fewer than 3,000 remain. All but a handful of those will ship out in a matter of weeks. The Marines' extended stay in Anbar went against the grain of the Corps' usual role as a fighting force designed to quickly seize territory and then turn it over to the Army to maintain control from fixed bases. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The US Marines concluded their nearly seven-year mission in Iraq by transferring command of Anbar province to the Army, marking the beginning of an expedited drawdown of American troops and increased focus on the war in Afghanistan.

Answer:","completion":"No, the answer you found does not accurately explain what HDMI out is. HDMI out is a term used to denote the output of the HDMI data stream typically from a computing or media device. HDMI, stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface, is an interface that enables the transmission of high-quality video and audio data between devices. For example, if you have a DVD player with an HDMI out port, you can connect it to a TV or monitor with an HDMI in port, so the video and audio from the DVD player can be displayed and heard on the TV or monitor. This connection ensures that no quality is lost from the source (DVD player) to the destination (TV or monitor). It's not directly related to HDTV camcorders and digital still cameras, as an HDMI out port can exist on a variety of devices including gaming consoles, desktop computers, laptops, tablets, etc. It's purely an interface to connect and transmit multimedia data from a source device to a display device."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

Dave Heaton of PopMatters said that the group \\"[uses] lyrics to convey ideas while using them for the pleasurable way the words sound.\\" The lyrics of the 2006 compilation Fab Four Suture, contains themes of war, governments that suppress freedom, and \\"the powerlessness that everyday people feel in the face of it all\\", in contrast to \\"humans [working] together, [treating] each other like people, and [pushing] for governments that would do the same.\\" Lætitia Sadier, who writes the group's lyrics, was influenced by both the Situationist philosophy Society of the Spectacle by Marxist theorist Guy Debord, and her anger towards the Iraq War. The Surrealist, as well as the Situationist cultural and political movements were also influences, as stated by Sadier and Gane in a 1999 Salon interview.Critics have seen Marxist allusions in the band's lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist. Music journalist Simon Reynolds commented that Sadier's lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than \\"affairs of the heart\\". The 1994 single \\"Ping Pong\\" has been put forward as evidence in regard to these alleged views. In the song, Sadier sings \\"about capitalism's cruel cycles of slump and recovery\\" with lyrics that constitute \\"a plainspoken explanation of one of the central tenets of Marxian economic analysis\\" (said critics Reynolds and Stewart Mason, respectively).Band members have resisted attempts to link the group and its music to Marxism. In a 1999 interview, Gane stated that \\"none of us are Marxists ... I've never even read Marx.\\" Gane said that although Sadier's lyrics touch on political topics, they do not cross the line into \\"sloganeering\\". Sadier also said that she had read very little Marx.

What is the answer to this question? law related to inter caste marriage in india?","completion":"In India, inter-caste marriages have historically faced societal backlash, mainly due to deeply rooted caste systems and traditions. However, recognizing the need to uplift socially backward communities and foster social harmony, the Indian Government introduced and implemented numerous laws to protect and support inter-caste couples. The primary laws related to inter-caste marriage in India include: 1. The Special Marriage Act, 1954: The Special Marriage Act was enacted to provide a special form of marriage for people who wish to marry outside the customs and rituals of their religion or caste. This Act allows any Indian citizen, irrespective of religion, caste, or creed, to marry under a civil ceremony. The Act also permits inter-religious marriages. Some of the essential conditions for a marriage under this Act comprise: - Both parties must be Indian citizens. - Neither party should have a living spouse at the time of the marriage. - Both parties must be at least 21 years old (for males) and 18 years old (for females). - The parties must give their consent to the marriage, free from fraud, force, or undue influence. 2. The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955: While the Hindu Marriage Act primarily deals with marriages within the Hindu community, Section 5 of the Act details specific conditions for a valid marriage. Among various conditions, the Act states that the parties should not be sapindas (closely-related) and not fall within the prohibited degree of relationships unless the regional customs or traditions recognize such relationships as valid for marriages. This provision indirectly allows inter-caste marriages within the Hindu community. 3. The Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 (formerly The Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955): The Act aims to prevent and eliminate the practice of untouchability by laying down specific provisions and punishments for offenses relating to untouchability. This law indirectly supports inter-caste marriages by penalizing the discrimination against lower castes, often the target of prejudice in inter-caste marriages. 4. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989: This Act specifically protects the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST), vulnerable to various forms of exploitation and atrocities. Under this law, any individual who promotes or forces someone to marry an SC/ST person with the objective of dominating and exploiting that individual may be punished. This Act illustrates the Indian Government's commitment to ensure the upliftment and protection of backward communities that often face challenges in the context of inter-caste marriages. 5. State-Specific Laws and Incentives: Various state governments in India provide incentives, financial or otherwise, to promote inter-caste marriages among their citizens. The financial incentives generally include a one-time lump sum payment to the couple, while some states may also provide additional benefits such as housing or education support. Despite the legal framework and measures, inter-caste marriages still face numerous challenges in India. However, these laws are an essential step to break down the rigid caste system barriers and promote social harmony in the country. As public awareness and education improve, it is hoped that societal acceptance of inter-caste marriages will continue to grow, and the role of the laws in this process will remain crucial."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Police in the Kenyan border town of Mandera said the attackers - thought to belong to al-Shabab - used explosives during the overnight attack. The main target appeared to be a guesthouse in the north-eastern town. It is the latest in a spate of deadly attacks targeting Christians in the mainly Muslim region. Pro-Shabab media outlets say the latest incident \\"killed Christian Kenyans\\" who were not from the local area. The dead included 10 people who had travelled to Mandera to stage performances in schools relating to books on the curriculum, the Daily Nation newspaper reported. Earlier this month, al-Shabab militants killed six people in an attack the group said was aimed at forcing Christians out of the area. Analysis: Abdullahi Abdi, BBC Somali service, Kenya Mandera borders Somalia, making it vulnerable to attacks from militants based there. The militants usually cross the porous border, carrying out deadly attacks on civilians and security agents before fleeing back. Muslims in the north east increasingly see al-Shabab as a threat to their own interests and are making a concerted effort to improve relations with Christians living there. Many of the Christians are skilled workers from other parts of Kenya, making a vital contribution to hospitals and schools. The north east is one of Kenya's poorest areas and, if they are driven out, public services will worsen. Al-Shabab, based in Somalia, is affiliated to al-Qaeda. The group has been at war with Kenya ever since Kenyan forces entered Somalia in October 2011 in an effort to crush them. Kenyan troops are now part of the African Union mission in Somalia.

Born on May 23, 1964, in England, Bailey was a professional dancer in the early 1980s, which led her to work with choreographer Arlene Phillips. This connection proved to be essential in Bailey landing her role in A-ha's iconic music video. \\"Take on Me\\" was a groundbreaking music video directed by Steve Barron in 1985 and is regarded as one of the most memorable videos in pop music history. It combines live-action with an animation technique known as rotoscoping, which involves tracing over live-action film footage frame by frame to create an animated look. In the video, Bunty Bailey plays the role of the main female character who falls in love with the lead singer Morten Harket. The storyline in the music video revolves around a budding romance between the Bunty Bailey's character and Morten Harket, whose comic book character comes to life. Their interaction starts with Bailey sitting at a cafe, sipping coffee while reading a comic book featuring a racing event. Morten Harket, as the main character of the comic, catches her attention and magically pulls her into his animated world. They embark on a whirlwind adventure, running from antagonists, and trying to make their way back to the real world. In the end, they are reunited in live-action, signifying the triumph of love. The \\"Take on Me\\" music video became an instant classic when it was released, winning multiple awards, including six MTV Video Music Awards in 1986. The video is often praised for its innovative combination of animation and live-action, as well as its engaging storyline. It played a significant role in boosting the popularity of the song, propelling A-ha to international fame. As for Bunty Bailey, following the release of the \\"Take on Me\\" video, she starred in the music video for A-ha's \\"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.,\\" another critically acclaimed video that continued the storyline from \\"Take on Me.\\" Bailey continued to work in entertainment as a model, actress, and dancer throughout the 1980s, working closely with the British dance troupe, Hot Gossip. In the years that followed, Bailey took a step back from the limelight but continued to work as a fitness instructor and volunteered for various charities. She occasionally appeared in reunion events and interviews related to A-ha and the music video, celebrating its lasting impact on popular culture.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible.

And his mother said he had organized a campaign to \\"get justice\\" for a homeless man who had been beaten in Sanford, as well as mentoring a 14-year-old African-American boy from a dangerous Orlando neighborhood. Zimmerman has acknowledged killing Martin during an encounter in his Sanford neighborhood, saying he shot in self-defense. This case has attracted national attention and sparked a widespread debate about racial profiling, gun control, and self-defense laws in the United States. As Zimmerman's personal life and character gain more attention, there remains a deep divide within the country over whether his actions that fateful night were justified or not. During the bond hearing, Zimmerman's family members testified to his character, painting a picture of a caring and compassionate individual, giving examples of his community involvement and concerns for the safety of those around him. The campaign to help the homeless man in Sanford that his mother mentioned showcases his dedication to fighting for justice, while his work mentoring a young African American boy highlights the hypocrisy of claims that he held racial biases. Yet, despite these claims by his relatives, there remain many who doubt Zimmerman's version of events and argue that the tragic death of Trayvon Martin was due not to self-defense but rather an act of aggression and prejudice on Zimmerman's part. Critics point to the multiple 911 calls he made during the incident, when he was specifically told not to follow Martin, but chose to do so anyway. As this case progresses through the legal system, more details and information about both Zimmerman and Martin will surely come to light, offering a more in-depth understanding of the events that transpired that night. However, as the public and media pore over these complexities, it is important to remember that the central issue of the case remains whether or not Zimmerman acted within the confines of the law when he shot and killed Trayvon Martin.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Sometimes, the scale needs to be zeroed out to be accurate. This can be done in two ways, depending on the scale you have. If you have an analog scale, press down on the scale with your hand and then lift up. The dial should level out to zero. If it doesn't, use the turn wheel, usually located at the bottom of the scale or near the dial, to move the dial of the scale to zero while it's resting. Test it again to ensure it is at the right place. If you have a digital scale, follow the same procedure as with an analog except the balancing will be done with a digital button instead of a turn wheel. One way to check the accuracy of your bathroom scale is to test an object that you already know the weight of. It needs to be large enough to register on your scale but small enough that you can carry it to the scale. Try something like a new, unopened bag of flour or sugar. These generally are five to ten pounds and should be a consistent weight. The weight of the paper or plastic bag these things come in shouldn't mess with the weight. If the flour or sugar comes in a heavy sack or metal container, you won't get an accurate reading and you should try another object. You can also try hand weights. The weight of these objects will be written on the side. Test to see if they are the weight they say they are. Another way that a scale may be inaccurate is across multiple weigh ins. Take an object you know the weight of, such as a hand weight or bag of sugar. Place it on the scale and note the weight. Take the object off and let the scale return to zero. Place the object on the scale again. Note the weight again. Repeat this at least five times to make sure that the scale in consistent over multiple weigh ins. You can weigh the object more if you get inconsistent results. Just make sure you do it an odd number of times so you can't have split results. Another way to make sure that a scale is accurate is to check the weight of two objects together. This will typically give you a larger amount of pounds, which will help test the scale at a higher level. It will also test the accuracy of the scale with an uneven weight distribution, which can be helpful for when you weigh yourself, since sometimes you might not stand with your weight 100% balanced. Place one object on the scale. Note the weight. Take it off and let the scale even back out. Place another object on the scale and note its weight. Take it off and let the scale even back out. Now, place the two objects on the scale together. Note the combined weight. Add together the weight of the objects and see if it matches the weight the scale told you of them together. If it matches, the scale is accurate. If it doesn't, try it again and see if it is off by the same number. If it is, it might be that your scale is always off by that amount. You can also try stepping on the scale alone, noting the weight, and then stepping on the scale with an object that weighs X amount of pounds, like a 5 pound dumbbell or a 1 pound bag of flour. Then, check to see if the weight goes up by the exact amount that you are holding. If it does, then the scale is accurate. For example, if you step on the scale and it says 145, then it should go up to 150 when you step on again while holding a 5 pound dumbbell. A scale can be affected by the surface it sits on. The best surface for a scale is a hard surface such as a flat bathroom or kitchen floor. It may be cushioned too much by carpet or other soft surfaces, which can make the scale off balance and give you inaccurate readings. Weight an object or yourself in the location you have your scale. Clear the scale and then move it to a different, more stable location. Weigh the same object again. The object should weigh the same. If it doesn't, one of the locations is causing inaccurate readings. Do a test with an object of known weight to see which one is accurate. Try to keep the scale in the same place every day. This way, even if the scale is slightly off, you should be getting the same error each day. This means that any weight you gain or lose, despite the number not being exactly correct, will still be how much you have gained or lost since your starting point was always the same. Summary:","completion":"The article provides detailed information on how to properly zero out and test the accuracy of both analog and digital scales, suggesting using objects with known weights, testing multiple weigh-ins for consistency, checking the weight of combined objects, ensuring the scale is on a hard and flat surface, and maintaining the scale's location for consistent readings."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Analyzing the question: The question asks where geese invading a secure installation will be spotted first. We have to determine which of the given options is most likely the place where geese would be noticed first during an invasion. 2. Evaluating the options: a. Fly: This option is an action that geese can perform, but it doesn't indicate a specific location in which they might be spotted. b. Group together: This option refers to the geese gathering in a cluster or group, which could happen at any location. Therefore, it doesn't provide a clear answer to the question. c. Guard house: The guard house is a specific location within a secure installation where security personnel are stationed to monitor the security of the premises. This is the first line of defense in any installation and a likely spot for detecting intruders. d. Ground: This option refers to a broad area, not a specific location, so it doesn't unequivocally answer the question. e. Follow ultralight airplane: This option relates to the geese following an aircraft, but it doesn't specify where such an event might take place, nor does it suggest a specific location in a secure installation where geese would be spotted first. 3. Choosing the most appropriate answer: Based on the evaluation of the options, a human would choose \\"guard house\\" because it is the most plausible location where geese would be spotted first during an invasion. The guard house is where security personnel are stationed to monitor the premises, making it the most logical and likely place for identifying intruding geese."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Abstract: Lysine acetylation is a key mechanism that regulates chromatin structure; aberrant acetylation levels have been linked to the development of several diseases. Acetyl-lysine modifications create docking sites for bromodomains, which are small interaction modules found on diverse proteins, some of which have a key role in the acetylation-dependent assembly of transcriptional regulator complexes. These complexes can then initiate transcriptional programmes that result in phenotypic changes. The recent discovery of potent and highly specific inhibitors for the BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) family of bromodomains has stimulated intensive research activity in diverse therapeutic areas, particularly in oncology, where BET proteins regulate the expression of key oncogenes and anti-apoptotic proteins. In addition, targeting BET bromodomains could hold potential for the treatment of inflammation and viral infection.

FINAL EXAM Question 1. What Plasmodium organism is Raymond G. Chambers an envoy for? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Raymond G. Chambers is not an envoy for a Plasmodium organism. Rather, he is the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Health in Agenda 2030 and for Malaria. The confusion may arise from the fact that Plasmodium species are the parasitic organisms responsible for malaria, a disease that Mr. Chambers has been dedicatedly working towards combating. Raymond G. Chambers is a philanthropist, humanitarian, and successful entrepreneur who has focused on eliminating malaria and improving global health as a central part of his work. As the Special Envoy for Health in Agenda 2030 and for Malaria, his role is to mobilize resources, generate political will, and foster partnerships among different stakeholders, including governments, private sector organizations, NGOs, and multilateral institutions, in order to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal related to health (SDG 3). Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium, which are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. There are five Plasmodium species known to infect humans, including Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale (with two subspecies: P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri), Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium knowlesi. Among these, P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most prevalent and cause the greatest number of malaria cases, with P. falciparum being responsible for the majority of severe cases and fatalities. Raymond G. Chambers' involvement in fighting malaria goes back to 2008 when he was first appointed as the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Malaria. Under his leadership, the international community made significant strides in reducing the disease burden worldwide. He played a crucial role in mobilizing resources for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and for other organizations working to eliminate malaria. In 2015, Chambers' mandate as the Special Envoy for Malaria was expanded to include all health-related issues covered in the United Nations' Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This broader role allows him to work on various health issues beyond malaria, such as maternal and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and universal health coverage, which are tackled under SDG 3: \\"Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.\\" In summary, Raymond G. Chambers is not an envoy for a specific Plasmodium organism but a dedicated leader committed to ending malaria, improving global health, and attaining the health-related Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations. His work encompasses raising awareness, mobilizing resources, and fostering collaborative efforts among different stakeholders to reduce the burden and suffering caused by this devastating disease, ultimately aiming for a world free from malaria."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: Article: Apple a day may poison children Children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding the pesticide safety limit because of remains on the fruit,according to research. Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report.

The one person who, by his interference, could have settled all doubts was debarred by circumstances from interfering in the matter. Wykham Delandre had quarrelled with his sister--or perhaps it was that she had quarrelled with him--and they were on terms not merely of armed neutrality but of bitter hatred. The quarrel had been antecedent to Margaret going to Brent's Rock. She and Wykham had almost come to blows. There had certainly been threats on one side and on the other; and in the end Wykham, overcome with passion, had ordered his sister to leave his house. She had risen straightway, and, without waiting to pack up even her own personal belongings, had walked out of the house. On the threshold she had paused for a moment to hurl a bitter threat at Wykham that he would rue in shame and despair to the last hour of his life his act of that day. Some weeks had since passed; and it was understood in the neighbourhood that Margaret had gone to London, when she suddenly appeared driving out with Geoffrey Brent, and the entire neighbourhood knew before nightfall that she had taken up her abode at the Rock. It was no subject of surprise that Brent had come back unexpectedly, for such was his usual custom. Even his own servants never knew when to expect him, for there was a private door, of which he alone had the key, by which he sometimes entered without anyone in the house being aware of his coming. This was his usual method of appearing after a long absence. After reading the above, is \\"In the end Wykham, overcome with passion, had ordered his sister to leave his house\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What were Margaret and Wykham quarreling about?\\"?","completion":"No, the statement \\"In the end Wykham, overcome with passion, had ordered his sister to leave his house\\" does not provide the correct answer to the question \\"What were Margaret and Wykham quarreling about?\\". This statement merely describes the outcome of their quarrel, not the reason or cause behind it. From the passage, it is clear that Margaret and Wykham had a bitter quarrel, and they were on terms of armed neutrality and hatred. However, the specific topic or issue that caused their quarrel is not mentioned in the text. The passage also mentions the aftermath of their disagreement, with Margaret leaving Wykham's house and eventually ending up at Brent's Rock with Geoffrey Brent. While it is evident that the quarrel had a lasting impact on their relationship, without further information, we cannot pinpoint the exact cause of their dispute."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rodney George Laver (born 9 August 1938) is an Australian former tennis player widely regarded as one of the greatest in the history of the sport. He was the No. 1 ranked professional from 1964 to 1970, spanning four years before and three years after the start of the Open Era in 1968. He also was the No. 1 ranked amateur in 1961-62. Laver's 200 singles titles are the most in tennis history. Laver had a long-running, friendly rivalry with Ken Rosewall between 1963, when he started out as a pro, and 1976, when both were semi-retired from the main tour. Including tournaments and one-night stands, they played over 130 matches, all of them as professionals, with some results from the barnstorming pro tours lost or badly recorded. Overall a match score of 79-63 in favour of Laver can be documented. Against the older Pancho Gonzales, whom he played 1964 to 1970 on the pro tour, Laver had a lead of 35-19 or 38-21, depending on the source. Laver had another, even longer rivalry with his fellow Queenslander Roy Emerson. They met first on the senior amateur tour in 1958 and dominated the amateur circuit until 1962, before Laver turned pro. When open tennis arrived in 1968, Emerson joined the pro tour, and had many new battles with Laver. Overall the score is 49-18 in favour of Laver, with 7-2 in major Grand Slam tournaments. Laver had also many battles with Lew Hoad in his first years on the pro circuit 1963-1966. Although he lost the first 8 matches in January 1963, Laver later in the year began to turn around their rivalry, and until 1966, he had built a 38-21 lead. Against Arthur Ashe, Laver had a head-to-head lead of 21-3, winning all of the first 18 matches. Ashe's first win came in 1974, when Laver was 35. Another younger rival in the Open Era was John Newcombe, whom Laver led 16-5 in their head-to-head score.

Please answer this question: which are the 10 lost tribes of israel?","completion":"The ten lost tribes of Israel refer to the ten of the twelve tribes of ancient Israel who were said to have been exiled after the Assyrian conquest around 722 BCE. They are commonly believed to have dispersed throughout the ancient world, assimilating into the populations of various regions, and their descendants eventually lost sense of their original Israelite identity. However, historians and biblical scholars have debated the veracity of this account and the fate of the ten tribes, as well as searched for tangible evidence to determine their existence. Nevertheless, according to the Hebrew Bible, the twelve tribes of Israel were descended from the twelve sons of the patriarch Jacob (who was also called Israel). Here is a list of the ten tribes considered \\"lost\\": 1. Reuben: This tribe was named after the firstborn son of Jacob and his wife Leah. The Tribe of Reuben occupied the area south of the Sea of Galilee at the northern region of the Dead Sea. 2. Simeon: The Tribe of Simeon, led by Jacob's second son with Leah, was originally located within the territory of Judah in the southern part of Israel. 3. Dan: Named after Jacob's fifth son, borne by Bilhah, Rachel's maid, the Tribe of Dan initially settled in the northwest coast of Israel, near the modern city of Tel Aviv, before eventually migrating north to avoid the Philistines. 4. Naphtali: Named after Jacob's sixth son with Bilhah, the Tribe of Naphtali settled in the northern part of Canaan, near the Sea of Galilee, and was known for its agricultural richness. 5. Gad: The Tribe of Gad descended from Jacob's seventh son, borne by Zilpah, Leah's maid. They settled on the eastern side of the Jordan River in modern-day Jordan, known for its grazing lands. 6. Asher: The Tribe of Asher stemmed from Jacob's eighth son with Zilpah. This tribe inhabited an area along the Mediterranean coast of present-day Lebanon, which today includes cities such as Tyre and Sidon. 7. Issachar: Named after Jacob's ninth son and fifth son with Leah, the Tribe of Issachar was located in the northern region of Israel's Jezreel Valley, famous for its fertile soil. 8. Zebulun: Descended from the tenth son of Jacob and Leah, the Tribe of Zebulun lived along the Mediterranean coast, south of the Phoenician city of Tyre. 9. Ephraim: The Tribe of Ephraim was established by one of the two sons of Joseph, Jacob's firstborn son with his wife Rachel. The tribe settled in a central part of Canaan, comprising the southern section of the present-day West Bank. 10. Manasseh: The other half of the tribe founded by Joseph's sons, the Tribe of Manasseh settled in the northern part of the West Bank and east of the Jordan River. The tribe itself was later divided into two half-tribes, preserving the original count of twelve tribes. Throughout history, various groups have claimed descent from the lost tribes of Israel, sometimes as a means of legitimizing their ancestry or religious status. The two remaining tribes, Judah and Benjamin, made up the southern Kingdom of Judah, which was later conquered by the Babylonians. However, unlike the ten lost tribes, the descendants of Judah and Benjamin maintained their Israelite identity, eventually became known as the Jewish people, and their history is better documented. The search for the ten lost tribes remains an area of fascination for historians, archaeologists, and religious scholars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen. - The Nordic combined events have been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since 1924. The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event. - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing. - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. - Tsugiharu Ogiwara ( Ogiwara Tsugiharu ) ( born 20 December 1969 ) is a Japanese nordic combined skier who competed from 1994 to 1998 . He won the 4 x 5 km team event at the 1995 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Thunder Bay , Ontario . Ogiwara 's best individual finish at the Winter Olympics was 6th at Nagano in 1998 . He had two individual career victories ( 1993 : 15 km individual , 1998 : 7.5 km sprint ) . He is the twin brother of Kenji Ogiwara , a fellow Japanese Nordic combined athlete . - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility.

Step 2: Probability of drawing 'g' second After removing the first 'a', there are now 4 letters remaining in the set ('ahgh'), with 2 'g's. So the probability is 2/4, which simplifies to 1/2. Step 3: Probability of drawing 'g' third After removing 'g', there are 3 letters remaining ('ahg'), with 1 'g'. So the probability is 1/3. Step 4: Probability of drawing 'a' fourth After removing the second 'g', there are 2 letters remaining ('ah'), with 1 'a'. So the probability is 1/2.

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history.

Tokyo (CNN) On a recent Friday night, a small band of street performers breaks into an impromptu hip hop show near Shibuya crossing, one of the world's busiest intersections. A crowd quickly gathers, many begin tapping their toes, shaking their hips, and waving their arms to the beat. This kind of dancing in the streets is permitted in a vibrant, youthful place like Shibuya. Yet, just a few minutes walk down the street, behind a nondescript glass entrance and down a flight of stairs, that same kind of dancing could get you thrown in jail. The reason? It's happening in a club. A few hours later, there's a line of young people waiting at the entrance of Sound Museum Vision. It's almost 2 a.m. Things are just getting started and the patrons seem eager to pay the cover charge, get inside, and be consumed by the booming music below. Aside from its physical location beneath the streets of Tokyo, the dance club has an underground feel. That's because Japan's entire dance culture has been forced to hide in the shadows amid stepped-up enforcement of a law from 1948 that forbids dancing after midnight or 1 a.m. in bars, clubs, and most other public venues. Last week, Japanese lawmakers voted to lift the notorious dancing ban, which goes back to the American occupation after World War II. Back then, \\"dance halls\\" were often a front for prostitution, which was rampant at the time in the poverty-stricken nation. Times have changed. Japan is now one of the world's largest economies with a high standard of living and vibrant nightlife. Opponents of the dancing ban call it obsolete and oppressive. The law sat in the books collecting dust, and police looked the other way for decades, allowing Japan's dance scene to thrive in the 70s, 80s and 90s. But a string of high profile drug cases involving celebrities, and a deadly club brawl in 2010 in Osaka that killed a 22-year-old student, led to a surge of arrests from club raids. JUST WATCHED Japanese rock inspires spellbinding dance Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Japanese rock inspires spellbinding dance 03:23 'War on Dance' In what became known as \\"Japan's War on Dance,\\" police used the no dancing laws to arrest DJs and haul club patrons to police stations, where they were often tested for drugs. The new law says club seating areas can't be too dark, which is an attempt to discourage crime. They need to be lit more than 10 lux, similar to a movie theater with the lights on. Darker clubs will be governed under the old law and will have stricter rules for after-midnight operation. Until changes take effect next year, after hours dancing is still against the law. \\"It's crazy. Don't make any sense. It's a dance club,\\" says musician and dancer David Escoe. \\"But I still get down. I'm usually in VIP. The key is you have to know the owner.\\" Many Japanese bars and nightclubs put up \\"no dancing\\" signs, which are often a shock to first-time visitors to Japan. The signs are an attempt to avoid problems with police, who consider dance clubs magnets for violence, drug abuse, and sex crimes. Daizo Murata, the owner of Sound Museum VISION and other Tokyo clubs, says he spent 21 days in jail for violating Japan's dancing ban and has operated in constant fear of police raids for years. \\"I worry about it every day. I've been worrying for 30 years,\\" Murata says. Steps to dance freedom Murata is part of a movement demanding change. A high profile raid and arrest at the Osaka club \\"NOON\\" in 2012 sparked the movement involving a wide range of club supporters, encompassing not only musicians and DJs, but also lawyers and politicians. The Let's Dance Petition Committee, initiated by world-known musician Ryuichi Sakamoto and others, gathered more than 150,000 signatures urging lawmakers to abolish the dancing ban in 2013. The non-partisan parliamentarians league was formed to submit the revision to the parliament in 2014. The draft was modified by the police and government before being ratified last week. There is political will to push the law through quickly. Heading toward the 2020 Olympic Games, many feel Tokyo cannot simply remain a city that goes dark after midnight. Politicians from various parties have pushed to lift the ban. In Tokyo, around 50 clubs and 300 DJ's are forming a Dance Entertainment Association (DEA) and plan to collaborate for events and discuss issues like club safety and security. \\"Now, the artists and DJs will be able work safely,\\" Murata says. \\"More great artists will be able to come here.\\" ||||| The ban forbids public dancing unless the venue has a licence, and even licenced premises have to stop all dancing by midnight. The Footloose-esque law was put into place after the Second World War, in an effort to crack down on dancehalls that were often a hotbed for prostitution. Since then, Japan has developed into a thriving and highly developed nation - yet the archaic dancing ban remained on the books for decades. Despite the law, dancing, even after midnight, was tolerated in the second half of the 20th Century, with police turning a blind eye to the hard-to-enforce law that was routinely being broken. However, into the 21st Century, a string of celebrity drug scandals and nightclub brawls led to a crackdown, with club raids once again becoming common. Fortunately, Japan's night owls will soon be able to party without fear. A campaign led by world-famous Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto, calling for the abolition of the ban, gained 150,000 signatures. The new law was finally ratified last week, and will come into force next year. Until then, late-night dancing will remain illegal. The lifting of the ban was partly due to the upcoming 2020 Olympics, with the government taking the necessary steps to make sure visitors have as much fun (and spend as much money) as they can during their stay. Japan may finally be catching up with the rest of the world, but that other highly-developed democracy, Sweden, is still sticking to its own dancing ban. 'Spontaneous dancing' is illegal in Sweden, and owners of bars, clubs and pubs without a special dancing licence face fines if their patrons decide to take to the floor. In March this year, politicians voted in the Riksdag to lift the bizarre ban - but it failed to pass, and Swedes still need government permission if they fancy a dance. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Japan has finally lifted its notorious 1948 dancing ban that forbids dancing after midnight or 1 a.m. in bars, clubs, and most other public venues.

There are five new \\"reactions\\" buttons joining the like symbol, TechCrunch reports: love, haha, wow, sad, and angry, all accessible when you hover over the like button. Users will now see a count for the most popular reactions chosen for each post on their news feeds (click on any one of the icons to get the total count for all reactions). In two blog posts announcing Wednesday's rollout, a Facebook product manager explains how to use the different reactions and how the tool will help the site \\"learn how the different Reactions should be weighted differently by News Feed to do a better job of showing everyone the stories they most want to see.\\" She notes they researched for a year or so to see which reactions people would most use, checking out surveys, comments, and virtual stickers to find the most common emotions. Those emotions had to resonate with people around the globe: USA Today notes the five reactions were universally understood, and a sixth—a \\"yay\\"—was dumped because it wasn't. TechCrunch—which points out Facebook basically copied the emotions concept from the Path sharing site—notes that \\"standardizing emotions\\" could prove helpful when communicating across languages. For instance, a user may know enough of a foreign language to read a post but not be able to write a fluent comment in response. These new reactions would therefore allow users to give more nuanced feedback on posts where a generic like doesn't feel right—the sad reaction seems more appropriate in response to a death, for instance. (How will Facebook public shaming change with the new reactions?) Expand this summary.","completion":"Recently, Facebook introduced an extension to its famous 'like' button by adding five new \\"reactions\\" to the platform: love, haha, wow, sad, and angry. The addition of these new reactions aims to give users more options to express their emotions as a response to a certain post, rather than just a simple thumbs-up. Users will now see a count for the most popular reactions for each post on their newsfeeds, allowing them to view the total count for all reactions. To access these new reactions, users only need to hover over the existing like button to display the expanded set of response options. In two blog posts announcing the launch of this new feature, a Facebook product manager explains how to use the different reactions and how the tool will help the social network to improve their algorithms that personalize the content shown to users. By monitoring how users interact with the new reactions, Facebook's News Feed will be able to better weigh the different types of content and provide users with the stories that are most relevant to their interests. It is noteworthy that Facebook conducted thorough research for about a year in order to identify which reactions users would most likely utilize. The process involved checking out polls, analyzing comments to find widely used expressions, and examining how people around the world used virtual stickers to express emotions. The reactions that were ultimately chosen had to be universally understood by people from different cultures and backgrounds. It was essential to maintain clarity and simplicity in their design. One example of this is the removal of a sixth reaction, \\"yay,\\" which was deemed to be too similar to the existing \\"love\\" reaction and might have caused confusion among users. In a broader context, standardizing emotions through these new Facebook reactions could prove useful when communicating across different languages. Users might be able to understand a post written in a foreign language, but might find it difficult to express their feelings in a written response. However, by using the new reactions, users can now offer more nuanced feedback to the content they come across on the platform. These updated response options address a long-coveted desire among Facebook users for a \\"dislike\\" button, which the social media giant never implemented. The new reactions offer users a more appropriate way of reacting to posts that require a more sensitive approach, such as expressing sadness upon hearing the news of a loved one's passing. It remains to be seen how these new reaction buttons will impact user interactions, but overall, they represent Facebook's commitment to adapting its platform to better serve the needs and preferences of its users."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have this big math problem: 1092 * g - 1040 * g - 468 = 0 First, let's find out what happens when we do (1092 * g) and subtract (1040 * g). To make it easy, imagine you have 1092 apples and you take away 1040 apples. You'll have 52 apples left, right? So, we have: 52 * g - 468 = 0 Now, we need to find out how many times 52 has to be multiplied to get 468. It's like asking, if I want 468 apples and I can only get them in groups of 52 apples, how many groups do I need? To find out, we'll add 468 to both sides of the equation: 52 * g = 468 Now, to find g, we'll divide both sides by 52: g = 468 ÷ 52 When we divide 468 by 52, we get 9.

Tareek Arnold, with his wrists shackled behind his back, was about to be taken downtown for arraignment Tuesday night when he shoved the cop escorting him out of the 32nd Precinct stationhouse in Harlem and made a run for it, police said. A surveillance video from a nearby business showed the tattooed terror running down the block after his 7:30 p.m. escape, with a uniformed officer and a detective a few seconds behind him. Arnold ran into a building on St. Nicholas Ave. near W. 134th St. — just two blocks from the stationhouse — but soon disappeared, police said. A second surveillance video showed he left the address soon afterward. His whereabouts remained a mystery Wednesday. Longtime family friends said they didn’t know where Arnold went. “I haven’t heard from him,” said one, who did not want to give her name. “I’m just finding out what’s going on through the news. “I’m worried and I’m hoping that nothing bad happens to him,” the woman said. “I don’t want nothing to happen to him, but I know how police can be.\\" Arnold, who is considered dangerous, was charged with shooting a rival on Seventh Ave. near 140th St. on June 8.

Tareek Arnold, 23, who had been arrested for attempted murder, escaped from police custody in Harlem Tuesday night, police said. Arnold, who has an infant son, according to family friends, had been arrested six times before he was taken into custody Tuesday.

Each question asks about a completely different topic. 1. The first question is about interest-only loans in real estate, and if they are okay for an investment property. Interest-only loans are when you only pay the interest portion of a loan each month, without paying off any of the principal (the main amount you borrowed). This can be a useful option for some investors, as it helps keep the monthly payments low.

This is exciting.Yet,on the other hand,competition breezes a pragmatic attitude.People choose to learn things that are useful,and do things that are profitable.Today's college education is also affected by this general sense of utilitarianism . Many colleges students choose Business,Law not Computer Programming as their majors convinced that these professions are where the big money is.It is not unusual to see the college students taking a part--time job as a warm--up for the real battle.I often see my friends taking GRE tests,working on English or computer certificates and taking the driving tests to get a license.Well,I have nothing against being practical.As the competition in the job market gets more and more severe,students do have reasons to be practical. However,we should never forget that college education is much more than skill training.Just imagine,if your utilitarianism becomes the main trend on campus,leaving no space for the cultivation of students' minds,or development of their soul.We will see university is training out well--trained spiritless working machines.If utilitarianism controls society,we will see people lost in the money--making adventures;we will see humanity losing their grace and dignity,and that,would be disastrous.I'd like to think society as encouraging and people regard profit or fame only as a horse that pulls the courage.Yet without the driver picking direction,the courage would go straight and may even end out in a dangerous situation.

As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice.

The original statement says, \\"A woman with white hair in a yellow shirt lies in the grass\\". - This tells us that there is a woman and she is lying down in the grass. 2. The presence of grass indicates that this is an outdoor setting, as grass typically grows outside. 3. The statement also mentions \\"overlooking the ocean in which a lone sailboat is visible.\\" - Oceans are naturally outdoor spaces, further supporting that the woman is outside.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. I am facing a new situation today: Bob's parents were in their early 60's. He sent them to the doctor's for a routine check up. Dan, his dad, had very high cholesterol, while Mary, his mom , had normal levels in her blood.

Background: Skyhooks were an Australian rock band formed in Melbourne in March 1973 by mainstays Greg Macainsh on bass guitar and backing vocals, and Imants \\"Freddie\\" Strauks on drums. They were soon joined by Bob \\"Bongo\\" Starkie on guitar and backing vocals, and Red Symons on guitar, vocals and keyboards; Graeme \\"Shirley\\" Strachan became lead vocalist in March 1974. Described as a glam rock band, because of flamboyant costumes and make-up, Skyhooks addressed teenage issues including buying drugs \\"Carlton (Lygon Street Limbo)\\", suburban sex \\"Balwyn Calling\\", the gay scene \\"Toorak Cowboy\\" and loss of girlfriends \\"Somewhere in Sydney\\" by namechecking Australian locales. Context: Greg Macainsh and Imants \\"Freddie\\" Strauks both attended Norwood High School in the Melbourne suburb of Ringwood and formed Spare Parts in 1966 with Macainsh on bass guitar and Strauks on lead vocals. Spare Parts was followed by Sound Pump in 1968, Macainsh formed Reuben Tice in Eltham, with Tony Williams on vocals. By 1970 Macainsh was back with Strauks, now on drums, first in Claptrap and by 1971 in Frame which had Graeme \\"Shirley\\" Strachan as lead vocalist. Frame also included Pat O'Brien on guitar and Cynthio Ooms on guitar. Strachan had befriended Strauks earlier--he sang with Strauks on the way to parties--and was asked to join Claptrap which was renamed as Frame. Strachan stayed in Frame for about 18 months but left for a career in carpentry and a hobby of surfing in Phillip Island. Skyhooks formed in March 1973 in Melbourne with Steve Hill on vocals (ex-Lillee), Peter Ingliss on guitar (The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band), Macainsh on bass guitar and backing vocals, Peter Starkie on guitar and backing vocals (Lipp & the Double Dekker Brothers) and Strauks on drums and backing vocals. The name, Skyhooks, came from a fictional organisation in the 1956 film Earth vs. the Flying Saucers. Their first gig was on 16 April 1973 at St Jude's Church hall in Carlton. At a later gig, former Daddy Cool frontman, Ross Wilson was playing in his group Mighty Kong with Skyhooks as a support act. Wilson was impressed with the fledgling band and signed Macainsh to a publishing deal. In August, Bob \\"Bongo\\" Starkie (Mary Jane Union) on guitar replaced his older brother Peter (later in Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons) and Ingliss was replaced by Red Symons (Scumbag) on guitar, vocals and keyboards. The two new members added a touch of theatre and humour to the band's visual presence. By late 1973, Wilson had convinced Michael Gudinski to sign the band to his booking agency, Australian Entertainment Exchange, and eventually to Gudinski's label, Mushroom Records. Skyhooks gained a cult following around Melbourne including university intelligentsia and pub rockers, but a poorly received show at the January 1974 Sunbury Pop Festival saw the group booed off stage. Two tracks from their live set, \\"Hey What's the Matter?\\" and \\"Love on the Radio\\" appeared on Mushroom's Highlights of Sunbury '74. After seeing his performance on TV, Hill phoned Macainsh and resigned. To replace Hill, in March, Macainsh recruited occasional singer, surfer and carpenter Strachan from his Frame era. Strachan had been dubbed \\"Shirley\\" by fellow surfers due to his curly blond hair a la Shirley Temple. Question: Did they have any good shows in that period? Answer:","completion":"During the early period of Skyhooks, the band experienced a mix of success and struggles. Upon their formation in 1973, the band had managed to gain a cult following in the Melbourne area, and this included university intelligentsia and pub rockers, suggesting that they had developed a local fan base and played good shows within the local scene. Their theatrical stage presence, along with the use of glam rock costumes and make-up, added an aura of charm and uniqueness to their performances. This was further complemented by their approach to address social issues in their songs, appealing to a section of the youth audience. However, not all their shows were well-received. Their performance at the Sunbury Pop Festival in January 1974 was notably disappointing, as the group was booed off stage. This incident demonstrated a turning point for the band, leading to a series of changes in their lineup and, eventually, their music and presence. The recruitment of Graeme \\"Shirley\\" Strachan in March 1974 injected a fresh energy into Skyhooks. His history with the group's founders, as well as his occasional singing stints, made him a natural fit for the band. While specific records of shows during this period may not be readily accessible, the band's combination of unique aesthetics, music addressing teenage concerns, and their evolving lineup all point to potential for memorable and enjoyable performances during this early stage of their existence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:The Nursing Times conducted an online poll of nearly 600 of its readers on issues such as staffing, patient safety and NHS culture. Three-quarters had witnessed what they considered \\"poor\\" care over the past 12 months, the survey found. The government said it had increased staffing and hundreds of new nurses were still being taken on by the NHS. The survey comes ahead of a public inquiry report into care failings at Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust. More than 57% of those asked in the survey described their ward or unit as sometimes or always \\"dangerously understaffed\\". Of those who had witnessed poor care, nearly 30% said they had seen it happen regularly. Some 85% of those who worked on general wards said the patient to nurse ratio was eight or more to one, and 44% said the ratio was 10 or more to one. Howard Catton, head of policy at the Royal College of Nursing, told the BBC the ratio level in many hospitals was unacceptable. \\"We should have clear national guidance on what safe staffing levels are. One registered nurse to eight patients is getting into very risky territory, it should be around one in five. \\"We have ratios for our kids in nurseries...why can't we have them for our patients in hospitals? \\"Cutting nurses will have a negative impact on the quality of care that's provided and in the worse case scenario yes it can lead to untimely deaths.\\" Unison head of nursing Gail Adams told the Nursing Times the findings of the survey echoed their own research on the issue, carried out in 2012. \\"At the time less than 10% of nurses said they could deliver safe, dignified, compassionate care all of the time.\\" Low morale Joyce Robins, co-director of Patient Concern, told BBC Radio 5 Live nurses felt they could not keep their patients safe because there were not enough staff. \\"The amount of work they are expected to do goes up all the time but staffing levels don't rise,\\" she said. \\"You hear all these stories that nurses don't care anymore but really it's that nurses can't care because they don't have time because there aren't enough of them.\\" Also speaking to Radio Five Live Jenni Middleton, editor of the Nursing Times, said morale was very low amongst nurses. \\"If you've gone into that job to care and to look after people and to not be able to do that is heartbreaking and very very stressful because you feel you're incapable of doing what you've been trained to do because you don't have the resources to back you up.\\" Prime Minister David Cameron has acknowledged the government still has a long way to go to raise standards across the NHS. Mr Cameron encouraged the idea of nurses checking on patients every hour, as part of a package of nursing measures in January. Some 31% of nurses on general wards in the survey said they were not aware of this being introduced where they worked. The issue of care standards will come to the fore again when the Francis report into the Mid Staffs Trust is published on Wednesday. Inquiry chairman Robert Francis QC will present the final report to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, before the minister makes a Commons statement. The Â£13m inquiry was set up after a Healthcare Commission report in 2009 found \\"appalling standards\\" of care. In response to the survey, the government said there were more clinical staff working in the NHS now than when it came to power in May 2010.

Following Bandung, Nasser officially adopted the \\"positive neutralism\\" of Yugoslavian president Josip Broz Tito and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as a principal theme of Egyptian foreign policy regarding the Cold War. Nasser was welcomed by large crowds of people lining the streets of Cairo on his return to Egypt on 2 May and was widely heralded in the press for his achievements and leadership in the conference. Consequently, Nasser's prestige was greatly boosted as was his self-confidence and image. How did the Egyptian press react to Nasser's accomplishments?","completion":"The Egyptian press reacted overwhelmingly positively to Nasser's accomplishments, particularly after the Bandung Conference in 1955. As Nasser officially adopted \\"positive neutralism\\" in response to the Cold War, he positioned Egypt as a nation that would no longer align with the superpowers of the United States or the Soviet Union. This stance earned Nasser significant praise and recognition, both in Egypt and internationally. Newspapers and journalists in Egypt widely covered Nasser's return from the conference and his adoption of positive neutralism. They portrayed him as a heroic figure, standing up for the rights and interests of his people and bolstering Egypt's sovereignty. Multiple Egyptian newspapers showered Nasser with praise, lauding his achievements, leadership, and vision for the nation's future. Egyptian press emphasized Nasser's role as a key participant in the conference and praised his speeches and diplomatic efforts to unite various nations under the non-aligned banner. Through this coverage, the press contributed to the construction of Nasser's image as a strong, pragmatic leader who played a crucial role in shaping the global political landscape. Upon his return to Cairo, Nasser was welcomed by thousands of Egyptians who lined the streets to cheer and celebrate him. This massive public display of support was amplified by the media, further highlighting the people's enthusiasm for Nasser's achievements and boosting his self-confidence. Moreover, the Egyptian press helped to consolidate the perception of Nasser as a pan-Arab leader, who championed the cause of anti-imperialism and national liberation throughout the Arab world. The media coverage of Nasser's diplomatic efforts and his unwavering vision of a united Arab front was instrumental in building his reputation as a driving force in the Arab nationalist movement. Egyptian newspapers also focused on Nasser's relationship with other prominent leaders at the conference, such as Yugoslavian president Josip Broz Tito and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. His close association with these influential leaders in the non-aligned movement further validated his credentials as a key figure on the global stage. In conclusion, the Egyptian press played a crucial role in elevating Nasser's prestige and solidifying his image as a charismatic, visionary leader at the forefront of the non-aligned movement and Arab nationalism. By amplifying his accomplishments, articulating his policies, and celebrating his return from the groundbreaking Bandung Conference, the Egyptian media helped to cement Nasser's legacy as one of the most influential leaders in modern Egyptian history."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The non-profits have worked on issues including obesity , health care , food safety , labor law , alcohol , and government regulation . The firm is known for campaigns that include aggressive advertising , opposition research , and online communications . - The Employment Policies Institute is a fiscally conservative non-profit American think tank that conducts research on employment issues such as minimum wage and health care. It was established in 1991 and has been described as \\"a nonprofit research group that studies issues of entry-level employment.\\" - Public relations (PR) is the practice of managing the spread of information between an individual or an organization (such as a business, government agency, or a nonprofit organization) and the public. Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment. This differentiates it from advertising as a form of marketing communications. Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free, rather than marketing or advertising. An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article. The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them to maintain a certain view about the organization, its leadership, products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, businesses and companies, government, government agencies and public officials as PIOs and nongovernmental organizations, and nonprofit organizations. Jobs central to public relations include account coordinator, account executive, account supervisor, and media relations manager. - Public interest, according to the \\"Random House Dictionary\\", is \\"1. the welfare or well-being of the general public; commonwealth. 2. appeal or relevance to the general populace: a news story of public interest.\\" - A think tank, policy institute, or research institute is an organization that performs research and advocacy concerning topics such as social policy, political strategy, economics, military, technology, and culture. Most policy institutes are non-profit organizations, which some countries such as the United States and Canada provide with tax exempt status. Other think tanks are funded by governments, advocacy groups, or businesses, or derive revenue from consulting or research work related to their projects. - NeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s.

We discovered a small creek nearby that we imagined once fueled the mill's waterwheel, producing energy for the entire operation. The sound of the rushing water added a sense of serenity to the area, further cementing its status as a perfect picnic spot. Through our exploration and conversation, our initial disappointment over not having a bag lunch was replaced with excitement for the adventures we were able to share.

(August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) is a comedian of a satirical talk show who is able to tap into people's frustrations with the sharply divided, special interest-driven political climate. Specifically, he makes fun of the American two-party system. During his warm-up act, an audience member suggests that he run for president. At first, Dobbs laughs off the idea, but following a popular groundswell of support, later announces on the air that he will stand as a candidate. Through his efforts, he gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in one of the national debates with the Democratic incumbent, President Kellogg, and Republican U.S. Senator Mills. A parallel plot follows Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), who works at a voting machine company in California called Delacroy. According to a television commercial in the movie, the entire United States will be using Delacroy voting machines for the Presidential election. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices that the voting system does not work correctly and alerts the head of the company, James Hemmings (Rick Roberts) via e-mail. Initially, Dobbs approaches the campaign seriously â perhaps too seriously, to the chagrin of his staff, especially his manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken). That turns around the night of the presidential debates, when, fed up with the other candidates' posturing, Dobbs shifts back into comedian mode, managing to keep the audience laughing and make serious points simultaneously. From then on, he resumes his showman persona, thoroughly shaking up the political landscape. Dobbs surges in polls after the debates, but remains a distant third to Kellogg and Mills. Election Day arrives, and polls show Dobbs at 17% with Kellogg and Mills tied in the 40s. Early returns show Kellogg beating Mills everywhere. Eleanor says...

Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame.

Help as much as you can. What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person that takes refuge with Denise? from the following article ? Terry asks his boss's wife Sylvia to his apartment after an office party and the two go to bed. Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window. At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement. As he leaves, he sees Carl's distinctive truck parked outside and rushes in again. He is too late, however, for in the dark she has been stabbed fatally and dies in Terry's arms. He takes refuge with Denise, who first seduces him and then offers him a chance to redeem himself. She wants revenge, and with him devises a plot to provoke Carl into another attack. Disguising herself, she goes to a bar where Carl is drinking and signals her availability. Terry follows her as she leaves to go home and, when Carl attacks, the two are able to repel him. He escapes, only to be caught by the police who Terry forewarned.","completion":"The first name of the person that takes refuge with Denise is Terry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - england - iowa - street corner - city - town The answer is \\"town\\" because The answer is:","completion":"\\"town\\" because the question describes a place where everybody knows everybody, which is a characteristic commonly associated with small towns. In small towns, people tend to know each other well, and a corner shop can become a local gathering place and center of activity. Step 1: Identify the type of place being described In the question, the corner shop is described as the epicenter of activity where everyone knows each other. This gives us a clue that the place is likely small and tight-knit. Step 2: Analyze the given options We are given five options: England, Iowa, street corner, city, and town. We can eliminate England and Iowa, as they are locations rather than characteristics of local communities. A street corner is a specific location and not an overall descriptor for a community. Step 3: Compare the characteristics of the remaining options with the description in the question The remaining options are city and town. Typically, cities are larger and more populated, making it less likely for everyone to know one another. Small towns generally feature a closer community with neighbors knowing each other on a more personal level. Step 4: Choose the option that best fits the given description Based on the information provided in the question and the comparison to the remaining options, we can deduce that the answer is \\"town,\\" as it is the most fitting option for a place where everyone knows each other and a corner shop can be the center of activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although this sentence provides information about the expansion of the original park and comments on its comparison to Disneyland, it does not clearly indicate whether expanding the park leads to Disneyland being incomparable to the original park solely due to the expansion. Sentence 2 suggests that Disneyland cannot compare to the original park as it expanded to attract customers of all ages. This sentence seems to focus mainly on comparing Disneyland to the expanded areas of the original park. However, Sentence 1 states that the original park is not as fantastic as Disneyland, which appears to be a contradiction. Given the information provided in the two sentences, the first sentence does not directly establish if the second sentence is true because of the unclear nature of the comparison, the slight contradiction in describing the parks, and no information provided on if the expansion is the sole reason Disneyland cannot compare.

Write the answer: What name was given to the pre-decimal coin worth one- eighth of a pound?","completion":"The pre-decimal coin that was worth one-eighth of a pound, or equivalent to two shillings and sixpence, was commonly known as the \\"florin.\\" However, there was another name for this coin, and that was the \\"half-crown.\\" Both names represent the same value and were used interchangeably before the implementation of the decimal currency system in 1971. The florin was first introduced in 1849 as part of the United Kingdom's gradual move towards decimalization of its currency. It was designed to be equivalent to one-tenth of a pound sterling at that time. This silver coin featured the portrait of Queen Victoria on the obverse and various designs on the reverse, illustrating the royal coat of arms, emblematic floral designs of England, Scotland, and Ireland, among others. Over time, the florin's design changed with the monarchs, and portraits of King Edward VII, King George V, King George VI, and Queen Elizabeth II appeared on these coins. On the other hand, the half-crown was an older coin, first minted in 1526 during the reign of King Henry VIII. It was made of silver and featured the portrait of the current monarch on one side. Throughout its existence, the half-crown saw changes in design for each monarch and alterations in the composition of metals used to produce the coin. The weight, size, and silver content of the half-crown varied over time, but its value as one-eighth of a pound sterling remained constant. Before decimalization, the British pound was subdivided into 20 shillings, with each shilling equivalent to 12 pence, making a total of 240 pence in a pound. The florin, worth two shillings and sixpence, was equal to 30 pence; since 30 divided by 240 equals one-eighth, the florin was effectively one-eighth of a pound. Following the Decimal Currency Act of 1969 and culminating in Decimal Day on February 15, 1971, the United Kingdom transitioned from the pounds, shillings, and pence system to the decimal currency system we use today. This change established a new denomination wherein one pound was equal to 100 pence. As part of this shift, the florin and half-crown ceased to be minted, and decimal coins such as the 10 pence and 50 pence coins took their place in British currency circulation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jackie wants to go out on the boat to spend some time on the ocean, but Mark wants to lay out on the beach and relax. Since they can't agree, Jackie goes out on the boat alone while Mark stays behind on the beach. and a hint : In coastal regions, sea breezes and land breezes can be important factors in a location's prevailing winds. The sea is warmed by the sun more slowly because of water's greater specific heat compared to land. As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it by conduction. The warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises. This causes a pressure gradient of about 2 millibars from the ocean to the land. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher sea level pressure, flows inland into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. If an offshore wind of 8 knots (15 km/h) exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop. Please answer this question : Is the air around Mark more or less dense than the air around Jackie?","completion":"In the given situation, the air around Mark is less dense than the air around Jackie. This is because Mark is on the beach, where the land heats up more quickly due to its lower specific heat compared to water. Consequently, the air above the land gets heated by conduction and becomes less dense as it rises. On the other hand, Jackie is out on the boat in the ocean, where the water heats up more slowly and the air above the sea remains cooler and denser. The sea breeze, which is a cooler breeze near the coast, flows from the sea to the land due to a pressure gradient created by the higher pressure above the sea (cooler, denser air) and the lower pressure above the land (warmer, less dense air). In calm prevailing winds, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land and the sea. However, if an offshore wind exists with a speed of 8 knots (15 km/h) or more, the sea breeze is less likely to develop.

Background: Arthur Asher Miller (October 17, 1915 - February 10, 2005) was an American playwright, essayist, and figure in twentieth-century American theater. Among his most popular plays are All My Sons (1947), Death of a Salesman (1949), The Crucible (1953) and A View from the Bridge (1955, revised 1956). He also wrote several screenplays and was most noted for his work on The Misfits (1961). The drama Death of a Salesman has been numbered on the short list of finest American plays in the 20th century alongside Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night and Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire. Context: In 1940, Miller married Mary Grace Slattery. The couple had two children, Jane and Robert (born May 31, 1947). Miller was exempted from military service during World War II because of a high school football injury to his left kneecap. That same year his first play was produced; The Man Who Had All the Luck won the Theatre Guild's National Award. The play closed after four performances with disastrous reviews. In 1947, Miller's play All My Sons, the writing of which had commenced in 1941, was a success on Broadway (earning him his first Tony Award, for Best Author) and his reputation as a playwright was established. Years later, in a 1994 interview with Ron Rifkin, Miller said that most contemporary critics regarded All My Sons as \\"a very depressing play in a time of great optimism\\" and that positive reviews from Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times had saved it from failure. In 1948, Miller built a small studio in Roxbury, Connecticut. There, in less than a day, he wrote Act I of Death of a Salesman. Within six weeks, he completed the rest of the play, one of the classics of world theater. Death of a Salesman premiered on Broadway on February 10, 1949, at the Morosco Theatre, directed by Elia Kazan, and starring Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman, Mildred Dunnock as Linda, Arthur Kennedy as Biff, and Cameron Mitchell as Happy. The play was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, winning a Tony Award for Best Author, the New York Drama Circle Critics' Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It was the first play to win all three of these major awards. The play was performed 742 times. In 1949, Miller exchanged letters with Eugene O'Neill regarding Miller's production of All My Sons. O'Neill had sent Miller a congratulatory telegram; in response, he wrote a letter that consisted of a few paragraphs detailing his gratitude for the telegram, apologizing for not responding earlier, and inviting Eugene to the opening of Death of a Salesman. O'Neill replied, accepting the apology, but declining the invitation, explaining that his Parkinson's disease made it difficult to travel. He ended the letter with an invitation to Boston, a trip that never occurred. Question: Did he win any awards for his work?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Arthur Miller won several awards for his work. His play \\"All My Sons\\" earned him his first Tony Award for Best Author in 1947, which also played a crucial role in establishing his reputation as a playwright. Miller's iconic play \\"Death of a Salesman\\" premiered on Broadway in 1949 and was a commercial success while receiving critical acclaim. \\"Death of a Salesman\\" won multiple awards, including the Tony Award for Best Author, the New York Drama Circle Critics' Award, and the prestigious Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

Were his living room walls peach or greige? It's pretty hard to tell just from the photos. When the convicted financier's New York duplex at 133 East 64th Street was put on sale last week to help pay investors that he swindled, everyone wanted a peek. The first look, offered by the Associated Press, showed muted grey-beige walls and rumpled pillows in the living room, a bare mattress in the bedroom, a tag hanging off of a leather bull's ear in the library, a trash can in the foreground of the kitchen, and cardboard packing boxes -- filled with wine --cluttering up the laundry room. Then Sotheby's International Realty announced it would be brokering the sale with a 9.9 million price tag. The high-end brokerage put out its own photos, featuring light-filled windows and warm peach-toned walls in the living room, glowing ceilings in the library and fresh flowers on all the coffee tables. See the photos from the AP and Sotheby's The photos show how different lenses, lighting, angles and post-production techniques can alter how a home looks and feels -- a subject I've talked about before. It also shows how two professional photographers armed with digital cameras, but with dissimilar mandates and time constraints, can produce photos that reveal very different messages about the home's owners. Mary Altaffer, the Associated Press photographer, says her assignment was to show how the Madoffs lived, as realistically as possible. Accompanied by a U.S. marshal, she had less than an hour to shoot the place, using a handheld Nikon camera with a wide lens and fill-in flash. The wide lens was to get as much detail in every photo as possible; the flash was to supplement the relatively gloomy morning light in rooms half-darkened by shades. Although Ms. Altaffer's hand is steadier and her equipment and technique more sophisticated than those of an amateur photographer, the result looks a lot like hastily-done snapshots of an apartment that was exited hastily. The AP's rules prohibit touch-ups: \\"I'm not allowed to color-correct or Photoshop,\\" says Ms. Altaffer. We asked professional photographers to comment on the shots taken for Sotheby's and the Associated Press: The flash of the AP photographer creates a brighter foreground, darker colors and grayer colors that makes the room more gloomy, which \\"goes along with the tone of their story.\\" \\"The color is just plain off on the Sotheby's images… the [AP] images have production flaws, but the whites seem white; in all the Sotheby's comparisons, the whites have [a] color cast.\\" On Sotheby's: \\"This shoot has better compositions. But the sky in the patio shot, which was color-enhanced post-production, \\"looks a little fake.\\" --Scott Van Dyke, Los Angeles \\"I would bet that the Sotheby's images are closer to what the eye would perceive, partly judging by cleaner-looking neutral colors.\\" --Alan Stoker, Iowa City, Iowa \\"It appears all the AP shots were done with ambient light which is not even and has many shadowy dark areas. The Sotheby's shots are all fairly evenly lit and nice and bright.\\" --Marian Kraus, Saint Charles, Ill. \\"The [AP photos'] on-camera flash tends to look cool or bluish.\\" By contrast, Travis Dubreuil had several hours to photograph the penthouse duplex with his Canon camera and semi-wide angle lens. His broker clients expected him to color-correct the photos and touch them up to minimize flaws. In fact, he says, the brokers attending the shoot fluffed up the living room pillows and threw a cream-colored scarf over the bedroom's bare mattress to simulate a bedspread; he later removed the mattress's telltale dimples using Photoshop. Photoshop was also useful to help layer multiple exposures of the library into one photo, which helped balance out the contrast between the bright windows and dark paneled walls (he used a tripod and a cable shutter release to ensure he'd get the exact same angle each time). And the fresh flowers in every room? The clients themselves added them later from an image library. \\"It's done all the time,\\" he says. In post-production, Mr. Dubreuil also adjusted the color of the sky on the patio, making it a more saturated blue, as well as the colors in the interior shots. The living room, he says, was lit by warm afternoon sun and appeared \\"creamish pink\\" to him, so he corrected the colors to match that mood. But what color are the living walls actually? Well, not quite peach nor greige. According to Sotheby's broker Anne Corey, they're a complex color with multiple undertones that change with the light. \\"I'd call them cocoa apricot,\\" she says.

While the term \\"junk DNA\\" may be a misnomer due to the fact that approximately 80% of the bases in the human genome may be expressed, researchers still use it in reference to the large amount of non-protein-coding DNA found in humans and other complex eukaryotic organisms. In contrast, the chromosomes of prokaryotes are gene-dense and have much less \\"junk DNA\\" compared to eukaryotes.

Process: - The butterfly starts as an egg - The egg hatches to form a larva, also called a caterpillar - The carterpillar molts (loses its skin) many times as it grows - The caterpillar then forms itself into a pupa, or chrysalis - The caterpillar in the chrysalis begins change, a process called mmetaphorphosis - The caterpillar completes its metamorphosis and has turned into a butterfly - The adult butterfly emerges out of the chrysalis and flys away! - Question: suppose less pollution in the environment happens, how will it affect LESS butterflies. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"less effect. A reduction in pollution is likely to have a positive impact on the butterfly population and their life cycle. Pollution is a significant factor that can negatively influence ecosystems, including the ones that butterflies inhabit. By reducing pollution levels, the life cycle of the butterfly, which is mentioned in the process, can be indirectly improved. Less pollution in the environment could potentially lead to the following benefits, which would result in less negative effect on butterflies: 1. Cleaner air and water sources: Pollution can affect the quality of air, water, and soil. With less pollution, butterflies would have access to cleaner resources that are essential for their survival. 2. Healthier food sources: Less pollution would lead to healthier plants, providing butterflies with better-nourished plant leaves during their larval stage, and more abundant flowers with nectar for adult butterflies. 3. Safer habitats: Reduced pollution levels create safer habitats for butterflies, as hazardous substances such as heavy metals and pesticides can negatively impact the life cycle of butterflies, from their eggs to their adult stage. 4. Decreased effects of climate change: In general, less pollution can contribute to mitigating the consequences of climate change. As climate change can significantly impact the distribution and abundance of butterfly species, reduced pollution would have less effect on the changes in their habitat. On the other hand, if the question specifically refers to the \\"second effect mentioned\\" as the stage where the caterpillar molts (loses its skin) many times as it grows, then there might still be a less effect on this stage of the process. The reduced pollution would foster overall improvement in the caterpillar's health, reducing the potential of harmful disruptions during the molting process. Better conditions place less stress on caterpillars, allowing them to molt and grow normally. In conclusion, less pollution would mean less effect on the butterfly population, with an overall positive influence on their life cycle stages, contributing to healthier, more abundant butterflies in the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: This movie is Damian Szifrón's second immersion in movies after his excellent character study in \\"El Fondo del Mar\\". With \\"Tiempo De Valientes\\" he creates extremely well done characters, far away from prototypes and with an unprecedented chemistry between them. I've seen Szifron's talent to present every character in a lighthearted way but just enough to involve us emotionally with them. His control over them is magnificent, so he restores on the movie a great direction and an overall brilliantly polished script, the characters laugh and cry with real sentiment and invite the viewer to join them in their emotions and their evolution on screen. The Spanish takes over the English, the Buenos Aires urban landscape at night replaces Hollywood sets and the premise is just as interesting as any other, so we have a film daring to compete over Hollywood's Machinery. But I want you to see the movie mainly because I've never dealt with such endearing characters, all of them. It seems the script suits perfectly to the actors and vice versa. I really believe with a film making like this Argentina is really up to the Competition.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer praises Damian Szifrón’s work, particularly his ability to create well-developed, unique characters with excellent chemistry between them.

The reviewer also appreciates the excellent direction and script of the movie, which help convey the emotions and character development effectively. Additionally, the reviewer applauds the movie's setting, as it replaces Hollywood with Buenos Aires, providing a fresh and interesting backdrop for the story. One of the main reasons the reviewer encourages others to watch the movie is because of the endearing characters that are perfectly portrayed by the actors.

The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \\"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast. The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70).

While it may still experience some earthquakes due to its location in a volcanic area, the effects of the motion and stresses on neighboring rock would be comparatively less due to the distance from the highly active volcano."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press) A couple wears masks as a precaution against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) as they pass by street vendors wait for customers at Dongdaemoon market in Seoul, South Korea, Thursday, June 11, 2015.... (Associated Press) The victim was a 65-year-old man who had been treated for lung cancer and was hospitalized in the same facility as another MERS patient, the Health Ministry said. The outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome has caused panic in South Korea. It has infected more than 120 people since the first case, a 68-year-old man who had traveled to the Middle East, was diagnosed on May 20. About 3,800 people remained isolated Thursday after possible contact with infected people, according to the ministry, and more than 2,600 schools and kindergartens across South Korea were closed. On Wednesday, experts from the World Health Organization and South Korea urged the schools' reopening as the outbreak in the country has so far been contained to hospitals and there is no evidence of sustained transmission in the community. South Korean officials believe the outbreak may have peaked, although they say the next few days will be crucial to determining whether their efforts to isolate patients and control the disease have worked. Three people diagnosed with MERS were released from hospitals Thursday, bringing the total discharged to seven. President Park Geun-hye postponed her planned U.S. visit scheduled next week to focus on coping with the outbreak. Most of the deaths so far have been of people who had been suffering from pre-existing medical conditions, such as respiratory problems or cancer. Experts think MERS can spread in respiratory droplets, such as by coughing. But transmissions have mainly occurred through close contact, such as living with or caring for an infected person. MERS has mostly been centered in Saudi Arabia and has a death rate of about 40 percent among reported cases. It belongs to the family of coronaviruses that includes the common cold and SARS, and can cause fever, breathing problems, pneumonia and kidney failure. ||||| WHO: To Avoid MERS, Don’t Drink Camel Urine Six people have died, 87 have been infected, and some 1,800 schools and kindergartens have temporarily shut their doors amid an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in South Korea. It’s likely the most significant outbreak of the disease outside the Middle East, and over the weekend, the World Health Organization released details on new cases of the disease in South Korea. It also issued a surprising piece of advice for individuals seeking to avoid infection: Drink neither raw camel milk nor camel urine. That’s perhaps not as strange as it sounds. While the exact transmission mechanisms remain unclear, it is thought that the disease has its origins in bats and that camels may serve as a transmission point to humans. And in parts of the Middle East, drinking camel urine is not as uncommon as one might think. In parts of the Arabian Peninsula, the liquid is consumed for its allegedly palliative properties. The Prophet Mohammed is said to have informed his followers to drink camel urine to cure them of disease. In 2013, an intrepid reporter for Vice sampled the substance while in Yemen. “The taste of warm piss is, as you would expect, disgusting,” he wrote. “But when it’s mixed with camel milk, as it traditionally is, it’s even worse. Getting rid of the musky aftertaste that takes over your mouth after the first sip is impossible.” Health researchers have also warned that Saudi camel traders may be another possible point of transmission for MERS. By drinking raw camel milk, they warn, the traders may be unwittingly transferring the disease from their herds to the human population. Since 2012, the WHO has documented 1,190 cases of MERS with at least 440 deaths.

Close Contacts of an Ill Traveler from the Arabian Peninsula If you have had close contact*** with someone within 14 days after they traveled from a country in or near the Arabian Peninsula**, and the traveler has/had fever* and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, you should monitor your health for 14 days, starting from the day you were last exposed to the ill person. If you develop fever* and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, you should call ahead to a healthcare provider and mention your recent contact with the traveler. Close Contacts of a Confirmed Case of MERS If you have had close contact*** with someone who has a confirmed MERS-CoV infection, you should contact a healthcare provider for an evaluation. Your healthcare provider may request laboratory testing and outline additional recommendations, depending on the findings of your evaluation and whether you have symptoms. You most likely will be asked to monitor your health for 14 days, starting from the day you were last exposed to the ill person. Watch for these symptoms: Fever*. Take your temperature twice a day. Coughing Shortness of breath Other early symptoms to watch for are chills, body aches, sore throat, headache, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and runny nose. If you develop symptoms, call ahead to your healthcare provider as soon as possible and tell him or her about your possible exposure to MERS-CoV so the office can take steps to keep other people from getting infected. Ask your healthcare provider to call the local or state health department. Top of Page Healthcare Personnel Not Using Recommended Infection-Control Precautions Healthcare personnel should adhere to recommended infection control measures, including standard, contact, and airborne precautions, while managing symptomatic close contacts, patients under investigation, and patients who have probable or confirmed MERS-CoV infections. They should also use recommended infection control precautions when collecting specimens. Healthcare personnel who had close contact*** with a confirmed case of MERS while the case was ill, if not using recommended infection control precautions (e.g. appropriate use of personal protective equipment), are at increased risk of developing MERS-CoV infection. These individuals should be evaluated and monitored by a healthcare professional with a higher index of suspicion. For more information, see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). People with Exposure to Camels MERS-CoV has been found in some camels, and some MERS patients have reported contact with camels. However, we do not know exactly how people become infected with MERS-CoV. The World Health Organization has posted a general precaution for anyone visiting farms, markets, barns, or other places where animals are present. Travelers should practice general hygiene measures, including regular handwashing before and after touching animals, and avoiding contact with sick animals. Travelers should also avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products. For more information, see WHO’s Frequently Asked Questions on MERS-CoV. (Should people avoid contact with camels or camel products? Is it safe to visit farms, markets, or camel fairs?) The World Health Organization considers certain groups to be at high risk for severe MERS. These groups include people with diabetes, kidney failure, or chronic lung disease, and people who have weakened immune systems. The World Health Organization recommends that these groups take additional precautions: Avoid contact with camels Do not drink raw camel milk or raw camel urine Do not eat undercooked meat, particularly camel meat *Fever may not be present in some patients, such as those who are very young, elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain medications. Clinical judgement should be used to guide testing of patients in such situations. **Countries considered in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring include: Bahrain; Iraq; Iran; Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Syria; the United Arab Emirates (UAE); and Yemen. ***Close contact is defined as a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters), or within the room or care area, of a confirmed MERS case for a prolonged period of time (such as caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with, a confirmed MERS case) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection); or b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a confirmed MERS case (e.g., being coughed on) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment. See CDC’s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients with MERS. Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited; considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with MERS (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk). Special consideration should be given to those exposed in healthcare settings. For detailed information regarding healthcare personnel (HCP) please review CDC’s Interim U.S. Guidance for Monitoring and Movement of Persons with Potential Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) Exposure. Transient interactions, such as walking by a person with MERS, are not thought to constitute an exposure; however, final determination should be made in consultation with public health authorities. Top of Page ||||| People have been consuming camel piss on the Arabian Peninsula for a long, long time. It’s been used by the Bedouin people as a shampoo and medicine for centuries, and it’s part of Muslim tradition as well; the Prophet Mohammed is said to have once told some of his sick followers to drink camel milk and pee “till their bodies became healthy.” Since the seventh century, Yemenis have been following his advice. Statistics about camel urine use are rare, but if you spend any time in Yemen you’ll find some people, mostly in the countryside, who drink urine as a cure for whatever ails them. Some salons use it as a remedy for hair loss, and it’s even occasionally prescribed by some doctors. Researchers in Muslim countries have lately been trying to lend some scientific basis to the claims that drinking piss will cure diseases. In February, a team from King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, claimed they had extracted a substance called PMF701 from camel urine that could be used to treat cancer. Similar claims were made by the same researchers in 2009, when they said they’d seen evidence that camel milk and pee could fight eczema and psoriasis. They were never given permission from the Saudi Food and Drug Authority to conduct more studies on patients, however, and there have been plenty of scientists and doctors in the region who have publicly denounced the practice of sipping camel pee. Lecturers from Sana’a University, in Yemen’s capital, have gone out of their way to remind people that quaffing urine is bad for your digestive system, and Dr. Rida Al-Wakil, a professor at a medical school in Egypt, told Alrai, an Arabic-language newspaper in Kuwait, that ads for camel urine treatments for hepatitis were “misleading” and potentially dangerous. While recently near Ta’izz, Yemen’s third-largest city, I decided to see what all the fuss was about for myself. According to herders I spoke to, pee from virgin female camels is highly prized for its delicate taste and curative powers, and can cost up to the equivalent of 20 for a single liter. I went with nonvirgin urine—for the equivalent of about 4, I got a fresh liter of it from a camel herder named Ahmed and took a long drink. The taste of warm piss is, as you would expect, disgusting. But when it’s mixed with camel milk, as it traditionally is, it’s even worse. Getting rid of the musky aftertaste that takes over your mouth after the first sip is impossible. It didn’t make me feel any healthier, but it didn’t make me sicker either.

Details of the cases are as follows: A 49-year-old male developed symptoms on 23 May while admitted to hospital since 14 May. The patient shared the room with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on 4 June (case n. 1). He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 31 May. A 62-year-old male developed symptoms on 2 June and visited the emergency room of a local health care facility on the same day. The patient was admitted to hospital between 20 and 28 May. During this period, he shared the same floor with four patients that were later confirmed and reported as MERS-CoV cases. On 29 May, the patient visited a local health care facility for unrelated medical conditions. He was isolated in a negative pressure room on 2 June. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on 3 June. A 24-year-old male developed symptoms on 22 May. Between 22 and 28 May, the patient was admitted to the same hospital room as two previously confirmed MERS-CoV cases. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 4 June. A 70-year-old female developed symptoms on 31 May. The doctor who was involved in the care of her husband was confirmed positive for MERS-CoV on 3 June. She tested positive for MERS-CoV on 4 June. A 45-year-old male developed symptoms on 4 June. The patient was admitted to hospital from 14 to 27 May for an unrelated medical condition. Although he did not have symptoms for MERS-CoV, the patient was isolated at home because of close contact at the hospital with MERS-CoV cases. He was transferred to another hospital for isolation on 2 June. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on 3 June. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the cases. The National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea also notified WHO of the death of 1 previously reported MERS-CoV case. The case was reported in a previous DON on 30 May (case n. 3). So far, a total of 41 MERS-CoV cases, including 4 deaths, have been reported to WHO by the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea. One of the 41 cases is the case that was confirmed in China and also notified by the National IHR Focal Point of China. Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1190 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 444 related deaths. WHO advice Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"South Korea experienced an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015, which resulted in the death of 10 people and infected more than 120 individuals.

I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening. So much for my attempt at appearing “classy” and “sophisticated”…. Question: Who was frozen in place? === The answer to the above question is","completion":": The waiter was frozen in place. This makeup disaster story revolves around the narrator's experience during a trip to Puerto Rico with a friend. Both of them were dressed to impress, with perfect hair and makeup, as they dined at an upscale restaurant in their hotel. The disastrous moment occurred when the narrator, who had long, bright red fake fingernails, tried to light a cigarette in an attempt to portray sophistication. When the flame from the lighter caught the plastic nail on fire, the waiter who was attending to them at the table became frozen in place, horrified by the sight of the flaming nail. The narrator had to quickly extinguish the fire by plunging their thumb into a glass of wine. Although the waiter regained his professional composure and continued to take their orders, the narrator's attempt at appearing sophisticated and classy was thwarted by the flaming, melted, and curled fake nail. Undoubtedly, the incident left a memorable impression on the staff at the restaurant and left the narrator questioning their choice of using long, brightly painted fake fingernails as a part of their attempt to exude elegance.

Movie title: Shiri Movie plot: In October 1992, an elite group of North Korean soldiers are put through a brutal training regime. Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years. Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1Â km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To make kitchen chrome appliances shine pick from the following. (I) smear toothpaste on and polish with a soft dry cloth. (II) smear toothpaste on and polish with a soft dry clamp.","completion":"Both options involve the use of toothpaste, which is a common household item that contains mild abrasives and gentle cleaning agents. These can be effective in cleaning and polishing chrome appliances. However, the difference lies in the choice of a polishing tool: a soft dry cloth in option (I) and a soft dry clamp in option (II). (I) Smear toothpaste on and polish with a soft dry cloth Using a soft dry cloth as a polishing tool has several advantages. First, it is easily available in most households, making it a convenient choice. Additionally, the soft texture of the cloth prevents scratches on the chrome surface. The flexibility of a soft dry cloth also allows for a better coverage of the appliance's shape and contours during the polishing process. When using a soft dry cloth, you can apply a small amount of toothpaste on the cloth, then gently rub the toothpaste onto the chrome surface in circular motions. Allow the toothpaste to sit for several minutes before polishing the surface with the clean areas of the cloth. The toothpaste residue should be wiped away, leaving the chrome appliance with a shiny and polished appearance. (II) Smear toothpaste on and polish with a soft dry clamp Using a soft dry clamp to polish chrome appliances might prove to be a less effective and convenient choice. A clamp is designed for holding objects tightly or securing them in place, and using it as a polishing tool could lead to unintentional pressure points that may scratch or damage the chrome surface. Additionally, a clamp may not provide the same flexibility and coverage as a soft dry cloth, making it difficult to clean and polish the appliance thoroughly. While it is possible to wrap the soft dry clamp in a soft cloth to protect the chrome surface and use it for polishing, this method is still less convenient and less effective than using a soft dry cloth directly. Conclusion In conclusion, option (I)—smearing toothpaste on and polishing with a soft dry cloth—is the better solution for making kitchen chrome appliances shine. This method offers multiple advantages, including the availability and affordability of the materials, the flexibility and coverage of the soft dry cloth, and the prevention of scratches or damages to the chrome surface.

Step 1: Identify the main verb in each sentence In both sentences, the main verb is \\"receive.\\" Step 2: Identify the context and the subjects In the first sentence, the subject is understood as an unspecified person or entity, and the context is about getting letters from the front (presumably in a wartime situation). In the second sentence, the subject is \\"He\\" and the context is about accepting or believing in Christ (religious context). Step 3: Assess the meaning of \\"receive\\" in each context In both sentences, \\"receive\\" has the basic sense of accepting or taking something that is being given or offered. However, the nuances are different in each sentence due to the context: In the first sentence, \\"receive\\" refers to the physical action of accepting or getting letters. This is a more literal use of \\"receive.\\" In the second sentence, \\"receive\\" has a more metaphorical meaning, as it refers to the spiritual or inner act of accepting Christ into one's life or belief system.

Tässä tekstissä mainitaan komissaari, joka pyrkii tasapainoilemaan kahden eri tavoitteen välillä. Ensimmäinen tavoite on uhanalaisten lajien suojelu, joka tarkoittaa toimenpiteitä luonnon monimuotoisuuden säilyttämiseksi ja elinympäristöjen suojeluksi. Tämä on tärkeää, jotta eläin- ja kasvilajien sukupuuttoon kuoleminen saadaan estettyä ja ylläpidettyä maapallon ekologista tasapainoa sekä varmistettua, että tulevat sukupolvet voivat nauttia luonnon tarjoamista palveluista ja hyödyistä. Toinen tavoite on Euroopan köyhimpien alueiden avustaminen, joka kuvaa komissaarin yritystä auttaa näitä alueita taloudellisesti, sosiaalisesti ja kulttuurisesti. Tämä voi sisältää esimerkiksi alueellisten kehitysrahastojen ja investointien käyttöönottoa tai ohjelmia, jotka tukevat paikallista taloutta, koulutusta, terveydenhuoltoa ja sosiaalipalveluja. Euroopan köyhimmät alueet tarvitsevat apua päästäkseen kehittyneempiin alueisiin nähden tasavertaiselle asemalle sekä sisällyttääkseen alueidensa asukkaat täysipainoisesti yhteiskuntaan. Komissaarin tehtävänä on löytää tasapaino näiden kahden eri tavoitteen välillä. Tämä saattaa olla haastavaa, koska molemmat tavoitteet voivat olla joskus keskenään ristiriitaisia. Esimerkiksi luonnon suojeleminen voi vaatia rajoittamaan tiettyjä taloudellisia toimintoja, mikä puolestaan saattaa vaikuttaa negatiivisesti köyhempiin alueisiin. Toisaalta, ekologisen kestävyyden ja uhanalaisten lajien suojelun huomioiminen taloudellisen kehityksen yhteydessä voi auttaa luomaan molempia tavoitteita tukevia ratkaisuja. Ratkaisevaa on siis löytää sellaisia toimintatapoja ja strategioita, joilla voidaan saavuttaa molemmat tavoitteet mahdollisimman tehokkaasti ja kestävästi. Tämä voi esimerkiksi tarkoittaa ympäristöystävällisten teknologioiden ja innovaatioiden edistämistä, luonnonvarojen kestävän hyödyntämisen periaatteiden noudattamista tai sosiaalisten ja kulttuuristen näkökohtien huomioimista kehityspolitiikassa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected.

While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack. The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W.

Plot title: Rails & Ties Movie plot: Laura Danner is a mentally ill, single mother who takes illegal drugs and is unable to care for her 10-year-old son Davey. Driven to despair, she decides to commit suicide by driving a car on to a railway track, taking Davey with her. She offers him some tranquillisers beforehand but, unbeknownst to her, he spits them out. His mother drives on to the tracks. As a train approaches, Davey tries in vain to drag her out of the car, himself jumping clear just in time. Two train crewmen, Tom Stark and Otis Higgs, seeing the car on the tracks ahead, argue about whether an emergency stop will derail the train or not. However, the train hits and kills the boy's mother. Subsequently, the railroad company calls for an internal inquiry and suspends the two drivers. Davey has spent the first night after the incident with an empathetic social worker, Susan Garcia. However, she places the boy with a cold-hearted, disciplinarian foster mother. Later on, after being confined to his room, he escapes by shattering the window. The authorities are alerted and a missing persons search is initiated. The boy obtains train conductor Tom Stark's home address. He turns up at the Starks' home and berates Tom for accidentally killing his mother in the train crash, but eventually he is placated.

Given the two facts above, motion can be converted into electrical energy with a what? A:","completion":"Given the two facts above, motion can be converted into electrical energy with a generator. A generator is a device that primarily serves to transform kinetic energy, which is a form of energy associated with the motion or movement of an object, into electrical energy that is utilized to provide power to various devices, appliances, and systems. To understand how this conversion process works, we should delve into the fundamental principle behind generators. The foundation of a generator lies in the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction, which was first discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831. Electromagnetic induction is the process where a changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a nearby conductor. If the conductor is part of an electric circuit, an electrical current will flow through it as a result of the induced EMF. A generator typically consists of a rotating component called a rotor, which contains magnets that create a magnetic field, and a stationary component called a stator, which consists of coils of wire. As the rotor spins within the magnetic field due to an external force (such as water in a hydroelectric installation, wind in a wind turbine or mechanical energy derived from an internal combustion engine in the case of a gas generator), the magnetic flux through the coils changes. This change in magnetic flux induces an electromotive force in the coils, which in turn generates electrical current. There are different types of generators that are available to serve varying purposes, such as gas generators, diesel generators, wind turbines, and hydroelectric generators, among others. Each of these generators employs the fundamental concept of electromagnetic induction but utilizes a different source of kinetic energy to drive the rotor's motion. In conclusion, motion can be converted into electrical energy using a generator that operates through the principle of electromagnetic induction. By converting kinetic energy into electrical power, generators offer a versatile solution to address a wide array of energy needs, ranging from powering small appliances in off-grid locations to providing large-scale electricity generation for entire nation grids."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It may seem simple, but achieving the perfect consistency and texture of cooked rice can be a tricky endeavor. The secret lies in choosing the appropriate saucepan and accurately measuring your rice. This article will delve into the importance of selecting the right saucepan and measuring your rice to ensure optimal results every time. Step 1: Selecting a Large Saucepan with a Tight-Fitting Lid The first step towards making perfectly cooked rice is picking the right saucepan. Consider the following factors while making your selection: 1. Size - Opt for a large saucepan that can comfortably accommodate the rice and the water it needs to cook. Remember that the rice will expand as it cooks, so the pan should have enough room for the grains to do so without overflowing. 2. Material - Choose a saucepan made from a material that conducts heat efficiently, such as stainless steel, copper, or cast iron. These materials ensure that heat is distributed evenly throughout the pan, helping the rice to cook uniformly. 3. Lid Quality - A tight-fitting lid is essential for keeping the steam trapped inside your saucepan. This allows the rice to cook with the perfect amount of moisture. Make sure the lid seals well around the saucepan's edges to prevent steam from escaping. Step 2: Accurately Measuring the Rice Once you've picked the right saucepan, it's time to measure the rice. Here's how to go about it: 1. Choose Your Measurement Tool - For the most accurate results, use a kitchen scale to weigh your rice rather than relying on volume measurements, like cups. Scales provide a more precise measurement, ensuring consistency every time you cook. 2. Rinse the Rice - Before measuring and cooking, rinse the rice in water to remove any dust or impurities. This also helps to wash away excess starch, which can make the rice stick together once cooked. 3. Measure the Rice - Using your chosen measurement method, weigh out the desired quantity of rice, keeping in mind that uncooked rice typically doubles in size when cooked. For example, 1 cup (200g) of uncooked rice will yield about 4 servings of cooked rice. 4. Determine the Rice-to-Water Ratio - The ratio of rice to water is crucial in achieving the desired texture of your cooked rice. Most types of rice require a 1:2 ratio (1 cup of rice to 2 cups of water). However, some rice varieties (such as basmati or sushi rice) may require different ratios, so consult the package instructions or a trusted recipe for specifics. Conclusion With these essential steps in mind, you'll be well on your way to mastering the art of cooking rice. By selecting a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid and accurately measuring your rice, you can achieve the perfect texture, consistency, and flavor every time. Give these techniques a try and elevate your culinary skills, impressing family and friends with your perfectly cooked rice dishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Demarest A:","completion":"Title: The Walls of Demarest Genre: Mystery/Thriller Setting: Demarest Maximum Security Prison Plot: Act 1: James Norwood, a notorious criminal mind, is transferred to Demarest Maximum Security Prison, known for its particularly ruthless and sadistic prison warden, Arthur Demarest, whom the walls of the prison are named after. Arthur takes pleasure in asserting his dominance over the inmates and rules the institution with an iron fist. He ensures they live in a state of constant fear, which inevitably leads to high tensions within the prison. Several key inmates, such as Mike \\"The Boss\\" Thompson, a mafia leader; Jamaal \\"The Dealer\\" Harris, a drug kingpin; and Victor \\"The Hitman\\" Martinez, a feared contract killer, among others, form a secret alliance to plot their escape. This diverse group represents each of the major gangs within Demarest and is united by the goal to overthrow Warden Demarest's tyranny. Act 2: As the brewing tension becomes palpable within Demarest, a new and enigmatic inmate named Ethan Walker joins the ranks. With a background in marine intelligence and elite special forces, he was wrongfully convicted of a crime he did not commit. Once inside, he quickly learns how Warden Demarest runs the prison and discreetly begins gathering information to take action against Demarest's oppressive regime. He gains the trust of the key inmates and is introduced to the alliance's master escape plan. The plan involves a complex tunnel system, a diversion, and the use of the upcoming Demarest Prison Festival as a cover to make their escape seem like an accident. They craft blueprints, distribute tasks, and set the plan in motion. However, as the escape day approaches, someone within the alliance betrays them. Their plans are exposed, and Warden Demarest tightens security while trying to identify the mole and the instigators. Act 3: The night of the Demarest Prison Festival arrives, and Ethan Walker discovers the informant's identity: Victor \\"The Hitman\\" Martinez, who was offered early release in exchange for his betrayal. As the festival is in full swing, the prisoners carry out their alternate escape plan. This plan leads to a massive prison riot, and Warden Demarest realizes that he has lost control. In the chaos, Warden Demarest is found dead in his office, causing the entire prison to fall into disarray. Suspicion initially falls on Ethan Walker, who has a military background that would make him a prime suspect in the killing. However, as the truth is unraveled by an internal investigation, it is revealed that it was Victor who killed Demarest to win favor with the alliance again and ensure the success of the escape plan. Epilogue: With Demarest dead and the true identity of the murderer exposed, the prison experiences a change in leadership, and new warden Mary Davies implements reforms for humane treatment within the prison. The members of the secret alliance are apprehended following the failed escape attempt, and each faces additional penalties. Ethan Walker manages to prove his innocence and, with the help of an empathetic prison guard, successfully appeals his wrongful conviction. Upon release, Ethan becomes a highly-sought-after investigator, working to expose corruption within the prison system, ensuring no one suffers as he did."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend blog will know that I suffer from an extremely sensitive scalp which can be really itchy, and I have to be very careful what shampoo I use. I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

Prisoners participating in a hunger strike at the Guantanamo Bay detention centre have lodged new complaints about their military jailers to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Wednesday's charges come as an ICRC team made a fact-finding trip to the US base in Cuba. In an emergency motion filed with a federal court in Washington, lawyers say guards have refused to provide drinking water to hunger strikers and kept camp temperature \\"extremely frigid'', to thwart the protest. A spokesman for the detention centre denied the allegations. \\"The reality is that these men are slowly withering away and we as a country need to take immediate action,'' said Mari Newman, a human rights lawyer based in Denver, who was among those who submitted the motion. The petition was filed after a Monday phone interview with Musaab al-Madhwani, a Yemeni prisoner. He told them that guards were refusing to provide bottled water and telling prisoners to drink from tap water that inmates believe is non-potable. The lawyers say in their motion that the lack of drinkable water has \\"already caused some prisoners kidney, urinary and stomach problems,'' in addition to the health effects of the hunger strike. Conflicting accounts Along with their motion, they submitted an affidavit from Stephen Xenakis, a psychiatrist and retired general, who believes that the hunger strike and lack of adequate drinking water \\"sets them up for gastrointestinal infections and a quick demise''. The doctor also said the 34-year-old al-Madhwani suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder linked to his torture while in US custody in Afghanistan and could be worsened by harsh conditions at Guantanamo. Washington has not filed a response to the motion. Navy Captain Robert Durand, a spokesman for the prison, said prisoners are provided with bottled water and that the tap water is safe to drink. \\"It's potable water. It's the same water I make my coffee with and that they make lunch with,'' Durand said. He also denied that there had been any change to the air conditioning settings inside the prison camps. Accounts of the hunger strike have been in sharp conflict for weeks. Lawyers who have visited or interviewed their clients say a majority of the 166 men held at Guantanamo have joined the protest and some have lost significant weight and are at serious risk. Obama monitoring The military said that as of Wednesday, there were 31 men on hunger strike, up from 28 on Monday. Three men were at the hospital being treated for dehydration and 11 were being force-fed with a liquid nutrient mix to prevent dangerous weight loss. A two-person delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross that includes a doctor is at the base to assess the situation. They started a week earlier than planned because of the hunger strike, said Simon Schorno, ICRC spokesman. Their findings will be presented to the camp commander and Miami-based Southern Command, which oversees the prison, but will not be made public. Lawyers for the prisoners say the hunger strike began on February 6 as a protest of the men's indefinite confinement without charge and because of what they said was a return to harsh treatment from past years, including more intrusive searches and confiscation of personal items such as mail from their families. The military says no policies or procedures have changed at Guantanamo and the strike is an attempt to draw attention to their cause. Josh Earnest, White House spokesman, say Obama's team is closely monitoring the hunger strikes, but deferred to the Pentagon for any specifics. \\"The administration remains committed to closing the detention facility at Guantanamo bay,'' Earnest said, noting that legislation passed by Congress makes it likely that process would not be quick. ||||| Nearly 170 inmates are currently being held at Guantanamo Bay The International Committee of the Red Cross says it is urgently sending a doctor to Guantanamo Bay because of a growing hunger strike among detainees. The ICRC says the doctor and another group member are flying to Guantanamo a week earlier than planned \\"because of the current tensions\\" there. A Pentagon spokesman says 31 of 166 detainees are now on hunger strike. The inmates - many of whom are being held without charge - are angry at the US failure to resolve their fate. Last week, more than 21 people at the US detention facility in Cuba were on hunger strike. 'Clear link' The ICRC said on Wednesday that it had initially planned to send its team to Guantanamo on 1 April. \\"However, in an effort to better understand current tensions and the ongoing hunger strike, we have decided to start this visit one week earlier,\\" ICRC spokesman Simon Schorno said. He added that \\"tensions at Guantanamo are certainly related, in our view, to the uncertainty that's prevailing on the future of the detainees\\". \\"We see a clear link between that and their emotional state.\\" Pentagon spokesman Maj Jeff Pool told the BBC that 31 detainees were currently on hunger strike. He said that 11 of them were being fed liquid food through tubes and three were treated at hospital. Maj Pool provided no comment on the latest visit by the ICRC, saying only that the group's delegations had been visiting Guantanamo about six times a year starting from January 2002. Hunger strikes have happened frequently at the US military prison, but this is reportedly one of the longest and more widespread protests. It started several weeks ago and the number of detainees joining the protest was growing steadily. Human rights groups and lawyers representing the prisoners say it reflects growing frustration at the US military's failure to decide their future. Nearly 100 of the detainees have been reportedly cleared for release but remain at the facility because of Congressional restrictions and also concerns of possible mistreatment if they are sent back to their home countries. However, Guantanamo officials deny claims that the strike began after copies of the Koran were mishandled during searches of prisoners' cells. The military detention centre opened in 2002 to hold suspects captured in counter-terrorism operations after the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Prisoners participating in a hunger strike at the Guantanamo Bay detention centre have lodged new complaints about their military jailers to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

Context: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule.

It would seem someone does not want the film completed. The storyline is flimsy. One has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek, but it had no real oomph. The characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just don't care about, it seems irrelevant. It is weird hearing Kylie's accent as Australian again and nice to see a kid I went to school with in a starring role. But that doesn't redeem the film at all. Goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in Molly Ringwald. Perhaps due to the nature of the film (it sort of pays homage to 80s films / bad horror films)but really an Aussie actor would have done just fine.

Write an article based on this summary: Pay attention if your wife starts to complain about you or your relationship. Watch for changes in her desire for sex. Notice if you share less emotional intimacy. Notice if your wife suddenly wants more privacy. Pay attention if she’s spending more time on her phone.","completion":"Title: Recognizing the Warning Signs in Your Marriage: Does Your Wife Need More Attention? Introduction: Marriage requires continuous nurturing of the relationship, understanding each other's feelings, and working together towards the betterment of the bond. At times, one partner may not be content due to several reasons, and it is crucial to identify these signs and address them before it is too late. In this article, we will focus on indicators that suggest your wife may need more attention and how you can tackle these warning signs before they escalate. 1. Your Wife's Complaints: It may be easy to ignore or brush aside your wife's complaints about you or your relationship. However, these criticisms can be a loud and clear cry for attention and understanding. The first step in addressing her concerns is genuinely listening and acknowledging her feelings. Consider these complaints as constructive feedback and identify ways to change your behavior for the betterment of your relationship. Remember, openly discussing the issues at hand will not only help you understand her perspective but can also strengthen your marital bond. 2. Changes in Sexual Desire: Fluctuations in one's desire for sex can be entirely normal. However, if you notice a prolonged or recurring decline in your wife's sexual interest, it may indicate an underlying problem. It is essential to approach this situation delicately, without overt assumptions about the cause. Engage in open communication, express your concerns, and be willing to hear her out. A decrease in sexual desire could stem from internal struggles, unmet emotional needs, or unresolved issues within the relationship. Giving her the attention she needs and working together to address these issues can revitalize your bond and restore intimacy. 3. Lack of Emotional Intimacy: Emotional intimacy is the core foundation of a healthy and long-lasting marriage. If you find yourself sharing less emotional intimacy with your wife – having fewer heartfelt conversations, or not connecting on a deeper level – this can be a red flag that requires immediate attention. Set aside time each day to connect with your wife, practice active listening, and empathize with her feelings. Create a secure environment where she can express her thoughts and emotions without fear of judgment. By rekindling emotional intimacy, you can bring your relationship back on track and ensure both of your emotional needs are met. 4. Increased Need for Privacy: While personal privacy is vital in any relationship, a sudden and significant increase in your wife's desire for privacy could serve as a warning sign. Notice if she becomes more secretive about her phone, computer, or spends more time alone without any reason. Instead of snooping or jumping to conclusions, communicate your concerns and encourage her to share what might be causing her withdrawal. Keeping open lines of communication and ensuring you respect her privacy can help you understand and address any underlying problems. 5. Spending More Time on Her Phone: In today's digital age, it's common for people to spend significant time on their phones. However, if your wife suddenly seems more engaged with her phone rather than you, this could be a sign that she's seeking emotional fulfillment elsewhere. Talk to her about how this behavior affects you and seek ways to reconnect and reestablish the lost connection. Engage in shared activities, find hobbies that interest you both, and prioritize regular date nights to strengthen your bond. Conclusion: Marriage is a complex journey that demands both partners to be attentive to each other's needs and emotions. Recognizing and addressing the warning signs mentioned above is a crucial step towards maintaining a strong, healthy, and loving relationship. Remember that open communication, empathy, and willingness to make positive changes are fundamental factors in building and sustaining a successful life-long partnership with your spouse."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Coming off their last-second home win over the Cardinals, the Ravens flew to Cleveland Browns Stadium for an AFC North duel with the Cleveland Browns. The match-up would be notable with former Ravens RB Jamal Lewis now playing for Cleveland. In the first quarter, Baltimore trailed early as the Browns took their opening drive and ended it with QB Derek Anderson (another former Raven) completing a 2-yard TD pass to WR Joe Jurevicius. Also, immediately after QB Steve McNair got intercepted, Cleveland cashed in with Anderson completing a 78-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards. In the second quarter, Baltimore managed to get on the board with kicker Matt Stover getting a 21-yard field goal. However, the Browns continued their offensive surge with kicker Phil Dawson getting a 41-yard field goal, along with Lewis getting a 1-yard TD run. Even though instant replay showed that the ball was just shy of breaking the plane of the goal line, the Ravens' coaching staff was unable to challenge the play in time. They would end the half with Stover kicking a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cleveland continued its surgence with Dawson kicking a 20-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Baltimore tried to come back, but the only thing from their comeback was McNair's 4-yard TD pass to TE Quinn Sypniewski. With the surprising loss, the Ravens fell to 2-2, despite outgaining the Browns 418-303 in total offense. On the positive note, RB Willis McGahee got his first 100-yard game as a Raven, as he ran 14 times for 104 yards.

(ii). create a black hole in the desert. (iii). turn a sculpture to dust. (iv). create a time traveling vortex....A:","completion":"Weathering is the process by which rocks, minerals, and other materials are broken down into smaller particles by natural forces like wind, water, ice, and temperature changes. It is an essential part of the geological cycle and plays a significant role in the shaping of Earth's landscapes, including the formation of sedimentary rocks. Based on the given choices, the correct answer to the question \\"Weathering can\\" would be: (iii). turn a sculpture to dust. The reasoning for this answer is explained below: (i). Release a best-selling album: This option is not possible because weathering is a natural process that affects Earth's surface and has no connection to music or the entertainment industry. (ii). Create a black hole in the desert: Weathering cannot create a black hole. Black holes are astronomical objects formed through the gravitational collapse of massive stars. They have nothing to do with the weathering processes that occur on Earth's surface. (iii). Turn a sculpture to dust: When a sculpture, typically made of stone or metal, is exposed to the elements over a long period, weathering processes such as physical (mechanical) weathering and chemical weathering can cause the material to break down gradually. Physical weathering includes processes like freeze-thaw cycles, abrasion, and thermal expansion, while chemical weathering involves reactions between the material, water, and atmospheric gases that can degrade the sculpture's structure. As a result, weathering can ultimately turn a sculpture to dust over time. (iv). Create a time traveling vortex: Time travel and time-traveling vortices are constructs found in science fiction literature and movies. There is currently no scientific evidence or known mechanism demonstrating that weathering could create any time-related phenomena. In conclusion, weathering processes can turn a sculpture to dust by causing the material to break down through natural forces over time, but they cannot release a best-selling album, create a black hole in the desert, or create a time-traveling vortex."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment. These mutations are considered beneficial. An example is a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics. Bacteria with the mutation increase in numbers, so the mutation becomes more common. Other mutations are harmful. They may even be deadly. Harmful mutations often result in a protein that no longer can do its job. Some harmful mutations cause cancer or other genetic disorders. I am facing a new situation today: David is a biochemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is testing three strains of bacteria, case A, case B, and case C.

Question: What first made the Notre Dame mascot famous around the US? Context: Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.

Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the Revolutionary Étude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the Minute Waltz (Op. 64, No. 1). However, with the exception of his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.

Republican guerrilla fighter Manuel Artiguez turns away from the border and back towards Spain. His friends stop him, saying \\"Manuel, the war is over!\\". The story returns twenty years later, to a young boy named Paco, who asks a man named Pedro why Artiguez, who is legendary for his fierce resistance to Franco even after the defeat of the Republicans, has stopped his guerrilla raids against the Francoists in Spain. Pedro sends Paco into France to find his uncle and Artiguez. Paco tells Artiguez that he wants him to kill Viñolas, a Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father. Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldn't tell the police where to find Artiguez, whom Viñolas must capture if he is to retain his rank in the Guard.

A brawl ensues and the next morning, when two of the Russians seek revenge on Connor and Murphy, the mobsters are killed in an act of self-defense. FBI Agent Paul Smecker is assigned to the case, and finds that the police and local news reporters see the MacManus brothers as heroes. The duo turn themselves in at a police station, where Smecker interviews them. After they retell their incident to Smecker, he declines to press charges and allows them to spend the night in a holding cell to avoid attention from the media. That night, they receive what appears to be a \\"calling\\" from God telling them to hunt down wicked men so that the innocent will flourish. Connor and Murphy resolve to rid Boston of evil men. Connor learns of a meeting of Russian syndicate bosses at a hotel. Having equipped themselves with weaponry from a local underground gun dealer, the brothers quickly kill all nine Russian mobsters, while Rocco, a friend of the brothers and mob errand boy for local mafia boss Giuseppe \\"Papa Joe\\" Yakavetta, is sent in on an independent hit as an unknowing throwaway. The next day, Rocco learns that he was betrayed by Papa Joe, the hit amounting to an attempt to have Rocco killed by the nine Russian mobsters as he was sent in with only a six-shot revolver.

Shack has an arsenal of makeshift weapons: a hammer, a steel rod, and a chain. A hobo who is a hero to his peers, A-No.1, manages to hop the train with the younger, less-experienced Cigaret close behind. At the next stop, A-No.1 evades Shack and escapes into the hobo jungle, but Cigaret is caught. Shack threatens to kill Cigaret for riding his train for free, who is bragging that he and he alone did it. Shack is distracted when he learns that A-No.1 has posted a notice on the yard water tower, announcing that he will become the first hobo to ride Shack's train all the way to Portland. The other hobos agree that the first who can successfully ride Shack's train will have earned the title \\"Emperor of the North Pole.\\" Railroad workers place bets whether A-No.-1 can do it, spreading the news far and wide over the telegraph, Shack being widely known and disliked. A-No.1 hops the train and does everything he can to steer clear of Shack, pulling a series of pranks with the help of other hobos, such as running Shack's train into a siding and greasing the tracks, almost causing it to crash head on into an oncoming mail train. He tries to rid himself of the company of Cigaret, who tags along and makes a general pest of himself. Shack succeeds in ejecting the two, but they board a fast passenger train which overtakes Shack's train and ride it to Salem, Oregon. There, they have several farcical encounters, including one with a policeman who chases the two into the Salem hobo jungle, accusing them of stealing a turkey. They also encounter a Holiness minister holding an outdoor baptism service. The two hobos reboard Shack's train after it arrives in Salem.

Write some highlights for the following article: Medicare can no longer automatically deny coverage requests for sex reassignment surgeries, a federal board ruled on Friday in a groundbreaking decision that recognizes the procedures are medically necessary for people who don't identify with their biological sex. Ruling in favor of a 74-year-old transgender Army veteran whose request to have Medicare pay for her genital reconstruction was denied two years ago, the agency's Departmental Appeals Board said there was no justification for a three-decade-old HHS rule excluding such surgeries from procedures covered by the national health program for the elderly and disabled. 'Sometimes I am asked aren't I too old to have surgery. My answer is how old is too old?' the veteran, Denee Mallon, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, said in an email interview before the board issued its decision. Medicare's Department of Health and Services review board ruled Friday, May 30, in favor of Mallon, a 74-year-old Army veteran, whose request to have Medicare pay for her genital reconstruction was denied two years ago. Denee Mallon, right, holds a banner before taking part in the Trans March to Morningside Park in Albuquerque. 'When people ask if I am too old, it feels like they are implying that it's a \`waste of money' to operate at my age. But I could have an active life ahead of me for another 20 years. And I want to spend those years in congruence and not distress.' Jennifer Levi, a lawyer who directs the Transgender Rights Project of Gay & Lesbian Advocates and Defenders in Boston, said the ruling does not mean Medicare recipients are necessarily entitled to have sex reassignment surgery paid for by the government. Instead, the lifting of the coverage ban means they now will be able to seek authorization by submitting documentation from a doctor and mental health professionals stating that surgery is recommended in their individual case, Levi said. No statistics exist on how many people might be affected by the decision. Gary Gates, a demographer with The Williams Institute, a think tank on LGBT issues based at the University of California, Los Angeles, has estimated that people who self-identify as transgender make up 0.3 percent of the U.S. adult population. Over 49 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare. The cost of gender reassignment surgery varies, but typically ranges from 7,000 to 50,000, according to the Transgender Law Center in Oakland, California. In Friday's ruling, the appeals board said that HHS lacked sufficient evidence in 1981 when it made a 'national coverage determination' holding that Medicare recipients were ineligible for what it then called 'transsexual surgery' because the procedure was too controversial, experimental, and medically risky. Denee Mallon, second from left, takes part in the Trans March to Morningside Park in Albuquerque on Thursday. The decision recognizes sex reassignment surgeries as a medically necessary and effective treatment for individuals who do not identify with their biological sex such as Mallon. The panel went on to say that regardless of what the record showed then, studies and experts have since shown the efficacy of surgical interventions as a treatment for gender dysphoria, the diagnosis given to people who experience extreme distress due to the disconnect between their birth sex and their gender identity. 'We have no difficulty concluding that the new evidence, which includes medical studies published in the more than 32 years since issuance of the 1981 report underlying the NCD, outweighs the NCD record and demonstrates that transsexual surgery is safe and effective and not experimental. Thus, as we discuss below, the grounds for the ...exclusion of coverage are not reasonable,' the civilian panel said. The appeals board's decisions are binding on HHS unless they are appealed in federal court. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency within HHS that manages Medicare, opted not to defend the transgender surgery exclusion before the five-member board and had initiated the process for lifting it on its own before Mallon filed her complaint. The ruling does not apply to Medicaid, which provides health coverage for individuals and families with low-incomes and is regulated by the states. Some states have exclusions on sex reassignment surgeries and the sex hormones transgender people often take during their transitions, while others evaluate claims on a case-by-case basis. Transgender health advocates said that because private insurance companies and Medicaid programs often take their cues from the federal government on what is considered medically necessary, elective or experimental, the decision could pave the way for sex-reassignment surgeries to be a routinely covered benefit. Mallon was born a man and identifies as a woman. 'When I learned that Medicare denies the essential care I need, I remember saying \`This is not right. They're relying on these archaic reasons to deny me the care my doctor agrees I need? I knew I had to do something to challenge that,' Mallon said. Denee Mallon, center, joins a candlelight vigil organized by Albuquerque Pride in Albuquerque the evening before she won the right for Medicare coverage of her sex change operation. Highlights:","completion":"- A federal board ruled that Medicare can no longer automatically deny coverage requests for sex reassignment surgeries, recognizing that these procedures are medically necessary for people who don't identify with their biological sex. - The ruling came in favor of a 74-year-old transgender Army veteran whose request for genital reconstruction coverage was previously denied. - The decision does not mean Medicare recipients are automatically entitled to have sex reassignment surgery paid for; instead, they can now seek authorization with documentation from medical professionals recommending the surgery for their individual case. - The ruling could pave the way for sex reassignment surgeries to become a routinely covered benefit by private insurance companies and Medicaid programs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere - The Earth's temperature rises - suppose plants begin to die happens, how will it affect a SMALLER greenhouse effect. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. To understand how plants dying could lead to a smaller greenhouse effect, it is important to understand the role plants play in mitigating climate change. One of the ways plants help regulate the Earth's temperature is through a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and convert it into glucose and oxygen. Through this process, plants act as natural carbon sinks, helping to reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. If plants begin to die, there would be a disruption in this natural process, leading to potential consequences for the greenhouse effect. There are a few ways in which this might occur: 1. Less CO2 Absorption: When plants die, they are no longer able to take in CO2 through photosynthesis. This would result in an overall decrease in the amount of CO2 being removed from the atmosphere, allowing more CO2 and other greenhouse gas concentrations to build up, which could initially lead to a larger greenhouse effect. However, if plants continue to die off and eventually become scarce, there will be a reduction in the overall biological activity contributing to the release of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (such as methane) into the atmosphere. Fewer plants and less biological activity could lead to a smaller greenhouse effect. 2. Soil Carbon Storage: Plants, particularly trees, help store carbon within the soil. When they die, this carbon storage capability is diminished, potentially releasing stored carbon back into the atmosphere as CO2 or other greenhouse gases. This can initially increase the greenhouse effect. However, over time, as fewer plants are present, the rate of carbon being removed from the atmosphere and stored in the soil will decrease, which could indirectly contribute to a smaller greenhouse effect. 3. Albedo Effect: The presence of plants and trees on Earth's surface impacts the albedo effect—the reflection of sunlight back into space. When plants die, the planet's surface may become less reflective, causing it to absorb more sunlight and potentially increasing the greenhouse effect in the short term. Over time, as fewer plants are present and the reflective capacity of Earth's surface changes, it could indirectly lead to a smaller greenhouse effect as the overall availability of the solar radiation reaching the atmosphere may be affected. 4. Ecosystem Dynamics: The death of plants can also have indirect impacts on the greenhouse effect through changes in ecosystem dynamics. For example, the decline in plant life could disrupt the food chain, affecting populations of herbivores, predators, and insects. These changes could alter the balance of emissions and uptake of greenhouse gases within the ecosystem, potentially leading to a smaller greenhouse effect in the long term. Overall, the death of plants would indirectly impact certain steps of the greenhouse effect process, disrupting the natural carbon cycle, and leading to complex chain reactions in the Earth's ecosystem dynamics. While it may initially seem counterintuitive that the decline of plant life might eventually contribute to a smaller greenhouse effect, it is essential to consider the long-term dynamics of how both direct and indirect impacts of this perturbation may affect the greenhouse effect and overall climate system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: process, airline divided, two parts, informally known, old Varig, new Varig Sentence 2: process, airline divided, two portions, informally known, new Varig, old Varig Step 2: Compare the main components. - Both sentences mention a process that divides the airline - The division is called \\"informally known\\" - Both mention \\"old Varig\\" and \\"new Varig\\" Step 3: Analyze the differences. - Sentence 1 refers to the division as \\"two parts\\" - Sentence 2 refers to the division as \\"two portions\\" - The order of the terms \\"old Varig\\" and \\"new Varig\\" is different in each sentence Step 4: Determine whether the differences affect the meaning. - The difference between \\"two parts\\" and \\"two portions\\" is not significant; they both convey splitting the airline. - The order of the terms \\"old Varig\\" and \\"new Varig\\" does not affect the meaning as they are simply reversed. Conclusion: Yes, these two sentences convey the same information. The differences between the sentences do not alter the overall meaning, and they both describe the same event of dividing the airline into old and new Varig as part of a process."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

With magazines, I was always a little suspicious that the review wasn't true, that it was more an advertorial than an honest article. Blogs seemed more honest - I never distrusted the review. Plus they went into so much more depth than magazines ever did. I think that the day I discovered beauty blogs was probably also the day my magazine addiction came to an end. BUT, there is one issue that I do have with blogs and that is editing, or grammar to be more precise. Now, don't get me wrong, it is not all blogs that I have this issue with. In fact, the majority of blogs I do read are very well written. But, I still come across a few that don't know the difference between your & you're; where, we're & were; and their, there & they're and this is a massive pet hate of mine. The odd typo doesn't bother me. We all make them. I know I do as I usually only proof read once but repeatedly writing there instead of their or where instead of were drives me mental. I just want to bust out a red pen and edit the post. The carton below, which is floating around Facebook at the moment, was my inspiration for writing this post as it really highlights how, by making the slightest grammatical error, the entire meaning of the sentence changes. I suspect that, if you are a similar grammar fanatic, you are sitting here, nodding your head, thinking 'man, that drives me crazy, too!'. If you are not a grammar fanatic then you might be thinking 'hey, what are you whinging about - it is only a couple of letters out of order'. This is why it annoys me so much - I read a sentence but it doesn't quite make sense, so I have to go back and read it again to get an understanding. As soon as I start doing that, I am no longer reading the content of the post but am instead trying to decipher what is being written.

Answer:","completion":"After conducting research on the two plant genera Lamium and Colletia, it appears that Lamium has more species than Colletia. Lamium, commonly known as Deadnettles, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. It comprises around 40 to 50 species of herbaceous perennial plants that can be found mainly in Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Some of the well-known species within the Lamium genus include Lamium album (White Deadnettle), Lamium purpureum (Red Deadnettle), and Lamium maculatum (Spotted Deadnettle). On the other hand, Colletia is a less diverse genus in the family Rhamnaceae. This genus consists of 15 to 17 species of mostly thorny shrubs native to South America, particularly in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile. Colletia species are well-known for their peculiar appearance with flattened photosynthetic branches instead of leaves, and the presence of spines. Some notable species within the Colletia genus are Colletia paradoxa (Jet Plane Plant or Anchor Plant) and Colletia hystrix (Crucifixion Thorn). In conclusion, Lamium has a higher number of species, roughly 40-50, compared to Colletia, which contains around 15-17 species."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The region is also called Sleswick in English. - Lübeck is a city in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany, and one of the major ports of Germany. On the river Trave, it was the leading city of the Hanseatic League, and because of its extensive Brick Gothic architecture is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. In 2015, it had a population of 218,523. - Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper. - The Austro-Prussian War or Seven Weeks' War (also known as the Unification War, PrussianGerman War, German Civil War, War of 1866, Brothers War, or Fraternal War, and in Germany as the German War) was a war fought in 1866 between the German Confederation under the leadership of the Austrian Empire and its German allies on one side and the Kingdom of Prussia with its German allies on the other, that resulted in Prussian dominance over the German states. This conflict also paralleled the Third Independence War of Italian unification. - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947. - The Margraviate of Brandenburg was a major principality of the Holy Roman Empire from 1157 to 1806. Also known as the March of Brandenburg (\\"), it played a pivotal role in the history of Germany and Central Europe. - Germany is a federal republic consisting of sixteen federal states (plural \\"Länder\\"; informally also \\"Bundesland\\", plural \\"Bundesländer\\"). Since today's Germany was formed from an earlier collection of several states, it has a federal constitution, and the constituent states retain a measure of sovereignty. With an emphasis on geographical conditions, Berlin and Hamburg are frequently called ' (city-states), as is the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, which in fact includes the cities of and . The remaining 13 states are called ' (literally: area states). - The Austrian Empire (modern spelling \\"\\") was an empire in Central Europe created out of the realms of the Habsburgs by proclamation in 1804. It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's great powers. Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]). It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the German Confederation. Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The \\"Ausgleich\\" of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. - Schleswig-Holstein is the northernmost of the 16 states of Germany, comprising most of the historical duchy of Holstein and the southern part of the former Duchy of Schleswig. Its capital city is Kiel; other notable cities are Lübeck and Flensburg. - Austria-Hungary, often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire in English-language sources, was a constitutional union of the Austrian Empire (the Kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council, or \\"Cisleithania\\") and the Kingdom of Hungary (Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen or \\"Transleithania\\") that existed from 1867 to 1918, when it collapsed as a result of defeat in World War I. The union was a result of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and came into existence on 30 March 1867. Austria-Hungary consisted of two monarchies (Austria and Hungary), and one autonomous region: the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown, which negotiated the CroatianHungarian Settlement (\\"Nagodba\\") in 1868. It was ruled by the House of Habsburg, and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states were co-equal. Foreign affairs and the military came under joint oversight, but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states. - Weimar Republic is an unofficial, historical designation for the German state between 1919 and 1933. The name derives from the city of Weimar, where its constitutional assembly first took place. The official name of the state was still \\"Deutsches Reich\\"; it had remained unchanged since 1871. In English the country was usually known simply as Germany. A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the \\"Deutsches Reich\\" was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries both left- and right-wing); and contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. However, the Weimar Republic government successfully reformed the currency, unified tax policies, and organized the railway system. Weimar Germany eliminated most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles; it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Deutsches Reich was the official name for the German nation state from 1871 to 1943 in the German language. It translates literally to \\"German Empire\\", with a context approximating that of \\"German Realm\\". From 1943 to 1945, the official name was but not formally proclaimed Großdeutsches Reich (\\"Great German Reich\\") on account of the new territories annexed into the state's administration during the Second World War. - The Holy Roman Empire was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806. The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany, though it also came to include the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Burgundy, the Kingdom of Italy, and numerous other territories. - The Province of Schleswig - Holstein ( German : Provinz Schleswig - Holstein , pronounced ( lesvç hltan ) ) was a province of the Kingdom of Prussia and the Free State of Prussia from 1868 to 1946 . It was created from the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein , which had been conquered by Prussia and the Austrian Empire from Denmark in the Second War of Schleswig in 1864 . Following the Austro - Prussian War in 1866 , which ended in Austrian defeat , Schleswig and Holstein were annexed by Prussia . The province was created in 1868 and also included the Duchy of Lauenburg since 1876 . Following the defeat of Imperial Germany in World War I , the Allied powers organised two plebiscites in Northern and Central Schleswig on 10 February and 14 March 1920 , respectively . In Northern Schleswig 75 % voted for reunification with Denmark and 25 % for staying with Germany . In Central Schleswig the situation was reversed with 80 % voting for Germany and 20 % for Denmark . No vote ever took place in the southern third of Schleswig , as it was considered a foregone conclusion that almost all the inhabitants would vote to remain in Germany . On 15 June 1920 , Northern Schleswig was officially reunited with Denmark ( see : South Jutland County ) . The remainder of Schleswig remained part of Schleswig - Holstein , now a province of the Free State of Prussia . With the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937 , the Hanseatic City of Lübeck and the Oldenburgian exclave Region of Lübeck were incorporated into the Schleswig - Holstein province , while a number of Hamburg 's adjacent municipalities , among them the city districts of Altona and Wandsbek , were incorporated into the Hanseatic City of Hamburg . This again ceded its exclaves of Geesthacht and Großhansdorf to Schleswig - Holstein . After World War II , Schleswig - Holstein was part of the British occupation zone , although some municipalities of Schleswig - Holstein east of Ratzeburg were exchanged for municipalities of Mecklenburg in the Soviet occupation zone ( Barber Lyashchenko... - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south. - The Free State of Prussia was a German state formed after the abolition of the Kingdom of Prussia in the aftermath of the First World War. It was the major state of the German Reich during the time of the Weimar Republic, comprising almost (62.5%) of its territory and population. \\"Free state\\" is another German term for \\"republic\\" that was coined in contrast to the Latin word, which was associated with the enemy France in the minds of many Germans of that time. - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark. - Italian unification, or the Risorgimento (meaning \\"resurgence\\" or \\"revival\\"), was the political and social movement that consolidated different states of the Italian peninsula into the single state of the Kingdom of Italy in the 19th century. The process began in 1815 with the Congress of Vienna and was completed in 1871 when Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. The memory of the Risorgimento is central to both Italian politics and Italian historiography, for this short period (181560) is one of the most contested and controversial in modern Italian history. Italian nationalism was based among intellectuals and political activists, often operating from exile. - Holstein (Northern Low Saxon: \\"Holsteen\\", , Latin and historical ) is the region between the rivers Elbe and Eider. It is the southern half of Schleswig-Holstein, the northernmost state of Germany. - Brandenburg (Lower Sorbian: \\"Bramborska\\") is one of the sixteen federated states of Germany. It lies in the northeast of the country covering an area of 29,478 square kilometers and has 2.48 million inhabitants. The capital and largest city is Potsdam. Brandenburg surrounds but does not include the national capital and city-state Berlin forming a metropolitan area. - Kiel is the capital and most populous city in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein, with a population of 240,832 (June 2014). - The Kingdom of Prussia was a German kingdom that constituted the state of Prussia between 1701 and 1918 and included parts of present-day Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic. It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin. - The German Confederation was an association of 39 German states in Central Europe, created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to coordinate the economies of separate German-speaking countries and to replace the former Holy Roman Empire. Most historians have judged the Confederation to have been weak and ineffective, as well as an obstacle to the creation of a German nation-state. It collapsed due to the rivalry between Prussia and Austria, warfare, the 1848 revolution, and the inability of the multiple members to compromise. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate.

At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - The unification of Germany into a politically and administratively integrated nation state officially occurred on 18 January 1871 in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles in France. Princes of the German states gathered there to proclaim Wilhelm I of Prussia as German Emperor after the French capitulation in the Franco-Prussian War. Unofficially, the \\"de facto\\" transition of most of the German-speaking populations into a federated organization of states had been developing for some time through alliances formal and informal between princely rulersbut in fits and starts; self-interests of the various parties hampered the process over nearly a century of autocratic experimentation, beginning in the era of the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire (1806), and the subsequent rise of German nationalism. - Zealand is the largest (7,031 km) and most populated island in Denmark with a population of 2,267,659 (39% of Denmark's total as of January 2016).

New York (CNN) -- He didn't compete for the hot dog eating title this year, but he did cause a scene at the contest. Takeru Kobayashi was arrested at Coney Island after his rival, Joey Chestnut, won the annual Nathan's International Hot Dog Eating Contest. The six-time champion of the contest was trying to make his way on stage after this year's event, according to a representative for Kobayashi and a New York police officer at the Brooklyn precinct booking desk. The incident was not a publicity stunt, Maggie James, Kobayashi's spokeswoman, said Sunday night. \\"He got excited when people chanted his name after the contest .... so he jumped up on the stage because he wanted his fans to see him and (he thought) maybe they would chant, 'Let him eat,'\\" James said, referring to a dispute that kept Kobayashi from the table this year. Kobayashi -- who took home the title every year from 2001 to 2006 -- did not compete because of a contract dispute with Major League Eating. He watched from the stands. Chestnut won by consuming 54 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes. The win -- Chestnut's fourth straight -- was short of his 68-hot dog record set last year. A statement from the New York Police Department's public affairs office following the arrest said Kobayashi was charged with two misdemeanors and one violation, with the violation considered a low-level charge similar to a traffic violation. The two misdemeanors were resisting arrest and obstructing government administration (specifically, interfering with police). The violation was trespassing. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. Who did compete at the hot dog eating contest this year? 2. Who was the winner of the constest? 3. How many times has Takeru Kobayashi won the event? 4. Why did he jump on stage? 5. What did the New York Police Department say he was charged with? 6.

Premise: \\"The Voth stared out at the packs of marauders racing through the ruins of the village.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The Voth saw people running in the village.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"The Voth stared out at the packs of marauders racing through the ruins of the village,\\" we can infer certain facts that would help us evaluate the hypothesis, \\"The Voth saw people running in the village.\\" Let's break down the elements of the premise and explore each detail individually. 1. The Voth: This element refers to the subject, \\"The Voth,\\" who is observing the events. It may or may not be a person, as the term \\"Voth\\" is not specified, but making this distinction is not critical for the purpose of evaluating the hypothesis. 2. Stared out: This implies that The Voth is attentively observing the events unfolding in front of them. It suggests that they have a clear view of the scene and are focused on the actions taking place. 3. Packs of marauders: This phrase refers to groups of people involved in hostile activities. The term \\"marauders\\" often denotes individuals who pillage, loot, or plunder, and the use of the word \\"packs\\" indicates several groups of such individuals. 4. Racing through the ruins: The marauders are described as moving rapidly or hurriedly through the ruins, suggesting that they are either pursuing something, fleeing from something, or actively engaged in destructive acts. 5. The ruins of the village: This final element provides context for the setting, clarifying that the events are unfolding in a village that has been devastated or destroyed. Given these details, let's now assess the hypothesis, \\"The Voth saw people running in the village.\\" In the premise, we know that The Voth is observing packs of marauders who are \\"racing through the ruins of the village.\\" The marauders, being people engaged in hostile activities, are running or moving rapidly. This corresponds with the key elements of the hypothesis, which involves seeing people running in the village. However, the hypothesis slightly differs from the premise in terms of the context of the village. The hypothesis describes a general village, whereas the premise specifically states that it is a ruined village. Despite this variation, the hypothesis still holds true because it covers the primary actions of the people – running in the village. In conclusion, based on the premise, \\"The Voth stared out at the packs of marauders racing through the ruins of the village,\\" the hypothesis \\"The Voth saw people running in the village\\" is true. This is because the elements in the premise, such as The Voth's attentive observation and the packs of marauders racing, support the assertion that The Voth witnessed people (in this case, marauders) running within the village. However, it is worth noting the subtle difference in the context of the village, as the premise specifically mentions the ruins of the village while the hypothesis refers to a general village setting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve -287*b + 85*b - 14*b + 2592 = 0 for b.","completion":"To solve -287*b + 85*b - 14*b + 2592 = 0 for b, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. We have three terms involving the variable b: -287*b, 85*b, and -14*b. Combine these terms by adding up their coefficients: -287 + 85 - 14 = -216. So the equation becomes: -216*b + 2592 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable b. To isolate b, we want to get b alone on one side of the equation. To do this, add 216*b to both sides of the equation: -216*b + 216*b + 2592 = 216*b + 0. This simplifies to: 2592 = 216*b. Step 3: Solve for b. Now that we have isolated b, we can solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 216: 2592/216 = 216*b/216.

Sentence 1 implies that one should not hurry into a certain situation or act impulsively just for the sake of doing something (i.e., \\"to burn powder\\"). Sentence 2 states that burning powder is negative due to its high cost. Step 2: Determine whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Entailment means that if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence must also be true. In this case, if the meaning of the first sentence implies the meaning of the second sentence, there is entailment. Step 3: Compare the meanings of both sentences. The information provided in Sentence 1 does not directly address the cost of burning powder. It focuses on the idea of not rushing into something or acting impulsively. Sentence 2, on the other hand, emphasizes the negative financial aspect of burning powder. Step 4: Make a final decision on whether there is entailment between the two sentences.

A: A:","completion":"Plants move enormous amounts of water from the soil to the atmosphere through the process of transpiration. Transpiration is the process by which moisture is transported from a plant's roots through its vascular tissues (xylem) to the leaves, where it evaporates into the atmosphere through tiny pores known as stomata. Transpiration serves several vital functions for plants, including: 1. Cooling: As water evaporates from the leaf's surface, it helps to dissipate excess heat and maintain a stable temperature within the plant. This is especially important during hot, sunny days when the risk of overheating is high. 2. Nutrient Transport: As water moves through the plant's vascular system, it carries essential nutrients absorbed from the soil to different parts of the plant. These nutrients are crucial for plant growth, development, and overall health. 3. Maintenance of Turgor Pressure: Turgor pressure is the force exerted by the water inside a plant's cells against the cell walls. This pressure maintains the structural integrity of the plant, keeping it upright and rigid. Transpiration continuously moves water from the roots to the leaves, helping maintain this essential internal pressure. 4. Draw Water from the Roots: Transpiration creates a negative pressure (suction) within the xylem that pulls water upward from the roots to the canopy. This movement is aided by cohesion (the attraction of water molecules to each other) and adhesion (the attraction of water molecules to the walls of the xylem). The rate of transpiration is influenced by several factors, such as: 1. Light: Increased light intensity usually leads to a higher rate of transpiration, as stomata open wider to facilitate photosynthesis in response to bright conditions. 2. Temperature: Warmer temperatures cause water to evaporate more quickly, increasing the rate of transpiration. Cooler temperatures slow down the process. 3. Humidity: High humidity decreases the rate of transpiration, as there is less potential for the surrounding air to absorb additional moisture. Low humidity, on the other hand, accelerates the process. 4. Wind: Wind increases transpiration by removing the moisture-laden air near the leaf's surface, allowing for more evaporation. In calm conditions, a layer of saturated air may form around the leaf, slowing down transpiration. 5. Soil Moisture: Adequate soil moisture is essential for optimal transpiration rates. When the soil is too dry, plants may close their stomata to conserve moisture, reducing transpiration. In summary, transpiration is the key mechanism by which plants move vast amounts of water from the soil to the atmosphere. This process enables plants to maintain their internal temperature, transport nutrients, support their structure, and draw water from the roots. Various environmental factors, including light, temperature, humidity, wind, and soil moisture, influence the rate of transpiration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: One sign of a toxic parent-child relationship is if your parents do not acknowledge your accomplishments in appropriate ways. This could mean that your parents either refuse to acknowledge when you accomplish something, or that your parents dismiss your accomplishments. Some parents may even ridicule your accomplishments. For example, if you get a good grade on a test, your parents should congratulate you for this accomplishment. If your parents are toxic, then they might ignore what you said, change the subject, make fun of you for being a nerd, or say something like, “So what? It’s just a test.” It is normal for parents to want to guide you, but parents who try to control your behavior may be toxic. This may range from small decisions like what to wear to school to larger decisions like where to go to college or what to major in. If you think that your parents exert a high amount of control over your decisions, then they may be toxic. For example, a parent who encourages you to make your own decisions might ask you questions about where you want to go to college and why; however, a parent who is exerting control over your decisions might tell you where you are going to attend college. Parents who have healthy relationships with their children show their emotional bond by making eye contact with their children, smiling at them, and offering affection in the form of hugs. If your parents have toxic behaviors, then they might not do any of these things. For example, a parent who shows appropriate emotional connection with his child might comfort her if she is crying; however, a parent who lacks an emotional connection with his child might ignore the child or yell at her to stop crying. Healthy boundaries are important in parent-child relationships. If you have good boundaries with your parent, then you should not feel like your lives are one and the same. For example, a parent who has healthy boundaries with her child might ask how her child's friends are doing, but would not insist on hanging out with her child and his friends. Verbal abuse is another form of toxic parenting. If your mother or father call you names, put you down, or just say things to hurt your feelings, then these are all forms of verbal abuse. For example, your parents should say things to build you up and make you feel good about yourself; however, you would feel bad if your parent said something like, “You’re worthless!” or, “I can’t stand to be in the same room with you!” Some parents will be kind and reassuring one day and then mean and critical the next day. But keep in mind that this is still verbal abuse, even if your parents are not always cruel to you. Parents who are too focused on themselves to notice their children or to treat them properly can also be toxic. If your parents ignore you completely or only acknowledge you when you are doing something that they can brag about to friends, then this is an example of narcissistic parenting and it is toxic. For example, your parents should encourage you in your interests. A narcissistic parent, however, might only pay attention to you if your interests give him something to brag about, such as by telling all of his friends that you won a scholarship, even though he never asks about your studies or encourages you. Some narcissistic parents may have a personality disorder (PD). A person with PD displays self-centeredness, refusal to accept personal responsibility, constant self-justification, a strong sense of entitlement, and shallow emotions. A parent with PD might treat children like a burden or roadblock to her own personal goals. She will typically rely on emotional manipulation to control her kids. People with PD are often hypercritical of their children and can be physically abusive or prone to endangering their child’s welfare. Some parents are too immature or have other problems (such as addiction) that make it hard for them to be effective parents, so a child ends up taking on some parenting duties. Consider whether you had to take on any parenting roles because your parent was not able or willing to care for you and/or your siblings. These may include things like cooking, cleaning, and caring for other children. Sometimes parents assign cooking and cleaning chores to teach children responsibility, but toxic parents may heap many responsibilities on one child to avoid having to do these things themselves. For example, a toxic parent who does not want to cook or clean may shirk these responsibilities and force one of his children to do all of the cooking and cleaning instead. Some children feel unloved even though their parents say that they love them regularly, because they don’t see this love reflected in how they are treated. Make sure you aren’t assuming you know how your parents feel about you without good reason. For example, a parent who regularly says “I love you,” but who often ignores her children is not behaving in a way that shows love. Likewise, a parent who says that she wants her children to be independent, but never allows them to make any decisions is not behaving in a way that demonstrates what she says she wants.","completion":"The article discusses various signs of a toxic parent-child relationship and highlights the importance of healthy boundaries, love, and support in fostering positive relationships. Some major indicators of toxic parenting include: 1. Lack of acknowledgement for accomplishments: Toxic parents may refuse to acknowledge, dismiss, or even ridicule their child's achievements. This can undermine the child's self-esteem and sense of self-worth. 2. Control over behavior: Excessive control over a child's decisions, ranging from clothing choices to college and major selection, may indicate toxic parenting. Healthy parenting involves guiding and encouraging children to make their own decisions. 3. Inadequate emotional connection: Toxic parents may not engage in healthy forms of emotional bonding such as making eye contact, smiling, and offering affection through hugs, which are essential for a child's emotional well-being. 4. Poor boundaries: Enmeshed relationships with limited independence or boundaries may be a sign of unhealthy parenting. Clear and healthy boundaries involve respecting a child's personal space, autonomy, and privacy. 5. Verbal abuse: Name-calling, putting down, or saying hurtful things to a child are forms of verbal abuse. Even if such negative behavior is not constant, it is still harmful to the child's emotional health. 6. Narcissistic parenting: Parents who are overly focused on themselves and only acknowledge their child when it benefits them may be considered narcissistic and toxic. Such parents might also display traits of personality disorders, including self-centeredness, refusal to accept personal responsibility, and shallow emotions. 7. Imposing parenting duties on children: Toxic parents may force their children to take on significant household responsibilities or caregiving roles due to their own immaturity, addiction, or other issues. While teaching responsibility is important, overburdening a child with such duties can cause undue stress and negatively impact their development. 8. Misaligned verbal expressions of love: If a parent's words do not align with their actions, it may result in confusion and feelings of being unloved. Properly demonstrating love and care is crucial to fostering a healthy parent-child relationship. In conclusion, recognizing and addressing toxic behaviors in parent-child relationships is crucial for fostering a healthy and supportive environment for children to develop and thrive. By promoting positive communication, establishing healthy boundaries, and offering genuine love and affection, parents can pave the way for their child's emotional well-being and success in life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"In the film Hamburger Hill, Sergeant Adam Frantz, played by Dylan McDermott, is wounded during one of the many combat sequences that take place throughout the movie. The film is set during the Vietnam War, and the 3rd Squad, 1st Platoon from the 101st Airborne Division is portrayed as they experience the various challenges of war, both on a personal and professional level. Although the specific detail of what exactly wounds Sgt. Frantz is not explicitly mentioned in the given movie plot synopsis, it can be inferred that it may have been caused by enemy fire, shrapnel, or an explosive during one of the battles. Considering the 1969 setting, the A Shau Valley, and the combative nature of the movie, there are numerous instances where he and other members of his squad could have faced injury. Hamburger Hill is historically based on the Battle of Hamburger Hill (formally known as Hill 937), which was fought by American and South Vietnamese forces against the North Vietnamese Army in May 1969. This battle was known for its ferocious fighting, high casualty rates, and the controversial decision to repeatedly storm a heavily fortified, strategically insignificant position. Wounds and injuries were a common part of the reality for soldiers during the Vietnam War, and the film aims to capture this reality in its portrayal of intense combat scenarios. The soldiers are shown facing numerous hardships, both physical and emotional, which are meant to give the audience an understanding of the struggles that service members went through during this period. To summarize, Sgt. Adam Frantz is wounded at some point in the film Hamburger Hill likely due to enemy fire, shrapnel, or an explosive amidst the numerous combat scenes shown. The movie attempts to portray the harsh reality of the Vietnam War, focusing on the daily challenges and hardships faced by soldiers on the ground."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device Stuart Hogg's long-range penalty put the hosts ahead before Finn Russell finished off heavy pressure to score. Replacement Matt Scott touched down the second for a 15-0 lead, with Italy's Carlo Canna missing three penalties. The Azzurri botched two scoring chances before further tries from Tim Visser and Tommy Seymour sealed a bonus point. Four tries brought Scotland's tally for the championship to 14, surpassing their record, set last year, of 11 for a Six Nations campaign. Despite their three victories, the Scots had to settle for a repeat of last year's fourth-place finish, on points difference, after victories for France against Wales, and Ireland over England. This was a 12th Six Nations defeat in a row for Italy, who finished with the Wooden Spoon for a 12th time in 18 seasons. In the Edinburgh rain, mistakes were inevitable but the opening half was an error and penalty-fest, a grind that Scotland slowly but surely took control of. Italy were a creative desert, a line-out horror-show, a goal-kicking nightmare. They lost four of eight line-outs in the first 40 minutes and missed three out of three kicks at goal. Two of those were straightforward, but Canna made a hash of both. Scotland were ahead with a booming Hogg penalty, but the hosts had serious problems of their own despite having the lead. Referee Pascal Gauzere got on their case early and he kept pinging them all day long. The Scots conceded five penalties in the opening 20 minutes, seven in the first 40 and a stratospheric 12 by the early minutes of the second half. Of course, they also had a healthy lead by then. The first came at the end of mountainous pressure, Ali Price eventually put Russell over in the corner. The downside was that they lost Huw Jones to injury in the creation of the score, Scott replacing him. Unlike poor Canna, Russell's kick was good and Scotland were ahead 10-0. Canna missed a second sitter and, soon after, Scotland had a second try when Price chipped over the top close to the Italian line for Hogg to win the aerial dual against Giovanbattista Venditti and bat the ball back into Scott's path. The centre had the easiest job in dotting it down. Scotland had battled their way into the lead with the knowledge that Italy's second-half performances have been a calamity in this Six Nations. Before this game they conceded 70% of their points in the second half and an average of 20 points in the last 20 minutes of the second half. It was Italy who came back strong, though. They camped themselves in the Scottish 22, forced Hogg into making a try-saver on Angelo Esposito, then went again. They won penalty after penalty. John Barclay disappeared to the bin and they won more penalties after that. When it looked like they were about to break through, Edoardo Padovani knocked on with the line at his mercy. It was painful stuff for the visitors. They were undone by Scotland's defence, yes, but mostly by their own lack of wit. Italy had a chronic lack of imagination and accuracy. Just after the hour, Scotland got their third try when Hogg scampered up the left wing, chipped ahead and Visser got the touchdown. Russell's conversion made it 22-0. For them, it was all about the four-try bonus point now. Media playback is not supported on this device Scotland started to hit their stride and the crucial fourth try came after multiple phases drained the life out of the tiring Italians, Russell's lovely hands finding Hogg who put Seymour over. Once again Russell, kicking beautifully, was successful with the conversion. Job done for Scotland. A third win in a championship that has seen them score more points (122) and more tries than they have ever done in the Six Nations. A decent farewell to Cotter, a man who has done so much to take the Scots from despair to hope.

Please answer the following question: Since grade school we have known about the food pyramid, but the food pyramid I want to discuss today is quite different: The Mediterranean Food Pyramid. The pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously. The pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed. The pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region. One of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways. They are among the minority of the world’s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic. There are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) – plus a little red wine. Your fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily. Fish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals. Fruit and vegetables (7 servings) should be consumed daily. Question: What issue is the author trying to address by promoting the Mediterranean diet? Options: A. Fast food culture B. consumption of dairy is too high C. Obesity epidemic D. not enough information === The correct answer is A:","completion":"Fast food culture"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Man Hunt Movie plot: On July 29, 1939, renowned British big game hunter Captain Alan Thorndike (Walter Pidgeon) slips through the forest undetected near the Berghof, Adolf Hitler's residence near Berchtesgaden. Getting the dictator in his telescopic sight, he pulls the trigger on his unloaded rifle and gives a wave. He ponders a moment, then loads a live round, but is discovered at the last second by a guard, and the shot goes wild.After being beaten up, Thorndike is taken to Major Quive-Smith (George Sanders). Quive-Smith is also a devoted hunter and an admirer of Thorndike. Thorndike explains that it was a \\"sporting stalk\\", not to kill, but just for the thrill of going after the biggest game of all. The Nazi half-believes him, but insists he sign a confession that he was in fact working for His Majesty's government. When Thorndike refuses, he is tortured, but remains steadfast and warns of \\"questions being asked in high places\\" if he is killed, as his brother, Lord Risborough (Frederick Worlock), is a very important diplomat. The phrase gives Quive-Smith the idea to have Thorndike thrown off a cliff to make his death look like an accident.Thorndike survives when his knapsack gets caught in a tree, breaking his fall. He eludes his German pursuers and reaches a port. He steals a rowboat, but is forced to abandon it hastily when a patrol boat comes near. He swims to a Danish ship about to sail for London. Vaner (Roddy McDowall), the English cabin boy, helps Thorndike hide. The Germans find Thorndike's coat and passport aboard the rowboat and search the nearby ship. Though they find nothing, they place agent Mr. Jones (John Carradine) on board using Thorndike's passport to continue looking even after the ship leaves the harbor.Jones is met by German agents in London.

Bye guys. - Canada’s eleventh province: Turks and Caicos? http://t.co/5xZQ3DrhzK via @torontostarAmira de Vera ||||| The head of the Turks and Caicos Islands says the country remains open to the long-simmering notion of joining Canada, which is backed by one Canadian premier but dismissed by the federal government. Turks and Caicos Premier Rufus Ewing led a delegation to Ottawa on Monday, meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper and other officials during a trip aimed at boosting ties between the countries. However, the Caribbean nation – a collection of 40 mostly uninhabited islands and roughly 35,000 people – has been the subject of annexation talk, a possible 11th province or fourth territory, for nearly a century. The subject came up again on Monday. Story continues below advertisement Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall offered to welcome Turks and Caicos to his province. He later said the offer was partially tongue-in-cheek – \\"Saskatchewarm,\\" he coined it. \\"I think we want to be constructive in Saskatchewan. If the Prime Minister's looking for a way to make this happen and doesn't want to go through the challenge of creating a province or territory, and Turks and Caicos want to make this happen, just, you know, we'd like a tropical island,\\" Mr. Wall said in an interview. Asked how that could legally work, he replied: \\"I don't know, but if there was a hope we'd put a great group on it and find out.\\" The notion of the island nation somehow joining Canada dates back at least as far as 1917 and has the backing of one Conservative backbencher, Peter Goldring. He bristles at the notion of annexation but favours boosted economic ties and, if both countries' populations agree, a union of some kind. The island leader's trip was focused on trade, however. While not ruling out a place in Canada, he said it was not imminent. \\"I'm not closing the door completely. It is not of my mandate to close the door … What I'll say is on the radar is some kind of relationship. I can't say what kind of relationship it will be,\\" Dr. Ewing, a surgeon by trade who now serves as his country's premier and tourism minister, told reporters. Canadians pining for tropical turf can take some solace, however – his trip was aimed at further greasing the wheels for Canadians to travel to and do business in Turks and Caicos, with Dr. Ewing saying he was seeking \\"relaxation of immigration issues\\" to the point of \\"seamless\\" borders. The Conservative government, however, was firmly rejecting any suggestion of welcoming Turks and Caicos into the Canadian fold. \\"We're not in the business of annexing islands in the Caribbean to be part of Canada. So that's not something that we're exploring. We're not looking at any sort of formal association with the islands,\\" Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird said. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement That will come as little surprise to Mr. Wall. He has never been to Turks and Caicos, and Dr. Ewing has never been to Saskatchewan. Mr. Wall said he recalls hearing talk about the Turks and Caicos joining Canada as long as he's been in politics. \\"I think people smile when they talk about it,\\" he said, \\"and probably think it'll never happen.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The Premier of Turks and Caicos Islands, Rufus Ewing, met with Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, in Ottawa to discuss the possibility of exploring a more formal relationship.

Consequently, Joseph had a large social circle, which allowed him to form connections with many different people. In contrast, Joel struggled with building friendships, limiting the size of his social circle. It was evident that being a part of a large social circle brought a lot of benefits for Joseph. He was quite adept at meeting new people, engaging in conversations, and creating meaningful bonds. This skill allowed him to have a diverse and supportive network who would often provide various opportunities and resources, bringing substantial positive impact on both his personal and professional life. In addition, Joseph's extensive network enabled him to broaden his perspectives as he became exposed to different viewpoints and experiences from the people he interacted with. On the other hand, Joel's journey with friendship building was not as smooth. He had a hard time initiating conversations, maintaining them, and being at ease in the presence of others, which resulted in his smaller social circle. Although Joel occasionally managed to establish deep connections with those he befriended, he primarily relied on a select few friends who acted as his safety net. This limited his exposure to the different experiences that a more extensive social network would have provided. As time went by, Joel became more aware of his struggles with making friends. This awareness drove him to be more intentional and proactive about improving his social skills. In this journey of self-improvement, he took the time to observe and learn from Joseph's interaction with people. Joel slowly practiced initiating conversations, listening actively, and expressing empathy, which gradually resulted in the expansion of his social circle. While Joseph's large social circle encompassed a variety of people from different walks of life, giving him access to diverse perspectives and opportunities, Joel's limited social circle offered him fewer opportunities for growth and learning. However, as Joel worked on his social skills, he managed to broaden his network and started developing more meaningful connections with others.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota.

It also aims to change the existing visa lottery system into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Given that Gene Hamilton is likely to align with the Republican party's stance on this issue, he would support a strong and secure border coupled with a more humane approach towards families entering the United States illegally.

He notes that radiation type A has the ability to break away atoms from molecules, while radiation type B simply causes them to vibrate. and a hint : Gamma rays, X-rays and the higher energy range of ultraviolet light constitute the ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word \\"ionize\\" refers to the breaking of one or more electrons away from an atom, an action that requires the relatively high energies that these electromagnetic waves supply. Further down the spectrum, the non-ionizing lower energies of the lower ultraviolet spectrum cannot ionize atoms, but can disrupt the inter-atomic bonds which form molecules, thereby breaking down molecules rather than atoms; a good example of this is sunburn caused by long-wavelength solar ultraviolet. The waves of longer wavelength than UV in visible light, infrared and microwave frequencies cannot break bonds but can cause vibrations in the bonds which are sensed as heat. Radio wavelengths and below generally are not regarded as harmful to biological systems. These are not sharp delineations of the energies; there is some overlap in the effects of specific frequencies.The word radiation arises from the phenomenon of waves radiating (i.e., traveling outward in all directions) from a source. This aspect leads to a system of measurements and physical units that are applicable to all types of radiation. Because such radiation expands as it passes through space, and as its energy is conserved (in vacuum), the intensity of all types of radiation from a point source follows an inverse-square law in relation to the distance from its source. Like any ideal law, the inverse-square law approximates a measured radiation intensity to the extent that the source approximates a geometric point.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Complete the following sentence. Joel asked Robert how long will the flight be before they arrive, because","completion":"Joel asked Robert how long will the flight be before they arrive, because he wanted to ensure that he had enough time to engage in various activities and prepare himself both mentally and physically for their upcoming destination. Joel knew that long flights could sometimes be exhausting and disorienting, particularly due to the jet lag that often accompanied journeys across multiple time zones. Therefore, by obtaining an accurate estimate of the flight duration from Robert, who had booked the tickets and was likely familiar with the details, Joel aimed to optimize his in-flight experience as well as enhance his overall travel plans. Firstly, knowing the flight duration would allow Joel to anticipate how much sleep to get beforehand or during the flight to minimize the effects of jet lag. Research has shown that adjusting one's sleep schedule to adapt to the destination's time zone can considerably alleviate jet lag symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, and irritability. Moreover, having information about the flight duration would enable Joel to plan any in-flight entertainment or productive activities he wanted to pursue. Many travelers use long flights as an opportunity to catch up on books, movies, or personal projects. By understanding how long he would be in the air, Joel could allocate the most suitable activities for the available time, ensuring that he could balance both relaxation and productivity. Additionally, knowing how long the flight would be would allow Joel to plan when to do some light exercise during the journey. It is crucial to maintain proper blood circulation during long flights to prevent the risk of blood clots or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). By being aware of the flight duration, Joel could stretch, walk around the cabin, or perform some seated exercises at suitable intervals to maintain his health and well-being. Furthermore, understanding the flight duration would help Joel prepare mentally for the trip. An accurate expectation of the time spent aboard the aircraft could reduce anxiety or stress that might arise from being in a confined space for an extended period. Proper mental preparation would result in a more enjoyable experience and alleviate any worries about the impending journey. Lastly, this information would assist Joel in making preparations for his arrival, such as arranging transportation or local accommodations at the destination. Knowing the flight duration would give a clearer sense of when he would be landing at their destination, factoring in any layovers or time zone differences.

Maybe. But those fears don't even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider--and that is the death of one's own child. \\"Pet Sematary\\" taps this base, primal adult fear, and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore. I've read comments about this film that include poor acting, characters making stupid decisions, etc. I disagree. The acting is actually first rate for a film like this. Maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario. But the film's events are not only logical, they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible. This is the true horror of \\"Pet Sematary\\": It isn't that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels, it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that Louis Creed does.

A:","completion":"The right answer to the question \\"what are clouds formed from?\\" is not \\"oxygen.\\" Clouds are primarily formed from water vapor, tiny water droplets, or ice crystals, depending on the temperature and conditions in the atmosphere. Water vapor comes from the Earth's surface through the process of evaporation, where water is converted from liquid to vapor form. As warm, moist air rises, it cools and the water vapor condenses on tiny particles, such as dust or smoke, suspended in the atmosphere. These tiny particles are called cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). If the water droplets or ice crystals grow large enough, they may eventually form visible clouds in the sky. Although oxygen is present in the atmosphere, it does not play a direct role in cloud formation. However, it is a component of water (H2O) - two hydrogen atoms bonded with one oxygen atom.

How do you do this: How can I keep fitted sheets from sliding off the mattress?","completion":"To keep fitted sheets from sliding off the mattress, you can try these steps: 1. Make sure you've got the right size sheet: Check if the fitted sheet is the correct size for your mattress. If it's too small or too big, it might slide off easily. 2. Properly secure the corners: When putting the sheet on your bed, grab each corner of the sheet, with the elastic part going under the mattress. Start with one corner, then stretch it over the opposite corner, and repeat it with the other two corners. 3. Tuck in the sides: Once the corners are secured, make sure to tuck the sides of the sheet under the mattress. This helps create a tight and smooth surface. 4. Use sheet suspenders: These are like little straps that connect the sheet corners underneath the mattress. You can find them online or in stores. They help keep the sheet in place by pulling it tight. Just attach the clips to the corners of the sheet and adjust the length of the suspenders to create tension. 5. Opt for sheets with extra-deep pockets: Some fitted sheets have deeper pockets, which means they can cover the sides of the mattress better. Look for sheets designed for your mattress' thickness and make sure the elastic is strong enough to hold tight onto the mattress. By following these tips, your fitted sheets should stay on your mattress without sliding off."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How are America's CEOs doing right now? Here's a report, based on a clutch of recent studies by research and consulting firms. To start with, CEOs' job security has gotten a little better, even if that of the people under them may not have. According to numbers from Booz & Co., 13.8% of the nation's CEOs were replaced in 2007, and 14.4% in 2008, but so far this year, through May, that figure is on track to decline to 12.1% When they leave their jobs, they're doing so for pretty much the same reasons as before, Booz finds. Roughly half of departures are planned by the CEOs, and about a third are forced. The rest are driven by mergers and acquisitions--though that last fraction was down modestly last year from 2007, and the first two were correspondingly up. When CEOs leave or are kicked out, their companies are looking for replacements with more experience than ever. That means new CEOs are older than they used to be. The average age of new chief executives today is just shy of 53, which is almost two years older than the starting age of the CEOs they're replacing. The average age of departing CEOs is at record highs for this decade. Fewer of those new CEOs are also serving as chairman, though, Booz found. In North America, where combining those titles is most common, only 18% of new CEOs started with both jobs last year. That is down from around 25% the previous two years, and way down from the historical average of just below 40%. On the other hand, the phenomenon known as \\"CEO apprenticing\\" has been on the rise. That's where the old CEO stays on as chairman to help out the new CEO. In North America the rate of apprenticing for new CEOs stands at around 65%, almost double the historical average of 35%. Those numbers also come from Booz. Companies are thinking twice about how they hire their new CEOs too. A recent survey by WorldatWork found that 44% of companies had reviewed their change-in-control policies in the previous 12 months. In 2003, only 27% had. Some 62% of companies had reviewed their severance practices in the previous 12 months, up from 39% in 2007. How are today's bosses doing in terms of compensation? Equilar's CEO Pay Strategies Report for 2009 looked at the CEOs of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index and found that their total compensation fell 7.5% between 2007 and 2008. That was the first drop since 2002. A very big part of it: Their average bonus shrank from 1.6 million to 1.2 over those six years. The early bird got the worm, Equilar also found. Bonuses for fiscal years that ended in June or August 2008 were actually up from a year before; bonuses awarded in December 2008 and January 2009--once the severity of the economic slump was fully obvious--were down 28.8%. Also, very few CEOs are able to gross up these days, according to WorldatWork. Grossing up is getting your pay increased to make up for rising taxes. WorldatWork's Severance Survey 2009 found that only 6% of companies had grossed up any executives in the previous six months to cover the burden of the new Golden Parachute Excise Tax. Only 15% were even considering it. CEOs did get to keep some perks, though. Equilar found that in 2008, Fortune 100 companies spent an average of 28.9% more on their CEOs' aircraft than in 2007--141,477, the most in five years. And the portion of those companies that let the boss make personal use of the plane increased from 74.7% in 2007 to 79.2% in 2008. Corporate aircraft are clearly far from a dying institution, despite all the bad press they've gotten lately. Not that CEOs aren't being made to earn what they're given. Equilar lined up CEO pay at S&P 500 companies with shareholder return, and found that the CEOs of the top quartile of companies got bonuses 5.2% bigger last year. In the second and third quartiles their bonuses fell, 16.6% and 42.6% respectively. The worst performers--the bottom quartile-- had their bonuses cut by a whopping 76%. Towers Perrin's research indicates that that's how it will be for the foreseeable future: Pay will follow performance. The trick will be to figure out how to properly reward risk-taking. Towers says, unsurprisingly, that pay entirely in commissions encourages recklessness. Pay in salary alone encourages taking no risk at all. Every company faces the challenge of finding the happy medium between those extremes. Every CEO, meanwhile, faces the challenge of being a master stuntman, willing to take risks but only in very controlled and safe ways. Here's hoping as many as possible pull it off.","completion":"Title: \\"Navigating the New Normal: A Close Look at the Challenges and Changing Dynamics in America's CEO Landscape\\" In this article, we explore the current status of America's CEOs based on various recent studies by research and consulting firms.

Yes A:","completion":"Title: The Crimson Legacy Genre: Historical Drama/Thriller Plot: During World War II, Countess Nina von Stauffenberg (played by Keira Knightley), the wife of the late Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg - the orchestrator of the failed July 20 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, is living under a constant threat from the Gestapo. After her husband's execution, she goes into hiding, with her five children at her family's ancestral estate in Bavaria. Nina is torn between her loyalty to her husband's legacy and the desire to protect her children from a formidable enemy. As the war intensifies, the Third Reich is desperate to eliminate any remnants of the July 20 plot and bring the conspirators' families to justice. Nina makes a difficult decision to contact MI6, the British Secret Service, to seek help in keeping her and her children hidden from the Gestapo. Frederick Anders (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), a British spy sent to Germany to gain intelligence, is assigned to help the Countess and her children stay undercover. Simultaneously, SS-Officer Markus Herman (played by Michael Fassbender), a man obsessed with capturing the Stauffenberg family, comes closer to discovering their location. The movie unveils a thrilling game of cat and mouse, as Frederick and Nina work together to outmaneuver Herman and the Gestapo. As the plot evolves, Nina is drawn into an unexpected alliance with the German resistance - a group of people secretly working to bring about an end to Hitler's regime. Risking her own life and the lives of her children, she manages to protect her husband's legacy and contributes her efforts to the German resistance movement. Throughout their journey to evade the clutches of the Gestapo, Frederick and Nina develop a deep bond, finding solace in each other's pain and motivations. This connection complicates the mission, making them more vulnerable than ever. In the climax, the Stauffenberg family and Frederick are cornered by Herman and his troops. However, they are saved by an unexpected air raid by the Allies, which ultimately results in Herman's demise and allows the family to escape to the safety of Switzerland. Epilogue: The war finally comes to an end, and in the post-war era, Nina and Frederick use their inherited family estates to open a charity for war survivors, eventually marrying and raising their families. Countess Nina von Stauffenberg becomes known as the embodiment of resilience and love amidst a dark chapter of history. The Crimson Legacy tells the story of a family's hidden pain, sacrifice, and courage to secure freedom while fostering love, hope, and humanity. With an ensemble cast, gripping plot, and breathtaking cinematography, the film is a testament to the willpower to survive in the face of war and the unyielding power of family."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - A stream or river must occur - Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock - Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through - After many years the river may dry up - A dry ravine is left - Question: suppose Less rain that year happens, how will it affect MORE or LARGER ravines forming. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"Less rainfall in a given year can have a considerable impact on the formation of larger ravines. The process of ravine formation is influenced by the continuous erosion caused by the flow of water in streams or rivers. These water bodies cut through the soil and bedrock over time, gradually deepening and widening until a ravine is formed. The following paragraphs will discuss the effects of reduced rainfall on the formation of larger ravines and the influence of the supposed perturbation on the second effect mentioned, which is erosion. Firstly, less rainfall over the course of a year could lead to a decrease in the flow and volume of water in streams and rivers. The force of flowing water is a key factor in erosion, and when there is less water available to flow through these waterways, the energy required to cut into the soil and bedrock is reduced. As a result of this, there may be less erosion taking place overall, leading to the formation of fewer or smaller ravines. In addition, the type of soil and bedrock in the area can also influence the rate of erosion and ravine formation. If less rainfall occurs in a region with highly erodible soil, there is a possibility that the rate of erosion may be slower, further impeding the formation of new or larger ravines. Moreover, the reduced flow of water could also affect the transportation of sediment, which is essential for the widening and deepening of existing ravines. With less rainfall and water flow, it may take longer for sediments to be transported downstream, limiting the growth of ravines. Furthermore, the decreased rainfall could influence the surrounding vegetation to some extent. Vegetation can impact how quickly erosion occurs, as it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Depending on the extent of the change in rainfall, the growth of vegetation may be affected, which could influence the overall stability of the soil and rate of erosion and ravine formation. In conclusion, less rainfall in a given year could lead to less erosion, which would have a direct impact on the formation of larger or more ravines. The supposed perturbation of reduced rainfall would likely result in less erosion, slowing down and potentially reducing the deepening, widening, and overall formation of ravines. In summary, less rainfall could have a notable effect on the process of ravine formation by reducing the force of water required for erosion, influencing the transportation of sediment, and possibly affecting the growth of vegetation - all of which contribute to the rate at which ravines develop."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Benson (34 carries, 117 yards, 1 TD) would join Jerome Bettis in 1997 as the only running backs to run for over 100 yards against the Ravens twice in the same season. This turned out to be Chris Henry's final game, as he was injured during the game and was placed on season-ending injured reserve. He was killed by injuries relating to a fall from a pick-up truck a month later. Answer this question: How many yards difference was there between Shayne Graham's field goal and Andre Caldwell's touchdown?","completion":"Alright, little buddy! So, in a football game, the Bengals played the Ravens. The Bengals did pretty well! Their quarterback, Carson Palmer, threw the ball to Andre Caldwell, who caught it in the end zone, which is the place where they score touchdowns. That play was worth 6 points because it was a 6-yard pass. Then later, their kicker Shayne Graham kicked a field goal, which is when you kick the ball between two big poles in the air. His field goal was 23 yards long. Now, to find the difference between the 6-yard touchdown and the 23-yard field goal, we just need to subtract the smaller number (6) from the bigger number (23). So, 23 - 6 = 17. The difference was 17 yards!"},{"prompt":"Q:Title: This phone is not too great...... Review: I do not really like this phone at all.

His historical romances draw a picture of frontier and American Indian life in the early American days which created a unique form of American literature. He lived most of his life in Cooperstown, New York, which was founded by his father William on property that he owned. Cooper was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church and contributed generously to it. James Fenimore Cooper was born in Burlington, New Jersey in 1789 to William Cooper and Elizabeth (Fenimore) Cooper, the eleventh of 12 children, most of whom died during infancy or childhood. He was descended from James Cooper of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, England, who immigrated to the American colonies in 1679. Shortly after James' first birthday, his family moved to Cooperstown, New York, a community founded by his father on a large piece of land which he had bought for development. Later, his father was elected to the United States Congress as a representative from Otsego County. Their town was in a central area of New York that had previously been occupied by the Iroquois, who had allied themselves with the British during the Revolutionary War and were forced to cede the territory after British defeat. The State of New York opened the land for sale and development after the war, and Cooper's father purchased several thousand acres in upstate along the headwaters of the Susquehanna River. By 1788, William Cooper had selected and surveyed the site where Cooperstown would be established. He erected a home on the shore of Otsego lake and moved his family there in the autumn of 1790. He soon began construction of the mansion that became known as Otsego Hall, completed in 1799 when James was ten. Cooper was enrolled at Yale University at age 13, but he incited a dangerous prank which involved blowing up another student's door -- after having already locked a donkey in a recitation room. He was expelled in his third year without completing his degree, so he obtained work in 1806 as a sailor and joined the crew of a merchant vessel at age 17. By 1811, he obtained the rank of midshipman in the fledgling United States Navy, conferred upon him on an officer's warrant signed by Thomas Jefferson. At 20, Cooper inherited a fortune from his father. He married Susan Augusta de Lancey at Mamaroneck, Westchester County, New York on January 1, 1811 at age 21. She was from a wealthy family who remained loyal to Great Britain during the Revolution. The Coopers had seven children, five of whom lived to adulthood. Their daughter Susan Fenimore Cooper was a writer on nature, female suffrage, and other topics. She and her father often edited each other's work. Among his descendants was Paul Fenimore Cooper (1899-1970), who also became a writer.

Across the street from the church was a Pan American gas station where the Greyhound bus stopped.It was closed for Christmas, but I noticed a family standing outside the locked door, huddled under the narrow overhang in an attempt to keep dry. I wondered briefly why they were there but then forgot about them as I raced to keep up with Jill. Once we got home, there was barely time to enjoy our presents. We had to go off to our grandparents' house for our annual Christmas dinner. As we drove down the highway through town,I noticed that the family were still there, standing outside the closed gas station. My father was driving very slowly down the highway.

Choices: - auditorium - humans - opera house - death - end of line The rationale to choose \\"end of line\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The appropriate punishment for cutting the line when waiting at a ticket office should be to send the individual to the \\"end of line.\\" Rationale: Cutting in line, while rude and inconsiderate, is not a severe offense that warrants extreme punishments such as death. Instead, sending the person cutting in line to the back of the queue is a just and fitting consequence because it: 1. Restores order: When someone cuts in line, the orderly flow of people may be disrupted. Sending the rule-breaker to the back of the line restores order and fairness to the waiting process. 2. Serves as a deterrent: By sending an individual found cutting in line to the end of the queue, it discourages others from engaging in the same behavior, as they can also see the consequence of such an action. 3. Ensures fairness and equality: Allowing line-cutters to get ahead in the queue is fundamentally unfair to those waiting patiently and following the rules. Moving line-cutters to the back of the line ensures that everyone has the same opportunity to access the ticket office in a fair and equitable manner. The other options do not fit the context of the question or lack relevance to the issue of cutting in line: - Auditorium: Refers to a building or hall designed for public gatherings, such as performances or conferences. It has nothing to do with cutting in line at a ticket office. - Humans: Refers to people in general and doesn't relate specifically to the question of proper punishment for line-cutting. - Opera house: A venue primarily meant for showcasing operatic performances. Like the auditorium, it has no relevance to the issue at hand. - Death: This is an extreme and vastly disproportionate punishment for cutting in line at a ticket office, which does not warrant such a severe response."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Whose film score dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance? Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here's \\"Have a Cigar\\" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives. The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes \\"Pink\\" is the name of one of the band members. According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the \\"dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce\\", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience.Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: \\"The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling.\\" Waters commented: \\"it's about none of us really being there ... [it] should have been called Wish We Were Here\\".O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to \\"Comfortably Numb\\": \\"I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye.

The terms used in the tweet might seem negative initially, but when taking into consideration the context and the way they are utilized, we can determine that the tweet likely carries an overall good-natured sentiment. First, it is essential to consider the context in which the tweet is sent. The user is responding to their friend @AGistheWest, who probably contacted them recently. By positioning the tweet as a response or a follow-up, the user is establishing a virtual conversation with a person they appear to know well. The user calls their friend a \\"loserr,\\" which at face value might seem insulting or negative; however, the playful tone of the message and the three 'r's in the word suggest that this is friendly banter. As such, the sentiment should be understood as teasing or playful instead of genuinely hurtful or negative. Furthermore, the user says, \\"thanks for hitting me back,\\" suggesting that they appreciate their friend's effort to reply or reach out. This part of the tweet demonstrates positive sentiment and gratitude for their communication. Lastly, the user mentions \\"have fun with your wonderful mix thoughhh,\\" which conveys a positive sentiment through the adjective \\"wonderful.\\" The extra letters on \\"thoughhh\\" are another sign of a relaxed and informal tone. While it could be argued that the friend is being sarcastic, it is more likely that they are genuinely wishing their friend enjoyment with whatever \\"mix\\" they might be working on. In conclusion, the tweet may initially appear to have a negative sentiment due to the term \\"loserr,\\" yet the overall tone, context, and positive reference to their friend's \\"wonderful mix\\" reveal that it carries a mix of playful teasing and friendly intentions.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Immanuel Kant, in the Critique of Pure Reason, described time as an a priori intuition that allows us (together with the other a priori intuition, space) to comprehend sense experience. With Kant, neither space nor time are conceived as substances, but rather both are elements of a systematic mental framework that necessarily structures the experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject. Kant thought of time as a fundamental part of an abstract conceptual framework, together with space and number, within which we sequence events, quantify their duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, time does not refer to any kind of entity that \\"flows,\\" that objects \\"move through,\\" or that is a \\"container\\" for events. Spatial measurements are used to quantify the extent of and distances between objects, and temporal measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between events. Time was designated by Kant as the purest possible schema of a pure concept or category. What type of measurements are used to quantify the duration of events?","completion":"To quantify the duration of events, temporal measurements are used. Various units of time measurement have been developed and standardized to systematically record and compare the durations of and intervals between events. Some common units of time include seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. These units allow us to record, communicate, and analyze the duration of events and the time that elapses between them. In addition to these standard units of time, specific contexts may require more refined or specialized units, such as milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds, which are particularly useful in scientific and technological research where events or processes occur at exceptionally rapid rates. In other contexts, larger units, such as decades, centuries, or millennia, can be used to comprehend extended periods of time, historical processes, or long-term trends. Besides these linear measures of time, methods of measuring cyclical or recurring events have also been developed, such as lunar cycles or solar cycles, which have been of particular importance in the development of calendars and the tracking of seasonal changes. In summary, various types of temporal measurements are employed to quantify the duration of events. These measurements, which range from extremely small intervals to extensive periods, provide a systematic framework for understanding and comparing the chronology and duration of events within the abstract conceptual framework described by Immanuel Kant in the Critique of Pure Reason."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Aeschylus (UK: , US: ; Greek: Aiskhulos Aiskhulos; Ancient Greek: [ais.khy.los]; c. 525/524 - c. 456/455 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian. He is often described as the father of tragedy. Academics' knowledge of the genre begins with his work, and understanding of earlier tragedies is largely based on inferences from his surviving plays. One hallmark of Aeschylean dramaturgy appears to have been his tendency to write connected trilogies, in which each play serves as a chapter in a continuous dramatic narrative. The Oresteia is the only extant example of this type of connected trilogy, but there is evidence that Aeschylus often wrote such trilogies. The comic satyr plays that follow his trilogies also drew upon stories derived from myths. For example, the Oresteia's satyr play Proteus treated the story of Menelaus' detour in Egypt on his way home from the Trojan War. Based on the evidence provided by a catalogue of Aeschylean play titles, scholia, and play fragments recorded by later authors, it is assumed that three other of his extant plays were components of connected trilogies: Seven against Thebes being the final play in an Oedipus trilogy, and The Suppliants and Prometheus Bound each being the first play in a Danaid trilogy and Prometheus trilogy, respectively (see below). Scholars have moreover suggested several completely lost trilogies derived from known play titles. A number of these trilogies treated myths surrounding the Trojan War. One, collectively called the Achilleis, comprised the titles Myrmidons, Nereids and Phrygians (alternately, The Ransoming of Hector). Another trilogy apparently recounts the entry of the Trojan ally Memnon into the war, and his death at the hands of Achilles (Memnon and The Weighing of Souls being two components of the trilogy); The Award of the Arms, The Phrygian Women, and The Salaminian Women suggest a trilogy about the madness and subsequent suicide of the Greek hero Ajax; Aeschylus also seems to have written about Odysseus' return to Ithaca after the war (including his killing of his wife Penelope's suitors and its consequences) in a trilogy consisting of The Soul-raisers, Penelope and The Bone-gatherers. Other suggested trilogies touched on the myth of Jason and the Argonauts (Argo, Lemnian Women, Hypsipyle); the life of Perseus (The Net-draggers, Polydektes, Phorkides); the birth and exploits of Dionysus (Semele, Bacchae, Pentheus); and the aftermath of the war portrayed in Seven against Thebes (Eleusinians, Argives (or Argive Women), Sons of the Seven).

We went to the front desk for a second time to a more helpful person and they gave us a one-bedroom suite - which we were told was an \\"upgrade\\". We needed two beds and we were told that we could get a two queen terrace suite the next day. We asked for the sofa bed to be made that evening around midnight when we would be gone and they confirmed it would be assembled upon our return back to the room. This was never done, so 2 people had to sleep on an uncomfortable sofa bed. The next morning I did call to express my disappointment, and they came to make the sofa bed at 12:00 (noon time). We asked for the two queen terrace suite (we called early around 9 am) and we were met with resistance from the front desk. I was ready to ask to be moved to another hotel immediately, but John Greene from your resort services took it upon himself to correct the situation. I have nothing but great things to say about John as he is an asset to the Cosmopolitan. I stayed at the Cosmopolitan last year and enjoyed myself to the fullest, however I cannot say the same this time. I am likely not to recommend this property to any of my colleagues, friends, or family in the near future. To be completely honest, the only thing that kept me coming back was the terrace.

Q:Given the background: Middle adulthood lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this stage of life, many people raise a family and strive to attain career goals. They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life. These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood. and the situation: David works for the government as a statistician. He had to produce a report for the coming annual meeting. This year he is thinking about a report with some lifestyle suggestions for middle adulthood population. To make it easier to understand the needs of middle adulthood population he would compare it with a group who are in their twenties. He labeled the first group as group A; and the latter group as group B. Answer the following question: Would group A have faster or slower reaction time than group B? A:","completion":"Group A would likely have a slower reaction time than Group B.

He stays overnight with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and has sex with her (by imagining she's a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but gets a look at a picture of Christine's hunky boyfriend Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decides to stay to have a try at him. Then things get strange. A big X-rated art house hit in the US in 1983. Why was it X rated? Let's see...there's strangulation, full frontal male and female nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt...and it's all a comedy!!!!! Paul Verhoeven made this after \\"Spetters\\". \\"Spetters\\" was attacked by the critics for it's extreme sexual sequences and denounced as trash. So, Verhoeven filled this film with very obvious symbolism thinking the critics would think it was art and praise it. He was right! Critics loved the film not realizing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke on them. Still, it's a great film. It's beautifully shot by Jan de Bont (now a director himself) and there's so much symbolism and obvious \\"hidden\\" layers in the dialogue that you're never bored. All the acting is great--Krabbe plays a thoroughly despicable character but (somehow) has you rooting for him; Soutendijk is just stunning to look at and plays her part to perfection--the little smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling; Hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body--he deserves credit for doing the church sequence and going at with Krabbe in the crypt. This is not for people easily offended or the weak of heart, but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you (like me) this is for you! A 10 all the way.

The British journalist recently freed in a NATO military operation described his Taliban hostage-takers as \\"hopelessly inept,\\" and praised his Afghan colleague who died in the rescue. Journalists carry flowers to the grave of Afghan journalist Sultan Munadi in Kabul on Thursday. New York Times reporter Stephen Farrell described his four days in captivity in a blog on the newspaper's Web site, posted late Wednesday just hours after he was freed. Taliban militants kidnapped Farrell and Afghan journalist, Sultan Munadi, on Saturday. During a pre-dawn raid Wednesday, NATO's International Security Assistance Force plucked Farrell to safety, but did not retrieve the body of Munadi, who died during a fierce firefight between troops and Taliban militants. A British commando was also killed, as were a woman and child. There has been criticism about the rescue operation as well as the initial decision to go into the region which Farrell points out in his blog, \\"was becoming more troubled by insurgents.\\" International troops, including British forces, have expressed their unhappiness about having to extract a Western journalist from the area, a Western military source in Kabul told CNN. Meanwhile, NATO has come under fire from a coalition of Afghan journalists working for foreign news outlets who called the pre-dawn raid \\"reckless and double-standard behavior.\\" The Media Club of Afghanistan issued a statement Thursday saying it \\"holds the international forces responsible for the death of Mr. Munadi because they resorted in military action before exhausting other nonviolent means.\\" \\"There is no justification for the international forces to rescue their own national, and retrieve the dead body of their own soldier killed in action, but leave behind the dead body of Sultan Munadi in the area. The MCA deems this action as inhumane.\\" British Prime Minister Gordon Brown intends to send a \\"private\\" letter of condolences to Munadi's family, a spokeswoman for his office told CNN. In his first-hand account of the kidnapping, Farrell praised Munadi for \\"trying to protect me up to the last minute.\\" The two had gone from Kabul to the northern Afghan city of Kunduz on Friday to investigate reports of a NATO airstrike in a Taliban-controlled area. Farrell said he and his colleagues believed the attack, which destroyed two tankers, would be \\"a major controversy involving allegations of civilian deaths against NATO claims that the dead were Taliban.\\" He said they took precautions, including waiting until the next day to drive along the main highway in daylight. While they were interviewing locals about what happened along the riverbank, Farrell said \\"a crowd began to gather, time passed, and we grew nervous.\\" \\"I do not know how long we were there, but it was uncomfortably long,\\" he said. \\"I am comfortable with the decision to go to the riverbank, but fear we spent too long there.\\" All of a sudden, some of the villagers shouted, \\"Taliban\\" and their driver fled with the keys, he said. Farrell and Munadi tried to escape too, but they were captured. Munadi was struck with a Kalashnikov rifle, but Farrell said apart from that incident, the two were not \\"subjected to any beatings, torture or ill-treatment over the next four days.\\" Their Taliban captors operated freely in the area southwest of Kunduz, and appeared to be the only armed presence, Farrell wrote. \\"It became a tour of a Taliban-controlled district of Afghanistan, and that control appeared total,\\" he said. \\"At no point did we see a single NATO soldier, Afghan policeman, soldier or any check to the Taliban's ability to move at will.\\" Farrell said he and Munadi were \\"paraded\\" around by their captors. \\"We were paraded to the children in the street: the infidel and his translator, to be laughed at and mocked,\\" he wrote. The captors operated with relative impunity and, at times, \\"their operational security was hopelessly inept\\" -- using Farrell's name over their mobile phones \\"heedless of who was, almost certainly, monitoring the calls.\\" They even played songs on the radio that praised the Taliban, he said. \\"They were not making it hard,\\" Farrell wrote. At one point, he said they drove near what they said were watchtowers, manned by the Afghan government and NATO, \\"gleeful at their daring.\\" \\"They drove with headlights full on at night as they moved us from house to house, at least three different buildings a day,\\" according to Farrell. He said the Taliban captors seemed to be welcomed by some Afghan villagers, while others appeared \\"more wary and formally polite.\\" During their captivity, Farrell said \\"there were good hours, and bad ones,\\" as well as \\"progress and setbacks.\\" It became harder for the captors to find safe houses, he said. On the third night, there was what appeared to be an attempt to free them, but their captors took them to another refuge within minutes. Then, on the next night, the aerial activity increased and their Taliban captors grabbed their weapons and headed outside -- leaving Farrell and Munadi behind. They ran out later, Munadi in front, and then became separated. Then, Munadi appeared again, holding out his hand to steady a faltering Farrell and they ran across a narrow ledge on the outer wall of the compound. \\"I could hear Taliban voices shouting and shooting from trees to our left, I thought,\\" Farrell wrote. \\"I could also hear indistinct voices ahead. We continued 20 yards along the wall until it suddenly reached the corner.\\" Munadi walked beyond that corner, out into the open, raising his hands and shouting, \\"Journalist.\\" \\"There was a burst of gunfire and he went down immediately,\\" Farrell wrote. \\"In the dark, with firing all around, trees everywhere and my view obscured by him and the wall, I did not know whether the bullets came from in front, to his right or to his left.\\" At the sound of gunfire, Farrell reared back and dived into a wet ditch. After a few minutes, he heard British-accented voices and then screamed, \\"British hostage,\\" flashing a camera light from the ditch. He said he told the soldiers that Munadi was lying behind him, and had possibly been shot. \\"The body was lying motionless in the ditch where I had seen him go down,\\" Farrell said. \\"I hoped he had dropped and was lying still. I knew it wasn't the case.\\" The soldiers told him that \\"they had his picture and would look for him, then dragged me away.\\" \\"It was over,\\" he wrote. \\"Sultan was dead. He had died trying to help me, right up to the very last seconds of his life.\\" Farrell said he was then taken onboard the aircraft, as the soldiers, most of them British, carried on some celebrations. But they fell silent after learning one of the rescuers died from the wounds sustained in the raid. \\"His blood-soaked helmet was in front of me throughout the flight,\\" Farrell wrote. \\"I thanked everyone who was still alive to thank. It wasn't, and never will be, enough.\\" CNN's Ingrid Formanek in Kabul, Afghanistan contributed to this report.

At this point, it merges with the Bow River, giving rise to the South Saskatchewan River. Ultimately, this river system drains into the Hudson Bay.

Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to. If I hadn’t have found his joke funny, he probably wouldn’t have asked me out on a date. I hope that answers your question. I know it wasn’t very…. eventful.

The justification for this interpretation includes several points. Firstly, the critic mentions about \\"quick cutting\\", \\"blurry step-printing\\" and \\"dopey dialogue\\". These are generally not positive features for a movie, indicating that the aesthetic and technical aspects of the film did not impress the critic. Secondly, the phrase \\"to goose things up\\" implies the director tried to artificially create excitement or interest through these techniques. This highlights that the critic felt the storytelling was not natural or engaging, suggesting criticism of the director's approach. Finally, the critic outright highlights that \\"inadequate performances kill the effect\\". The reviewer uses the word 'kill' which is strong and negative.

Questions is also available on friends' profiles just as you would post on someone's wall. We first learned of Facebook's Q&A feature two months ago, when the company started asking for volunteers to beta test the product. The world's largest social network even went so far as to promise beta testers a trip to Facebook's offices to meet with the Q&A team. I had the chance earlier today to discuss the new feature with several Facebook employees. Questions has several defining features:. • Photo questions: For example, if you take a picture of a bird, but don't know what species it is, you can post the picture on Facebook Questions and get your answer. • Polling: If you're simply looking for the answer to \\"Which city is better: Chicago or Dallas?\\", you can get your answer by creating a poll. • Tagging: The company seems to be placing a lot of emphasis on tagging questions based on category or topic. The goal seems to be to make Q&A discovery an easier and faster process by making it simple to look up questions on cooking, photography, San Francisco or a variety of other topics. • Topic exploration: Facebook described this as a roulette-type feature that allows users to browse Facebook's eventual mountain of Q&A. Under the \\"Questions about\\" drop-down menu, there's a feature called \\"Everything\\" that allows users to browse the company's catalog of questions. • Following: You can follow specific questions for updates and new answers. • Updated homepage: Facebook Questions does actually change the homepage, adding a new bar at the top of the page where you can choose to update your status, ask a question, add photos, or post a link. There was one more thing that Facebook made clear to me: Facebook Questions is not an advertising product. While brands with Facebook Pages will eventually be able to answer questions, it's not meant to be a promotional platform; it's meant to be a useful and insightful product for users. Facebook Questions will roll out to a limited group of beta testers today, but the company promises to \\"bring this product to all of you as quickly as we can.\\" The entire feature is public, so we don't suggest posting those awkward bedroom questions on Facebook. Will Facebook Questions prove to be more useful than Quora or even Twitter as a Q&A platform?

The 45-year-olds, named yesterday as Marc and Eddy Verbessem, had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world. Their brother, Dirk Verbessem, said they were terrified of never being able to see each other and feared losing their independence in an institution. 'That was for my brothers unbearable,' said Mr Verbessem, 46. 'Did not want to end up in an institution: Deaf Belgian twins Marc and Eddy Verbessem chose to die by euthanasia because they feared losing their independence after learning they would also soon go blind. 'They lived together, did their own cooking and cleaning. You could eat off the floor. Blindness would have made them completely dependent. 'I sometimes think, if they had their wives and children, perhaps they would have had something to live for.' The twins, from the village of Putte, near the city of Mechelen, were told they would go blind from a genetically caused form of glaucoma and had other severe medical problems, their local doctor, David Dufour. The pair, who both worked as cobblers and could communicate with each other using a special sign language understood only by them and their close family, enlisted the support of Mr Dufour to be euthanised. But it took them almost two years to find a medical institution to carry out the procedure after they were turned by their local hospital. Mr Verbessem told the Daily Telegraph that the family had tried to talk them out of it, but were eventually persuaded by their arguments. Relied on each other: The twins, pictured here on Belgian television before they were named, had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world. They died by lethal injection four. weeks ago, dressed in new shoes and suits, with Mr Verbessem and their. parents, Mary and Remy, by their sides at Brussels University Hospital. in Jette.

Euthanasia is legal under Belgian law. if those making the decision can make their wishes clear and are. suffering unbearable pain, according to a doctor's judgement. The Belgian law differs from that of. Switzerland, famous for its Dignitas clinic, where only 'assisted. suicide' is permitted. This means patients must play an active role in. the administration of the drug that ends their lives. Brussels University Hospital: In Belgium, some. 1,133 cases of euthanasia - mostly for terminal cancer - were recorded. in 2011, about one per cent of all deaths in the country, according to. official figures. In Belgium, some 1,133 cases of. euthanasia - mostly for terminal cancer - were recorded in 2011, about. one percent of all deaths in the country, according to official figures. But this case was unusual as neither twin was suffering extreme physical pain or was terminally ill. Mr Dufour, the doctor who presided. over the euthanasia, told RTL television news that the twins had taken the. decision in 'full conscience'. He said they were 'very happy' and it had was a 'relief' to see the end of their suffering. 'They had a cup of coffee in the hall, it went well and a rich conversation,' Mr Dufour said. More to come? Belgium's ruling Socialists tabled a legal. amendment just days after the twins were killed which would allow the. euthanasia of children and Alzheimer's sufferers (picture posed by. models) 'Then the separation from their parents. and brother was very serene and beautiful. At the last there was a. little wave of their hands and then they were gone.' Belgium was the second country in the. world after the Netherlands to legalise euthanasia in 2002, but it. currently applies only to people over the age of 18. Other jurisdictions where it is permitted include Luxembourg and the U.S. state of Oregon. Just days after the twins were killed,. Belgium's ruling Socialists tabled a legal amendment which would allow. the euthanasia of children and Alzheimer's sufferers. The draft legislation calls for 'the. law to be extended to minors if they are capable of discernment or. affected by an incurable illness or suffering that we cannot alleviate.' The Dignitas building in Pfaeffikon near Zurich: Under Swiss law only 'assisted suicide' is permitted - which means that patients must take an active role in administering the drug that ends their lives. The proposed changes are likely to be. approved by other parties, although no date has yet been put forward for. a parliamentary debate. A bid to tighten legal controls on. assisted deaths in Switzerland and ban suicide tourism was recently. rejected by the country's parliament. Experts say the suicide tourism industry's clients come mainly from Britain, Germany, and France, but that numbers have been declining in recent years. Statistics from Dignitas show the. clinic based near Zurich has helped a total of 1,298 people commit. suicide between 1998 and 2011.","completion":"Deaf Belgian twins Marc and Eddy Verbessem chose euthanasia after learning they would soon become blind.

After the red mustang is hosed down, a team of workers efficiently and meticulously begin to soap up the car. Armed with soft sponges and high-quality car wash soap, they work together with precision to cover every inch of the mustang's exterior surface. They know the importance of using a gentle touch on this beautiful, classic vehicle and take care not to scratch the paint as they scrub away dirt and grime. In a well-practiced routine, the workers start at the hood, moving in circular motions to ensure they don't miss a single spot. As they move along the sides of the car, they pay special attention to the wheels, detailing each spoke in a thorough manner. They use special brushes to clean the tire grooves and rid the rims of any residual brake dust. Meanwhile, another worker tackles the windshield and windows, using a separate sponge and glass-specific cleaner to avoid streaks and smears on the glass. They take extra care around the windshield wipers, making sure to lift them and clean underneath. Once the entire exterior of the red mustang is covered in soap, the workers step back for a moment to inspect their work. Satisfied with the coverage, they move on to the next step in the car wash process. The workers grab the hose once more and begin rinsing the red mustang, starting from the top and working their way down. This process ensures that the soap runs off the car and spreads evenly, and avoids any dirty water from flowing down onto a freshly cleaned area. The high-pressure water quickly and effectively lifts away the soap, leaving the car's finish sleek and spotless. After the thorough rinse, the workers take their microfiber towels to carefully dry the car. They understand the importance of properly drying the vehicle to avoid mineral deposits and water spots, so they take their time, ensuring every droplet is removed. Once the red mustang is completely dry, the workers apply a coat of wax to give it that extra shine and protect its paint job from fading or damage. They buff the wax into the car's surface, taking care not to leave any residue behind. Finally, the workers step back and admire their handiwork, the red mustang shining brilliantly and looking like new once again. As the car leaves the car wash, the owner is impressed with the outstanding job the workers have done, and their attention to detail ensures the red mustang remains an eye-catching classic on the road."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\"Squirrels are funny.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Squirrels are the funniest animals.\\" is true?","completion":"To determine the validity of the hypothesis \\"Squirrels are the funniest animals\\" based on the premise \\"Squirrels are funny,\\" it is essential to examine the argument's logical structure, evaluate the context of the terms, and consider alternative candidates for the title of \\"funniest animals.\\" First, let's analyze the logical structure of the argument, which consists of a premise and a conclusion. The premise \\"Squirrels are funny\\" proposes that squirrels possess a quality of humor or amusement. However, the conclusion \\"Squirrels are the funniest animals\\" is not directly derived from the initial premise. The conclusion seeks to assert that squirrels are not only funny but also the funniest among all animals. This leap in reasoning constitutes a logical fallacy, as the conclusion is not justified based solely on the given premise. Next, it is essential to consider the context of the terms used in the argument. The concept of funniness is subjective and can vary significantly between different cultures, people, and individual perspectives. What one individual finds amusing in squirrels might not entertain another, and similarly, what one person deems as the funniest animal may not align with another's perception. It is also crucial to define what aspects make an animal funny—behavior, appearance, or both. Given the subjective nature of humor and funniness, it becomes challenging to establish any one species as the funniest without relying on personal biases. Finally, it is important to consider alternative contenders in the animal kingdom who may be deemed funny by various individuals. Numerous animals, such as monkeys, cats, dogs, or parrots, display behaviors that some people might find amusing, making them worthy contenders for the title of the funniest animal. These animals often engage in playful antics, have unique quirks, or exhibit interactions with humans and other species in ways that may be perceived as funny. Without considering these alternative candidates and establishing the reasoning behind squirrels being the funniest animals, the hypothesis remains unsupported based on the original premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"Squirrels are the funniest animals\\" cannot be confirmed solely based on the premise \\"Squirrels are funny,\\" as the argument exhibits a logical fallacy, the subjective nature of humor and funniness, and the presence of alternative candidates within the animal kingdom. To validate such a hypothesis, one would need to develop a sound and universally applicable set of criteria for funniness, compare the comedic levels of various animals based on these criteria, and ultimately provide compelling evidence to substantiate squirrels as the funniest of all species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thus, it does not logically follow that the boy is swimming in a pool based on the initial statement. Furthermore, the answer choices provided – A) yes, B) it is not possible to tell, and C) no – offer three potential solutions to the question. The first answer, A) yes, implies that there is a direct correlation between the two scenarios, which is unfounded based on the lack of contextual information.

In fact, you can exercise your brain as often as you do to your arms or legs-and the results can be positive and empowering. To improve your brain, you can't simply repeat the same exercises over and over. Just as lifting a two-pound weight will stop challenging you, so will repetitive exercises such as crosswords or Sudoku. Once you master easy exercises, you must move on to harder ones in order to push your brain-like your muscles-to a new level. The science behind brain training Scientists once believed that your mental abilities were fixed in adulthood. Since studies have shown just the opposite, millions of people around the world have adopted the new practice of brain training. The most popular of these brain training products is made by the San Francisco-based Lumosity. Lumosity's scientists with an experienced team of game designers have developed a fun,effective online brain training program that measures, tracks, and adapts to your progress, so you'll always be challenged. Promising studies on the effects of brain training In a 2013 Stanford study, a treatment group of 21 breast cancer survivors used 12 weeks of Lumosity training to work on processing speed, mental flexibility, and working memory tasks. On average, those who trained improved on tests of these abilities, compared to a group that did not train with Lumosity. There is even some evidence suggesting that Lumosity may be beneficial to normal, healthy adults. In a 2011 study by Lumosity and San Francisco State University researchers. 13 people who trained over 5 weeks improved working memory scores by 10%and attention scores by 20%. Brain training is designed to meet real-life needs The design of brain train ing is targeted at real-life benefits instead of improving game scores.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device The home side took the lead when Roarie Deacon went down easily under a Steven Whittaker challenge and Kevin Holt dispatched the resulting penalty kick. Whittaker made up for that with a fine low cross that was turned in by Anthony Stokes via defender Kerr Waddell's toe. Hibs came closest to a winner, but goalkeeper Scott Bain was in fine form. Dundee, who had lost their first three Premiership games of the season, move off the bottom of the table, one point ahead of Partick Thistle. Hibs stay in fifth place, now equal on points with Hamilton Academical, who had ended the Edinburgh side's 12-game unbeaten run last weekend. After that home defeat, head coach Neil Lennon was looking for a vastly improved performance against a side yet to get off the mark. But slack play by the Hibees defence has been their Achilles heel so often and it once again proved the case. As Deacon teased Whittaker, the former Rangers and Norwich City full-back stuck out his left leg and, with the Dundee midfielder going to ground, it left referee Don Robertson with a simple decision. Holt slammed the ball home from the spot to give the hosts the lead. Bain in the home goal was showing the type of form that led to his inclusion in Gordon Strachan's Scotland squad last year. The 25-year-old pulled off a string of stunning saves that kept the Dundee goal intact. However, when the Edinburgh side made the breakthrough, they had a fair slice of fortune going their way. Whittaker floated a cross into the box and Stokes diverted the ball goalwards and the final touch came off the leg of Waddell with Bain left stranded on his line. Hibs felt they had fair claims for a penalty when Scott Allan handled the ball as Stokes strode forward, but the referee again waved play on despite the protests from the visiting players. The second half continued on a similar vein, with Bain denying Marvin Bartley and Brandon Barker. Chances at the other end were few and far between, but Faissal El-Bakhtoui did go close to a winner. The Dundee striker's effort from 18 yards drifted inches the wrong side of the post to leave both teams with a point at the end of a pulsating 90 minutes. Dundee manager Neil McCann: \\"I am happy with a point. I'm not going to say we weren't up against it. Hibs are a good side. \\"What Hibs were doing, they were coming in narrow and trying to strangle the game. \\"Today, Neil Lennon will maybe think he deserved three points, but I'm delighted that we got one. \\"Scott Bain was terrific. I have been so impressed with him since I came in.\\" Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: \\"There was only one team in it. \\"Once we gave our weekly goal away, we played great. \\"We dominated the game and I'm disappointed not to win it. The level of performance was superb. \\"Their keeper was man of the match and we were a little wasteful in front of goal. \\"We're new to the league and it says a lot that we're disappointed not to win this one.

Answer:","completion":"Answer: Absorbing sunlight, kinetic energy, and electromagnetic energy. These are the three best answer choices because they all cause cool objects to warm up through different mechanisms: 1. Absorbing sunlight: When an object absorbs sunlight, it converts the solar energy absorbed into heat energy, causing the object to warm up. This is a common way in which objects on Earth, like rocks or the ground, get heated during the daytime. 2. Kinetic energy: When a cool object comes into contact with a warmer object or substance, the faster-moving particles of the warmer object transfer their kinetic energy to the slower-moving particles of the cooler object. This causes an increase in the temperature of the cooler object. This process is called heat conduction. 3. Electromagnetic energy: Electromagnetic radiation, such as microwaves, infrared radiation, and radio waves, can also heat objects. When electromagnetic waves interact with an object, the object's particles absorb the energy and vibrate at a faster rate, causing the object to heat up. This is the principle behind microwave ovens and other heating devices. These three answer choices are based on scientifically recognized principles of thermal energy transfer and heating mechanisms, giving them the best potential to cause cool objects to warm up."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Don't leave notes on the door.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Safeguarding Your Home: Top Techniques to Thwart Potential Intruders Introduction Home security is a significant concern for many homeowners, especially with the ever-evolving threats that technology brings. With innovation in techniques employed by criminals, it is crucial to adopt a proactive and multifaceted approach to ensure your home's safety. In this article, we will highlight some key steps you can take to best protect your home from potential burglary attempts. From simple practices of locking doors and windows to the installation of exterior lighting, these actions will not only deter burglars but also add a layer of protection to your personal sanctuary. 1. Lock external doors at all times One of the most basic yet crucial home security steps is always locking your external doors. It may seem obvious, but many burglaries occur due to unlocked doors that provide criminals easy access to your home. Invest in high-quality deadbolt locks and ensure all family members develop the habit of locking doors whenever they leave the premises, even if it's just for a short period. In addition, the use of a security chain or a secondary lock can further strengthen the security of your doors. 2. Lock your external windows and sliding glass doors Windows and sliding doors are other common entry points for burglars. Make sure to keep these points of access securely locked, particularly when you are away or during the night. Use window locks on all accessible windows and place bars or wooden dowels on sliding doors' tracks to hinder movement. Moreover, consider using window film or security screens to make it more difficult for criminals to break the glass and gain access. 3. Use exterior lighting to ward off potential robbers A well-lit exterior can act as a deterrent for potential intruders as it increases their risk of being seen and caught. By illuminating the entry points to your home and creating a sense of activity, burglars may think twice before attempting to trespass. Install motion-sensor lights around your property to ensure that any movement near your house triggers the lights. This sudden change in lighting may startle intruders and persuade them to flee. Solar-powered lights are an eco-friendly and cost-effective option to consider in addition to traditional outdoor lighting systems. 4. Don't leave notes on the door Leaving notes on your door for family members, delivery personnel, or service providers can inadvertently signal to burglars that your home may be unoccupied, making it a more desirable target. While it may be convenient to communicate with others through notes, it is best to find alternative methods to get your message across, such as phone calls or text messages. If you have a smart security system, consider equipping it with a video doorbell, which allows you to communicate with visitors remotely and monitor your front door without leaving obvious visual cues for potential criminals. 5. Additional security measures Implementing additional measures, such as security cameras or alarm systems, can provide your home with an extra layer of protection. Security cameras can discourage potential intruders while also capturing evidence in the event of an actual break-in. Home alarm systems can alert you, your neighbors, and law enforcement of any unauthorized entry attempts, ensuring a rapid response in case of an emergency. Conclusion Protecting your home from potential intruders is an ongoing process that requires vigilance and a combination of security measures. Implementing the suggestions presented in this article—locking doors and windows, using exterior lighting, avoiding leaving notes on the door, and incorporating additional security systems—will help create a safer environment for you and your family. It is essential to maintain an open dialogue with family members and neighbors about security measures and strategies to ensure that everyone remains vigilant and committed to keeping your community safe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Arsenal TV was a channel focused on providing coverage for the English football club Arsenal, similar to other channels in the Setanta Sports package like Celtic TV, Rangers TV, and LFC TV, which was dedicated to Liverpool Football Club. During this time, both Arsenal TV and LFCTV were available on satellite and cable platforms in the UK and Ireland, operated by Setanta Sports. The year 2007 is significant for LFCTV because it was the year the channel was officially launched, on 20 September 2007. As for Arsenal TV, it had been operating since its launch in 2004, but its association with LFCTV in 2007 underscored their shared purpose within the Setanta Sports package to provide dedicated coverage for their respective football clubs. However, after 2009, Arsenal TV ceased to exist as a television channel, with its content later moving online, replacing Channel 67. LFCTV, on the other hand, continued to operate as a standalone channel after the Setanta Sports package dissolved. In summary, the relationship between Arsenal TV and 2007 is that both Arsenal TV and LFCTV were part of the Setanta Sports package at that time, providing dedicated coverage for their respective football clubs, Arsenal and Liverpool."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kenneth Duva Burke (May 5, 1897 - November 19, 1993) was an American literary theorist, as well as poet, essayist, and novelist, who wrote on 20th-century philosophy, aesthetics, criticism, and rhetorical theory. As a literary theorist, Burke was best known for his analyses based on the nature of knowledge. Furthermore, he was one of the first individuals to stray away from more traditional rhetoric and view literature as \\"symbolic action.\\" Burke was unorthodox, concerning himself not only with literary texts, but with the elements of the text that interacted with the audience: social, historical, political background, author biography, etc. Burke called the social and political rhetorical analysis \\"dramatism\\" and believed that such an approach to language analysis and language usage could help us understand the basis of conflict, the virtues and dangers of cooperation, and the opportunities of identification and consubstantiality. Burke defined the rhetorical function of language as \\"a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols.\\" His definition of humanity states that \\"man\\" is \\"the symbol using, making, and mis-using animal, inventor of the negative, separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of hierarchy, and rotten with perfection.\\" For Burke, some of the most significant problems in human behavior resulted from instances of symbols using human beings rather than human beings using symbols. Burke proposed that when we attribute motives to others, we tend to rely on ratios between five elements: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. This has become known as the dramatistic pentad. The pentad is grounded in his dramatistic method, which considers human communication as a form of action. Dramatism \\"invites one to consider the matter of motives in a perspective that, being developed from the analysis of drama, treats language and thought primarily as modes of action\\" (Grammar of Motives xxii). Burke pursued literary criticism not as a formalistic enterprise but rather as an enterprise with significant sociological impact; he saw literature as \\"equipment for living,\\" offering folk wisdom and common sense to people and thus guiding the way they lived their lives. What exactly is dramatism?","completion":"Dramatism is a rhetorical framework and method of analysis developed by Kenneth Burke that examines language and communication through a metaphorical lens, viewing them as symbolic actions performed by humans. The central concept of dramatism is that our lives and social interactions can be seen as an ongoing drama, and the language we use to express ourselves shapes these dramatic performances. The key elements of dramatism include: 1. Dramatistic Pentad: Burke proposed that human motives can be analyzed through the relationships among five elements: act (what was done), scene (the context or setting in which the act took place), agent (the person who performed the act), agency (the means or tools used to perform the act), and purpose (the reason behind the act). Understanding the interplay among these elements enables a deeper understanding of human behavior, intentions, and motivations. 2. Identification and Consubstantiality: According to Burke, one of the primary functions of rhetoric is to establish a sense of shared identity or consubstantiality among individuals. This process of identification allows people to put themselves in others' shoes, fostering empathy, compassion, and cooperation. However, identification can also lead to divisiveness and strife when different groups focus on their differences instead of finding common ground. 3. Terministic Screens: Burke argued that our understanding of reality is filtered through our language and the terms we use to describe it. These \\"terministic screens\\" shape our perceptions, influencing how we make sense of the world and the actions we take as a result. Thus, the language we use has significant implications for our motivations and behaviors. 4. Symbolic Action: In dramatism, all human actions can be understood as symbolic expressions of the values, beliefs, and attitudes that inform our thought processes. This approach emphasizes the importance of studying not just the content of texts, but also the broader social, political, and cultural contexts in which those texts are embedded. 5. \\"Equipment for Living\\": Burke saw literature and other forms of symbolic action as providing essential tools for navigating the complexities of human life. By engaging with stories, myths, and other cultural narratives, we learn important lessons about ourselves and the world, and we develop strategies for coping with the challenges that inevitably arise in our interpersonal relationships. By approaching communication and language through the lens of dramatism, Burke's theory provides a flexible and holistic method for understanding and interpreting human motives and actions. By acknowledging the impact of language and symbolism on our perceptions, values, and decisions, we can better appreciate the power of rhetoric and narrative in shaping our social reality."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Process: - Energy builds up in the crust of the earth - The energy causes the fault lines give way - The earth&#x27;s plates move - The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions - The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there was no earthquake happens, how will it affect pressure builds up until it is released. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"In the given process, energy building up in the earth's crust is a crucial factor in the occurrence of an earthquake. If we assume that no earthquake happens, then we can analyze how this perturbation might affect the pressure build-up and its release. To understand the effect of the perturbation, we follow a series of steps: Step 1: Identify the source of pressure build-up As energy accumulates in the Earth's crust, it puts increasing pressure on the rocks and geological structures surrounding the fault lines. This pressure build-up is primarily due to the movement of tectonic plates. Step 2: Analyze the effect of no earthquake occurrence If there is no earthquake in this scenario, the perturbation is that the fault lines do not give way, which implies that the Earth's plates do not move. This means that the energy continues to accumulate in the crust and it does not radiate outward as seismic waves. Step 3: Consider the consequences of energy accumulation With the continuous build-up of energy in the crust and the absence of any release mechanism (i.e., an earthquake), the potential for a pressure release must still exist as energy cannot be destroyed. However, due to our perturbation, it is not being released in the form of seismic activity. Step 4: Assess possible alternative release mechanisms Without an earthquake, the accumulated pressure in the Earth's crust must find another way to release. This could lead to a stable situation where the pressure is somehow evenly distributed and does not cause any significant geological events. Alternatively, the pressure might continue to increase until it is released in an even more powerful earthquake in the future or through another type of geological event, such as volcanic activity (if the built-up energy is able to trigger it). In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of no earthquake occurring does have an effect on the process, as it prevents the release of pressure in the form of seismic activity. This could lead to a stable situation or, conversely, the pressure might accumulate and be released in a future event with potentially more significant consequences. The perturbation, therefore, has both direct (preventing fault line movement) and indirect (potentially affecting future geological events) effects on the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Geeky Michael Eckman warns him that Bianca is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective father does not allow Bianca or her older sister, the shrewish Kat, to date. Kat, a senior, is accepted to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, but her father, Walter, wants her to stay close to home. Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter, an obstetrician worrisome of teenage pregnancy, will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude makes this unlikely. When Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father's new rule and, as a pretense for allowing her to date Joey, suggests that Cameron find someone willing to date Kat. Cameron selects \\"bad boy\\" Patrick Verona, but Patrick scares him off. Michael assists by convincing Joey to pay Patrick to take out Kat, under the pretense that this will allow Joey to date Bianca. Patrick agrees to the deal, but Kat rebuffs his first few advances.

Write highlights for this article: One of the deepest mysteries in science - where all the antimatter went after the Big Bang and therefore why there’s matter at all in the universe – is a step closer to being solved, claim CERN researchers. It comes because they’ve reached an important milestone in being able to make precision comparisons between atoms of ordinary matter and atoms of antimatter. ‘We’ve demonstrated that we can probe the internal structure of the antihydrogen atom,’ said team spokesman, Jeffrey Hangst, ‘and we’re very excited about that. We now know that it’s possible to design experiments to make detailed measurements of antiatoms.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS. Hi-tech: The CERN Alpha experiment uses cutting-edge equipment to trap antihydrogen atoms. Today, we live in a Universe that appears to be made entirely of matter, yet at the Big Bang, matter and antimatter would have existed in equal amounts. The mystery is that all the antimatter seems to have gone, leading to the conclusion that nature must have a slight preference for matter over antimatter. If antihydrogen atoms can be studied in detail they may provide a powerful tool for investigating this preference, as the results from CERN’s Alpha collaboration suggest. Hydrogen atoms consist of an electron orbiting a nucleus. By firing light at them the atoms can be excited, with the electrons jumping to higher orbits, and eventually relaxing back to their so-called ground state by emitting light. The frequency distribution of the light emitted forms a very precisely measured spectrum that, in the matter world, is unique to hydrogen. Pioneering: Professor Jeffrey Hangst at the Alpha experiment. Leap forward: Professor Hangst explained that his experiment means antimatter can now be better understood. Basic principles of physics say that antihydrogen should have an identical spectrum to hydrogen, and measuring this spectrum is the ultimate goal of the Alpha collaboration. ‘Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and we understand its structure extremely well,’ said Hangst. ‘Now we can finally begin to coax the truth out of antihydrogen. Are they different? We can confidently say that time will tell.’ In a paper published today in Nature, Alpha reports the first, albeit modest, measurement of the antihydrogen spectrum. In the Alpha apparatus, antihydrogen atoms are trapped by a sophisticated arrangement of magnetic fields acting on the magnetic orientation of the antihydrogen atoms. By shining microwaves with a precisely tuned frequency on the antihydrogen atoms, the collaboration flips the antiatoms’ magnetic orientation, thereby liberating antihydrogen from the trap. When this happens, the antihydrogen meets ordinary matter and annihilates, leaving a characteristic pattern in particle detectors surrounding the trap. This measurement shows that it is possible to set up experiments in which the internal properties of antihydrogen atoms can be changed by shining microwaves on them. In the near future, Alpha will work at improving the precision of the microwave measurements, and undertake complementary measurements of the antihydrogen spectrum using lasers.","completion":"1.

Given the question: This article: Lazar Markovich Lissitzky (Russian: Ла́зарь Ма́ркович Лиси́цкий, listen ; November 23 [O.S. November 11] 1890 – December 30, 1941), known as El Lissitzky (Russian: Эль Лиси́цкий, Yiddish: על ליסיצקי‎), was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist and architect. He was an important figure of the Russian avant-garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union. His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewußte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation). Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design. This continued until his deathbed, where in 1941 he produced one of his last works – a Soviet propaganda poster rallying the people to construct more tanks for the fight against Nazi Germany.

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Slime molds are fungus-like protists that grow as slimy masses on decaying matter. They are commonly found on items such as rotting logs. Q: Slime molds are fungus-like protists that grow as slimy masses on what? Choices: - recycled matter - food matter - dark matter - decaying matter A: Answer:","completion":"Slime molds are fungus-like protists that grow as slimy masses on decaying matter. Slime molds belong to the group of organisms known as protists, which are eukaryotic and can be unicellular or multicellular but are not classified as plants, animals, or fungi. While slime molds exhibit fungus-like characteristics, they are distinct from fungi in several ways. One significant difference is that slime molds are motile and can move, whereas fungi are mostly stationary. These slime molds grow as slimy masses, which are often brightly colored, on decaying matter, specifically decomposing plant material. They play essential roles in ecosystems due to their ability to break down and consume dead plant matter. By doing so, they recycle nutrients and contribute to the natural process of decomposition, transforming organic waste material into more simple substances that can be used by other organisms in the environment. This process helps maintain balance and nutrient availability in ecosystems where they are found. Common habitats for slime molds include rotting logs, damp soil, and leaf litter on the forest floor. These locations offer suitable environments for the growth and development of slime molds since they provide an abundance of decaying plant matter and moisture. In summary, slime molds are fungus-like protists that grow as slimy masses on decaying matter. They play crucial roles in ecosystems, aiding in decomposition and nutrient recycling, with rotting logs and damp soil being some common places for them to thrive. The correct choice from the given options is \\"decaying matter,\\" as it best describes the substrate on which slime molds can develop and flourish."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Last summer, he was studying the evolution of two different salamander species, species A and species B. Species A salamander was Gold-striped salamander while species B salamander was fire salamander. He found it interesting that they took different approaches to adapt to different habitats. and a hint : Consider the antlers of the Irish elk, (often supposed to be far too large; in deer antler size has an allometric relationship to body size). Obviously, antlers serve positively for defence against predators, and to score victories in the annual rut. But they are costly in terms of resource. Their size during the last glacial period presumably depended on the relative gain and loss of reproductive capacity in the population of elks during that time. As another example, camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid coloration is displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the necessity for reproduction.Stream-dwelling salamanders, such as Caucasian salamander or Gold-striped salamander have very slender, long bodies, perfectly adapted to life at the banks of fast small rivers and mountain brooks. Elongated body protects their larvae from being washed out by current. However, elongated body increases risk of desiccation and decreases dispersal ability of the salamanders; it also negatively affects their fecundity. As a result, fire salamander, less perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats, is in general more successful, have a higher fecundity and broader geographic range. Please answer this question : Which species would be more successful in reproduction, Species A or species B? A:","completion":"In terms of reproductive success, species B, the fire salamander, would be more successful compared to species A, the Gold-striped salamander. While both species have evolved different adaptations to survive in their respective habitats, the fire salamander benefits from several factors that contribute to its reproductive success. First, the fire salamander is less perfectly adapted to mountain brook habitats than the Gold-striped salamander, which means that it has a more general and versatile set of adaptations. This allows the fire salamander to access a broader range of habitats, thereby increasing its chances of finding a suitable mate and reproducing. The wider geographic range of the fire salamander means that it can successfully reproduce in a variety of environments, allowing the population to grow and expand. Second, the Gold-striped salamander's elongated body, while helpful in protecting its larvae from being washed away by currents, comes at a cost. The increased risk of desiccation and decreased dispersal ability negatively impact the survivability and reproductive success of the species. The elongated body also affects the fecundity of the species, meaning that the Gold-striped salamander will generally produce fewer offspring than the fire salamander. Lastly, the fire salamander's higher fecundity plays a crucial role in its reproductive success. The species is able to produce more offspring than the Gold-striped salamander, increasing the population size and overall fitness of the species. These offspring will then grow up to reproduce themselves, further perpetuating the success of species B. Taking these factors into consideration, species B, the fire salamander, would be more successful in reproduction than species A, the Gold-striped salamander. Of course, it's essential to remember that both species have survived and adapted to their particular environments, demonstrating the dynamic nature of evolution and species success. However, considering the specific characteristics mentioned above, the fire salamander has a greater chance of maintaining and expanding its population due to its reproductive advantages."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: The film begins in January 1793 as a 17-year-old Hornblower joins a ship of the line, Justinian. Hornblower is introduced to his shipmates, one of whom is the ruthless Jack Simpson, who rules the midshipman's berth as the bully he is.Hornblower becomes suicidal under Simpson's malignant rule and finally finds opportunity to challenge him to a duel. An older midshipman, Clayton, feels guilty that he himself has not stood against Simpson. He knocks Hornblower unconscious, takes his place in the duel and is killed. Simpson, on the other hand, recovers to fight another day.Hornblower goes on to join the frigate, Indefatigable, under the command of Captain Pellew. Midshipmen Kennedy, Hether, and Cleveland go with him, as well as Simpson's old division which, due to Pellew's ire, becomes Hornblower's division. Hornblower's conduct under the pressure of battle eventually wins the respect and loyalty of these men.Simpson joins Indefatigable (known by her crew as the Indy) when Justinian is sunk by a rogue French ship called Papillon. The Indy and her crew take on a cutting out expedition into the Gironde, take Papillon, and sail to rejoin Indefatigable. During the operation, Simpson attempts the murder of Hornblower, and sets Kennedy adrift.The French Ship, Papillon, now in the hands of the British, is sailing back to the Indy when the Indy comes under fire from three French ships. On the way back to the Indy, the Papillon comes under fire from shore batteries, killing the two officers superior to Hornblower, Lt. Eccleston and Lt. Chadd. Shortly before the most senior officer (Eccleston) dies, he tells Hornblower to take command. Simpson attempts to challenge Hornblower's authority, but Hornblower tells Mr Bowles (the ship's master), that if Mr Simpson resists \\"you have my permission to shoot him\\". Simpson is then taken below whilst the Papillon sails back to the Indy.The Indy is now taking heavy fire from the three French ships, and Hornblower orders the Papillon not to lower her French colours. The Papillon then engages the French ships forcing them to surrender. After the battle, Mr Simpson and Hornblower are called to Captain Pellew's cabin. Accused by Hornblower of attempted murder, Simpson challenges him to a second duel, which Hornblower accepts (after receiving permission from Pellew).In this second duel, which takes place on a beach, Simpson shoots at Hornblower before the combatants are actually told to fire. Simpson claims, dubiously, that it was a misfire, running forward to see if his opponent is still alive. But Hornblower is not badly injured. Simpson is then told that he must stand his ground and take fire. Faced with this prospect, Simpson pleads pathetically to Hornblower for his life, revealing himself for the coward he is. Hornblower fires into the air, claiming that shooting the now defenseless Simpson is \\"not worth the powder\\". Smarting at this insult, Simpson attempts to knife Hornblower, but is shot dead just before he reaches him by Captain Pellew, who is standing concealed on a cliff above the beach.As the film draws to its end, Captain Pellew tells Hornblower precisely how impressed he has been by his actions. Pellew anticipates that Hornblower has a great career ahead of him, if he continues as he has begun., Question: Who shoots and kills Simpson?

Now, for the first time, we retell exactly as he wrote, one of the first â and still the best â tales of the macabre. Jonathan Harker, a lawyer traveling from London to Transylvania to secure property for Count Dracula, arrives at Bistritz to stay for the night. There, he is warned by a concerned lady against continuing his journey the following day. Harker believes that her concerns are rooted in peasant superstition. He ignores her, but starts to feel increasingly unnerved by the way everyone looks at him. Harker sets off for the rest of his journey and arrives at the Borgo Pass where he's picked up by the Count's mysterious coachman. Harker debarks at Castle Dracula, and the coach immediately rushes off. Somewhat hesitantly, Harker approaches the main door, whereupon a thin, tall, gaunt old man opens it. Harker asks, \\"Count Dracula?\\" \\"I am Dracula, enter freely and of your own will,\\" says the man at the door. Dracula takes Harker to his bedchamber where Harker notices that Dracula casts no reflection. Later, Harker goes to sleep. He wakes in an ancient crypt where he is seduced by three beautiful vampiresses. Dracula rushes into the room in a rage and orders them to leave Harker alone. Dracula explains, \\"This man belongs to me,\\" then gives the vampiresses a baby to feed on. Harker wakes up screaming in his room and assumes it was a nightmare, but two small wounds on his neck indicate otherwise. Harker soon realises he is a prisoner, and tries to escape by climbing out of his bedroom window. He finds his way back to the crypt where Count Dracula and his three brides rest in coffins. Harker runs out of the crypt screaming, and jumps out of the castle's tower into the river below.

These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage. Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated.

For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. Question: What bad effect does being busy bring? === The answer to the above question is pick from the following.

If so, hope you remember the evening. Seventeen men and women have been charged in Florida in what prosecutors say was a scam targeting tourists looking for after-dark fun that played out in these and other private clubs, according to an Associated Press report. The con: \\"B-Girls\\" (slang for women at bars whose job is to encourage customers to spend a lot of money) enticed victims to South Beach private clubs where they were charged sky-high prices for Champagne and other drinks. The story said that women -- most from Russia and neighboring Eastern European countries -- would chat up tourists and businessmen in legitimate nightspots, looking for those who seemed to have money to spend. Then the women invited their victims to the \\"private clubs,\\" where drinks flowed and credit cards took big hits. Women would pour drinks into buckets or planters to get the men to buy more, The Miami Herald says. \\"Some victims are so intoxicated by the drinks forced upon them by the B-Girls that they cannot stand and are not competent enough to sign credit card receipts,\\" FBI agent Alexander V. Tiguy said in an affidavit quoted in the story. \\"Those victims are propped up by the B-Girls long enough to obtain signatures.\\" I tried to call three clubs listed on the main South Beach drag of Washington Avenue. One had no phone number I could find, one had a disconnected number and one had only an answering machine with no business name on it. Prosecutors say at least 88 victims have been identified with total losses in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. One victim was gouged 43,000, the AP reports. Some of the accused are being held without bail and one top operative is believed to have fled the country, the story said. U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer told the AP that such scams could give \\"our tourism industry a black eye. We are pleased to have put this ring out of operation.\\" (My colleague Cathy Grossman, a former Floridian, says that B-girls have always been a part of the South Florida scene. She reminds me that the former Poodle Lounge at the Fontainebleau resort, where the Rat Pack partied, was a big hangout for ladies waiting to meet rich gents and conventioneers and that any female sitting solo at the bar was suspect. However, I'm pretty sure 43,000 tabs weren't rung up there.) Readers, has anyone heard of this scam or of anything similar in another pleasure capital, Las Vegas?

Passage: Big Butte Creek drains approximately 245 square miles (635 km2) of southern Oregon. Elevations range from 1,562 feet (476.1 m) at the creek's mouth to 9,495 feet (2,894 m) at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of 3,528 feet (1,075 m). About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford.The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from 10 °F (−12 °C) in the winter to 100 °F (38 °C) in the summer. Precipitation averages between 35 and 80 inches (890 and 2,000 mm) annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the South Fork Rogue River to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west.

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 23:12 EST, 27 December 2013 | UPDATED: 05:03 EST, 28 December 2013 It is said that to be a truly great photobomber you must first be an artist. So in a year when the art of photobombing was added to the Oxford Dictionary ('a photograph that has been spoiled by the unexpected appearance of an unintended subject in the cameraâ€™s field of view as the picture was taken') it should come as little surprise that some of the best spoiled photos came from celebrities. In Hollywood, photobombing has become a tit-for-tat game amongs the stars, especially at big awards events, when the opportunities to intrude a photo are endless in a sea of cameras. Arguably the most famous of the year: During a concert, OPTIONS: - 1D notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - Daily Mail notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - Hollywood notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - Oxford Dictionary notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - PUBLISHED notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - Photobombs notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - Queen B notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - Tumblr notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it - UPDATED notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it","completion":"Arguably the most famous of the year: During a concert, Queen B notices a fan taking a selfie and ducks down to be part of it. This iconic moment quickly became viral on social media, which led to a surge of activity for fans who couldn't help but share the humorous image. Beyoncé, affectionately known as Queen B, had swiftly and skillfully made her way into the unsuspecting fan's photo, effectively turning it into an unforgettable photobomb. With her magnetic charisma and signature smile, this candid moment was undoubtedly a highlight of the year, showcasing a relatable, lighthearted side that stars rarely share with the public. Photobombing wasn't just limited to the music industry, however, as actors, athletes, and even politicians took advantage of opportunities to steal the spotlight. From awards shows to red carpets, sporting events to charity galas, 2013 saw an increase in this phenomenon that quickly gained traction across the globe. Fans reveled in collecting these candid moments, delighting in the playful side of their favorite personalities. Additionally, the trend seemed to bridge the gap between fans and celebrities, allowing for a sense of camaraderie and familiarity often missing from fame's aloof facade. As smartphones and portable cameras continue to perpetuate the ever-growing thirst for candid snapshots, it's easy to see why photobombing has enjoyed such a meteoric rise in popularity. With a little whimsy and the element of surprise, photobombing appears to be a winning combination for both the prankster and their unwitting subject. And while the term was only formally recognized as an official part of the English language with its addition to the Oxford Dictionary in 2013, it's clear that the trend is here to stay. As we look back on a year filled with unforgettable moments, it's impossible to deny the impact that photobombing has had on both popular culture and celebrity interactions. From Queen B's triumphant concert selfie to many other instances of stars taking a bite out of the photobombing craze, it's clear that this unique form of expression has struck a chord with fans and celebrities alike. And as we eagerly await a new year of candid gems, it's safe to say that photobombing has effectively proven itself to be an art form all its own."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer based on context: The Jets played a rare road game at home, as they took on their intracity rivals (and stadium co-tenants), the New York Giants. Both offenses were slow to start through the first quarter, though the Jets' defense capitalized when Giants running back Brandon Jacobs fumbled at his own 11-yard line, which was picked up by safety Kerry Rhodes for a touchdown. The Jets had a chance to extend the lead later in the period, but Mike Nugent missed a 42-yard field goal. The Giants responded on the ensuing drive with an eight-yard touchdown by Derrick Ward. The deadlock was broken toward the end of the first half when Chad Pennington led the Jets on a 93-yard drive with less than two minutes in the half, ending on a 16-yard touchdown pass to Brad Smith. The Jets were able to tack on a 47-yard field goal by Nugent to end the half, after they got the ball back on an interception of Giants quarterback Eli Manning by Jonathan Vilma, taking a 17-7 lead into the locker room. The Giants went to work when they opened the second half, getting a 19-yard touchdown run from Jacobs to cut the Jets' lead to three. The lead was restored back to ten, however, when Leon Washington returned the ensuing kickoff 98&#160;yards for a touchdown. Later in the quarter, Manning led the Giants downfield and completed a 13-yard pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey for a touchdown. Pennington attempted to respond by leading the Jets deep into Giants territory early in the fourth quarter, but he floated a pass toward the end zone which was intercepted at the two-yard line by cornerback Aaron Ross. Despite the bad field position, Manning eventually found Plaxico Burress on a 53-yard touchdown pass to put the Giants ahead, 28-24. The Jets tried to get back ahead later in the period, but Pennington was intercepted again by Ross (Pennington's third of the afternoon), who took it 43&#160;yards for what was effectively the game-sealing touchdown. One last attempt by the Jets to score yielded no positive yardage, and the Giants ran out the clock to preserve the victory. What all touchdown passes did Eli Manning make?","completion":"Alright kiddo, in that game Eli Manning, the quarterback for the New York Giants, threw two touchdown passes.

Answer this question: who was the prime minister of bulgaria from 1950 to 1956??","completion":"From 1950 to 1956, the Prime Minister of Bulgaria was Valko Chervenkov, who was a Bulgarian communist politician and an important figure in the Bulgarian government during the early years of the Cold War. His full name was Valko Chervenkov Valkov, born on September 15, 1900, in Zlatitsa, Bulgaria, and passed away on October 21, 1980, in Sofia, Bulgaria. Valko Chervenkov originally worked as a teacher. However, he later adopted communist ideologies and joined the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) in 1919. Over the years, he climbed up the ranks within the party, working as editor for different party newspapers and traveling to the Soviet Union to learn about its policies. In the early 1930s, Chervenkov was forced to flee Bulgaria due to his communist activities and took up refuge in Moscow. During World War II, Chervenkov was a member of the Soviet intelligence service, which added significant weight to his resume. Following the end of World War II, as Bulgaria fell under Soviet influence, Chervenkov, with his Soviet connections, started to become a prominent figure in the country. In 1949, after the death of Georgi Dimitrov, who was the first leader of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Chervenkov assumed the role of the first secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Valko Chervenkov became the Prime Minister of Bulgaria in 1950. As the Prime Minister, Chervenkov adopted a strong pro-Stalinist stance, following in the footsteps of his predecessor. This period is often referred to as the \\"Chervenkov era.\\" During his term, Chervenkov promoted industrialization, education, and cultural growth. Despite these positive initiatives, there were several suppressions of opposition, restrictions on civil liberties, and persecution of religious institutions that occurred during his tenure. The Chervenkov era was marked by an intense personality cult, as people were expected to laud the Prime Minister for all his contributions to the nation. After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, the Soviet Union went through a period of political changes, and Nikita Khrushchev ascended to power. This transition impacted leading communist figures in Bulgaria, including Chervenkov. In 1954, Chervenkov was removed from his position as the first secretary of the BCP, and Todor Zhivkov replaced him. However, Chervenkov continued to hold his position as the Prime Minister until 1956. That year, with the Soviet Union's political climate shifting towards de-Stalinization, Chervenkov was pushed out of power, and Anton Yugov replaced him as the Prime Minister of Bulgaria. Chervenkov's removal marked the end of his political influence. After his forced resignation, he was appointed the Minister of Public Education, a role he held until being relieved of all government duties in 1961."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light. I am facing a new situation today: A scientist named Kathy walks into her office to see two neon signs plugged into the wall and hanging above her desk. Confused, she looks around to see if there's any clue as to who put them there. Seeing nobody, she flips the light switch on and walks in. Upon flipping the light switch, only the large sign lights up. Even though they are clearly both plugged in, the small sign isn't turning on. Kathy leaves her office to find someone to ask who put these random signs up in her room. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Are the electrons in the small sign more or less energized than the large sign's electrons? A:","completion":"Based on the new situation and the background article, the electrons in the small sign are less energized than the large sign's electrons. The large sign lights up when the light switch is turned on, which means an electric current is being sent through the noble gas in the glass tube, energizing the electrons and producing light as they return to their original energy level. Since the small sign does not light up even though it is plugged in, it implies that for some reason an electric current is not being sent through the gas, possibly due to a malfunction or issue with the circuitry. Therefore, the electrons in the small sign are not being energized to the same extent as the electrons in the large sign, resulting in the lack of emitted light."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: (CNN)A leader of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region said Friday he is not interested in a truce with the Ukrainian government in Kiev because his troops are on the offensive. \\"Since we're attacking, there is no sense to have peace talks now,\\" Aleksandr Zakharchenko, leader of the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk, said in a meeting with university students, according to his media office. \\"We've made this mistake before. It's not decent to repeat it,\\" he said. Thousands have been killed in months of conflict between the rebels and Ukrainian troops, and a ceasefire agreed to in September crumbled long ago. Zakharchenko's comments came two days after the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia met in Berlin to discuss a way out of the violence. But Zakharchenko showed no interest in the talks. \\"There will be no attempts from our side to talk about the ceasefire,\\" he said, reported Russian state news agency RIA. \\"We will be on the offensive until we reach the border of Donetsk region.\\" He said that he was interested in cooperating with Ukraine on prisoner exchanges. \\"We need to get our guys who've been captured,\\" he said, according to RIA. Despite the talks in Berlin, violence in the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine shows no signs of abating. Power is out in and around Luhansk after militants shelled a power plant there, Luhansk regional official Hennady Moskal told Ukraine's state-run Ukrinform news agency. Moskal noted that the local water supply and boilers are off, and trolley buses aren't operating. Thursday's shelling of a transit stop in Donetsk city -- an attack that Ukraine's Defense Ministry blamed on rebels -- killed eight civilians, according to state news reports. But Ukrainian troops have come under heavy fire, as well. That includes 115 attacks in a recent 24-hour period that killed three troops and wounded 50 more, Ukrinform reported Friday. The news agency said that \\"Russian-terrorist troops\\" faced off with Ukrainian soldiers Thursday along Bakhumtka Highway, even posting a picture that showed a man with stripes on his clothing, suggesting that he was part of the Russian military. This is in line with Kiev's repeated assertions that Russia has not only actively supported rebels with arms, but has sent its own troops across the border to battle Ukrainian forces. On Wednesday, for instance, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that \\"more than 9,000 Russian troops (crossed) our Russian-Ukrainian border, bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks, armed personnel carriers, and killing Ukrainian civilians and attacking Ukrainian troops.\\" Claims that Russian forces entered Ukraine 'complete rubbish,' Russia says . Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov promptly responded to this assertion with a firm denial, much like other denials made by Russian officials in recent months over similar allegations of armed intervention. \\"As to the flow of troops and armaments, this is not the first time we hear something like that,\\" he said. \\"And each time I hear that, I say if you're so confident about that, please present us with facts, but no one has been able to provide us with these facts.\\" Russian forces, equipment enter Ukraine, PM says . Pro-Russian separatists have claimed control of parts of eastern Ukraine since the spring of 2014, despite a push by Ukrainian forces to defeat them. From mid-April to January 21, the conflict had killed at least 5,086 people and injured at least 10,948 others, said the United Nations. \\"We fear that the real figure may be considerably higher,\\" the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said about the death toll in a report released Friday. At least 262 people were killed in the fighting from January 13 through Wednesday alone, the report said. Unrest in Ukraine began with protests in the country's capital last year after President Viktor Yanukovych, favoring closer ties to Russia, dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the European Union. After months of protests and days of deadly clashes between demonstrators and security personnel in Kiev, Parliament ousted Yanukovych in February. Weeks later, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula.

Question: Generate a 3-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms. Answer:","completion":"Title: Useful but Needs Improvement Rating: ★★★☆☆ I have been using the com.google.android.gms (Google Play Services) app for a while now, and I believe it's time to share my thoughts on it. While this app has proved to be a quite helpful tool that powers Google-related features and functions on my device, there are still some concerns that I'd like to address, so I have decided to give it a 3-star rating. First of all, let's talk about the positives. The Google Play Services app handles several important tasks like authentication of Google services, synchronization of contacts, and access to the latest user privacy settings. This app also enhances the overall app experience by providing much-needed APIs for other apps that rely on Google's services for smooth operation. However, I've experienced some issues and drawbacks that could use some attention. For instance, I've noticed that the app occasionally consumes more battery than it should, leaving my device drained sooner than expected. Moreover, the frequent updates sometimes cause compatibility issues with other apps, resulting in crashes or slow performance. Another drawback is the lack of transparency and control over the services and features. For instance, it's challenging to disable specific features that I don't use or have more control over the data being shared with Google. In conclusion, while com.google.android.gms is an essential app for Android devices that offers many useful services, I believe there's room for improvement to make it more user-friendly and efficient. Optimizations in battery consumption, addressing compatibility issues, and providing users with more control over their data would significantly improve the app experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Valerio Mezzanotti for The New York Times Eva Cavalli, Roberto Cavalli and Sharon Stone attend the amfAR dinner. More Photos » IF you have never seen Sharon Stone in the role of auctioneer, imagine her giving the performance of a lifetime, the part she was born to play. This is a woman who could shake a dime out of Ebenezer, as well as an extra holiday or two. So there was Ms. Stone on Saturday night at Milan Fashion Week, merely hours after Reuters reported she had been admitted to a hospital for a migraine suffered during the Fendi show, vamping in a black halter gown by Roberto Cavalli that resembled nothing more than a bra top with a skirt attached by panels of fringe. At a black-tie benefit for amfAR, the AIDS research foundation, she sold a Damien Hirst etching for 110,000, followed by a six-liter gold-leaf bottle of Moët & Chandon that someone bought for 20,000 and promptly returned for her to sell again. Wait, scratch that. Did Ms. Stone say dollars? That should have been euros! An M.C. constantly had to correct her all night. “Someone help the blonde with a pain problem,” Ms. Stone said, joking about herself, before turning to an aggressive bidder and adding, “I liked you from the moment I saw you.” Another bidder declined her advances, shaking his head. “Don’t give me that little Italian thing,” she said. “I don’t like it.” Out front, near the entrance to La Permanente gallery, the designer Kenneth Cole, who is the board chairman of amfAR, was sweating amid a throng of Italian actresses and socialites to make sure the arrivals went smoothly. Photographers went wild for Mr. Cavalli, chanting “Ro-bert-oh! Ro-bert-oh!” as if he were the goalie for Inter Milan. Mr. Cole, a tireless organizer of such fund-raising events, did not appear to relax for one moment. Does he ever have any fun at these things? “Fun is overrated,” he said. Mr. Cavalli, meanwhile, has been something of a Fashion Week gadfly, having picked a fight with Giorgio Armani over the politics of scheduling shows. He called Mr. Armani a “little king.” Mr. Armani told him to hush up. “We have to show what we have in our minds and our hearts and our fantasies to bring fashion back to Milan like it was 20 years ago,” Mr. Cavalli said. Actually, apart from the presence of newer designers like Dan and Dean Caten of the label DSquared, newer models like Jessica Stam and Lindsey Wixson, and a smattering of celebrities such as Solange Knowles (in a smashing white gown with an open back by Rubin Singer), this party was vintage 1992. Buckets of vodka and mixers were piled around velvet sofas bearing the Fendi logo, and crystal ashtrays were everywhere. So many people were smoking cigarettes at their tables that it became difficult to see across the room. Ms. Stone, in what must have been her second hour on stage, began to flag, her voice sounding more like that of an aging lounge singer than a temptress. At one point, she flopped down on a lip-shaped couch that was also for sale. The party raised more than 1.1 million for AIDS research in the end; Mr. Cavalli bought the couch for 35,000 euros. “This is what I’d like you to do,” Ms. Stone said. “I’d like you to get really drunk and flirt with someone at your table, because that’s what I’m going to do.” Then she took her seat, next to Mr. Cavalli.

Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a string that only contains single digit numbers spelled out. The input string will not contain spaces between the different numbers. Your task is to return the number that the string spells out. The string will spell out each digit of the number for example '1726' will be 'oneseventwosix' instead of 'one thousand seven hundred six'. Problem:twofivesixeightonesevenzerothree Solution:","completion":"This problem is essentially asking to convert the spelled out single digit numbers into numeric form, without any spaces in between them. It seems that the input is a string composed of several instances of single digits written out in full in English (\\"one\\", \\"two\\", \\"three\\", etc.), linked together without spaces. The task is to convert these spelled out numbers back into the numerical representation. Guidelines: - The input will be a single string, without spaces. - The string will contain only English words for single digit numbers. - The goal is to return the number that these spelled out numbers form together, not considering them as separate entities but as digits of the same number. For example, \\"threetwo\\" should be converted to 32, not \\"3, 2\\". According to these guidelines, here is a solution to the task: 1. Create a dictionary where keys are the English words for numbers from zero to nine and values are respective numbers (0 to 9). \`\`\`python numbers_dict = {\\"zero\\": 0, \\"one\\": 1, \\"two\\": 2, \\"three\\": 3, \\"four\\": 4, \\"five\\": 5, \\"six\\": 6, \\"seven\\": 7, \\"eight\\": 8, \\"nine\\": 9} \`\`\` 2. Make a loop over the dictionary keys and replace every occurrence of the key in the input string with its corresponding value. \`\`\`python def spell_out_to_digit(s): for word, number in numbers_dict.items(): s = s.replace(word, str(number)) return int(s) \`\`\` 3. Using this function for the problem we have: \`\`\`python print(spell_out_to_digit('twofivesixeightonesevenzerothree')) # 25681703 \`\`\` This output is the correct translation of the concatenated low digits spelled out into its numeric form, by simply replacing each instance of spelled out low digits contained into the input string with the actual numeric digits they represent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tammy learned about fish reproduction. But I can use this background: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.

A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it can be determined that Moe didn't learn about fish eggs being fertilized inside of the female body. The reason is that Moe learned about mammalian reproduction in school, which differs significantly from fish reproduction. Mammals, unlike most fish, give birth to live young after internal fertilization, and they do not lay eggs. Tammy, on the other hand, learned about fish reproduction. This means she would have acquired knowledge about the various methods of fish reproduction, including egg-laying and fertilization processes that can occur either inside or outside the female fish's body.

For starters, a kitschy spelling doesn't make you a German restaurant, and to be fair, I don't think that's what the owners had intended, so I think those that would judge this restaurant's German authenticity are a little off the mark. With that said, what I'm about to say may make a lot of fanboys and girls very upset, as I understand that Chef Curry is a star in the valley, and I've been to a few of his past endeavors and quite agree that the mans talents are undeniable...but for me and my party, Brat Haus seemed to have everything down except for the food. The decor is a very cool blend of modernist artsy, and industrial minimalist. Very cool. The service might have been a stretched a little thin, like one reviewer also mentioned, we were sitting at one of the few tables inside, when most of the servers tables were presumably outside, and we felt a little bit like we were at the \\"kids\\" table during thanksgiving dinner...a little slapdash \\"heres your order and your check, thanks for coming.\\" First, the good. There is no shame in the beer list. No shame, Weihenstephaner Hefe, yes please...anytime I can. La Fin du Monde from Unibrou? absolutely...and these are probably two of the most commercial beers out of their selection, so if you've never heard of them, you can imagine what kind of paradise lies waiting for the average beer geek. Just wish those beers had gotten to us a little sooner, and that we might have been asked if we wanted another round. Again, when your at the kids table, just a sip of thanksgiving wine is all you can hope for. If we could rate the place on their beer and fries alone, this would be a whole different review. Belgian Fries, truffle aoli...they honestly couldn't have been more perfect. But it should be about the brats, yes? Partly on our failure, we went straight to the out of the box gourmet section. We had the rattlesnake rippers (rattlesnake sausage) , and the duck duck dates (Date and duck sausage), our logic being we can make beer brats at home, (Damn good ones mind you, if I don't say so myself. but, I guess I just did.), point being we decided to forego the mundane and see what an accomplished Chef known for his skill with cured meats could whip up instead. This was in retrospect a mistake. Both the rattlesnake and the duck at the end of it all, had us craving some good ole beer brats instead. We found these two dogs, uninspired and not nearly as exciting as the quirky names or exotic meats might suggest. The rattlesnake. tasting like dry chicken, was insufficiently seasoned, moist less, and awkwardly skinny in a consequently overwhelmingly sized bun. We could taste neither duck nor dates, in the Duck, Duck Dates sausage, and we had already polished off the fries before the stark realization set in that these dogs were not going to get even close to filling us up. Sharing our disappointments with each other, our party tried to place our proverbial fingers on the source of our ennui, and realized that everything was under seasoned, and we had failed in choosing the appropriate toppings for our peculiar dogs. (You have to pick one before they arrive) We chose pickled red onions, and spicy peppers. We agreed that given the Chefs history, we would have liked to see more of an active hand in his condiment pairings, rather than see a short list of condiments to choose from, i.e....we recommend apricot onion chutney with the duck and date sausage, or better yet, not even a suggestion, but more of an insistence, showing the confidence to say, we know how this rattlesnake shows its best and thus have served it with this fill in the blank accouterment. Left to our own devices and not having known that we wouldn't have classic dog garnishment, i.e...ketchup, mustard, relish...we were left there with our skinny, dry, under seasoned wieners, some sad not so spicy peppers, which helped a little with flavor but not with the dryness...and nothing else. Dessert was the Drunken Date Cake, which was so blasu00e9, it had us all hunger games dueling for the measly scoop of vanilla ice-cream melting at its side. Total: 2 dogs, 2 beers, some fries, and one dessert: 43 Yelp rating system classifies 2 stars as \\"meh, Ive had better\\" and really thats the best way to describe this experience. If you decide to check out brat haus, my advice is to skip the fancy for now, go straight for the classic, and enjoy some great beers. We however, chose not to take the chance on ordering more, and decided to go and get something to eat.

Powell contended that it was not inconsistent to want to foster cooperation even with an organization like the Indonesian military, which has a history of human rights abuses. \\"If you get young officers, expose them to a military organization that is within a democratic political institution, such as the United States, then that rubs off on them,\\" he said. In Malaysia, Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led the country since 1981. The Malaysian foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, later told local reporters that Powell had proposed that American and Malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional training center in Malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities. His brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often criticized. The United States once distanced itself from Mahathir for strong-arm tactics with political rivals, and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected militants, including some who may be linked to al-Qaida, without trial. Powell said his discussions with Mahathir \\"touched on the case\\" of his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who is serving a 15-year sentence on charges of sodomy and abuse of power after trials that Powell said the United States had \\"always felt\\" were flawed.

Hint: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory.

As a youth, Golovkin would walk the streets with them, who went around picking fights for him with grown men. On July 20, 2012 it was announced that Golovkin would defend his titles against European champion and The Ring's #10-rated middleweight Grzegorz Proksa (28-1, 21 KOs) on September 1 at the Turning Stone Casino in Verona, New York.

Entering Alphaville in his Ford Mustang,[3] called a Ford Galaxie,[4] he poses as a journalist named Ivan Johnson, and claims to work for the Figaro-Pravda. He wears a tan overcoat that stores various items such as an M1911A1 Colt Commander automatic pistol. He carries a cheap Instamatic camera (new in 1965) with him and photographs everything he sees, particularly the things that would ordinarily be unimportant to a journalist. Caution is, in fact, on a series of missions. First, he searches for the missing agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); second, he is to capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Professor von Braun (Howard Vernon); lastly, he aims to destroy Alphaville and its dictatorial computer, Alpha 60. Alpha 60 is a sentient computer system created by von Braun which is in complete control of all of Alphaville. Alpha 60 has outlawed free thought and individualist concepts like love, poetry, and emotion in the city, replacing them with contradictory concepts or eliminating them altogether. One of Alpha 60's dictates is that \\"people should not ask 'why', but only say 'because'.\\" People who show signs of emotion (weeping at the death of a wife, or smiling) are presumed to be acting illogically, and are gathered up, interrogated, and executed. In an image reminiscent of George Orwell's concept of Newspeak, there is a dictionary in every hotel room that is continuously updated when words that are deemed to evoke emotion become banned. As a result, Alphaville is an inhuman, alienated society. Caution is told that men are killed at a ratio of fifty to every one woman executed. He also learns that Swedes, Germans and Americans assimilate well with Alphaville. Images of the EÂ =Â mcÂ² and E = hf equations are displayed several times throughout the film as symbols of the regime of logical science that rules Alphaville.

Q: In my early 20s, I was a one-on-one aide for a couple of teenagers with cerebral palsy. With the first one, I was hired by and worked for the family. I picked the teen up from school every day and took care of him until he was in bed for the night. When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym. So I had to push this kid in a wheelchair around the track for about 15 minutes each day, until the other kids were all done and off doing the next activity. Then he and I were able to leave gym class and go do some physical therapy in his own little room just for that. Because, you know… lawyers and rules. According to the above context, answer the following question. When did the author work as an aide to someone with spastic quadriplegia? Select from the following. (I) when they were hired by the teen's family. (II) When they took a job with the local school district. (III) not enough information. (IV) when they were in high school.

Review title: Pointless Product review: DO NOT BUY FOR RESTAURANT!!!I ordered this and set it aside because I didn't need it right away. A week or two later I started using it, and within a few minutes it just started giving ridiculous and random readouts. Biggest waste of money I've ever had. Plus, it ended up in about 50 worth of lost product because we were unable to get accurate temperatures. Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Read and analyze the review The reviewer is expressing strong dissatisfaction with the product and states that it is a waste of money due to inaccurate readings. The reviewer also mentions that they experienced a loss of about 50 in their restaurant because of this issue. Step 2: Consider the context and relevance The product may be some kind of temperature measuring device or thermometer, possibly used in a restaurant for food safety purposes. As the review states, it is not suitable for use in a restaurant. Step 3: Evaluate how the review affects the decision to buy Given the strong negative sentiment expressed in the review, it would decrease the chances of buying the product. The reviewer is clearly warning others not to buy the product, which can impact the overall perception of the product's quality and performance. Step 4: Determine the potential risk of purchasing the product The risk of purchasing the product is higher, considering the reviewer shared their experience of losing 50 worth of products due to inaccurate readings. If the product is being used in a restaurant, such inaccuracies in readings could lead to a larger loss. Conclusion: The chances of buying the product would decrease as a result of this review, primarily due to the strong negative sentiments and concerns about the product's effectiveness and potential loss related to its use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A year and a half after deploying National Guard troops to counter illegal immigration on the Southwest border, the Department of Homeland Security and Pentagon told Congress Tuesday they are cutting the number of troops and changing their mission. The drawdown, which the department characterized as a \\"transition,\\" will begin in January and should be completed by March. Several lawmakers told CNN the number of National Guard troops on the border will be cut from 1,200 with responsibilities mainly on the ground to 300 who will support the border mission in the air. The Department of Homeland Security said the change is possible because of a jump in the number of Border Patrol officers in the region, an increase in technology and a drop in apprehensions at the border. But several lawmakers criticized the move, saying conditions on the Southwest border merit more troops, not fewer. A deployment of 1,200 troops was \\"not enough to begin with, although they are doing as good a job as they can,\\" Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, told CNN. Poe said the United States has \\"operational control\\" of only 44 percent of the Southwestern border. \\"That's not success,\\" Poe said. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, agreed. \\"If the Obama administration's goal is border security, their actions undermine their objective,\\" he said in a written statement. \\"We should keep guardsmen on the ground until the Border Patrol can gain operational control of the majority of the U.S.-Mexico border.\\" But Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, supported the drawdown. \\"While I appreciate the service of our National Guard forces, requiring them to engage in border law enforcement activity is not cost effective,\\" he said in a statement. The Homeland Security Department said that in the fiscal year ending October 1, Border Patrol apprehensions of illegal immigrants -- a key indicator of the amount of illegal immigration -- decreased to 340,252, down 53 percent since fiscal year 2008. Since 2004, the size of the Border Patrol has doubled to 21,444. In a news release announcing the change, the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon did not cite exactly how many troops would be pulled from the border, but said the \\"new strategic approach\\" will increase border security. That approach includes \\"adding a number of new multi-purpose aerial assets\\" equipped with the \\"latest surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.\\" In addition, the National Guard will provide helicopters and planes to the Border Patrol, \\"allowing for faster response capabilities,\\" the news release said. \\"I did not understand or get the impression they are going to add any equipment; they're going to use what they have,\\" said Poe, who was briefed on the changes. The Defense Department budget for the border would drop by half, from 120 million to 60 million, congressional staffers said they were told. Specifics about the ramped-up aerial surveillance are still being worked out, the staffers said. Poe said he plans to fight the change. \\"I'll ask the president to reconsider and then try to figure a way, bipartisan, to show that this is not a wise move,\\" he said. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The Department of Homeland Security and Pentagon announced a reduction in National Guard troops deployed for countering illegal immigration on the Southwest border. The number of troops will decrease from 1,200 to 300, transitioning from ground-focused operations to supporting the border mission in the air.

This decision is attributed to the increased number of Border Patrol officers and technology, as well as a drop in apprehensions at the border. However, lawmakers like Reps.

Hint: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH.

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life.

The group's social worker Miss Finch (performed by Cheryl Wagner and voiced by Sally Kellerman) is sent to Sesame Street to find Big Bird a worthy bird family and bring him to the selected family. After leaving Sesame Street, New York City, New York, Miss Finch brings Big Bird to the fictional town of Oceanview, Illinois to live with a family of dodos. The dodos all think very poorly of non birds, even saying he should have a bird as a best friend instead of Mr. Snuffleupagus (who is currently watching over Big Bird's nest). This causes him much distress. When Big Bird runs away from his new home and ends up on the news, Miss Finch tells Kermit the Frog that she will reclaim him.

To do this, subtract 279 from both sides of the equation. 50*l + 279 - 279 = -371 - 279 50*l = -650 Step 3: Solve for l. Now that we have isolated the term with the variable (50*l), we can solve for l by dividing both sides of the equation by 50.

Jurnaliştii argumentează că presa ar fi putut fi reglementată prin legile existente şi că cei care au elaborat noua lege nu s-au consultat cu ei. Translate to English English:","completion":"Journalists argue that the press could have been regulated through existing laws and that those who drafted the new law did not consult with them. A deeper insight into this viewpoint is that many journalists believe that the new law that has been implemented is unnecessary and restrictive towards their profession. Instead, they suggest that pre-existing legislation could have been used, modified, or reinforced to regulate the press effectively without imposing new restrictions or guidelines. Past evidence demonstrates that a large number of professionals in the journalism field feel disenfranchised or overlooked when governmental or regulatory entities enact changes to laws that oversee their work, in particular, without involving them in the legislative process. This is particularly true when the new laws partially or entirely transform the landscape of their work environment and the core aspects of their profession. If we go further into the argument that the existing laws could have regulated the press, it might imply that the journalists observe the new regulations as an extreme measure when the solution could have been found within the already established legal system. Journalists could feel that their knowledge and understanding of the intricacies of their work and its interaction with the law could have been helpful in creating a comprehensive and effective law. It's not uncommon for those in the field to feel that they are best positioned to provide input on laws that will directly affect their work as they have first-hand experience with the practicalities involved. The press plays a tremendous role in society, disseminating information, keeping the public informed on crucial issues and events, and serving as a watchdog over government and other powerful entities. Therefore, they form a delicate balance with the law, which seeks to regulate the press for fairness, ethics, and national security reasons. In an ideal world, this balance would be achieved through collaborative conversations between lawmakers, regulatory bodies, and journalists. Thus, the lament about the lack of consultation resonates deeply as journalists feel sidelined in decisions that directly impact their work and, to a larger extent, democracy. In conclusion, the statement implies a feeling of being overlooked or undervalued amongst journalists. It illustrates their belief in the capabilities of existing laws to regulate the press effectively and a sense of frustration and concern due to a perceived lack of consultation during the new law drafting process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Washington Post's Jason Rezaian sentenced in Iran The verdict and the sentence are not yet known. Rezaian's family said the lack of information \\"follows an unconscionable pattern by Iranian authorities of silence, obfuscation, delay and a total lack of adherence to international law, as well as Iranian law.\\" ISNA quoted the judiciary spokesman, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni Ejei, as saying that \\"this person has been sentenced, but I don't know the details of the verdict.\\" Mohseni Ejei said the ruling may be appealed by Rezaian or his lawyer in the next 20 days. Rezaian, The Washington Post's bureau chief in Tehran, was detained in Iran in July 2014 and has languished in jail for over a year despite an international outcry. Uncertainty continued to reign on Sunday. The statement from his family called it \\"another sad chapter in his 14-month illegal imprisonment and opaque trial process.\\" And Doug Jehl, the foreign editor of the Post, said on CNN's \\"Reliable Sources\\" that the mysterious announcement shows that \\"what we're seeing unfolding here is sham.\\" \\"For Iran to say that there's been a verdict but it's not final simply suggests, again, that this is not a matter for the courts, it's a matter that's being decided in the political spheres in Iran,\\" he said. John Kirby, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said the U.S. government has no firm information on the apparent ruling. \\"We're monitoring the situation closely, and we continue to call for all charges against Jason to be dropped and for him to be immediately released,\\" Kirby said. Timeline: Jason Rezaian in Iranian prison Rezaian's case has become a symbol of the increased dangers faced by journalists around the world. Rezaian, who has dual Iranian and American citizenship, has been detained in Iran longer than any American journalist in the past. Marty Baron, the paper's top editor, said it is unclear whether the apparent sentence has even been shared with Rezaian or his lawyer. \\"This vague and puzzling statement by the government of Iran only adds to the injustice that has surrounded Jason's case since his arrest 15 months ago,\\" Baron said in a statement. Rezaian's ordeal began last July when he and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, were taken into custody. She was later released. For months Rezaian was not told of the charges against him. Prosecutors eventually accused him of espionage and other offenses, including \\"collaborating with a hostile government\\" and \\"propaganda against the establishment,\\" according to the Post. The newspaper steadfastly denied the allegations, calling them \\"the product of fertile and twisted imaginations.\\" And the State Department called the charges \\"absurd.\\" Rezaian's trial began in May under a cloak of secrecy. Baron has called it a \\"sham\\" and the treatment of Rezaian a \\"travesty.\\" The trial reportedly concluded back in August with no announcement of a ruling. At times Rezaian has seemed like a pawn in a geopolitical faceoff. U.S. President Barack Obama faced criticism from some for concluding a deal between major world powers and Iran over Iran's nuclear program without any pledge from Iran that it would release Rezaian and other Americans held in Iran. In a speech this summer, Obama mentioned Rezaian and other Americans \\"who are unjustly detained in Iran.\\" \\"Journalist Jason Rezaian should be released,\\" the President said. Who are the Americans detained in Iran? Boxing great Muhammad Ali, an American Muslim, also urged Tehran to free Rezaian on bail. \\"To my knowledge, Jason is a man of peace and great faith, a man whose dedication and respect for the Iranian people is evident in his work,\\" Ali said in a religiously worded statement issued in March. Iran's human rights chief, Mohammad Javad Larijani, told news outlet France 24 last year that he hoped Rezaian's case would come to a positive conclusion. \\"Let us hope that this fiasco will end on good terms,\\" he said. The Post has sought to keep world attention focused on the case. On Friday, it noted that Rezaian had been detained for 444 days -- \\"the same amount of time as U.S. government employees during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-1981.\\" The Post called this \\"a milestone significant in its injustice.\\" Jehl said on Sunday that the lack of a publicized ruling \\"suggests once again that Jason is not really a prisoner, he's a bargaining chip being used by the Iranian government to extract some concessions from the U.S.\\" Summary:","completion":"Iranian authorities claim to have sentenced imprisoned Washington Post journalist, Jason Rezaian, however, the precise details of the verdict remain unknown, leading Rezaian’s family to declare that this illustrates the \\"unconscionable pattern by Iranian authorities of silence, obfuscation, delay and a total lack of adherence to international law, as well as Iranian law.\\" Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief, was arrested in July 2014 and has since been held in jail, despite an international outcry.

Write a summary based on this article: Advertisement Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — Russia has sent advanced antiship cruise missiles to Syria, a move that illustrates the depth of its support for the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad, American officials said Thursday. Russia has previously provided a version of the missiles, called Yakhonts, to Syria. But those delivered recently are outfitted with an advanced radar that makes them more effective, according to American officials who are familiar with classified intelligence reports and would only discuss the shipment on the basis of anonymity. Unlike Scud and other longer-range surface-to-surface missiles that the Assad government has used against opposition forces, the Yakhont antiship missile system provides the Syrian military a formidable weapon to counter any effort by international forces to reinforce Syrian opposition fighters by imposing a naval embargo, establishing a no-fly zone or carrying out limited airstrikes. “It enables the regime to deter foreign forces looking to supply the opposition from the sea, or from undertaking a more active role if a no-fly zone or shipping embargo were to be declared at some point,” said Nick Brown, editor in chief of IHS Jane’s International Defense Review. “It’s a real ship killer.” Jeffrey White, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former senior American intelligence official, said Syria’s strengthened arsenal would “tend to push Western or allied naval activity further off the coast” and was also “a signal of the Russian commitment to the Syrian government.” The disclosure of the delivery comes as Russia and the United States are planning to convene an international conference that is aimed at ending the brutal conflict in Syria, which has killed more than 70,000. That conference is expected to be held in early June and to include representatives of the Assad government and the Syrian opposition. Secretary of State John Kerry has repeatedly said that it is the United States’ hope to change Mr. Assad’s “calculations” about his ability to hold on to power so that he will allow negotiations for a political solution to the conflict. Mr. Kerry indicated that he had raised the issue of Russian arms deliveries to Syria during his recent visit to Moscow, but declined to provide details. “I think we’ve made it crystal clear we would prefer that Russia was not supplying assistance,” he said. “That hasn’t changed.” American officials have been concerned that the flow of Russian and Iranian arms to Syria will buttress Mr. Assad’s apparent belief that he can prevail militarily. “This weapons transfer is obviously disappointing and will set back efforts to promote the political transition that is in the best interests of the Syrian people and the region,” Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the senior Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement on Thursday night. “There is now greater urgency for the U.S. to step up assistance to the moderate opposition forces who can lead Syria after Assad.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and the committee chairman, added in a statement, “Russia is offering cover to a despotic ruler and defending a bankrupt regime.” Syria ordered the coastal defense version of the Yakhont system from Russia in 2007 and received the first batteries in early 2011, according to Jane’s. The initial order covered 72 missiles, 36 launcher vehicles, and support equipment, and the systems have been displayed in the country. The batteries are mobile, which makes them more difficult to attack. Each consists of missiles, a three-missile launcher and a command-and-control vehicle. The missiles are about 22 feet long, carry either a high-explosive or armor-piercing warhead, and have a range of about 180 miles, according to Jane’s. They can be steered to a target’s general location by longer-range radars, but each missile has its own radar to help evade a ship’s defenses and home in as it approaches its target. Two senior American officials said that the most recent shipment contained missiles with a more advanced guidance system than earlier shipments. Russia has longstanding interests in Syria, including a naval base at the Mediterranean port of Tartus. As the Syria crisis has escalated, Russia has gradually augmented its naval presence in the region. In January, more than two dozen Russian warships sailed to the Black and Mediterranean Seas to take part in what the Defense Ministry said was to be the country’s largest naval exercise in decades, testing the ships’ ability to deploy outside Russian waters. A month later, after the Black Sea exercises ended, the Russian Defense Ministry news agency said that four large landing vessels were on their way to operations off the coast of Syria. “Based on the results of the navy exercises in the Black and Mediterranean seas,” the ministry said at the time, “the ministry leadership has taken a decision to continue combat duty by Russian warships in the Mediterranean.” Russia’s diplomatic support of Syria has also bolstered the Assad government. At the United Nations, the Russians recently blocked proposals that the Security Council mount a fact-finding trip to Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon to investigate the burgeoning flood of refugees, according to Western diplomats. Jordan had sought the United Nations visit to make the point that the refugee situation was a threat to stability in the region, but Russia said that the trip was beyond the mandate of the Security Council, diplomats said. When allegations that the Assad government had used chemical weapons surfaced, Russia also backed the Syrian government’s refusal to allow the United Nations to carry out a wide-ranging investigation inside Syria — which Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said was an attempt to “politicize the issue” and impose the “Iraqi scenario” on Syria. Russian officials have repeatedly said that in selling arms to Syria, they are merely fulfilling old contracts. But some American officials worry that the deliveries are intended to limit the United States’ options should it choose to intervene to help the rebels. Russia, for example, previously shipped SA-17 surface-to-air missiles to Syria. Israel carried out an airstrike against trucks that were transporting the weapons near Damascus in January. Israel has not officially acknowledged the raid but has said it is prepared to intervene militarily to prevent any “game changing” weapons from being shipped to Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group. More recently, Israeli and American officials have urged Russia not to proceed with the sale of advanced S-300 air defense weapons. The Kremlin has yielded to American entreaties not to provide S-300s to Iran. But the denial of that sale, analysts say, has increased the pressure within Russia’s military establishment to proceed with the delivery to Syria. ||||| Article Excerpt Russia has sent a dozen or more warships to patrol waters near its naval base in Syria, a buildup that U.S. and European officials see as a newly aggressive stance meant partly to warn the West and Israel not to intervene in Syria's bloody civil war. Russia's expanded presence in the eastern Mediterranean, which began attracting U.S. officials' notice three months ago, represents one of its largest sustained naval deployments since the Cold War. While Western officials say they don't fear an impending conflict with Russia's aged fleet, the presence adds a new source of potential danger for miscalculation in ... ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story CAIRO — The black flag of jihad flies over much of northern Syria. In the center of the country, pro-government militias and Hezbollah fighters battle those who threaten their communities. In the northeast, the Kurds have effectively carved out an autonomous zone. After more than two years of conflict, Syria is breaking up. A constellation of armed groups battling to advance their own agendas is effectively creating the outlines of separate armed fiefs. As the war expands in scope and brutality, its biggest casualty appears to be the integrity of the Syrian state. On Thursday, President Obama met in Washington with the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and once again pressed the idea of a top-down diplomatic solution. That approach depends on the rebels and the government agreeing to meet at a peace conference that was announced last week by the United States and Russia. “We’re going to keep increasing the pressure on the Assad regime and working with the Syrian opposition,” Mr. Obama said. “We are going to keep working for a Syria that is free of Assad’s tyranny.” Photo But as evidence of massacres and chemical weapons mounts, experts and Syrians themselves say the American focus on change at the top ignores the deep fractures the war has caused in Syrian society. Increasingly, it appears Syria is so badly shattered that no single authority is likely to be able to pull it back together any time soon. Instead, three Syrias are emerging: one loyal to the government, to Iran and to Hezbollah; one dominated by Kurds with links to Kurdish separatists in Turkey and Iraq; and one with a Sunni majority that is heavily influenced by Islamists and jihadis. “It is not that Syria is melting down — it has melted down,” said Andrew J. Tabler, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and author of “In the Lion’s Den: An Eyewitness Account of Washington’s Battle with Syria.” “So much has changed between the different parties that I can’t imagine it all going back into one piece,” Mr. Tabler said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Fueling the country’s breakup are the growing brutality of fighters on all sides and the increasingly sectarian nature of the violence. Recent examples abound. Pro-government militias have hit coastal communities, targeting Sunni Muslim civilians. Sunni rebel groups have attacked religious shrines of other sects. A video circulating this week showed a rebel commander in Homs cutting out an enemy’s heart and liver, and biting into the heart. Analysts say this shift in the nature of the violence will have a greater effect on the country’s future than territorial gains on either side by making it less likely that the myriad ethnic and religious groups that have long called Syria home will go back to living side by side. As the momentum seesaws back and forth between rebels and the government, the geographic divisions are hardening. After steadily losing territory to rebels during the first two years of the conflict, government forces have progressed on a number of key fronts in recent weeks, routing rebel forces in the southern province of Dara’a, outside Damascus and in the central city of Homs and its surrounding villages. Advertisement Continue reading the main story These victories not only reflect strategic shifts by government forces but also could further solidify the country’s divisions. Since mass defections of mostly conscripted soldiers shrank the government’s forces earlier in the uprising, it has largely given up on trying to reclaim parts of the country far from the capital, said Joseph Holliday, a fellow with the Institute for the Study of War in Washington. Instead, the government has focused on solidifying its grip on a strip of land that extends from the capital, Damascus, in the south, up to Homs in the country’s center and west to the coastal area heavily populated by Mr. Assad’s sect, the Alawites. Other than hitting them with airstrikes or artillery, Mr. Assad has made little effort to reclaim rebel-held areas in the country’s far north and east. Photo The character of those fighting for Mr. Assad has changed, too. As the uncommitted defected, the loyalists remained. “All of these defections and desertions basically created a more loyal and therefore more deployable core,” said Emile Hokayem, an analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, who is based in Dubai. “At least you know who is fighting for you.” Mr. Assad has also come to rely more heavily on paramilitary militias that draw largely from his Alawite sect and other minorities who consider him a bulwark against the rebels’ Islamism. More recently, fighters from Lebanon’s Shiite militant group Hezbollah have added extra muscle, especially in the border region near the town of Qusair, an area dotted with Shiite and Sunni villages that has seen intense fighting in recent months. This new focus on tightening his grip on the country’s center suits Mr. Assad fine, said Abdulrahim Mourad, a Lebanese politician and former Parliament member who visited Mr. Assad in Damascus last month. “He told jokes, was very funny,” Mr. Mourad said. “He was very relaxed and relieved.” In the void left by the government in the country’s north and east, rebel groups have seized swaths of territory and struggled to establish local administrations. Although the Obama administration and its allies share the rebels’ goal of removing Mr. Assad from power, they have little else in common with the many rebel brigades that define their struggle in Islamic terms and seek to replace Mr. Assad with an Islamic state. Among them is Jabhet al-Nusra, or the Nusra Front, the local branch of Al Qaeda, which the United States has blacklisted as a terrorist group. The war’s duration and the competition for resources have left the rebel movement itself deeply fractured. Few effective links exist between the rebels’ exile leader, Gen. Salim Idris, and the most powerful groups on the ground. And recent months have seen increasing fights among rebels, diminishing their ability to form a united front against the government. This week, the Islamist Shariah Commission in Aleppo went after rebels accused of looting. The council sent fighters to surround the group’s headquarters and arrested some of its members, confiscating trucks full of looted goods. The haul in one neighborhood included five washing machines and a television. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Another video, circulated this week, showed a Nusra Front leader in eastern Syria standing behind 11 bound and blindfolded captives. After announcing that they had been sentenced by an Islamic court for killing Syrians, he drew a pistol and shot them in the back of the head, one by one. Activists later identified the man as a Saudi citizen named Qaswara al-Jizrawi. They also determined that the executions took place months earlier since Mr. Jizrawi was killed in March in a gunfight between his and another rebel group that left dozens of people dead on both sides. In Syria’s northeastern Hassakeh Province, the country’s largest Kurdish majority area, residents have taken in Kurds fleeing violence elsewhere, expanded the teaching of the Kurdish language in schools and raised militias that have clashed with rebel brigades. Many local Kurds are linked to groups in Turkey and Iraq and hope to use the uprising to push for greater autonomy. These spreading fissures leave little optimism that Syria can be stitched back together under one leadership in the near future. “The only real outcome I see in the next 5 to 10 years is a series of cantons that agree to tactical cease-fires because they are tired of the bloodletting,” said Mr. Holliday, the analyst with the Institute for the Study of War. “That trajectory is in place, with or without Assad.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"The article reports that Russia has supplied Syria with advanced anti-ship cruise missiles, showing its deep support for President Bashar al-Assad's government, according to American officials. The upgraded missiles, referred to as \\"Yakhonts\\", have enhanced radar systems that make them more effective. They pose a significant threat to any international forces planning to impose a naval embargo, establish a no-fly zone, or conduct limited airstrikes to support Syrian opposition fighters. The escalation happens as Russia and the U.S. are planning an international conference aimed at ending the conflict in Syria. Heightened concerns exist that continued Russian and Iranian arms supplies to Syria will bolster Assad's confidence in a military victory.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who told his friend that he could certify that the offensive smell have been of the most head-and-stomach distending nature? is inside the article: By mid-1858 the problems with the Thames had been building for several years. In his novel Little Dorrit—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—Charles Dickens wrote that the Thames was \\"a deadly sewer ... in the place of a fine, fresh river\\". In a letter to a friend, Dickens said: \\"I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature\\", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that \\"in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep\\" on the Thames foreshore, and that \\"the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter\\". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged 34–36 °C (93–97 °F)—rising to 48 °C (118 °F) in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained on the banks of the river. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was so terrible. The press soon began calling the event \\"The Great Stink\\"; the leading article in the City Press observed that \\"Gentility of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso once inhales the stink can never forget it and can count himself lucky if he lives to remember it\\". A writer for The Standard concurred with the opinion. One of its reporters described the river as a \\"pestiferous and typhus breeding abomination\\", while a second wrote that \\"the amount of poisonous gases which is thrown off is proportionate to the increase of the sewage which is passed into the stream\\". The leading article in The Illustrated London News commented that: We can colonise the remotest ends of the earth; we can conquer India; we can pay the interest of the most enormous debt ever contracted; we can spread our name, and our fame, and our fructifying wealth to every part of the world; but we cannot clean the River Thames., can you guess it ?

Pick from: -The narrator is unknown to the subject .. -The narrator is a stranger to the subject .. -None of the above choices .. -The narrator is the guardian of the subject ..","completion":"The female subject may be so happy to see the narrator because the narrator is the guardian of the subject. In the provided text, the narrator refers to the female subject as \\"Sweet girl\\", which indicates an affectionate relationship or connection. Additionally, the narrator provides context where the female subject has stitches and underwent an ultrasound, revealing that the narrator is aware of the subject's medical history and is likely responsible for her well-being. The reference to \\"We're trying to make do without the cone collar\\" also suggests that the narrator is involved in taking care of the female subject since they are making decisions regarding her recovery and comfort. Furthermore, the subject's happiness to see the narrator likely stems from the bond between them, as a result of their guardian-role, and the comfort and safety this relationship brings. The other options, such as the narrator being unknown to the subject or being a stranger, would not elicit the same happiness and excitement. In contrast, a familiar and caring guardian provides a sense of security and companionship that would make the subject react as described. In conclusion, the text provides sufficient evidence to support that the female subject is happy to see the narrator because the narrator is her guardian and takes care of her well-being, ultimately providing her with a sense of security and emotional connection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Though there are about 400 languages from all over the world that are in danger of disappearing completely, Zoque-Ayapaneco, a native Mexican language is considered the most likely to become extinct, because the only two people in the world that speak it fluently do not talk to each other! And, it's not because they live in different countries, states or even villages. In fact, Manuel Segovia and Isidro Velazquez, both in their 70s, live within 500 yards of each other, in the village of Ayapa in the Southern Mexican State of Tabasco. They, however, refuse to communicate because they simply don't have much in common. Segovia is apparently a little flank in nature while Velazquez is described as shy. Segovia was at least able to talk in Zoque-Ayapanece with his brother until he passed away about 12 years ago, and still manages to practice it with his family, especially his son Manuel, who for the last five years has been trying to learn it and hopes to become fluent enough to teach it to the next generation. Velazquez on the other hand, has not been heard speaking in the language with anybody. The two men say the language used to be widely spoken in the village, but the younger generation _ it for fear of being laughed at, and it therefore began to die a slow death, as the elders passed away. Unless the two men get their acts together, the only way to hear the language will be to either listen to Manuel's not-so-fluent statement or see them talk in a documentary entitled \\"Lengua Muerta\\" (Dead Language) that is being filmed to capture Zoque Ayapaneco and 364 other native Mexican languages that are in a similar state.

By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, wireless communication, armoured cars, tanks, and aircraft. Infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100-man companies were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre; instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior NCO, were favoured. Artillery also underwent a revolution. In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, indirect fire with guns was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked field telephone. Counter-battery missions became commonplace, also, and sound detection was used to locate enemy batteries.","completion":"How did the modernization of technology and the reorganization of infantry formations during World War I influence the shift in tactics and communication by the end of 1917?"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is Plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional floras, their biodiversity, genetic diversity and fitness, the adaptation of plants to their environment, and their competitive or mutualistic interactions with other species. a good answer to this question? Options: (A). yes (B). no","completion":"(B). no While the given statement provides valuable information about the study of plant ecology, it does not directly answer the question regarding plant habitats. A more detailed and long answer addressing plant habitats would be as follows: Plant habitats refer to the various environments in which plants grow, thrive, and reproduce. These habitats can be natural or man-made and are determined by factors such as geography, climate, altitude, soil type, and species interactions. Understanding plant habitats is crucial because it helps ecologists and conservationists maintain, protect and restore ecosystems. Here is a comprehensive explanation of different types of plant habitats: 1. Terrestrial habitats: These are land-based habitats characterized by diverse plant communities. Terrestrial habitats can be broadly classified into the following categories: a. Forests: This habitat is dominated by a dense canopy of trees and an understory of smaller plants. Forests can be further categorized into tropical rainforests, temperate forests, and boreal forests, based on temperature, precipitation, and the type of vegetation. b. Grasslands: Grasslands are open areas dominated by grasses and herbs, with a minimal presence of trees. They can be further classified into savannas, temperate grasslands, and steppes, depending on the location and climate. c. Deserts: Deserts are areas with minimal precipitation, extreme temperature fluctuations, and sparse vegetation. Desert vegetation primarily consists of drought-tolerant species like cacti, succulents, and shrubs. d. Wetlands: Wetlands are areas where water covers or saturates the soil for extended periods. They support specialized plant communities, such as marshes, swamps, and bogs, that have adapted to the saturated conditions. 2. Aquatic habitats: These habitats are found in both freshwater and saltwater environments. The main types of aquatic habitats include: a. Lakes and ponds: These are standing freshwater habitats that support a variety of submerged, floating, and emergent plants. b. Rivers and streams: These are flowing freshwater systems with diverse plant communities adapted to various water flow rates and conditions. c. Estuaries: These are areas where freshwater meets saltwater and provide a unique habitat for salt-tolerant plant species. d. Coastal and marine habitats: These habitats are influenced by tides, waves, and saltwater. They can include shores, coral reefs, tidal pools, and seagrass meadows. 3. Anthropogenic habitats: These are human-created or modified environments that now support plant communities. Examples include agricultural fields, landscaped parks, and urban gardens. Overall, the diversity of plant habitats reflects the vast array of plant adaptations and ecological strategies employed by different species. These habitats are critical for the maintenance of life on Earth since plants are the primary producers and serve as the base of entire ecosystems. By studying plant habitats and understanding their responses to factors such as climate change, land use changes, and invasive species, scientists can develop strategies to protect and conserve these crucial ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world. - The Habsburg Monarchy or Empire, occasionally also styled as the Danubian Monarchy (\\"Donaumonarchie\\"), is an unofficial appellation among historians for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the between 1521 and 1780 and then by the successor branch of Habsburg-Lorraine until 1918. The Monarchy was a composite state composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The dynastic capital was Vienna, except from 1583 to 1611, when it was moved to Prague. From 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy was formally unified as the Austrian Empire, and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. - The Austrian Empire (modern spelling \\"\\") was an empire in Central Europe created out of the realms of the Habsburgs by proclamation in 1804. It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's great powers. Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]). It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the German Confederation. Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The \\"Ausgleich\\" of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. - Solomon Judah Löb HaKohen Rapoport ( June 1 , 1786 -- October 15 , 1867 ) ( Hebrew : ) , was a Galician rabbi and Jewish scholar . He was born in Lemberg , Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria . He married in 1810 Franziska Freide Heller , the daughter of the well - known Aryeh Leib Heller , and was instrumental in publishing the work Avnei Miluim of his father in law . He wrote both the index , sources and numerous comments . After various experiences in business , Rapoport became rabbi of Tarnopol ( 1837 ) and of Prague ( 1840 ) . He was one of the founders of the new Wissenschaft des Judentums movement . His chief work was the first part of an ( unfinished ) encyclopaedia ( Erekh Millin , 1852 ) . Equally notable were his biographies of Saadia Gaon , Nathan ( author of the Arukh ) , Hai Gaon , Eleazar Kalir and others . Thrown upon his own resources about 1817 , Rapoport became the collector of the meat - tax on farmers . He had already given evidence of marked critical ability , though his writings previously published were of a light character -- poems and translations . His critical talent , however , soon revealed itself . In 1824 he wrote an article for Bikkure ha - ' Ittim on the independent Jewish tribes of Arabia and Abyssinia . Though this article gained him some recognition , a more permanent impression was made by his work on Saadia Gaon and his times ( published in the same journal in 1829 ) , the first of a series of biographical works on the medieval Jewish sages . Because of this work he received recognition in the scholarly world and gained many enthusiastic friends , especially S. D. Luzzatto . After the fashion in rabbinic circles , Rapoport was known by an acronym \`\` Shir '' , formed by the initial letters of his Hebrew name Shelomo Yehuda Rapoport ( Shir literally means \`\` song '' in Hebrew ) - The First Partition of Poland took place in 1772 as the first of three partitions that ended the existence of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1795. Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries. With Poland unable to effectively defend itself, and with foreign troops already inside the country, the Polish parliament (Sejm) ratified the partition in 1773 during the Partition Sejm convened by the three powers. - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the nation's size and the Commonwealth disappeared as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. - The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, also known as Galicia or Austrian Poland, became a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy as a result of the First Partition of Poland in 1772, when it became a Kingdom under Habsburg rule. From 1804 to 1918 it was a crownland of the Austrian Empire. After the reforms of 1867, it became an ethnic Pole-administered autonomous unit under the Austrian crown. The country was carved from the entire south-western part of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. Among the many ceremonial titles of the princes of Hungary was \\"ruler of Galicia and Lodomeria\\". - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south. Bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north. The total area of Poland is , making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. With a population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous country in the world, the 8th most populous country in Europe and the sixth most populous member of the European Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, and its capital and largest city is Warsaw. Other metropolises include Kraków, Wrocaw, Pozna, Gdask and Szczecin. - In Judaism, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah.

Given the question: Information: - Virgin Records is a major record label first founded by English entrepreneur Richard Branson, Simon Draper, Nik Powell and musician Tom Newman in 1972. The company grew to be a worldwide phenomenon over time with the success of its platinum performers such as Janet Jackson, Roy Orbison, Devo, Genesis, Keith Richards, the Human League, Culture Club, Simple Minds, Lenny Kravitz, dc Talk, the Smashing Pumpkins, Mike Oldfield, Spice Girls and more on their list of artists. It was later sold to Thorn EMI in 1992. - Michael Gordon \\"Mike\\" Oldfield (born 15 May 1953) is an English musician and composer. His work blends progressive rock with world, folk, classical, electronic, ambient, and new-age music. His biggest commercial success is the 1973 album \\"Tubular Bells\\"which launched Virgin Records and became a hit in America after its opening was used as the theme for the film \\"The Exorcist\\". He also recorded the 1983 hit single \\"Moonlight Shadow\\" and a rendition of the Christmas piece \\"In Dulci Jubilo\\". - Universal Music Group, Inc. (also known as Universal Music Group Recordings, Inc. and abbreviated as UMG) is an American-French global music corporation that is a subsidiary of the Paris-based French media conglomerate Vivendi. UMG's global corporate headquarters are in Santa Monica, California. - Musica universalis (literally universal music), also called Music of the spheres or Harmony of the Spheres, is an ancient philosophical concept that regards proportions in the movements of celestial bodiesthe Sun, Moon, and planetsas a form of \\"musica\\" (the Medieval Latin term for music). This \\"music\\" is not usually thought to be literally audible, but a harmonic, mathematical or religious concept. The idea continued to appeal to thinkers about music until the end of the Renaissance, influencing scholars of many kinds, including humanists. Further scientific exploration has determined specific proportions in some orbital motion, described as orbital resonance. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - Island Records is a Jamaican-English record label that operates as a division of the Universal Music Group (UMG). It was founded by Chris Blackwell, Graeme Goodall and Leslie Kong in Jamaica in 1959. Blackwell sold the label to PolyGram in 1989. Both Island and another label recently acquired byPolyGram, A&M Records, were both at the time the largest independent record labels in history, with Island in particular having exerted a major influence on the progressive UK music scene in the early 1970s. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - In celestial mechanics, an orbital resonance occurs when two orbiting bodies exert a regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other, usually because their orbital periods are related by a ratio of two small integers. The physics principle behind orbital resonance is similar in concept to pushing a child on a swing, where the orbit and the swing both have a natural frequency, and the other body doing the \\"pushing\\" will act in periodic repetition to have a cumulative effect on the motion. Orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies, i.e., their ability to alter or constrain each other's orbits. In most cases, this results in an \\"unstable\\" interaction, in which the bodies exchange momentum and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists. Under some circumstances, a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting, so that the bodies remain in resonance. Examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of Jupiter's moons Ganymede, Europa and Io, and the 2:3 resonance between Pluto and Neptune. Unstable resonances with Saturn's inner moons give rise to gaps in the rings of Saturn. The special case of 1:1 resonance (between bodies with similar orbital radii) causes large Solar System bodies to eject most other bodies sharing their orbits; this is part of the much more extensive process of clearing the neighbourhood, an effect that is used in the current definition of a planet. - EMI (officially EMI Group Limited, originally an initialism for Electric and Musical Industries and often known as EMI Records and EMI Music) was a British multinational conglomerate founded in March 1931 and was based in London. At the time of its break-up in 2012, it was the fourth-largest business group and family of record labels in the recording industry and was one of the big four record companies (now the big three). Its EMI Records Ltd. group of record labels included EMI Records, Parlophone, Virgin Records and Capitol Records. EMI also had a major publishing arm, EMI Music Publishingalso based in London with offices globally. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Music of the Spheres is an album by English musician Mike Oldfield , released in the United Kingdom on 17 March 2008 . The album , Oldfield 's second album with Mercury Records and his first classical work , is based on the concept of a celestial Musica universalis . The album features New Zealand soprano Hayley Westenra ( on \`\` On My Heart '' ) and Chinese pianist Lang Lang on six tracks . Music of the Spheres was nominated for a Classical Brit Award in 2009 . - Tubular Bells is the first album by English musician Mike Oldfield, recorded when he was 19 and released in 1973 when he was 20. - The term harmonic in its strictest sense describes any member of the harmonic series. The term is employed in various disciplines, including music and acoustics, electronic power transmission, radio technology, etc. It is typically applied to repeating signals, such as sinusoidal waves. A harmonic of such a wave is a wave with a frequency that is a positive integer multiple of the frequency of the original wave, known as the fundamental frequency. The original wave is also called 1st harmonic, the following harmonics are known as higher harmonics. As all harmonics are periodic at the fundamental frequency, the sum of harmonics is also periodic at that frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency is 50 Hz, a common AC power supply frequency, the frequencies of the first three higher harmonics are 100 Hz (2nd harmonic), 150 Hz (3rd harmonic), 200 Hz (4th harmonic) and any addition of waves with these frequencies is periodic at 50 Hz. - Mercury Records is an American-based record label owned by Universal Music Group. In the United States, it operates through Island Records; in the UK, it is distributed by Virgin EMI Records. - \\"Moonlight Shadow\\" is a song written and performed by English multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield, released as a single in May 1983 by Virgin Records, and included in the album \\"Crises\\" of the same year. The vocals were performed by Scottish vocalist Maggie Reilly, who had been collaborating with Mike Oldfield since 1980. It is Oldfield's most successful single, reaching number one on a number of charts around Europe. 'music of the spheres ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'genre'?

Please answer the following question: Process: - One type of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air - Some scientists believe that releasing too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is one of the causes of global warming - This upsets the balance of the carbon cycle - The ozone layer helps protect us from harmful rays from the sun - It is getting damaged from air pollution such as methane gas from livestock and CFCs from spray cans - Acid rain is created when gasses such as sulfur dioxide get high into the atmosphere - The wind can blow these gasses for miles and then they get washed out of the air when it rains - This rain is called acid rain and can damage forests and kill fish. Question: suppose planting more trees happens, how will it affect LESS bad effects of pollution. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: less To answer this question, let's break down the process of how planting more trees can affect pollution: 1. Trees absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. By increasing the number of trees, there will be more CO2 removed from the atmosphere. This helps in reducing the excess CO2 and restoring the balance of the carbon cycle. 2. With a reduction in excess CO2, the greenhouse effect can be somewhat mitigated. This can aid in slowing down global warming, which is believed to be caused by the excess buildup of greenhouse gases like CO2. 3. Although planting more trees does not directly affect the ozone layer, it can contribute to reducing the overall levels of air pollution. This includes the pollutants that are responsible for damaging the ozone layer, such as methane and CFCs. 4. Lastly, trees can act as a natural filter for some of the pollutants that cause acid rain, like sulfur dioxide. As the trees absorb these pollutants, there will be a lesser amount getting into the atmosphere, which can eventually lead to a decrease in acid rain. In summary, planting more trees can have a positive impact on reducing the severity of some of the harmful effects of pollution.

TOKYO — Moody’s, the credit ratings agency, lowered Japan’s credit rating by one notch on Wednesday, warning that frequent changes in administration, weak prospects for economic growth and its recent natural and nuclear disasters made it difficult for the government to pare down its huge debt. Hours after the downgrade, the government announced a 100 billion credit facility to help the Japanese economy ride out a spike in the yen in recent weeks amid the global market turmoil, which has battered Japan’s export-led economy. “Taking into account that there is a lopsided rise in the yen, I felt that swift measures were needed,” Yoshihiko Noda, the finance minister, told reporters. Moody’s Investors Service lowered Japan’s grade by one step to Aa3, the fourth-highest rating, the company said in a statement. The downgrade brings Moody’s rating for Japan in line with Standard & Poor’s, which lowered the country’s grade by one notch to AA-minus in January, the fourth highest on its scale. Moody’s had put Japan on review for a downgrade in May. The action comes after a round of downgrades by major ratings agencies of sovereign debt, and amid concern that the debt crisis in Europe could escalate. On Aug. 5, S.& P. cut the sovereign debt rating of the United States for the first time in the country’s history. Markets in Tokyo largely shrugged off the downgrade, the latest in a line of many. Trust in Japanese government debt “remains unwavering,” Japan’s finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, told reporters after the downgrade. Still, the move, a week before the country’s ruling party is to select a new prime minister, could put additional pressure on the incoming administration to balance budgets. The government financing of the recovery from the March 11 earthquake, tsunami and subsequent nuclear crisis is expected to reach as high as 10 trillion yen (130 billion). Even before the disasters, Japan’s debt was expected to soar to almost 220 percent of its gross domestic product next year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which would rank it as the largest debt-to-G.D.P. ratio in the world. Japan, however, has long been able to borrow at low nominal rates because of unwavering appetite by domestic investors for government debt. Moody’s said that it was worried by large budget deficits and the buildup of government debt. Frequent change in leadership had prevented the government from pursuing long-term fiscal reform, the agency said, while the recent disasters had delayed recovery. Meanwhile, weak prospects for economic growth were also hampering efforts to curb the country’s debt burden, the agency said. Deflation and sluggish growth has long weighed on Japan’s economy, eroding the country’s tax base and forcing the government to issue debt to finance its budget. Meanwhile, spending on pensions and social welfare has soared as the country’s population ages. The global economic crisis further darkened Japan’s economic outlook, as has the recent tsunami and nuclear accident. Global market turmoil in recent weeks has also wreaked havoc with the Japanese economy, driving up the value of the yen and hurting its export-led economy. The credit facility unveiled on Wednesday aims to spur Japanese spending on corporate acquisitions and resources overseas, according to a statement released by the Finance Ministry. By spending yen for dollars and other currencies, the ministry hopes that the currency will weaken somewhat. A strong yen hurts Japanese exporters because it makes their goods less competitive and erodes the value of their overseas earnings when repatriated into yen. The ministry also said it would step up monitoring of currency markets by asking financial institutions to report on positions held by their currency dealers. Prime Minister Naoto Kan, meanwhile, is expected to step down by the end of the month amid criticism of his handling of the response to the disasters, making way for Japan’s fifth prime minister in six years. Mr. Noda, the finance minister, is among a field of candidates to replace Mr. Kan. He has supported more aggressive steps, including raising taxes, to tackle the country’s debt. Debate over Japan’s finances has been sidelined by the country’s recovery and reconstruction needs, however. ||||| Credit ratings agency Moody's criticised the instability at the top of Japanese politics on Tuesday as it slashed the country's credit rating and warned that its mountain of debt needed to be tackled. Moody's cut Japan's rating by one notch to Aa3, its fourth highest rating, and said a tougher deficit reduction plan was urgently needed. The move came just hours before Japan took fresh steps to help corporations cope with the strength of the yen, including a 100bn (£60bn) fund to help fund overseas acquisitions. Japan has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio of any country in the world, with its borrowings estimated to hit 233% of annual economic output in 2011. Moody's said the rapid turnover of Japanese prime ministers – five different men have held the job since the credit crunch began in August 2007 – had prevented the government from turning \\"long-term economic and fiscal strategies into effective and durable policies\\". Naoto Kan, the current prime minister, is expected to resign next week, triggering yet another leadership battle – and potentially dealing another blow to Japan's debt-reduction plans. \\"A divided Diet [the Japanese parliament] and tensions within the ruling Democratic party of Japan risk both the timing and implementation of the reform plan. Indeed, the imminent change in the party's presidency and the election of a new prime minister reflect the factious nature of the country's politics,\\" Moody's warned. Kan had proposed a fiscal consolidation plan this year, after March's devastating earthquake added to the country's economic problems. This included doubling the sales tax later this decade. Moody's argues that more needs to be done to achieve a primary budget surplus by 2020. Otherwise, it said, \\"even under the government's more vigorous and optimistic economic growth scenario, a decline in the debt-burden trajectory would remain elusive\\". The downgrade did not alarm traders as most of Japan's debt is bought by domestic investors, meaning it is less reliant on the international credit markets. The Nikkei 225 closed 1.07% lower at 8639.61. Moody's told reporters in Tokyo that it did not see the eurozone debt crisis spreading to Japan, and maintained a \\"stable\\" outlook on the country's debt. Recent twists in the financial crisis have driven up the value of the yen to record levels, hurting Japanese exporters. Finance minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to take \\"decisive action\\" to prevent speculators pushing the yen higher, as he announced that 100bn of credit will be made available to companies to help them borrow cheaply and invest overseas. Noda also stepped up the monitoring of foreign exchange positions held by currency dealers. \\"We decided to compile the package to show our strong determination that we will act if current yen rises persist, or if the yen rises further,\\" Noda said. The package received a lacklustre reception in the financial markets, though, where there was disappointment that Japan had not intervened in the foreign exchange markets to actively push its currency lower, as it did three weeks ago. The yen rose slightly, hitting ¥76.53 to the dollar. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Moody's, a credit ratings agency, lowered Japan's credit rating because they are worried that the country's government has had many changes and is having a hard time with its big debt.

Тушь для ресниц Translate to English","completion":"Mascara for Eyelashes Mascara for eyelashes is a cosmetic product used primarily to enhance the appearance of the eyes by lengthening, volumizing, and darkening the eyelashes. It has been a popular beauty item for centuries, with its roots tracing back to ancient Egypt, where kohl was employed to darken the eye area. The modern-day mascara, however, made its debut in the early twentieth century and has seen significant transformations and improvements since then. Mascaras come in various types and formulations, including waterproof, smudge-proof, lengthening, and volumizing. Each type of mascara caters to specific needs and preferences and often includes a unique combination of ingredients to achieve the desired result. The critical components of mascara can be divided into three categories: 1. Pigments: Typically, iron oxides or titanium dioxide are used to impart color to the lashes. These pigments can be black, brown, or even colored in more playful shades like blue, green, and purple. The pigments help create the illusion of fuller, longer, and more dramatic lashes. 2. Waxes and Oils: These ingredients help form a smooth, creamy texture and help the mascara glide easily onto the lashes. Commonly used waxes and oils in mascaras are beeswax, carnauba wax, and rice bran wax, as well as mineral oil, lanolin, and castor oil. They also contribute to the product's durability and provide hydration to the lashes. 3. Polymers: Polymers are responsible for holding the mascara in place on the lashes, ensuring a uniform and smudge-proof application. They also help maintain the curl and volume of the lashes throughout the day. Polymers such as PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) and VP (vinylpyrrolidone) are commonly used in mascara formulations. To choose the right mascara, consider factors like your natural eyelash type, the desired outcome, and the occasion at which the mascara will be worn. For instance, if you have short or sparse lashes and want to create an illusion of length and fullness, opt for a lengthening and volumizing mascara. On the other hand, if you plan on wearing mascara at the beach, pool, or during a workout, invest in a waterproof formula to ensure that the product remains intact. Application of mascara typically involves using a brush, wand, or comb that is coated with the product. To apply, start at the base of the lashes and wiggle the applicator outward in a zigzag motion, ensuring that you coat every single lash. Add additional coats for a more dramatic look, but be cautious not to build up too many layers, as this can lead to clumping and an unappealing spider-like effect. To remove mascara, it is crucial to use a gentle makeup remover or cleanser designed specifically for the eyes. Avoid rubbing the eyes vigorously as this could result in the loss of eyelashes or irritation. Instead, soak a cotton pad in the remover and gently press it against the lashes, allowing the product to dissolve before gently wiping it away. Mascara is an essential beauty staple and has a long-standing relationship with boosting confidence and enhancing the natural allure of one's eyes. With the multitude of options available, it's easy to find a mascara that caters to your unique needs, preferences, and desired outcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Background: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.

PUBLISHED:. 10:17 EST, 22 August 2012. |. UPDATED:. 01:44 EST, 23 August 2012. The parliamentary head of Angela Merkel's party has warned that crisis-wracked Greece has 'no room for manoeuvre' ahead of talks this week between the German chancellor and the Greek prime minister. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is due. to visit Berlin on Friday before heading to Paris for talks with French. President Francois Hollande the next day. According to Greek media, Samaras. will discuss extending a deadline for Greece to make budget cuts in return for its next slice of aid. while stopping short of making a formal request. Warning: Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, right, is expected to discuss extending the deadline for Greece to make budget cuts. But German MP Volker Kauder, left, says Greece has 'no room for manoeuvre' The Financial Times reported today that Samaras would ask for two more years to make the demanded cuts. But Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of Merkel's conservative bloc, told Der Spiegel weekly: 'The Greeks have to stick to what they have promised. There is no room for manoeuvre, either in terms of time or substance. 'That would be yet another agreement broken. That's exactly what led us to this crisis.' Greece's debt stands at more than 300. billion euros (372 billion), and its economy is struggling through a. fifth year of recession with unemployment above 23 percent. In an interview published today, Samaras insisted. that Athens doesn't want more money from creditors, but made clear it. would like more time to enact reforms and spending cuts. He vehemently rejected the suggestion. that it might be better for Greece to leave the 17-nation euro and. bring back its former currency, the drachma. Showdown: Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is due to visit Berlin for talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel, right, on Friday before heading to Paris for talks with French President Francois Hollande, left, the next day. That, he told Germany's mass-circulation Bild daily, would result in 'a catastrophe for Greece' and economic collapse. Samaras pledged before coming to. power to seek a two-year extension to the deadline for implementing. unpopular cuts demanded in exchange for two massive international aid. packages worth 240 billion euros that are keeping Greece afloat. But delays in implementing reforms. and austerity measures have fueled impatience in Germany - the largest. single contributor to the bailouts - and other eurozone countries. German officials and lawmakers have. made clear they're in no mood to grant significant concessions, and. speculation has grown that Greece will have to leave the euro. Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who chairs the eurozone finance ministers' meetings, was due in Athens today. 'Let me be very clear: we are not asking for extra money,' Samaras was quoted as telling Bild. 'We stand by our commitments and the. implementation of all requirements. But we must encourage growth,. because that reduces the financing gaps. 'All we want is a little \\"air to. breathe\\" to get the economy going and increase state income,' Samaras. added, without specifying any timeframe. 'More time does not automatically mean more money.' Asked whether Greece needs a second. debt writedown following one carried through earlier this year, Samaras. replied: 'that has never been discussed.' Some German politicians have talked. openly in recent weeks about the possibility of Greece leaving the euro,. and the vice chancellor, Economy Minister Philipp Roesler, has said. that the idea of a Greek exit has 'lost its horror.' Difficult times: Greece's debt stands at more than 300 billion euros, and its economy is struggling through a fifth year of recession with unemployment above 23 percent. This picture shows a view of the Acropolis and the Parthenon in Athens. But Athens insists the country must. remain in the euro - something which opinion polls have shown the vast. majority of Greeks want. Asked by Bild whether a return to the. drachma would be better, Samaras replied that 'the consequences would. be a catastrophe for Greece.' 'It would mean at least five more. years of recession and push unemployment above 40 percent,' he was. quoted as saying. 'A nightmare for Greece: economic collapse, social. unrest and an unprecedented crisis of democracy.' Auditors from the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- known as the Troika -- will release a report in mid-September on Greece's progress towards achieving the required austerity. According to Der Spiegel, this report will call for Athens to slash 14 billion euros (17 billion) from its budget over the next two years, 2.5 billion euros more than originally demanded. Der Spiegel said the extra cuts were needed because planned privatisations were not shaping up to be as lucrative as hoped and tax revenues were falling short of forecasts as Greece struggles through its fifth year of recession. Kauder reiterated that Europe should strive to keep Greece in the eurozone, but stressed that the Troika report would be the basis for further decisions. 'We should do everything to stick together. When the first difficulties appear, you don't throw the children out of the house. I am going to wait to see what the Troika says,' Kauder said. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Write a text based on this summary: survey shows taiwanese not anxious to resume talks with china Text:","completion":"A recent survey conducted in Taiwan has revealed that the majority of Taiwanese citizens are not in a hurry to resume talks with China. This finding comes amidst rising tensions between the two nations, which have seen a long-standing dispute over sovereignty and political differences. The survey, completed by a reputable research institution, sheds light on the sentiments of the general public in Taiwan regarding their relations with China. An overwhelming majority of the respondents voiced their concern about China's increasing aggression towards Taiwan, as well as its attempts to assert its dominance in the region. This has led to a marked reduction in the desire for talks among the populace. It should be noted that since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2016, cross-strait communication between Taiwan and China has significantly reduced. The DPP has historically advocated for Taiwan's independence and has resisted China's \\"one country, two systems\\" approach. The level of anxiety among Taiwanese citizens about resuming talks with China is further compounded by the Hong Kong situation, with fears that any potential future agreements could lead to a similar loss of autonomy. China's handling of Hong Kong has raised doubts about the viability of the \\"one country, two systems\\" model and its application to Taiwan. That being said, not all Taiwanese maintain the same view. There remains a minority who believe that it is still necessary to maintain dialogue with Beijing, given the economic ties between the two nations. For these individuals, a continued discussion could be the key to securing a stable future for Taiwan. In conclusion, this recent survey highlights the growing hesitance among Taiwanese citizens to reestablish communication with China. Fueled by ongoing geopolitical concerns and a desire for independence and autonomy, the findings suggest that any attempts at negotiating a peaceful resolution between the two nations will be met with considerable resistance. However, it remains essential to acknowledge the varied perspectives existing within Taiwanese society and to ultimately navigate a path forward that respects the wishes of the majority while also considering the minorities who advocate for renewed dialogue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first time I saw Oscar Pistorius run, I was captivated. Witnessing him caused me to jump up and down. My 10-year-old son, an amputee since the first week of his life, calmly commented, \\"Mom, he's just a man!\\" I suppose that should have curbed my enthusiasm. But to see a man in motion without the use of feet was simply magical. I saw him as a future superhero for my son, who is missing part of his right forearm and hand. Completely inspired, I felt as though I had witnessed the Messiah. I was so captivated that I started posting his likeness all over my Facebook page. In short, I was caught up in \\"Oscar-mania.\\" Even my church pastor had preached about Pistorius. The \\"Blade Runner,\\" he said, represented Christian values. He embodied things that I wish for my son's life. Seeing Pistorius at the Olympic and Paralympic Games was amazing and did something very special to raise awareness of athletes with physical differences. However, in the hysteria, I lost sight of one simple thing that my son had been able to see: Pistorius is just a man. He has the ability to make the mistakes of mortals. He is not a god; he is a person, and I got caught up in the passion. In full: Pistorius' affidavit to court. We don't know what really happened. I would like to believe that Reeva Steenkamp's death was a horrible accident. Oscar Pistorius may or may not be guilty. But, whatever happened, there is a lesson: Too often in life, we put people on pedestals. We set them up to fail. The reality is that, despite their seemingly superhuman performances, they are just people with their own sets of challenges. The truth is, I wanted my son to have a role model. The first part of his life was filled with questions for me. I wanted someone to tell me that he would be OK. After he was born, the first couple of times that I saw someone with a limb difference, I would race up to them and start a conversation. In the beginning, this approach brought me comfort. One morning at the gym, I spotted a man with a limb difference like my son's. At the time, my baby was only 6 months old. I ran up to him and said hello. The guy turned and looked at me. In a thick French-Canadian accent, he responded, \\"Hello, my dear!\\" Completely embarrassed, I thrust my baby into his range of vision and stumbled to say, \\"He, he, he is like you!\\" Suddenly, his seductive voice changed to a matter-of-fact tone. In an instant, he said the words I have never forgotten: \\"This is your issue. Your son will never really see himself as different unless you let him.\\" He continued, \\"He is young and you control how he perceives himself. So just relax and enjoy him.\\" I was mortified and completely perplexed. But on another level, I was grateful for his words. All of this made my husband laugh.

On 2 April 2015, 3 Iranian officers were killed by unidentified gunmen in the city of Hamidiyeh, about 25 kilometers west of the city of Ahvaz. Additional 2 casualties were sustained by the Iranian security on 26 October 2015. In early June 2016, a Sunni group known as Suqour al-Ahvaz blew up the Bou-Ali-Sina Petrochemical Complex in Bandar-E Mahshahr, Khuzestan. On July 2016, on two occasions Ahwazi militants of al-Farouq Brigade of the Ahwazi National Resistance blew up pipelines in the Johar as-Sabaa' district. Reportedly, members of the al-Farouq Brigade managed to escape after the operation, despite efforts of the security forces and Revolutionary Guards to track down the offenders. According to Algemeiner, the group responsible for the 11 and 17 July attacks was Suqour al-Ahvaz . In August 2016, Iran executed 3 men, charged with terror attack which led to the death of 3 Iranian policemen in Khuzestan province back in April 2015. On October 2016, a young girl was killed, when Iranian security forces attempted to arrest her father, wanted for security reasons.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation? ? St Botolph's Church is an Anglican place of worship in the village of Quarrington, part of the civil parish of Sleaford in Lincolnshire, England. The area has been settled since at least the Anglo-Saxon period, and a church existed at Quarrington by the time Domesday was compiled in 1086, when it formed part of Ramsey Abbey's fee. It was granted to Haverholme Priory about 1165, and the Abbey claimed the right to present the rector in the 13th century. This right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation in the early 16th century, and then passed to Robert Carre and his descendants after Carre acquired a manor at Quarrington. With capacity for 124 people, the church serves the ecclesiastic parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford and, as of 2009, had an average congregation of 50. Recognised for its age and tracery, the church has been designated a grade II* listed building. It has a tower and spire with a nave and north aisle ending at a chancel at the east end. The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century, although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century. Renovations followed, and the local architect Charles Kirk the Younger carried out restoration work in 1862–63, when he added the chancel in his parents' memory. The high interior's three bays of arcading correspond to the three windows in the nave's south wall and the north aisle wall; those on the south wall are unusual for the hexagons and trefoils in the reticulated designs.

Miller told the court the teen's parents should share part of the blame for the crash because they never set limits for the boy and gave him everything he wanted, according to CNN affiliate WFAA Couch is himself a victim -- of \\"affluenza\\" -- the psychologist said, suggesting the teen's life could be turned around with treatment and no contact with his parents.

Couch was given no jail time, though he could face up to 10 years behind bars if he violates the terms of his probation. Prosecutors had asked for the maximum of 20 years. The judge's decision stunned victims' family members, who say they feel Couch basically got away with murder. \\"Let's face it. ... There needs to be some justice here,\\" Eric Boyles, who lost his wife and daughter, told \\"Anderson Cooper 360.\\" On the night of June 15, his wife, Hollie Boyles, and daughter, Shelby, left their home to help Breanna Mitchell, whose SUV had broken down. Brian Jennings, a youth pastor, was driving past and also stopped to help. All four were killed when the teen's pickup plowed into the pedestrians on a road in Burleson, south of Fort Worth. Couch's vehicle also struck a parked car, which then slid into another vehicle headed in the opposite direction. Two people riding in the bed of the teen's pickup were tossed in the crash and severely injured. One is no longer able to move or talk because of a brain injury, while the other suffered internal injuries and broken bones. According to prosecutors, three hours after the crash, tests showed Couch had a blood alcohol content of 0.24, three times the legal limit. \\"There are absolutely no consequences for what occurred that day,\\" said Boyles. \\"The primary message has to absolutely be that money and privilege can't buy justice in this country -- that it's not OK to drink and drive and kill four people ... and not have any consequences to that. That's not the American dream that we grew up to participate in.\\" Couch was sentenced by a juvenile judge Tuesday. Judge Jean Boyd told the court she would not release the teen to his parents, but would work to find Couch a long-term treatment facility. According to WFAA, defense attorneys asked that Couch be sent to a small, private facility in California. They reportedly said the teen's father would pay the 450,000 price tag. \\"There is nothing the judge could have done to lessen the suffering for any of those families,\\" said defense attorney Scott Brown, CNN affiliate KTVT reported. \\"(The judge) fashioned a sentence that is going to keep Ethan under the thumb of the justice system for the next 10 years,\\" he said. \\"And if Ethan doesn't do what he's supposed to do, if he has one misstep at all, then this judge, or an adult judge when he's transferred, can then incarcerate him.\\" ||||| The bizarre term ‘affluenza’ has touched a nerve across America. And so has the no-jail sentence handed down to a Texas teenager who killed four people and injured several others in a Texas DUI case. Now the psychologist who coined the term and bestowed 16-year-old Ethan Couch of Fort Worth, Texas, with his best defense to avoid jail-time in the case is regretting his clever word-smithing. “I wish I had never used the term,” psychologist G. Dick Miller confessed to CNN’s Anderson Cooper Thursday. “Everyone has latched on to it.” But as the psychologist talked, he only seemed to create more ire associated with his novel diagnosis of ‘affluenza.’ It turns out there was no real science or school of psychological thought behind making money the prime legal defense for an over-privileged teen. Instead, Miller suggested that the entire nation, the richest in the world, is afflicted with affluenza: Everyone from parents who give their kids too much to obese Americans with too much food to eat. “We all suffer from affluenza,” Miller declared. “We have a nation doing that.” Couch received a sentence of ten years’ probation after a judge bought the defense's argument that Couch was a victim of 'affluenza.' Couch’s defense lawyer said the 16-year old was not taught right from wrong by his parents, and that his parents should actually share some of the blame. The teen had faced up to 20 years in prison. Needless to say, the relatives of victims in the case were crushed. Clearly, over-privilege was at the heart of the case, right from the start. As more reporting emerges about the devastating DUI crash that killed four people emerges, the image of the entitled 16-year-old from a moneyed family grows darker: Ethan Couch had other arrests leading up to the crash, including for improper possession of alcohol. And according to Couch’s own friends who were in the F-350 Ford pick-up during the crash, the teen knew that his name and family money would get him off right from the start: Couch is quoted as saying at the terrible accident scene, with bodies flung from vehicles and people dead or dying: “I’m Ethan Couch. I’ll get you out of this.” On this, he was right. So what is it about this case that has so touched a nerve across America? Tell us your take in the comments. <br> ||||| Anderson Cooper spent the better part of a half-hour last night grilling Dr. G. Dick Miller, the defense-called psychologist who used the term \\"affluenza\\" in the troubling case of Ethan Couch, the 16-year-old who avoided serving prison time for killing four people in a drunken-driving crash this summer. Above is clip No. 2 of 3 from that interview (you can find all three clips here, but if you only have time for one, No. 2 is probably the one you want). Josh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City. The interview itself is frustrating, in large part because I'd much rather see Cooper cross-examine Judge Jean Boyd, who is the one who sentenced Couch to 10 years' probation instead of the 20-year prison sentence that prosecutors had asked for. But she has yet to publicly defend her decision, so instead we're left with Miller, who basically argues for the position that we should always err on the side of probation and rehab over prison time. Advertisement That's certainly a conversation worth having, but it's not what's causing the outrage over Couch's sentence. Instead the understandable outrcy is over the perception that the relatively lenient sentence was predicated on the fact that the teen's family has lots of money—both because that was the basis for the \\"affluenza\\" defense that more or less claimed Couch didn't know his actions had consequences because he came from privilege, and because his parents are the ones footing the bill for his stay at a 450,000-a-year, in-patient rehab facility near Newport Beach as part of the sentence (a center that Cooper repeatedly, and almost compulsively, points out offers \\"equine therapy.\\") It's hard to imagine a poor teen being handed the same sentence for committing the same crime, or even a similar one, but this too is a topic that Miller more or less dodges, preventing Cooper from landing the cathartic knockout blow that viewers no doubt were hoping for. (Then again, Miller probably wasn't the best target for that punch anyway.) Miller also seems to blur his specific \\"affluenza\\" argument when he suggests, more than once, that Couch's is far from a special case. \\"I wish I hadn't used that term. Everyone seems to have hooked onto it,\\" he told Cooper. \\"We used to call these people spoiled brats.\\" There's also the issue that throughout the interview Miller repeatedly suggests that Couch wasn't actually responsible for the deaths of the four people that were killed in the crash. He repeatedly takes issue with Anderson describing their deaths as murders, and even goes as far as to push back against the idea that Couch killed them, granting only: \\"Four people died.\\" Slate, along with the rest of the Internet, will no doubt have more on this story later, but for now anyone who needs a refresher on the details can find one here. ***Follow @JoshVoorhees and the rest of the @slatest team on Twitter.*** ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The term \\"affluenza\\" gained national attention when it was used in the defense of 16-year-old Ethan Couch, who was sentenced to 10 years' probation for driving drunk and causing a crash that killed four people.

Looking for their first road victory of the season, the Bills traveled to Soldier Field to take on the second of their four NFC North rivals, the Chicago Bears, in Dick Jauron's first return to Chicago since being fired at the end of the 2003 Chicago Bears season. From the start, Buffalo was in trouble, as Robbie Gould kicked two FGs in the first quarter-- a 42-yarder and a 43-yarder. Then, in the second quarter, three straight scores came from the Bears-- an 8-yard pass from Rex Grossman to Bernard Berrian, a 1-yard run from Cedric Benson and a 15-yard pass from Grossman to Rashied Davis-- that put the Bills in a deep hole.

News article: Now, the president's executive order purports to address this gap by extending the Hyde Amendment to these dollars as well. The problem is that, regardless of Obama's stated intentions, he can't actually do this without an act of Congress. As Dorinda Bordlee, an attorney with the Bioethics Defense Fund, wrote: \\"If a president could do that, there would be no need to have a majority of Congress pass the Hyde Amendment each and every year to prevent abortion funding using Medicaid dollars for low-income government health care. Instead, we could have simply prevailed on each president to issue an executive order saying agencies can't use Medicaid money for abortion. Congress controls the purse strings, not the president. That's Civics 101.\\" It is telling that the nation's largest abortion provider -- Planned Parenthood -- is claiming \\"victory\\" because \\"we were able to keep the Stupak abortion ban out of the final legislation and President Obama did not include the Stupak language in his executive order.\\" Several supporters of the bill have argued that this debate is otherwise irrelevant because abortions aren't performed at CHCs. While currently true, this doesn't mean that CHCs wouldn't like to offer abortion among their reproductive services. Under the new law, they can. There's nothing to stop them. Here's why. By statute, CHCs are required to provide all \\"required primary health care services,\\" defined to include \\"health services related to . . . obstetrics or gynecology that are furnished by physicians.\\" Federal courts long have held that when a statute requires provision of health services under such broad categories, then the statute must be construed to include abortion unless it explicitly excludes it. Voilà. One may believe that poor women should have affordable access to abortion. This is a reasonable position and it is likely to be the result of this bill. But it is not what Americans have been led to believe is true, nor is it what most want. A January Quinnipiac University poll found that 67 percent of Americans oppose public funding for abortion, down from 72 percent in December. Prediction: Abortions will be performed at community health centers. You can bet your foreclosed mortgage on that. There was always a will by this administration, and now there's a way. -- In a recent column I wrote that Margaret Chase Smith was the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate. She was the first elected to both houses. The first woman elected to the Senate was Hattie Caraway of Arkansas. kathleenparker@washpost.com For more on the debate over abortion and health care, read Rep. Bart Stupak on \\"Why I voted for health-care reform.\\" ||||| When I saw that Kathleen Parker's March 24 op-ed, \\"Stupak's original sin,\\" defined me as a \\"backstabber,\\" it reminded me of a Bible verse. Matthew 7:3 asks, \\"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?\\" The true motives of many blogs and organizations claiming to be pro-life have become clear in recent days: to politicize life issues as a means to defeat health care reform. One group even sent an e-mail to supporters saying they are \\"working feverishly to stop this legislation from going forward.\\" The pro-life groups rallied behind me -- many without my knowledge or consent -- not necessarily because they shared my goals of ensuring protections for life and passing health-care reform but because they viewed me as their best chance to kill health-care legislation. Last November, an amendment I introduced succeeded in making sure the House health-care-reform bill contained the current law prohibiting public funding for abortions. I was disappointed that the Senate could not pass my language and only mustered 45 pro-life votes, far short of the 60 votes needed to keep the amendment intact. Many of my Democratic pro-life colleagues and I worked tirelessly in the days leading up to the final House vote on health-care reform to strengthen the legislation's restrictions on abortion funding. We proposed numerous procedural and legislative options, but ultimately all of our efforts required the 60 votes we could not obtain in the Senate. Once it was clear that the House leadership would eventually obtain the 216 votes necessary to pass health-care reform, I was left with a choice: Vote against the bill and watch it become law with no further protections for life or reach an agreement that prevents federal funding for abortions. Therefore, I and other pro-life Democrats struck an agreement with President Obama to issue an executive order that would ensure all Hyde Amendment protections would apply to the health-care reform bill. No, an executive order is not as strong as the statutory language we fought for at the start. We received, however, an \\"ironclad\\" commitment from the president that no taxpayer dollars will be used to pay for abortions. Throughout history, executive orders have carried the full force and effect of law and have served as an important means of implementing public policy. Perhaps the most famous executive order was the Emancipation Proclamation signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. More recently, in 2007, President George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13435, restricting embryonic stem-cell research. This executive order protected the sanctity of life and was \\"applauded\\" and \\"welcomed\\" by pro-life advocates. That these same people would now claim that President Obama's executive order maintaining the sanctity of life is not worth the paper it is written on is disingenuous at best. Some, including Parker, have criticized Obama's executive order as unenforceable in the courts and therefore just a \\"fig leaf.\\" Yet the language that critics point to is standard language with any executive order, including Bush's ban on embryonic stem-cell research. Again, many of these pro-life groups did not express concern over the Bush language but claim it is unacceptable under Obama. To further protect against federal funding for abortion, during floor debate on the health-care reform bill I engaged in a colloquy with Rep. Henry Waxman to make clear congressional intent that the provisions in the bill, combined with the executive order, will ensure that outcome. Such colloquies are often referred to in court cases when an attempt is being made to determine Congress's intent. This, too, was no minor concession by those opposed to our efforts, and it is a tremendous victory for those protecting the sanctity of life. I have said from the start that my goal was to see health-care reform pass while maintaining the long-standing principle of the sanctity of life. The president's executive order upholds this principle and current law that no federal funds be used for abortion. I and other pro-life Democrats are pleased that we were able to hold true to our principles and vote for a bill that is pro-life at every stage of life and that provides 32 million Americans with access to high-quality, affordable health care. The writer is a Democratic representative from Michigan. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The president's executive order attempts to extend the Hyde Amendment to cover the funding gap for abortions. However, this cannot be done without an act of Congress. Community Health Centers (CHCs) don't currently perform abortions, but under the new law, nothing stops them from offering abortion among their reproductive services. Significant debate has arisen as abortion isn't explicitly excluded from CHCs, potentially allowing them to provide the service under broad categories. A majority of Americans oppose public funding for abortion, but this new legislation could lead to an increase in abortions performed at CHCs. Pro-life groups have expressed concern that the executive order may not be enforceable and merely a \\"fig leaf.\\" Meanwhile, pro-life Democrats remain committed to working toward health care reform while upholding the sanctity of life. The president's order aims to maintain current law and prevent the use of federal funds for abortion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Who was Robin Hood's second in command????","completion":"To find out who Robin Hood's second in command was, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the source material: Robin Hood is a legendary character from English folklore, who is commonly depicted as an outlaw who steals from the rich and gives to the poor. The stories of Robin Hood have been adapted and retold in various forms throughout history, with different versions of the legends existing. 2. Examine the source material: While the earliest ballads, such as \\"Robin Hood and the Monk\\" and \\"Robin Hood and the Potter,\\" do not mention a specific second in command, later tales consistently feature Little John as Robin Hood's right-hand man and most trusted companion. 3. Analyze the character: Little John is known for his loyalty, honesty, and impressive fighting skills. Standing tall at approximately seven feet, he is said to wield a large quarterstaff as his weapon of choice. Together, Robin Hood and Little John face numerous adventures and challenges in their quest to help the impoverished. 4. Verify with other sources: A look at various adaptations of the Robin Hood legend, from movies and television shows to novels and comics, confirms that Little John is typically portrayed as Robin Hood's second in command. This includes popular adaptations such as the 1938 film \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood,\\" the 1960s British TV series \\"Robin Hood,\\" and the 1993 film \\"Robin Hood: Men in Tights.\\" Conclusion: Based on my analysis of the source material and the consistency of Little John's role across various adaptations, it is appropriate to conclude that Robin Hood's second in command was Little John."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.
