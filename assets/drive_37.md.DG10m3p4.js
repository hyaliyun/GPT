SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

This switch in roles is an important distinction between the two sentences. 3. Sentence 1 provides information about a specific interview and only mentions a second daughter being molested. Sentence 2 claims that all daughters were molested. This difference in the scope of accusations is another reason why the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence.

Article:China's new \\"Elderly Rights Law\\" deals with the growing problem of lonely elderly people by ordering adult children to visit their ageing parents. The law says adults should care about their parents \\"spiritual needs\\" and \\"never neglect or snub elderly people\\". The regulation has been ridiculed by tens of thousands of Chinese web users. Many across China are questioning how the law could be enforced, since it fails to spell out a detailed schedule dictating the frequency with which children should make parental house calls. \\"Those who live far away from parents should go home often,\\" it says. However, that does not mean the law is toothless. Instead, it serves as an \\"educational message\\" to the public, while also serving as a starting point for law suits, explained Zhang Yan Feng, a lawyer with Beijing's King & Capital Law Firm. \\"It's hard to put this law into practice, but not impossible,\\" Mr Zhang explained. \\"If a case is brought to court on the basis of this law, I think it'll probably end up in a peaceful settlement. But if no settlement is reached, technically speaking, court rulings can force the person to visit home certain times a month.\\" \\"If this person disobeys court rulings, he could be fined or detained.\\" But few in China seem to fear they will end up behind bars if they fail to log visits home. \\"Who doesn't want to visit home often? What is considered \\"often\\"? Who will oversee the process?\\" complained one poster on weibo, China's version of Twitter. \\"We all know to cherish our elderly parents, but sometimes we are just too busy trying to make a living and the pressure is too much.\\" \\"It's fine that no-one is paying for us to visit our parents, but is there someone who can give us time off to do it?\\" asked another. The question of how to deal with ageing parents is a mounting problem in China. According to Chinese government statistics, more than 178 million people in China were 60 years or older in 2010. By 2030, that figure will double. As China's population goes grey, the Chinese media fills with stories of neglected old people. Many were shocked by the story of a 91-year-old grandmother who was beaten and forced out of her home in China's southern Jiangsu province after she asked her daughter-in-law for a bowl of rice porridge. Two days later, internet forums were filled with a similar story of farmers in the same province who allowed their family's 100-year-old matriarch to sleep in a pig sty, sharing close quarters with a pungent pig. But those stories have not lead most people to support the new Elderly Rights Law. \\"Family bonds should be based on spontaneous emotions,\\" argued one weibo user. \\"It's funny to make it part of a law; it's like requiring couples to have a harmonious sex life after marriage.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"China's new \\"Elderly Rights Law\\" addresses the issue of lonely elderly people by mandating adult children to visit their aging parents and care for their \\"spiritual needs.\\" The law has sparked debate, with many questioning how it can be enforced since it does not provide a detailed schedule for visits. Although the law's practicality is hard to enforce, lawyer Zhang Yan Feng stated it could act as an educational message and potentially be the basis for legal cases. China has a growing elderly population, with 178 million people aged 60 or more in 2010, a number expected to double by 2030.

Answer the following question: Question: Bob destroyed Wendy's favorite toy. Wendy isn't sad because she believes she can do what to it? Choices: - raise - make - reincarnate - repair - build The rationale to choose \\"repair\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The rationale for choosing \\"repair\\" as the answer lies in understanding the context of the situation and the meanings of each choice provided. - Raise: In this context, \\"raise\\" refers to the act of lifting or elevating something. This is not a suitable solution for the issue Wendy is facing, as Bob destroyed her toy, and Wendy possibly wants to fix it. - Make: To \\"make\\" something is to create or produce it from scratch. Choosing this option would mean Wendy believes she can make a new toy instead of the original one. However, the word \\"make\\" can have several other meanings and is not as specific a verb as \\"repair\\" is for fixing a broken item. - Reincarnate: This choice refers to the idea of bringing something back to life in a different form or body. While technically this could mean that Wendy believes she can bring the toy back in an alternative form, it is important to consider that Wendy might want her original toy to be as it was before it got destroyed, not a new version of it. Additionally, the concept of reincarnation is usually related to spiritual beliefs associated with living beings and not inanimate objects like toys. - Repair: In the given context, \\"repair\\" refers to the act of fixing, restoring, or mending something that has been damaged or broken. This is the most logical and appropriate choice for Wendy because it implies that she believes she has the ability or resources to fix her favorite toy that Bob destroyed. By repairing her toy, she can restore its original condition and continue to enjoy it. - Build: To \\"build\\" something means to construct or assemble it from parts or materials. While this choice might seem closely related to the concept of repairing, it leans more towards creating a new toy from various components, instead of fixing the original toy. Building a new toy would not be the same as bringing the broken toy back to its original state. Taking all these points into consideration, it is clear that \\"repair\\" is the most appropriate answer. By choosing \\"repair,\\" Wendy expresses her confidence in her ability to fix her favorite toy that was destroyed by Bob, ultimately restoring it to its original state and allowing her to continue enjoying it. This choice accurately addresses the issue at hand and is the most logical and relevant solution in this context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

America changed its mind after 2008 and broke hard for the tea party, building a wave that would devastate Democrats. At least that's the conventional lazy narrative about the 2010 midterm elections.

Article: Federal Communication Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski pauses as he speaks at the Cable Show in Chicago, June 15, 2011. WASHINGTON Julius Genachowski said on Friday he will step down as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission in the coming weeks after four years on the job, and touted his record of working to expand broadband Internet service to Americans. Genachowski, whose term was due to end in June, told FCC staffers he would be leaving his post \\"in the coming weeks\\" but did not give a date. He told Reuters after his announcement that he has no career plans lined up for after his FCC tenure ends. \\"I'm still focused on the work of the agency,\\" Genachowski said, adding that he expects the FCC, which maintains a Democratic majority, to keep its policy direction after he leaves. Asked to describe his tenure at the FCC in three words, Genachowski answered \\"unleashing broadband's benefits.\\" His exit from the agency that oversees telecommunications and broadcast policies was widely expected after President Barack Obama's re-election. Obama will nominate a successor to Genachowski, who has headed the FCC since 2009. In a statement, Obama praised Genachowski, the president's classmate at Harvard Law School, for giving the FCC a \\"clear focus\\" on encouraging innovation and competitiveness, attracting \\"jobs of tomorrow\\" and improving high-speed Internet access and mobile devices sector growth. \\"I am grateful for his service and friendship, and I wish Julius the best of luck,\\" Obama said. The FCC is also losing its senior Republican commissioner. Robert McDowell said on Wednesday he will depart his post in a few weeks, leaving the five-member panel with two Democrats, one Republican and two vacancies. Among the possible candidates to head the FCC is Tom Wheeler, a venture capitalist and an Obama ally and fundraiser. Wheeler headed the National Cable Television Association and the wireless industry group CTIA. Two other possible contenders are: Lawrence Strickling, head of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which advises the president on telecommunications and information policy; and Karen Kornbluh, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international economic body. The next FCC chief faces a list of projects to complete. One major one is Genachowski's plan for a complex incentive auction of spectrum that is meant to free up airwaves for better wireless Internet access. The auction relies on TV stations to give up some of their airwaves to be auctioned off to wireless companies or opened up for shared use. The broadcasters would get a portion of the proceeds and the rest would pay for a public-safety program and go to the U.S. Treasury. Also on the list is the delayed loosening of rules on media ownership. Asked whether he would like to see a vote on those rules before he leaves the FCC, Genachowski said only that the commission will \\"continue to work on the agenda.\\" Later this year, a federal court will also hold hearings in a case against Genachowski's net neutrality rules for Internet service providers that could have broad implications for the breadth of the FCC's regulatory power. 'AN UNEASY DANCE' In his FCC tenure, Genachowski oversaw an overhaul of the multibillion-dollar Universal Service Fund from a project to spread telephone service in rural America to one focused on broadband access. He also spearheaded the creation of a strategy known as the National Broadband Plan and later pushed Internet providers to step up the speediness of their services. The FCC's priorities under Genachowski reduced the influence of U.S. broadcasters, the relationship with whom has been \\"an uneasy dance,\\" according to Medley Global Advisors telecommunications policy analyst Jeffrey Silva. Also left disappointed were liberal-leaning organizations including consumer interest groups. Harold Feld of advocacy group Public Knowledge said Genachowski is leaving more tasks for his successor to finish than most of his predecessors. \\"It's true to some degree of every chairman, but this chairman in particular came in with a lot of expectations,\\" Feld said. \\"And then, as people say, he wrote a lot of checks that he's now leaving for the next chair to figure out how to cash.\\" Genachowski, who charted a centrist course in his chairmanship, defended his tenure, which also included the FCC's rejection of a landmark 2011 merger bid between U.S. No. 2 wireless carrier AT&T; Inc and fourth-largest provider T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom. The bid was dropped after the Justice Department sued to block the deal. In pushing against the merger, Genachowski stood up against the prospect of a duopoly in the wireless market by AT&T; and the largest carrier, Verizon, analysts say, as it retained T-Mobile as a competitor and protected the third-biggest player Sprint from being overwhelmed. \\"This sector has always been and will always be characterized by a robust debate,\\" Genachowski said. \\"Some people say the commission has gone too far, some people say the commission hasn't gone far enough. What we've been focused on are the right actions to drive the economy and to improve the lives of the American people.\\" Genachowski came to the FCC after advising Obama on telecommunications policy and working at several tech investment firms. He had previously served as chief counsel for former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.

For example, the sentence \\"he was born in the U.S.\\" contains a stationary event since it will last forever; however, \\"he is hungry\\" contains a transient event since it will remain true for a short period of time. Don't create questions which have explicit mentions of answers in the text. Instead, it has to be implied from what is given. In other words, we want you to use \\"instinct\\" or \\"common sense\\". Note that the written questions are not required to have a single correct answer. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Sentence: Picasso manages to enter the building , but is prevented from killing Nunemarcher by Cross , and escapes after being shot by Kane . Student:","completion":"Part #1: Understand whether an event is transient or stationary. Usage: Given a sentence, classify an event in the sentence as either transient (it will change over time) or stationary (it will NOT change over time). Example: \\"He was born in the U.S.\\" is a stationary event because being born in a specific country will never change for that person. Part #2: Write a question based on the given sentence. Usage: Create a question related to the sentence that does not have explicit answers mentioned in the text, but can be inferred using instinct or common sense. Example: Sentence: \\"He is hungry.\\" The question could be, \\"Will the person's hunger pass with time or will the person remain hungry forever?\\" It's a transient event since the person's hunger will change upon eating, so the correct answer would be that the hunger will pass with time. Part #3: Consider that the question has no single correct answer. Usage: When creating the question, make sure it has multiple possible answers. Example: Sentence: \\"Picasso manages to enter the building, but is prevented from killing Nunemarcher by Cross, and escapes after being shot by Kane.\\" The question could be, \\"What do you think could have happened to Picasso after being shot and escaping the building? Explain.\\" This question has no single correct answer, as it is open to interpretation and can have various predictions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Boston Center did not follow the protocol in seeking military assistance through the prescribed chain of command. In addition to notifications within the FAA, Boston Center took the initiative, at 8:34, to contact the military through the FAA's Cape Cod facility. The center also tried to contact a former alert site in Atlantic City, unaware it had been phased out. At 8:37:52, Boston Center reached NEADS. This was the first notification received by the military-at any level-that American 11 had been hijacked: FAA: Hi. Boston Center TMU [Traffic Management Unit], we have a problem here. We have a hijacked aircraft headed towards New York, and we need you guys to, we need someone to scramble some F-16s or something up there, help us out. NEADS: Is this real-world or exercise? FAA: No, this is not an exercise, not a test. NEADS ordered to battle stations the two F-15 alert aircraft at Otis Air Force Base in Falmouth, Massachusetts, 153 miles away from New York City. The air defense of America began with this call. At NEADS, the report of the hijacking was relayed immediately to Battle Commander Colonel Robert Marr. After ordering the Otis fighters to battle stations, Colonel Marr phoned Major General Larry Arnold, commanding general of the First Air Force and NORAD's Continental Region. Marr sought authorization to scramble the Otis fighters. General Arnold later recalled instructing Marr to \\"go ahead and scramble them, and we'll get authorities later.\\" General Arnold then called NORAD headquarters to report. F-15 fighters were scrambled at 8:46 from Otis Air Force Base. What question would one ask from this paragraph?","completion":"One possible question that could be asked from this paragraph is: \\"What were the reasons for the failure in following the proper protocol for seeking military assistance during the hijacking of American 11, and what measures were taken by Boston Center to rectify the situation?\\""},{"prompt":"Q:Context: Tracy heard the dog behind Kendall and screamed very loudly too.

The variables on the right side of the equation are both j with their respective coefficients being -3 and -7. Therefore, you can combine these terms by adding their coefficients: -20 = (-3 - 7) * j Step 2: Simplify. Now, simplify the right side of the equation by performing the subtraction inside the parentheses: -20 = (-10) * j Step 3: Solve for j. To isolate j, you will need to divide both sides of the equation by -10. (-20) / (-10) = (-10) * j / (-10) Step 4: Simplify and get the final answer.

Here is an article: This three-story brick house built in 1850 is set amid rolling green hills, 25 miles from Brussels in the French-speaking province of Walloon Brabant. It has four bedrooms and three baths; a recent renovation retained architectural elements like exposed oak ceiling beams and rafters, and even remnants of machinery, like the pulley above the living room framed by ceiling beams. The baths and kitchen have been redone, as have the electrical, water and heating systems. The house has about 7,600 square feet of space; the central living room has a 26-foot ceiling, opened up as part of the renovation, in which the owners removed two higher floors to reveal beams, braces and rafters, said Véronique Schatten, office manager for Engel & Voelkers Wavre, the listing agency. The room has three elongated south-facing windows, as well as three smaller windows on the opposite wall. A large stone fireplace set in a brick wall came from a chateau in France. Other rooms on the main floor include a small television lounge with an open mezzanine above that functions as a home office; an open kitchen; and an adjoining dining area with a terra-cotta-tiled floor. Kitchen cabinets are wooden; the stovetop is ceramic and appliances are by the German company Miele. Of three bedrooms on the second floor, two have en-suite baths with Grohe ceramic fixtures and white tile walls. On the third floor is the master suite, which has a dressing room in addition to the bath, and a pitched ceiling with exposed wood. The teak-paneled bath has a ceramic tub, a large tiled shower, and two porcelain sinks by the Italian company Antonio Lupi. In the basement is a brick-walled wine cellar with a lounge, which still has a round chunk of granite in the floor, a remnant of the mill’s machinery. Also included in the asking price are two 19th-century buildings with terra cotta roofs, one most likely a horse stable, the other a renovated one-story building that was intended to be a pool house. The pool was never built, so the building, equipped with a bar, a fireplace, French doors, and a terrace, is used for entertaining. Red beeches line the driveway leading to the main house. The lawns are dotted with chestnut and oak trees, trellised walkways and sculptured shrubs. The center of Brussels is 40 minutes away, an hour during rush hour. Walloon Brabant is in the “Green Belt,” a ring of suburbs and semirural areas around Brussels. Castles and monuments punctuate the countryside, among them the site of the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The market has been steady and strong, nearly unaffected by the crisis that crippled housing markets in countries like Ireland and Spain. According to Olivier Thiel, a residential investment specialist in the Brussels office of Knight Frank, a London real estate and consulting firm, “Almost everyone who is 30 years old has bought real estate, and they see it as a type of savings.” About 70 percent of Belgians own property, said Mr. Thiel, adding that property prices in Walloon Brabant had gone up an average of 50 percent over the past decade, and that higher-end properties had risen 16 percent over the last five years. Even so, Ms. Schatten says that properties priced above a million euros are not moving. In Walloon Brabant, a province of Wallonia, the transfer tax is around 14.5 percent of property value. Owners tend to keep properties a minimum of 10 years before selling, in order not to lose money on the purchase. “It’s kept it stable, slow,” Ms. Schatten said of the market. Nearly all buyers in Walloon Brabant are Belgian, typically young Brussels families seeking more space. The small number of foreigners who do buy in Walloon Brabant are generally residents of France, Britain, Holland and Scandinavian countries, and have children attending international schools in the area. There are no restrictions on foreign buyers. As in many European countries, buyers do not usually hire a lawyer, relying instead on the public notary to handle the transaction. But while there is no imperative to hire a lawyer, especially if the buyer is using a real estate agent, some factors may dictate retaining one, said Siegfried Busscher, a lawyer with the Brussels-based Schoups law firm. If there are international tax issues, he said, a lawyer should be consulted. Foreigners are eligible for mortgages from Belgian banks; they must meet the same requirements asked of any Belgian buyer. Brussels and Wallonia tourism: wallonie-tourisme.be/ French, Dutch and German; euro (1 euro = 1.28) The transfer tax and notary fee cost approximately 15 percent of the property’s value. The property tax is 1,679 a year.

Which language is this?","completion":"The language provided in your prompt is Finnish. It belongs to the Finno-Ugric family of languages and is the official language of Finland. The sentence translates to \\"In short, we have many opportunities to increase interaction with Latin America.\\" The Finnish language is spoken by about 5 million people, most of whom reside in Finland. Finnish is notable for its complex grammar and extensive use of vowel sounds. It is known for its consonant gradation—a grammatical feature relating to changes that occur in the pronunciation of consonants in certain phonetic environments—and its use of fifteen noun cases. Apart from Finland, it's also spoken in parts of Sweden, Norway, Russia, and Estonia, as well as by Finnish ex-pat communities in the United States, Canada, and throughout Europe. The Finnish language has a beautiful and complex phonetic structure and is considered very expressive. The language is phonemic, which means that each letter corresponds to exactly one sound, thus making pronunciation simpler than in other languages. To learn Finnish, it's important to understand its unique characteristics and structure, which comprise a significant range of suffixes and a unique approach to expressing tense and mood through verb inflection. In terms of writing, Finnish uses the Latin script, and like many European languages, it's written from left to right. The Finnish alphabet consists of 29 letters including 'a', 'ä', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'ö', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', and 'å'. The diacritical marks that appear above certain letters — 'ä' and 'ö'— signify a change in pronunciation. Moreover, the Finnish language is notable for its rich and evocative vocabulary, with many unique words that do not have direct translations into other languages. For instance, the words 'sisu' (extreme determination and persistence) and 'löyly' (the steam that rises when water is thrown on the hot stones in a Finnish sauna) are unique to the Finnish language in their meaning. The overall structure and lexicon of the Finnish language provide a fascinating window into Finnish culture and way of thinking. Finally, it's noteworthy that Finnish, like other languages, also has a variety of dialects and regional differences, where pronunciation, vocabulary, and even the grammar can vary a little from one area to another. This tends to be especially true in rural areas and among older generations, while standard Finnish is commonly used in urban areas and among younger Finns, and it's this version of the language that is typically taught to learners."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information: - The Cape Canaveral Monsters is a 1960 science - fiction b - movie written and directed by Phil Tucker . Though intended as a theatrical feature , it was ultimately released directly to television . - Phil Tucker (May 22, 1927 November 30, 1985) was an American film director, writer, producer, and film editor. While Tucker directed his first six feature films in the span of two years (while still in his mid-20s), he is best known for his first film, the science fiction B movie \\"Robot Monster\\", often considered an example of \\"so bad it's good\\" film-making in the Ed Wood vein, and for the Lenny Bruce movie \\"Dance Hall Racket\\". - A B movie is a low-budget commercial movie that is not an arthouse film. In its original usage, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the term more precisely identified a film intended for distribution as the less-publicized, bottom half of a double feature. Although the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased by the end of the 1950s, the term \\"B movie\\" continued to be used in the broader sense it maintains today. In its postGolden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition: on the one hand, the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient; on the other, many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity. - Dance Hall Racket is a 1953 American film directed by Phil Tucker starring Lenny Bruce (who also wrote the script) and his wife Honey Harlow. - Leonard Alfred Schneider (October 13, 1925 August 3, 1966), better known by his stage name Lenny Bruce, was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, satirist, and screenwriter. He was renowned for his open, free-style and critical form of comedy which integrated satire, politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity. His 1964 conviction in an obscenity trial was followed by a posthumous pardon, the first in the history of New York state, by then-Governor George Pataki in 2003. He paved the way for future outspoken counterculture-era comedians, and his trial for obscenity is seen as a landmark for freedom of speech in the United States. - Robot Monster (a.k.a. Monster from Mars) is a 1953 independently made American black-and-white 3D science fiction film, produced and directed by Phil Tucker, written by Wyott Ordung, that stars George Nader, Claudia Barrett, and George Barrows. The production company was Three Dimension Pictures, Inc. The film was distributed by Astor Pictures. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'genre'.

Movie plot title: Call Northside 777 Movie plot: James Stewart in Call Northside 777 (1948) In Chicago in 1932, during Prohibition, a policeman is murdered inside a speakeasy. Frank Wiecek (Richard Conte) and another man are quickly arrested, and are later sentenced to serve 99 years' imprisonment each for the killing. Eleven years later, Wiecek's mother (Kasia Orzazewski) puts an ad in the newspaper offering a 5,000 reward for information about the true killers of the police officer. This leads the city editor of the Chicago Times, Brian Kelly (Lee J. Cobb), to assign reporter P.J. McNeal (James Stewart) to look more closely into the case. McNeal is skeptical at first, believing Wiecek to be guilty. But he starts to change his mind, and meets increased resistance from the police and the state attorney's office, who are unwilling to be proved wrong. This is quickly followed by political pressure from the state capital, where politicians are anxious to end a story that might prove embarrassing to the administration. Eventually, Wiecek is proved innocent by, among other things, the enlarging of a photograph showing the date on a newspaper that proves that a key witness statement was false.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Thomas Cowperthwait Eakins (July 25, 1844 - June 25, 1916) was an American realist painter, photographer, sculptor, and fine arts educator. He is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important artists in American art history. For the length of his professional career, from the early 1870s until his health began to fail some 40 years later, Eakins worked exactingly from life, choosing as his subject the people of his hometown of Philadelphia. He painted several hundred portraits, usually of friends, family members, or prominent people in the arts, sciences, medicine, and clergy. Eakins' first works upon his return from Europe included a large group of rowing scenes, eleven oils and watercolors in all, of which the first and most famous is Max Schmitt in a Single Scull (1871; also known as The Champion Single Sculling). Both his subject and his technique drew attention. His selection of a contemporary sport was \\"a shock to the artistic conventionalities of the city\\". Eakins placed himself in the painting, in a scull behind Schmitt, his name inscribed on the boat. Typically, the work entailed critical observation of the painting's subject, as well as preparatory drawings of the figure and perspective plans of the scull in the water. Its preparation and composition indicates the importance of Eakins' academic training in Paris. It was a completely original conception, true to Eakins' firsthand experience, and an almost startlingly successful image for the artist, who had struggled with his first outdoor composition less than a year before. His first known sale was the watercolor The Sculler (1874). Most critics judged the rowing pictures successful and auspicious, but after the initial flourish, Eakins never revisited the subject of rowing and went on to other sports themes. At the same time that he made these initial ventures into outdoor themes, Eakins produced a series of domestic Victorian interiors, often with his father, his sisters or friends as the subjects. Home Scene (1871), Elizabeth at the Piano (1875), The Chess Players (1876), and Elizabeth Crowell and her Dog (1874), each dark in tonality, focus on the unsentimental characterization of individuals adopting natural attitudes in their homes. It was in this vein that in 1872 he painted his first large scale portrait, Kathrin, in which the subject, Kathrin Crowell, is seen in dim light, playing with a kitten. In 1874 Eakins and Crowell became engaged; they were still engaged five years later, when Crowell died of meningitis in 1879. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did the critics think of his early works?","completion":"The critics thought that Thomas Eakins' early works, especially the rowing pictures, were successful and showed a lot of promise.

Firstly, it is essential to understand that this product is a DVD, presumably aimed at teaching certain moves – possibly dance, workout, or any other physical activity. The review acknowledges that the DVD is excellent for beginners, implying that the instructions are clear, easy to understand, and provide a good foundation for people new to the activity. For someone with limited experience or knowledge in the subject matter, this review could increase the chances of buying the product. Clear instructions and thorough explanations can be significantly beneficial for beginners, as they may not be familiar with the specific techniques or terminology involved in the activity. In this case, the product would serve as a reliable resource for learning the basics before moving on to more advanced levels. On the other hand, the reviewer mentions that there was too much explanation for their preference, which could be a valuable piece of information for someone with more experience or expertise in the specific activity. If the potential buyer has prior experience or is looking for a DVD that provides advanced techniques with minimal focus on foundational or basic moves, this review could decrease the chances of them purchasing the product.

The sentence is: \\"If you choose the annual payments option, you'll receive the Mega Millions Plus jackpot in 26 graduated annual payments.\\" Spaces exist in a sentence to separate words and without them, the sentence can look quite different and possibly challenging to read, especially for those who are not programmed to read without spaces. In this case, and like English text in general, the spaces co-exist with punctuation marks such as commas and full stops. In this task, only the spaces between words are being removed, which means the punctuation marks will remain intact. To remove the spaces from this sentence, we'll take each word in succession and seamlessly join it to the next. Spaces tend to be situated after each word and before the following one, so removing them means that the tail of one word effectively meets the head of the next. The punctuation marks, as mentioned, divide sentences and phrases rather than individual words so they should remain untouched. Without further ado, here is the sentence \\"If you choose the annual payments option, you'll receive the Mega Millions Plus jackpot in 26 graduated annual payments.\\" with all spaces removed: \\"Ifyouchoosetheannualpaymentsoption,you'llreceivetheMegaMillionsPlusjackpotin26graduatedannualpayments.\\" As expected, without any spaces, the sentence becomes a long string of letters, punctuation, and numerals. It's challenging to read for a human being, but makes no difference for an AI as we don't rely on visual separation to understand text. Further confirmation is required to make certain that spaces between words are the only target in this limitation.

In 1923, Virginia has begun writing the book Mrs Dalloway in her home in the town of Richmond outside London. In 1951, troubled Los Angeles housewife Laura Brown escapes from her conventional life by reading Mrs Dalloway. In 2001, New Yorker Clarissa Vaughan is the embodiment of the novel's title character, as she spends the day preparing for a party she is hosting in honor of her former lover and friend Richard, a poet and author living with AIDS who is to receive a major literary award. Richard tells Clarissa he has stayed alive for her sake, and the award is meaningless because he didn't get it sooner, until he was on the brink of death. She tells him she believes he would have won the award regardless of his illness. Richard often refers to Clarissa as \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" - her namesake - because she distracts herself from her own life the way the Woolf character does. Virginia, who has experienced several nervous breakdowns and suffers from bipolar disorder, feels trapped in her home. She is intimidated by servants and constantly under the eye of her husband, Leonard, who has begun a publishing business, Hogarth Press, at home to stay close to her. Virginia both welcomes and dreads an afternoon visit from her sister Vanessa and her children.

The name of which Spanish region means ?very hard??","completion":"In order to answer the question, I need to first identify the Spanish regions and then determine which region's name means \\"very hard.\\" Step 1: Identify the Spanish regions. There are 17 autonomous regions in Spain: Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, Balearic Islands, Basque Country, Canary Islands, Cantabria, Castilla-La Mancha, Castilla y León, Catalonia, Extremadura, Galicia, La Rioja, Madrid, Murcia, Navarre, and Valencia. Step 2: Determine which region's name means \\"very hard.\\" In this case, none of the 17 autonomous regions in Spain are directly translated to \\"very hard.\\" However, this question might be about a historical region or a broader geographic area in Spain. Extra step: Investigate the potential historical or geographic references that could mean \\"very hard.\\" After researching, I find that the name \\"Castilla,\\" a historical region in Spain, which now has been divided into two autonomous communities: Castilla-La Mancha and Castilla y León, is derived from the word \\"castillo,\\" which means \\"castle\\" in Spanish. The name represents the numerous castles that were built in the area during the Middle Ages. While \\"castle\\" could symbolically be considered \\"very hard\\" due to its structure and purpose, it's not a direct translation.

Question: What type of pistol was George Jackson accused of smuggling? Title: Black August Movie plot: Feature Description:The George Jackson story has now been developed into a movie entitled Black August. It depicts the last 14 months of George Jackson's existence under the subjective and objective conditions of captivity. Sentenced to one year-to-life at age 18, for a 70 gas station robbery in 1960, George Jackson would spend the next 11 years in California's industrial prison complex, 7 years of which were in solitary confinement. The movie encompasses the infamous Soledad Brothers case in which George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clucheette are accused of murdering a Soledad prison guard, in retaliation for the killing of three Black inmates involved in a fight with White inmates on an exercise yard in Soledad State Prison, Soledad, California. The movie also reflects on the general prison movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the role the Black Panther Party would play in organizing both the outside communities in America as well as their influence on prisoners across the country. George Jackson would be moved and inspired as a result of the Panther Party activities. As a prison organizer, George was recruited by Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton to head the Peoples Army, a euphemism which would become synonymous with the name Black Guerrilla Family. The film points out the conspiratorial nature of occurrences, which surrounded the events of August 7, 1970, where Jackson's 17-year-old younger brother, Jonathan Jackson, would be killed at the Marin County Courthouse, at San Raphael, California, during an alleged hostage takeover attempt to leverage against the release of the elder Jackson, and the other Soledad Brothers. The younger Jackson and thre others would be killed, including Superior Judge, Harold Haley. and August 21, 1971, where George Jackson himself, and five others would be killed at San Quentin State Prison, California, during what is discribed as a prison break attempt.

Easy enough, as long as your hoody is zipper free. just cut away the legs at the sleeve holes, Trim the cuffs to the desired length, and you will have a t-shirt in 5 minutes..","completion":"Option (a) makes more sense to accomplish the goal of making a t-shirt from a hoodie. Here's a detailed and long answer explaining how to accomplish this goal using Option (a) - transforming a zipper-free hoodie into a t-shirt: 1. Gather your materials: To transform your zipper-free hoodie into a t-shirt, you will need some or all of the following materials: sharp fabric scissors or fabric shears, a fabric pen or chalk, pins, a sewing machine (with thread that matches your hoody), and an iron. 2. Prepare your workspace: Lay out your hoodie on a flat, clean, and well-lit surface, such as a table or the floor. Ensure that the hoodie is completely flat and wrinkle-free before you begin cutting. 3. Mark the cutting lines: Start by marking the cutting lines on your hoody using your fabric pen or chalk. To do this, lay a well-fitting t-shirt on top of your hoodie and align the shoulder seams. Trace the sleeve and collar lines of the t-shirt onto your hoody, ensuring your markings are symmetrical on both sides. If you prefer a wider or more relaxed fit for the sleeves and collar, you can draw those lines accordingly. 4. Cut the sleeves and collar: Using your sharp fabric scissors or fabric shears, carefully cut along the lines you've drawn to remove the sleeves and excess collar fabric. Ensure you cut as straight and accurately as possible. A poorly cut line can negatively impact the final appearance of your t-shirt. 5. Trim and neaten raw edges: To prevent fraying and give your t-shirt a polished look, fold over the raw edges of the sleeves and collar (approximately 1/4 - 1/2 inch) and pin them in place. If you're having difficulty keeping the fabric folded, press the folds with an iron to help them hold in place more securely. 6. Sew the hems: Use your sewing machine to sew a straight stitch around the pinned edges of the sleeves and collar to secure the folds and create a clean, finished hem. You can use a zigzag stitch if you prefer or if your fabric has some stretch, but remember to still sew close to the folded edge. 7. Remove pins and iron: After sewing, remove all pins and press the hems with an iron to give them a crisp, finished look. 8. Enjoy your new t-shirt: Your hoody has now been successfully transformed into a t-shirt. Enjoy wearing your newly created t-shirt and extend the life of your old hoodie by giving it a new purpose. If you have any remaining fabric, consider repurposing it to create patches, accessories such as hair scrunchies, or for other crafting projects. Option (b) is not a suitable choice because it refers to cutting \\"away the legs at the sleeve holes\\" and \\"trimming the cuffs to the desired length.\\" Hoodies do not have legs nor cuffs at the desired length for a t-shirt. This option seems to be a mix-up between working with a hoodie and pants, making it an improper approach to the goal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 metres thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer of water between glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure lifts. The lava from the volcano then comes up to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's biggest airlines, airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it. Going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane's engines, causing damage to the plane. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and sharp, glass-like rocks all over the countryside. Farmers are keeping their animals inside to stop them eating ash-covered grass or the sharp objects.

Zinni feared that Bin Laden would in the future locate himself in cities, where U.S. missiles could kill thousands of Afghans. He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.

French art expert says Louvre's Leonardo was overcleaned One of France's most eminent art experts has criticised the Louvre Museum's cleaning of a 500-year-old Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece, The Virgin and Child With Saint Anne. Ségolène Bergeon Langle, former director of conservation for France's national museums, accuses the team involved with the restoration of removing details of Leonardo's original work by mistaking it for repaints by later hands. She criticises the removal of Leonardo's own glaze on the infant's body. A dozen letters she wrote \\"opposing the cleaning\\" and warning of damage to one of western art's jewels \\"remained unanswered\\", she said. Two of the experts on the international committee that advised on cleaning were specialists from the National Gallery in London, Larry Keith and Luke Syson. Bergeon Langle, an authority on art restoration, resigned from the committee, along with Jean-Pierre Cuzin, the Louvre's former head of paintings, last December. At the time neither would discuss their departure. Bergeon Langle said only: \\"My reasons I am reserving for a meeting with the president-director of the Louvre.\\" But this week, she gave an interview to a prestigious French publication, Le Journal des Arts. In January 2011, she said, the committee agreed \\"a gentle cleaning\\" of late varnishes and the removal of stains on the Virgin's cloak: \\"Yet, between July and October, a more pronounced clean was called 'necessary', which I objected to. I was then faced with opposition to my position, which is technical, not aesthetic.\\" Her letters to the committee asking for details on the cleaning and materials to be used for retouching went unanswered, she said. \\"I had to resign.\\" She believes the decision-makers behind the restoration were not cautious enough. \\"The Virgin's face is less modelled now. The cleaning should never have gone so far … The whitened layer on Christ Child's body has been mistakenly understood as a late varnish gone mouldy.\\" She believes it was an irreversibly [original] altered glaze: \\"I recommended preservation, but nobody would listen.\\" Considering that experts rarely speak out, her decision to go public is damning. It confirms the view of critics that the painting is left too bright and is robbed of the Renaissance master's subtlety. As the Guardian reported last year, a Louvre source revealed that Keith and Syson were particularly keen on this restoration. Michel Favre-Félix, president of the Association for the Respect and Integrity of Artistic Heritage in Paris, was among those alarmed by the cleaning procedures. He is now collating a dossier of evidence, challenging the restoration on \\"points of gross misconduct\\". He said: \\"We are calling for the establishment of a scientific ethics committee, independent from the museums and the restoration teams, just as there is for medicine. It should re-examine the whole Saint Anne file.\\" Michael Daley, director of ArtWatch UK, the restoration watchdog, said he was shocked to learn that Bergeon Langle's warnings had been ignored: \\"It suggests either that describing what they planned would be dangerous and embarrassing or that they weren't clear what they intended to do. Either way, it's unacceptable.\\" The criticisms resonated with another member of the Louvre's advisory committee, Jacques Franck, consulting expert to the Armand Hammer Centre for Leonardo studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. He told the Guardian: \\"Restorations likely to generate such disapproval from leading experts should never be undertaken … Bergeon Langle is unquestionably France's best authority.\\" Asked to comment on whether other Leonardo paintings in the Louvre should be cleaned, Bergeon Langle gasped in horror: \\"Just do not do it!\\" The Louvre and the National Gallery declined to comment. • This article was amended on 30 April 2012. The original said that Ségolène Bergeon Langle criticised the retouching on the landscape in the painting and that she believed the restorers were not cautious enough. These points have been corrected. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"A famous art expert in France, Ségolène Bergeon Langle, thinks that the Louvre Museum cleaned a very old painting by Leonardo da Vinci too much. She says that this cleaning removed important details from the painting, and she is unhappy that her letters warning about this problem did not get a response."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pro-independence rallies being held in Glasgow and other cities to mark the anniversary of the 2014 vote. Meanwhile pro-Union supporters are marking the occasion by calling for a second referendum to be ruled out. The SNP has launched a \\"new conversation\\" on independence in the wake of the Brexit vote, but opposition parties have urged them to \\"focus on the day job\\" of governing Scotland. A rally of independence supporters is being held at Glasgow Green, with live music and speakers including SNP MP and deputy leadership candidate Tommy Sheppard. Meanwhile actress Elaine C Smith is hosting a meeting of the \\"Scottish Independence Convention\\" in Glasgow, with speakers including MSPs Jeane Freeman and Ross Greer. Other events are taking place elsewhere in Glasgow, Oban and Inverness, and a rally is also planned for Edinburgh later in the week. On 18 September 2014, more than 3.6 million Scots - a record 84.59% of the electorate - turned out to vote on the question \\"should Scotland be an independent country\\". A total of 2,001,926 people voted No, while 1,617,989 voted Yes. Most of the major parties have changed leaders since then, with Nicola Sturgeon replacing Alex Salmond as first minister and Theresa May taking over from David Cameron in Downing Street, while there have been UK and Scottish parliamentary elections and a referendum on the EU. Ms Sturgeon has claimed that the UK Scotland voted to remain part of \\"no longer exists\\", arguing that Scots have the right to consider a second poll in light of the EU referendum in June, which saw the majority of Scots who turned out backing Remain, while the UK as a whole voted to leave. Writing in the Sunday Herald newspaper to mark the anniversary, the SNP leader said self-governance was more important than \\"oil, national wealth and balance sheets\\". Ms Sturgeon said: \\"The EU referendum and the myriad of uncertainties it has thrown up in terms of the path ahead for both Scotland and the rest of the UK have of course provided a new ingredient to the debate on Scotland's future. \\"But two years on from the historic vote of 2014, the fundamental case for Scotland's independence remains as it was. The case for full self-government ultimately transcends the issues of Brexit, of oil, of national wealth and balance sheets and of passing political fads and trends. \\"It is in essence, as the Yes campaign said two years ago, about the simple fundamental truth that the big decisions about Scotland - including the decision about our EU membership - should be taken by those who live and work here. That is a truth which endures.\\" Mr Salmond meanwhile predicted his successor would call a second poll in 2018. And the Scottish Greens said they would launch a fresh campaign to convince former No voters to back independence by having others who changed their minds explain their reasons. A party spokesman said: \\"In light of the 2015 election, the prospect of decades more Tory government or the results of this year's Brexit vote many have reconsidered their choice and many more are thinking of doing the same. This campaign is about giving these voters a platform to tell their stories.\\" Former Better Together campaigners have also been marking the event. The Scottish Conservatives have set up a number of street stalls across Scotland calling for the country to \\"move forward\\" instead of focusing on independence. Leader Ruth Davidson said Ms Sturgeon's latest quotes showed she was \\"abandoning\\" her 2014 arguments. She said: \\"The economic case for independence two years ago was a tissue of lies. Fantasy figures on oil and our national wealth concocted to fool people and which fell apart under scrutiny. \\"Now everyone can see Nicola Sturgeon's sums don't add up, she's decided to abandon them altogether. \\"Instead of trying to explain what would happen to our economy and how we fund our public services under independence, the new mantra is that none of these things matter anymore and people should just shut up about them and wrap themselves in a flag instead. \\"I think Scots are smart enough to draw their own conclusions.\\" Meanwhile, Ms Davidson's finance and economy spokesmen Murdo Fraser and Dean Lockhart have written to Ms Sturgeon urging her to rule out a second referendum, calling it a \\"ball and chain\\" on the country's economy. They said Ms Sturgeon \\"could provide no greater stimulus to the Scottish economy than to clarify that no referendum will take place\\". Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said the SNP should \\"renew its focus on the day job\\". She said: \\"Since 2014 the economic arguments for Scotland staying in the UK, the positive benefits we get from pooling and sharing resources, have become stronger. \\"With so many challenges facing Scotland's future it makes no sense to return to the arguments of our past. \\"Instead there should be a renewed focus on the day job from the SNP government. We need to see real progress on the bread and butter issues which touch the lives of families across Scotland. \\"Scotland's voice was heard in 2014 and Nicola Sturgeon needs to listen to it.\\" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, speaking at his party's federal conference in Brighton, accused former Prime Minister David Cameron of putting \\"the future of the union\\" at risk by focusing on English nationalism after the vote. He said: \\"Instead of reaching out to Scotland, he used his speech in the morning of the Scottish referendum result to stoke up English nationalism by arbitrarily stripping Scottish MPs of voting rights. \\"He put all our work during the referendum at risk. I am glad he has gone. David Cameron doesn't deserve our respect or fond memory.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"In 2014, people in Scotland voted to decide if their country should be independent or not. Many people discussed this important decision, and in the end, 55% of them decided that Scotland should stay with the United Kingdom (UK). However, some people still believe that Scotland should be an independent country. They are having meetings and events to support this idea. Scotland's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, says that big decisions about the country should be made by the people who live there. Other leaders believe that being a part of the UK is better for Scotland's money and jobs. They think that having another vote on this issue will not help their economy grow and that people should think about the future instead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: As millions of playthings are recalled, doctors are reminded that the risks of lead exposure continue for young patients. Lead is such a well-known health - perhaps even contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire- that it came as a shock to discover that toys played by children could contain lead. Doctors are now dealing with the aftershocks. Just how dangerous is this exposure? That's the question physicians are being asked by parents who find a lead-polluted Elmo, of Dora. Millions of others toys, lunch boxes and pieces of jewelry manufactured in China have been recalled because they contain lead either in the paint that coats them or as a component of the plastic used to make the item more flexible. The lead content in some of the toys recalled this summer was 180 times the amount allowed by law. Some pieces of jewelry were almost 100% lead. Experts advise that the items do cause a risk and that doctors should urge parents to check the comprehensive lists of recalled products on the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Web site and return any appearing on those lists to the manufacturers. If exposure is suspected, a blood test is in order . Since there is no safe level of this universal element, the risk face by children for lead poisoning and its accompanying threat of learning disabilities and behavior problems is considerable. Doctors who have toys in their waiting rooms also are advised to see if any of them have been recalled and to check for chipped, flaking paint-even on those that haven't yet been recalled--since new announcements of toy risk continue. Question: What is Dora according to the passage? Answer: A:","completion":"Dora, according to the passage, is a toy played by children that has been found to contain lead. This toy is mentioned alongside Elmo as an example of a toy that parents are concerned about due to the risks of lead exposure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sir Donald George Bradman, AC (27 August 1908 - 25 February 2001), often referred to as \\"The Don\\", was an Australian international cricketer, widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time. Bradman's career Test batting average of 99.94 has been cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport. The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. Bradman joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 28 June 1940 and was passed fit for air crew duty. The RAAF had more recruits than it could equip and train and Bradman spent four months in Adelaide before the Governor-General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, persuaded Bradman to transfer to the army, a move that was criticised as a safer option for him. Given the rank of Lieutenant, he was posted to the Army School of Physical Training at Frankston, Victoria, to act as a divisional supervisor of physical training. The exertion of the job aggravated his chronic muscular problems, diagnosed as fibrositis. Surprisingly, in light of his batting prowess, a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight. Invalided out of service in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due to the extent of the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed stockbroking during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand. In June 1945, Bradman faced a financial crisis when the firm of Harry Hodgetts collapsed due to fraud and embezzlement. Bradman moved quickly to set up his own business, utilising Hodgetts' client list and his old office in Grenfell Street, Adelaide. The fallout led to a prison term for Hodgetts, and left a stigma attached to Bradman's name in the city's business community for many years. However, the SA Cricket Association had no hesitation in appointing Bradman as their delegate to the Board of Control in place of Hodgetts. Now working alongside some of the men he had battled in the 1930s, Bradman quickly became a leading light in the administration of the game. With the resumption of international cricket, he was once more appointed a Test selector, and played a major role in planning for post-war cricket. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was wrong with him?","completion":"Sir Donald Bradman, who is known to be the greatest batsman of all time, suffered from significant physical health issues during his life. According to your provided information, Bradman's muscular problems, which were diagnosed as fibrositis, were so severe that they eventually got him invalided out of service in June 1941. These chronic muscular problems were so severe that Bradman was unable even to shave or comb his hair due to the extensive muscular pain. In addition to his physical muscular issues, a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight. This was surprising given his extraordinary skills as a batsman. Furthermore, due to his health conditions, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his dominant right hand. This was after being referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders in 1945. Bradman, according to Charles Williams in his biography, might have also suffered from psychosomatic problems which could have been induced by stress and possibly depression. This theory was not disputed by Bradman himself when he read the manuscript of the biography. From the information given, one could surmise that Sir Donald Bradman's health problems were not only physical but might have also involved mental health issues. His physical problems included chronic muscular problems diagnosed as fibrosis, poor eyesight, and loss of feeling in his dominant hand's thumb and index finger. In addition, the suggestion of possible psychosomatic issues indicates that the stress and demands of his life and career could have also affected his health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Given the following context: White Deer Hole Creek is a 20.5-mile (33.0 km) tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River in Clinton, Lycoming and Union counties in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. A part of the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin, the White Deer Hole Creek watershed drains parts of ten townships. The creek flows east in a valley of the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians, through sandstone, limestone, and shale from the Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian periods. As of 2006, the creek and its 67.2-square-mile (174 km2) watershed are relatively undeveloped, with 28.4 percent of the watershed given to agriculture and 71.6 percent covered by forest, including part of Tiadaghton State Forest. The western part of White Deer Hole Creek has very high water quality and is the only major creek section in Lycoming County classified as Class A Wild Trout Waters, defined by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as \\"streams which support a population of naturally produced trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long-term and rewarding sport fishery.\\" The rest of the creek and its major tributary (Spring Creek) are kept stocked. There are opportunities in the watershed for canoeing, hunting, and camping, and trails for hiking and horseback riding. Historically, two paths of the native indigenous peoples ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek. Settlers arrived by 1770, but fled in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War. They returned and the creek served as the southern boundary of Lycoming County when it was formed on April 13, 1795. A logging railroad ran along the creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber clearcutting, and small-scale lumbering continues. During World War II a Trinitrotoluene (TNT) plant, which became a federal prison in 1952, was built in the watershed.

The answer is:","completion":"What does the term \\"BASE\\" in BASE jumping stand for and what are the elements that it encompasses? As per the provided answer, the term \\"BASE\\" in BASE jumping is an acronym that represents four categories of fixed objects from which an individual can jump. Let’s discuss each letter of the acronym: 1. Buildings: This includes any man-made structures such as skyscrapers, towers, etc. The jumper often ascends these structures in a variety of ways - by elevator, stairs, or sometimes even climbing - before making the leap. 2. Antennas: This refers to transmission towers or masts. Like buildings, these are also man-made structures but they typically have a different architecture, often being more slim and tall. 3. Spans: This term refers to bridges. The space beneath the bridge provides an unobstructed area which allows the jumper to achieve freefall. Unlike buildings and antennas, this category also includes natural arches. 4. Earth: This signifies natural landforms, primarily cliffs or mountainous areas. The terrain on these landforms can often be rugged or steep which adds another layer of thrill and risk to the jump. These jumps often require more technical skills due to the varying conditions and potential for unpredictable winds. BASE jumping is essentially parachuting or wingsuit flying from these fixed, high points. It's worth noting that because of the altitudes involved and the proximity to the structure during the jump, it’s considered a very high-risk activity. This sport demands not just physical readiness, but also mental preparedness and the mastering of safety protocols and techniques. Despite the risk involved, many adrenaline junkies are drawn to this extreme sport due to the thrill and exhilaration that comes with it."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late. Tom warmed up properly before running. But I can use this background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). What is an answer for this question: Which runner has a greater chance of getting a tendon injury?

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do all vertebrates have?\\" is \\"fat\\", given that all vertebrates have jaws?","completion":"The right answer to the question \\"what do all vertebrates have?\\" is not \\"fat\\" but rather \\"a vertebral column\\" or \\"a backbone.\\" Although it is true that most vertebrates have both fat and jaws, these characteristics do not solely define the group. The distinguishing feature of vertebrates is the presence of a vertebral column or a backbone, made up of individual vertebrae, which provides structural support and protection to the spinal cord. To clarify further, the term \\"vertebrates\\" refers to animals belonging to the subphylum Vertebrata of the phylum Chordata, which includes mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. The most notable characteristic shared by all vertebrates is the presence of this vertebral column. Other traits shared among vertebrates include a well-developed nervous system, a closed circulatory system, and, indeed, the presence of jaws in most (but not all) vertebrates. While fat is a common feature among vertebrates, it does not solely define the group, and there might be exceptions depending on the species or specific circumstances (e.g., food scarcity). Similarly, jaws are present in most vertebrates but are not a defining characteristic for all. For example, jawless fish like hagfish and lampreys are considered vertebrates but lack jaws. In summary, the right answer to the question \\"what do all vertebrates have?\\" is \\"a vertebral column\\" or \\"a backbone\\" because this feature is the primary characteristic defining the group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1947, the Muroc Army Air Field in California has test pilots fly high-speed aircraft such as the rocket-powered Bell X-1, but they die as a result. After another pilot, Slick Goodlin, demands 150,000 to attempt to break the sound barrier, war hero Captain Chuck Yeager receives the chance to fly the X-1. While on a horseback ride with his wife Glennis, Yeager collides with a tree branch and breaks his ribs, which inhibits him from leaning over and locking the door to the X-1. Worried that he might not fly the mission, Yeager confides in friend and fellow pilot Jack Ridley. Ridley cuts off part of a broomstick and tells Yeager to use it as a lever to help seal the hatch to the X-1, and Yeager becomes the first person to fly at supersonic speed, defeating the \\"demon in the sky\\". Six years later, Muroc, now Edwards Air Force Base, still attracts the best test pilots. Yeager (now a major) and friendly rival Scott Crossfield repeatedly break the other's speed records. They often visit the Happy Bottom Riding Club run by Pancho Barnes, who classifies the pilots at Edwards as either \\"prime\\" (such as Yeager and Crossfield) that fly the best equipment or newer \\"pudknockers\\" who only dream about it.

Q: What effect, related to weather forecasting, occurs not only for sound but for any wave when there is relative motion between the observer and the source? A: A:","completion":"The effect related to weather forecasting that occurs not only for sound but for any wave when there is relative motion between the observer and the source is known as the Doppler Effect (IV). The Doppler Effect, named after Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave relative to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. This phenomenon can be observed in various waves, such as sound, light, and electromagnetic waves. In the context of weather forecasting, the Doppler Effect is particularly significant for meteorologists who use a technology called Doppler radar to measure the velocity and direction of atmospheric phenomena such as precipitation, wind, and storms. A Doppler radar sends out waves, usually in the form of radio or microwaves, which then bounce off objects in the atmosphere, such as raindrops or snowflakes, and return to the radar receiver. By analyzing the frequency change in the reflected waves, meteorologists can determine the motion of the objects, allowing them to make more accurate predictions regarding weather patterns and potential hazards like tornadoes and flash floods. In summary, the Doppler Effect (IV) is the weather forecasting-related phenomenon that occurs with any wave, including sound, when there is relative motion between the observer and the wave source. This effect is a crucial aspect of modern meteorology, enabling accurate and timely predictions of weather events using advanced technologies like Doppler radar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When Jonathan goes outside his eyes start to water and become itchy, and he can't stop sneezing. Jonathan's brother, Thomas, was recently invited to a seafood dinner. Thomas decided to eat some shellfish, and a short while later he felt like his throat was closing up and it was becoming difficult to breathe. and a hint : Allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms might include itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Severe symptoms can cause difficulty breathing, which may be life threatening. Keep in mind that it is the immune system and not the allergen that causes the allergy symptoms. Allergy symptoms can be treated with medications such as antihistamines. Severe allergic reactions may require an injection of the hormone epinephrine. These treatments lessen or counter the immune system’s response. Please answer this question : Who is less likely to be experiencing mild allergy symptoms? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information and comparing the symptoms between Jonathan and Thomas, it appears that Thomas is less likely to be experiencing mild allergy symptoms. Jonathan's symptoms include watery and itchy eyes, along with constant sneezing. These symptoms are quite typical of mild allergic reactions, particularly during spring when there is a high amount of pollen in the air. Pollen allergies are a common type of seasonal allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever. In Jonathan's case, his immune system is overreacting to the pollen as if it is a harmful invader, triggering the release of histamine which causes the mild allergy symptoms he is experiencing. These symptoms can often be managed with over-the-counter antihistamines or other allergy medications. In contrast, Thomas' symptoms appear to be more severe. After eating shellfish at a seafood dinner, he experienced difficulty breathing as if his throat was closing up. These symptoms suggest that Thomas is experiencing a more serious allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening and severe allergic reaction which requires immediate medical attention and treatment with epinephrine, a hormone that helps open the airways and improve blood circulation. Symptoms like difficulty breathing and throat constriction can be potentially life-threatening and are generally not considered mild allergy symptoms. In conclusion, based on the symptoms experienced by both Jonathan and Thomas, it is more likely that Jonathan is experiencing mild allergy symptoms while Thomas is experiencing a more severe allergic reaction. It is crucial for Thomas to receive appropriate medical intervention to address his potentially life-threatening allergic reaction, whereas Jonathan can typically manage his symptoms by using antihistamines or other allergy medications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"Title: Needs Improvement - Potential But Falls Short (2/5) Review: I recently downloaded the app with package com.google.zxing.client.android after hearing a lot about its barcode scanning capabilities. While I had high hopes for its performance and ease of use, I must say that it currently stands at two stars for me, with five being the highest possible rating. There is certainly potential for a truly useful and efficient app, but the current version falls short in several areas. Firstly, let's talk about the user interface. The design is basic and somewhat outdated, giving a dull overall impression. Inputs and buttons can be unresponsive at times, causing unnecessary delays when setting up scans and processing the data. I believe that a more streamlined and modern interface is essential for an optimal user experience. Secondly, the app's actual barcode scanning capability has left me feeling underwhelmed. While it does manage to scan barcodes eventually, the process can often be finicky and frustrating. The scanner sometimes has issues focusing on the barcode, requiring multiple attempts and angle adjustments before it's finally successful. This can defeat the purpose of having a quick and convenient method of scanning barcodes. Improving the scanning accuracy and efficiency should be a top priority for the developers. Additionally, the app's performance issues could use some attention. It tends to freeze or crash frequently, especially when processing large amounts of barcode information. This can be extremely inconvenient and leads to users having to restart the app or even their device. The developers need to focus on optimizing the app's performance and reducing the number of crashes and freezes. Moreover, the app is lacking in terms of features. While barcode scanning is the main selling point, it would be beneficial to expand the app's functionality. For instance, adding a price comparison tool could prove to be a valuable addition that would keep users engaged and recommend the app to their friends and connections. Lastly, the customer support for this app is mediocre at best. The response time to user inquiries and feedback is slow, and the solutions provided to technical issues are often unhelpful. Better customer support could drastically improve the app's overall appeal and reputation. In conclusion, the app with package com.google.zxing.client.android has potential, but it currently falls short in various departments: user-interface, scanning performance, app stability, additional features, and customer support. To rate it higher, I would need to see significant improvements made to address these shortcomings. Until then, I'm giving it two stars out of five."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Tanya, on the other hand, was more focused on the convenience and affordability that the local store offered. She hadn't yet delved into the vast implications of choosing between these two options, and simply followed her usual routine. While she was aware that Emily frequented the farmer's market, she didn't quite understand Emily's motivations nor the underlying reasons that propelled her to do so. Emily, who had taken numerous steps over the years to educate herself about the importance of food sourcing, environmental conservation, and local economies, regularly shared her knowledge with others, hoping to make a positive impact by raising awareness. She took great care in selecting her grocery items, oftentimes asking the farmers themselves about their cultivation methods and the types of seeds they used, as a means to ensure that her choices aligned with her values. Furthermore, she found that the quality and taste of the produce she purchased at the farmer's market far surpassed what she could find at the chain supermarkets. The locally-grown fruits and vegetables were picked at the peak of ripeness, allowing their flavors to fully develop before consumption. This made her meals not only healthier, but more enjoyable as well. In addition to supporting local farmers, Emily also appreciated the sense of community that the farmer's market fostered. Conversations and friendships bloomed between vendors and customers, creating an atmosphere that was both lively and welcoming. Emily enjoyed the opportunity to engage in meaningful exchanges, learn new recipes, and discover novel products that she would have unlikely stumbled upon in a conventional grocery store. Despite Emily's insistence on the importance of purchasing groceries from the farmer's market, Tanya remained hesitant. That is, until one sunny Saturday morning, when Emily decided to invite her friend along to experience first-hand the vibrant world of fresh, locally-sourced produce. Tanya, who had never before set foot in a farmer's market, soon found herself drawn to the enticing sights, the alluring smells of freshly baked bread, and the cheerful sounds of laughter and good-natured bargaining. As they strolled from stall to stall, Emily shared her insights garnered over the years. She explained the significance of each choice she made, and by extension, how those choices directly impacted local farms and the larger community. Tanya soon began to comprehend the importance of promoting sustainable practices and supporting the livelihoods of those who worked hard to supply fresh, nutritious food. That pivotal day marked a turning point in Tanya's perspective, as she realized that there was much more at stake when it came to something as seemingly simple as grocery shopping. From that moment on, she slowly began incorporating more locally-sourced items in her food choices, and started attending the farmer's market with Emily on a regular basis.

When we push ourselves too far outside of our comfort zone , or make decisions too hastily , we get stressed . Answer the following question: What happens when the narrator becomes stressed ?","completion":"When the narrator becomes stressed, various psychological, emotional, and physical reactions occur, affecting their overall well-being, productivity, and interpersonal relationships. These reactions can be broadly categorized into the following: 1. Psychological effects: The narrator's cognitive abilities may be compromised due to stress. They may experience difficulties concentrating, problem-solving, and making sound decisions. Additionally, memory recall and information retention might become challenging. Over time, the narrator may develop negative thought patterns, self-doubt, and a sense of vulnerability, which can adversely impact their self-esteem and overall mental health. 2. Emotional effects: Stress can lead to a wide range of emotional responses in the narrator, such as feelings of anxiety, irritability, frustration, and sadness. They may also become more prone to mood swings and emotional outbursts, which can strain their personal and professional relationships. In severe cases, chronic stress can contribute to the onset of depression and other mental health disorders. 3. Physical effects: The narrator's body may exhibit physical symptoms in response to stress. Some common physical manifestations of stress include headaches, muscle tension, fatigue, digestive issues, and changes in appetite or sleep patterns. When stress is prolonged or becomes chronic, the narrator may be more vulnerable to developing severe health issues, such as cardiovascular diseases, weakened immune systems, and a greater susceptibility to illnesses or infections. 4. Behavioral effects: Stress can also influence the narrator's overall behavior and habits. They may struggle to maintain a proper work-life balance, leading to reduced productivity and procrastination. Additionally, stress can spur unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as substance abuse, overeating, or social withdrawal. Over time, these behaviors can compound stress levels and adversely impact various aspects of the narrator's life, including their career, relationships, and personal well-being. 5. Impact on personal and professional relationships: As the narrator becomes more stressed, their ability to maintain healthy, functional relationships may decline. The increased irritability, emotional outbursts, and mood swings can strain connections with friends, family, and coworkers. In turn, a deteriorating support system can amplify feelings of stress and isolation, creating a vicious cycle. In summary, when the narrator becomes stressed, a cascade of psychological, emotional, physical, and behavioral effects ensue. These reactions can negatively impact their mental and physical health, productivity, decision-making abilities, and relationships with others. Addressing and managing their stress should be a priority for the narrator, as unchecked stress can lead to chronic health problems and diminished overall well-being. By finding coping strategies and maintaining a balanced approach to life, the narrator can potentially reduce counter-productive stress and foster a healthier, more fulfilling life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hattie McDaniel (June 10, 1895 - October 26, 1952) was an American stage actress, professional singer-songwriter, and comedian. She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. The whereabouts of McDaniel's Oscar are currently unknown. In 1992, Jet magazine reported that Howard University could not find it and alleged that it had disappeared during protests in the 1960s. In 1998, Howard University stated that it could find no written record of the Oscar having arrived at Howard. In 2007, an article in the Huffington Post repeated rumors that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry civil rights protesters in the 1960s. The assertion reappeared in the Huffington Post under the same byline in 2009. In 2010, Mo'Nique, the winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the ceremony in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel \\"for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to\\". Her speech revived interest in the whereabouts of McDaniel's plaque. In 2011, J. Freedom duLac reported in the Washington Post that the plaque had disappeared in the 1960s. In November 2011, W. B. Carter, of the George Washington University Law School, published the results of her year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Oscar's fate. Carter rejected claims that students had stolen the Oscar (and thrown it in the Potomac River) as wild speculation or fabrication that traded on long-perpetuated stereotypes of blacks. She questioned the sourcing of the Huffington Post stories. Instead, she argued that the Oscar was likely returned to Howard University's Channing Pollack Theater Collection between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1973 or had possibly been boxed and stored in the drama department at that time. The reason for its removal, she argued, was not civil rights unrest but rather efforts to make room for a new generation of black performers. If neither the Oscar nor any paper trail of its ultimate destiny can be found at Howard today, she suggested, inadequate storage or record-keeping in a time of financial constraints and national turbulence may be blamed. She also suggested that a new generation of caretakers may have failed to realize the historic significance of the 5 1/2\\" x 6\\" plaque.

Given those answer options, answer the question: President Donald Trump's approval rating has headed into unfamiliar territory in recent weeks — upward. Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

Everyone knew that they were about to witness a once-in-a-lifetime event. The fight began with both fighters showcasing their skills and displaying their tactical prowess. Mayweather's defensive expertise made it difficult for Pacquiao to land any significant punches, while Mayweather's counter-punching ability allowed him to catch Pacquiao whenever he got too aggressive. On the other hand, Pacquiao managed to apply constant pressure, keeping Mayweather on his toes and demonstrating his trademark speed and power. As the rounds went on, the fight remained close and extremely competitive. Both fighters continued to push themselves, each knowing that the slightest mistake could cost them their legacy. In the end, it came down to the final round. With both fighters battered and bruised, they gave it their all in an unforgettable display of heart and skill. When the final bell rang, the decision was in the hands of the judges. After a tense few moments, it was announced that the fight had ended in a split decision. Mayweather emerged as the victor, but only by the slimmest of margins. The boxing world celebrated the long-awaited matchup, and the fans were left with a satisfying end to the long-standing debate of who was truly the best pound-for-pound champion. Mayweather and Pacquiao both gained newfound respect for each other, and after the fight, they exchanged words of admiration and gratitude for the opportunity to share the ring. In an unexpected turn of events, Mayweather expressed his interest in promoting and supporting a rematch, willing to overlook his past issues with Bob Arum. Both fighters, with nothing left to prove, acknowledged the possibility of a future rematch but also contemplated retirement. Regardless of the outcome, their showdown remained etched in the annals of boxing history as one of the greatest fights of all time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Choose from: [I] yes [II] no","completion":"[I] Yes. The initial state of Earth was a hot, molten mass, formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago. The planet came into being as a result of the process of accretion, wherein dust and gas in the early solar system clumped together to form larger bodies, ultimately leading to the birth of Earth and other planets. In its infancy, Earth was extremely hot due to residual heat from the accretion process, as well as radioactive decay of isotopes and intense volcanism. The planet underwent frequent collisions with other celestial bodies, including a particularly massive impactor known as Theia. This catastrophic collision is believed to have played a crucial role in the formation of the Moon as debris from both Earth and Theia merged together under the influence of gravity. During this molten, chaotic period, heavy elements, such as iron and nickel, sank to form the planet's core, while lighter elements, such as silicates, rose to form the mantle and crust, setting the stage for the process of differentiation that defined Earth's layered internal structure. Early on, Earth's atmosphere was composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, but constant volcanic activity and the release of gases from the planet's interior led to a chemical transformation of the atmosphere to one dominated by water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and other trace gases. Over time, as the planet slowly cooled, the outer layers of the molten Earth began to solidify, eventually forming a thin, fragile crust. The bombardment of comets and asteroids provided Earth with water, which eventually filled the planet's basins, creating the first oceans. Life on Earth is thought to have originated in these early oceans, around 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, as simple single-celled organisms. Thus, the initial state of Earth was an extremely hot and molten mass, characterized by extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other celestial bodies. It was through a series of evolutionary processes that Earth transformed into the habitable and diverse planet we know today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu. answer the following question: Q: What is the full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I? Answer:","completion":"The woman married to Maximilian I is Mary of Burgundy. Her grandfather, as per the provided context, is Philip the Good. So, the full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I is Philip the Good. The reasoning behind this answer is that according to the given context, the Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed on to several family members, including \\"his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I.\\" The last male named before this part of the sentence is Philip the Good, which means Philip is the \\"his\\" referred to here and, therefore, Mary's grandfather."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Buccal testosterone is taken orally through a lozenge. The lozenge dissolves in your mouth.","completion":"This method of administration allows for the testosterone to be absorbed directly into your bloodstream through the mucous membranes of your mouth, bypassing the digestive system and liver, which can sometimes cause unwanted side effects or reduce the effectiveness of the hormone. Buccal testosterone also offers a more consistent and steady release of the hormone into the body, providing better therapeutic results for those seeking to treat low testosterone levels or transition to a male physical appearance. To use buccal testosterone, you will usually be prescribed a specific dosage by your healthcare provider, who will take into account your particular needs and medical history. Generally, it's advised to place the lozenge between your cheek and gum, allowing it to dissolve slowly over a period of approximately 30 minutes. During this time, it's crucial not to chew, swallow or disrupt the lozenge in any way, as this will impact the absorption of testosterone into your system. It's also advisable to avoid consuming food, beverages, or indulging in activities like smoking while the lozenge is dissolving. Many users prefer to take their dose either in the early morning or right before bed to minimize discomfort or the potential for interference with daily tasks. Additionally, be sure to practice good oral hygiene, as buccal testosterone can occasionally contribute to gum irritation or other oral health issues if proper care is not taken. As with any hormone therapy, it's essential to follow your doctor's instructions closely and attend regular checkups to monitor your progress, ensure the correct dosage is being utilized, and address any questions or concerns that may arise. Some potential side effects of buccal testosterone include: gum or mouth irritation, a bitter taste in the mouth, headache, and mood swings. If you experience any of these symptoms or notice other changes in your body or mood, contact your healthcare provider for further evaluation. They may adjust your dosage or recommend an alternative method of testosterone administration that better suits your needs. Remember that testosterone therapy should only be undertaken when prescribed by a qualified medical professional, as misusing or abusing it can lead to a wide range of health issues. It's crucial to work closely with your doctor to determine if buccal testosterone is right for you and to establish an appropriate treatment plan to address your unique needs and goals. In conclusion, if you're considering taking testosterone, buccal administration is an effective and convenient option that may provide the results you're searching for while minimizing the potential for side effects. Always follow your healthcare provider's guidance and recommendations to ensure the safe and successful use of this hormone therapy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Looking for a harder-hitting rock sound than that of All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2 began recording their eleventh studio album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, in February 2003 with producer Chris Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs \\"had no magic\\". The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \\"sonic cohesion\\".

Here is an article: OAKLAND, Calif. – Californians may have rejected legalizing recreational marijuana, but voters across the state are more than ready to reap revenue from the state's largest cash crop. On Election Day, all 10 cities with local measures on their ballots approved new or higher taxes on marijuana sales that put the need for cash above the stigma of a federally banned drug. The same was true in Colorado, where medical marijuana was approved in 2000. Nine municipalities approved higher sales taxes on medical marijuana products this year. So far, no Colorado town with a marijuana tax question on the ballots has rejected it. The embrace of pot as a legitimate revenue stream signals the continued mainstreaming of marijuana in both states, despite the defeat of California's Proposition 19. \\"As part of treating this business like any other business in the city, we need to update our business operation tax to include them,\\" said Amy Williams, a spokeswoman for the City of Sacramento, where voters approved a 4 percent tax on medical pot. Other cities that approved special marijuana taxes, including San Jose, Long Beach and Oakland, have all struggled with recession-driven deficits, and all decided to look to marijuana to bridge the gap. Some cities put measures on the ballot to prepare themselves in case voters approved Proposition 19, which included a provision that would have legalized small-scale cultivation of marijuana across the state. Long Beach's measure, which passed overwhelmingly, would have imposed a 15 percent tax on businesses that sold marijuana for recreational use. Voters in Stockton imposed a 4 percent tax on medical marijuana dispensaries. The same measure would have levied a 10 percent tax on non-medical marijuana businesses. Oakland voters led the way last year by passing the country's first special tax on medical marijuana, an extra 18 for every 1,000 in sales on top of the city's regular sales tax of 9.75 percent. In the most recent election, voters raised that tax rate to 50 for every 1,000. And the city is poised to lead again in pushing the limits of government-sanctioned pot sales. Later this month, the city will begin taking applications for permits to run four industrial-scale medical marijuana growing operations. Nearly 300 groups and individuals have registered their interest in applying for the permits. Each would have to pay a 5,000 nonrefundable fee to apply. Recipients of the permits would be required to pay an annual fee of 211,000. The decision to tax the drug in a way that resembles special taxes on recreational substances like alcohol and tobacco moves the state even closer to acknowledging openly that marijuana being sold legally under state law is \\"medical\\" in name only. Currently, tobacco distributors in California must pay 87 cents in taxes per pack of cigarettes and a tax rate of more than 33 percent for other tobacco products. Beer and wine are taxed at a rate of 20 cents per gallon. Hard liquor taxes are 3.30 per gallon for spirits less than 100 proof and 6.60 per gallon for over 100 proof. Medical marijuana advocates are frustrated by the comparison to other mood-altering substances. They believe that what they see as the drug's broad therapeutic properties should put pot in the same category as prescription medications, which are not taxed. They also believe that not granting the drug the respect they think it deserves as medicine has led to crackdowns in other California cities less enthusiastic about embracing marijuana as a revenue source. Recent regulations have forced many dispensaries in Los Angeles to close, after a loophole in a moratorium on such operations allowed hundreds of pot retailers to open, turning the city for a time into a free-for-all of legal weed. San Diego prosecutors have waged a long-running battle against dispensaries, arguing that state law does not permit the retail pot storefronts that have become the norm. Fresno officials used zoning laws to shut down dispensaries, while an outright ban on dispensaries in Anaheim remains tied up in court. In San Jose, some dispensary operators are frustrated by what they see as contradictory messages from city government. On the one hand, the City Council has been working to reach an agreement on regulating as many as 80 pot retailers that have sprung up in the past two years. At the same time, county narcotics officers have led raids on dispensaries that investigators say are using medical marijuana as a pretense to sell drugs. Yet how much revenue cities will really see from marijuana remains difficult to predict. Dispensaries have always been required to pay state sales tax like any other business, but many would rather risk state penalties for not paying taxes than leave a paper trail for federal authorities. While the medical marijuana business has made some entrepreneurs wealthy, taxes on the drug are not universally viewed as a salvation for ailing local economies. In Sacramento, officials estimated that taxes on dispensaries would realistically bring in about 500,000 per year. A financial review earlier this year projected deficits topping 50 million annually in coming years. \\"Of course we need whatever we can get, but it's not going to make a huge dent in our problem,\\" Williams said.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The town that had more growth of algae because of fertilizer is Big town. Big town used pesticides and fertilizers in their approach to agriculture, which can lead to the runoff of these chemicals into nearby water sources. These excess nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers, can trigger the rapid growth of algae, a phenomenon known as an algal bloom. On the other hand, Small town applied permaculture principles and organic farming methods, which typically avoid or limit the use of synthetic fertilizers. Instead, they rely on natural and sustainable methods to nourish the soil and facilitate plant growth. As a result, the likelihood of excessive nutrient runoff and the subsequent growth of algae is significantly reduced in Small town."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: From what song, did a Czech rock group take its name? In a 1991 interview, Zappa reported that he was a registered Democrat but added \\"that might not last long—I'm going to shred that\\". Describing his political views, Zappa categorized himself as a \\"practical conservative\\". He favored limited government and low taxes; he also stated that he approved of national defense, social security, and other federal programs, but only if recipients of such programs are willing and able to pay for them. He favored capitalism, entrepreneurship, and independent business, stating that musicians could make more from owning their own businesses than from collecting royalties. He opposed communism, stating, \\"A system that doesn't allow ownership ... has—to put it mildly—a fatal design flaw.\\" He had always encouraged his fans to register to vote on album covers, and throughout 1988 he had registration booths at his concerts. He even considered running for president of the United States as an independent.Zappa was an atheist. He recalled his parents being \\"pretty religious\\" and trying to make him go to Catholic school despite his resentment. He felt disgust towards organized religion (Christianity in particular) because he believed that it promoted ignorance and anti-intellectualism. Some of his songs, concert performances, interviews and public debates in the 1980s criticized and derided Republicans and their policies, President Ronald Reagan, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), televangelism, and the Christian Right, and warned that the United States government was in danger of becoming a \\"fascist theocracy\\".In early 1990, Zappa visited Czechoslovakia at the request of President Václav Havel. Havel designated him as Czechoslovakia's \\"Special Ambassador to the West on Trade, Culture and Tourism\\". Havel was a lifelong fan of Zappa, who had great influence in the avant-garde and underground scene in Central Europe in the 1970s and 1980s (a Czech rock group that was imprisoned in 1976 took its name from Zappa's 1968 song \\"Plastic People\\").

The unprocessed images show its large craters formed by millions of years of collisions with space rocks.

Do we want our brave spaceship Cassini to measure the gravity of: - Becky Evans's gravity field: This doesn't sound right. Becky Evans is the author of this story, not a planet or moon! - Cassini's gravity field: This also doesn't sound correct. Cassini is the spaceship itself. It's like trying to measure your own height using your own hands! - Cassini spacecraft's gravity field: Again, this seems a bit off because we're talking about the spacecraft again. - Craggy's gravity field: This one is also not quite right. Craggy describes the surface of the moon, not an actual place. - Earth's gravity field: If the story was about measuring Earth's gravity field, our spaceship wouldn't have needed to fly all the way to Saturn's moon, right? It can do that job from here. - Nasa's gravity field: This one's funny! NASA is an organization full of brainy scientists who investigate space. They don't have a gravity field of their own! - Rhea's gravity field: This seems likely. Rhea is the moon that our spaceship Cassini was exploring. - Saturn's gravity field: This could be a good analysis too, but since our spaceship was getting close to Rhea, it might be more interested in what's happening there. - icy moon Rhea's gravity field: Well, Rhea is an icy moon, so this answer is just a fancy way of saying \\"Rhea's gravity field\\"! So based on all of this, the best endings would be that Cassini was studying \\"Rhea's gravity field\\" or the \\"icy moon Rhea's gravity field\\".

Given the question: - Composition of blood is regulated - Volume of water in blood is kept constant - PH is kept at a constant level - Kidneys help regulate blood pressure - Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells - Calcium levels are maintained. What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","completion":"The first step of the process is the regulation of blood composition. Blood composition is highly regulated by various systems in the body. It's a process constantly at work to maintain our physiological balance. The kidneys carry out the major role in this regulation, by ensuring the right quantities of various substances while it expels metabolic waste products like urea, creatinine, etc. 1. Blood flows into the kidneys. Kidneys filter about 1/5th of the blood plasma that enters the glomeruli (the function unit of kidneys). 2. The filtered substance, also known as glomerular filtrate, enters the tubules within the kidneys. This filtrate includes water, glucose, amino acids, urea, and a variety of salts. 3. As the filtrate goes through the tubules, the kidneys carry out selective reabsorption, where the essential substances which the body still needs, such as glucose and amino acids, are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. 4. Kidneys also perform selective secretion where additional unwanted substances such as excess potassium or hydrogen ions are also removed from blood and added into the tubules. 5. Water, salt, and electrolyte reabsorption helps in maintaining the volume and composition of blood. Meanwhile, the kidneys are actively involved in regulation of blood pH by controlling hydrogen ion concentration. 6. The kidneys play a crucial role in regulating blood pressure by altering the volume of blood or amount of salt reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. 7. When oxygen levels in the body decrease, kidneys produce and release erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells, thus increasing oxygen levels. 8. The kidneys also regulate calcium level by promoting vitamin D activation, which increases the absorption of calcium in intestines. So, the primary step in this overall functioning of the kidneys is the blood flowing into the kidneys and filtration occurring in the glomerulus. This sets the stage for the series of regulation and balance processes that follow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Review: I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and incredulous. The first shot is a camera feed from a robot traveling towards a bomb and is, naturally, shaky. But then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode, even during quiet conversational moments, to the point of ridiculousness. Have the rental houses run out of tripods and Steadicams? The fact that it was shot on 16mm doesn't help, as the entire movie is grainy as well as shaky. For all the effort Bigelow put into accurate vehicles and equipment, there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that they undermine the movie's credibility. - A car would not erupt in flames after a single shot, and once engulfed would not be extinguished by a small hand-held extinguisher. - A single Humvee would not be driving around Baghdad in 2004, but would be backed up by other vehicles in case of breakdown or attack. - It would be exceptionally unlikely to be able to hit a running insurgent at long range, where the bullet is clearly taking over a second to reach the target. - I believe bombs were brought to designated disposal areas on or near a base, not some random spot in the middle of the desert. - The oil tanker attack is stated to have occurred in the Green Zone, a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within. The zone is mostly offices and palaces with few residences, yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warren of dark alleys and lurking insurgents. Oddly, James never gets in trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions to each take an alley by themselves, thus setting up the attempted kidnapping. - Speaking of which, the 3-man team is always depicted clearing buildings, chasing insurgents etc. on their own, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there. - How many hours does the team have to stare at a dead insurgent hanging out a window to figure out he's not faking it? There were no establishing shots to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was or where Baghdad was in relation. I had no idea who the EOD team reported to, nor were any other characters fleshed out. These are things the characters would know, so we should too. Many of the \\"surprises\\" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it's obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will get into trouble with the Iraqis he's trying to move along, that the choice of cereals back home will be overwhelming, and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle. Finally, there was an almost complete lack of character development. Renner's character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenalin. He's exactly the same at the end of the movie. What's the point? If this is indeed the best so far of the Iraqi war movies, it's a sorry bunch.

Context: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

Form of expression: This gesture is commonly used by Silvio Berlusconi as a sign of disbelief. Waving your hands in the air is as undeniably Italian as buffalo mozzarella, bankruptcy and bunga bunga. But the well known tradition of gesturing is not just an expression of their extensive range of emotions – Italians use around 250 distinct hand signals in everyday conversation, experts have revealed. Gestures, most of which originated in Naples, generally include fingers flying horizontally from the chin, exaggerated shrugs and upheld palms, and lots of exasperated cries and raised eyebrows. Some are offensive – meaning ‘gay’ or ‘cuckold’. But many are mundane: ‘can I have a cigarette’, ‘call me’. Or ‘tastes good’, virtually all now internationally recognised gestures. Perhaps the best known is the one used regularly by Silvio Berlsuconi to express disbelief at the stupidity of what someone is saying. The hands are slightly cupped, with the finger tips forming upward-pointing cones which are shaken more or less violently, depending on the degree of exasperation. Very common in Naples, it translates as ‘What do you want?’ Professor of psychology at Roma Tre University and an expert on gestures, Isabella Poggi has identified 250 individual signs, that she says are akin to a language in their own right. The signs can have quite complex meanings, she told the NY Times; ‘There are gestures expressing a threat or a wish or desperation or shame or pride,’ she said. The sign for ‘I don’t give a ****’ is an act of defiance.: ‘It’s a rebellion against power, a way of reacquiring one’s own dignity.’ The only thing that separates hand gestures from sign language is that they are used individually, she said. Meaning: The range of signs can have quite complex meanings, from desperation to shame. Here, Berlusconi seems to be pinching his lips, telling someone to stop talking. Talking with hands: The only thing that separates hand gestures from sign language is that they are used individually. No one knows for certain why the system of gestures developed. One theory is that Italians developed them as an secret language of communication during centuries of foreign occupation — by Austria, France and Spain in the 14th through 19th centuries, Professor Poggi said. And in busy cities like Naples, gesturing was a way of marking one’s territory. ‘To get attention, people gestured and used their whole bodies,’ she added. Recognisable: Some of the signs are easy to decipher. Here, the Italian Minister for Integration Cecile Kyenge is raising her hand to stop someone mid-speech. Salute: Bank of Italy deputy governor Fabrizio Saccomanni gestures during a meeting. The hand movements developed from a time when people gestured with their whole bodies. Hand gesturing appears to be an ancient phenomenon. Gestures used by the figures painted on ancient Greek vases found in the Naples area can be easily compared to those used by today’s Neapolitans. Italian writer Italo Svevo wrote in a letter to his wife from England in 1901. ‘It seems that in this country, I’m actually a laughing stock on account of my way of gesturing... Hands in pockets - only then can you speak English.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article discusses the importance of hand gestures in Italian culture, mentioning that Italians use around 250 distinct hand signals in everyday conversation, with many of these gestures originating in Naples.

The use of hand gestures in Italy dates back centuries and might have been developed as a secret communication method during foreign occupation or as a means of getting attention in busy cities.

Challenges Faced: During his seven-year tenure, Topping has also faced significant challenges as the chairman of the SPFL. One key issue the league had to overcome was the financial uncertainty caused by several major clubs facing economic difficulties. Topping was vital in helping the SPFL navigate through this turbulent period and has since pushed for stronger financial regulations among clubs.

Network effects are a large factor with electrification. When converting lines to electric, the connections with other lines must be considered. Some electrifications have subsequently been removed because of the through traffic to non-electrified lines. If through traffic is to have any benefit, time consuming engine switches must occur to make such connections or expensive dual mode engines must be used. This is mostly an issue for long distance trips, but many lines come to be dominated by through traffic from long-haul freight trains (usually running coal, ore, or containers to or from ports). In theory, these trains could enjoy dramatic savings through electrification, but it can be too costly to extend electrification to isolated areas, and unless an entire network is electrified, companies often find that they need to continue use of diesel trains even if sections are electrified. The increasing demand for container traffic which is more efficient when utilizing the double-stack car also has network effect issues with existing electrifications due to insufficient clearance of overhead electrical lines for these trains, but electrification can be built or modified to have sufficient clearance, at additional cost. What can be a drawback of electrification of long distance freight trains?","completion":"A drawback of electrification of long distance freight trains is that it can be too costly to extend electrification to isolated areas.

Article:Paramedics treated about 12,000 people who were so drunk it was noted on Scottish Ambulance Service systems in the six months to the end of September. The figures were obtained by the Scottish Conservatives under freedom of information laws. The ambulance service said alcohol had a significant impact on its operations. It comes after a recent internal Scottish Ambulance Service survey showed alcohol was a factor in more than half of all call-outs ambulance staff dealt with at weekends. The latest figures showed Scotland's largest health board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, had the highest number of alcohol-related 999 call-outs in the six month period at 3,849. It was followed by NHS Lothian, with 1,935, and NHS Lanarkshire, with 1,470. Tory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said the statistics highlighted how \\"deep-rooted and complex\\" a problem alcohol is in Scottish society. He said: \\"Not only is it harming those who are over-consuming, but it is diverting scarce resources away from those whose need was not so avoidable. \\"Of course the Scottish government and NHS can always do more to discourage reckless patterns of drinking and provide more help for paramedics who have to repeatedly go into these challenging situations - often several times each shift. \\"But ultimately this is a case of personal responsibility, and that's where the real change has to come from.\\" A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said its teams had to respond to an increase in demand over the festive period, which was largely driven by alcohol. He added: \\"They are highly trained professionals who are frustrated by the amount of time they spend looking after patients who are simply intoxicated. \\"Our staff should not have to fear for their own safety when responding to patients but alcohol is often a key factor in assaults. \\"Assaults or threatening behaviour are reported to the police and support and counselling services are available to staff.\\" Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said a recent four nations report found that Scotland was leading the way in the UK in taking action to tackle alcohol misuse. She added: \\"However, the harmful effects of excessive alcohol consumption puts additional pressure on these services, and this is another reason why everyone should drink responsibly and keep safe.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"In the six months leading up to September, paramedics treated around 12,000 people in Scotland for alcohol-related issues, according to data obtained by the Scottish Conservatives.

Jamie learned to apply makeup from videos rather than from written instructions, because the","completion":"visual aspect made it easier for her to understand the technique and the ideal color combinations. Watching her favorite beauty influencers like James Charles, NikkieTutorials, and Jackie Aina, she slowly but surely became more and more adept at the art of makeup application. One sunny afternoon, Jamie felt a surge of inspiration and decided to try her hand at an adventurous, new look. After hours of watching beauty tutorials from her favorite gurus, she was eager to put her skills to the test. She began by selecting shades from her favorite eyeshadow palette - a mix of sparkly blues and deep purples, meant to mimic the colors of a night sky. She started with blending lighter hues in the crease of her eyelid, aiming for a sophisticated smoky effect. This step took the most time, as Jamie methodically layered and blended the eyeshadows, painstakingly ensuring the perfect level of shading. With the eyelids taking shape, she continued with the highlight, applying shimmering silver on the brow bone and inner corner of her eye. Satisfied with the iridescent glow, Jamie proceeded to apply a black gel eyeliner, gently winging it out at the corners. She was keen on it being sharp, following Jackie's advice of aiming for a liner that could cut. Finally, she put on a generous coat of mascara, lifting her lashes to the sky. The next piece in Jamie's makeup masterpiece was a stunning contour. Defined cheekbones were the goal, so she carefully picked a cool-toned bronzer to deepen the hollows of her cheeks. Just like Nikkie taught her, she used a slightly damp beauty sponge to blend the bronzer seamlessly, giving her face dimension. Jamie then skillfully applied blush to the apples of her cheeks, adding a flush of warmth. This time, she opted for a rosy pink, a tribute to her childhood memories of playing dress-up. She illuminated her cheekbones, tip of her nose, and cupid's bow with an ice-white highlighter, capturing an ethereal glow. The finishing touch was her lips. Pondering her options, she decided on a matte plum lipstick, matching it to the shades of the eyeshadow. Meticulously outlining her lips, she filled them in with the rich color. Once completed, she looked in the mirror, blinking in surprise at the transformation. Her handiwork had paid off, showcasing her newfound skills in blending, highlighting, and bringing drama to her look. She felt empowered, like her favorite beauty influencers, ready to make a bold statement. That night, she posted a picture of her masterpiece on Instagram, her heart swelling with pride as the likes and comments poured in. Friends both old and new showered her with compliments, marveling at her newfound talent and how far she had come. Emboldened by the positive feedback, Jamie decided she would continue to hone her skills and explore the creative world of makeup. Even though she knew that success wouldn't come overnight, the journey excited her. She’d documented her progress and started a YouTube channel, enthusiastically sharing her growth and knowledge with others. Years down the line, her persistence and passion yielded results. With a growing fan base, Jamie became a successful beauty influencer, inspiring countless others to follow in her footsteps and express their creativity through the art of makeup. Throughout it all, she understood the importance of dedication, learning, and growth and would always remember the journey that started with makeup tutorials on sunny afternoons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Our favorite was the Denny's about ten miles outside of downtown Savannah, and we had a regular waitress that was AWESOME. As a side note, I met her several years later and found out we were a major help putting her daughter through school. We had one kid in our group who was a perpetual problem, a wannabe at everything. He just tried too freaking hard to be the center of attention. Well, he joined us ONCE in a trip to Denny's.

Translate to English","completion":"At this point, it is quite evident that there are various opinions present. In any discussion or debate, it is not uncommon to find that there are several differing viewpoints. These varying opinions often stem from the diverse experiences, backgrounds, and perspectives of the individuals involved. In many cases, such diversity in opinion can prove to be quite healthy, as it can foster constructive dialogue and bring forth ideas that might not have otherwise been considered. One must remember that when they encounter multiple opinions, it is crucial to maintain an open mind and a willingness to listen to others. Underestimating the value of differing viewpoints can lead to narrow-mindedness and a lack of progress in solving complex issues. A key aspect of productive dialogue involves acknowledging and respecting these differences, as well as valuing the insights that they may provide. While it may be natural to form an initial bias towards one's own perspective, it is important to be mindful of this tendency and to actively work towards maintaining an objective and balanced stance. One way to foster understanding and bridge the gaps between conflicting viewpoints is to engage in active listening, which means truly paying attention to what the other person is saying, asking clarifying questions, and providing affirmations in order to enhance the conversation. Another strategy to derive benefit from a variety of opinions is to be willing to adapt and even change one's own stance when presented with compelling evidence or well-reasoned arguments. This flexibility not only reflects a genuine commitment to achieving the best possible outcome but also demonstrates a spirit of cooperation and collaboration. We must also bear in mind that while some differences in thought may seem irreconcilable, many times these disagreements can be explored further to identify common ground or areas of mutual interest. Adopting a more inclusive and empathetic approach to exploring divergent perspectives can often result in the discovery of workable compromises and innovative solutions. In this way, when confronted with numerous opinions in any given situation, it is vital to recognize the value of differing viewpoints, engage in open communication and dialogue, and work towards identifying commonalities while respecting and learning from the diverse perspectives present.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who signed a declaration stating that \\"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\\"? ? Shackleton's February 1907 announcement that he intended to base his expedition at the old Discovery headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. \\"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work,\\" he wrote, adding: \\"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\\". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.Shackleton's initial reply was accommodating: \\"I would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself\\". Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. \\"I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound\\", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided \\"what limits he puts on his own rights\\". To this Shackleton replied: \\"There is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further\\".The matter was unresolved when Scott returned from sea duty in May 1907. Scott pressed for a line of demarcation at 170° W—everything to the west of that line, including Ross Island, McMurdo Sound, and Victoria Land, would be Scott's preserve. Shackleton, with other concerns pressing on him, felt obliged to concede. On 17 May he signed a declaration stating that \\"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\\", and that he would seek to land further east, either at the Barrier Inlet visited briefly during the Discovery Expedition, or at King Edward VII Land. He would not touch the coast of Victoria Land at all. It was a capitulation to Scott and Wilson, and meant forfeiting the expedition's aim of reaching the South Magnetic Pole which was located within Victoria Land.

OLD TOWN - the heart and soul of Key West and the place most visitors spend their time - is only one mile by two. The Crew's house by the cemetery was less than half a mile from where they'd last seen Winston. Walking, it might've taken ten minutes to get there, but on Chloe's Vespa it was a hair-raising three-minute ride away. When they got there, Paul saw no sign of either Winston or Lily, so he assumed they were still inside the rundown shack that passed for a gallery. They parked a block away and approached at a brisk walk, Paul almost jogging to keep up with Chloe's excited strides. Winston was Chloe's mentor in what they referred to as \\"The Life,\\" this being a euphemism for a whole range of different activities, groups and lifestyles that fell under the general category of living underground and off the information grid. Paul, after defrauding his former partners and then running afoul of the law in a very public way, had been living The Life for almost a year and a half now. Chloe, as near as he could tell, had been doing it for almost a decade. Winston had started in the late '60s as a 16-year-old member of the notorious Weather Underground. He not only led his own Crew, he was also in contact with dozens, maybe scores of other such groups all over the world, including Chloe and Paul's little Crew of four.

Instead, this is a hopelessly dull and pointless waste of time without even a satirical or titillating plotline to make you want to turn the page. It actually IS a book you can put down. It doesn't manage to fall into the category of beach reading, although you might want to throw it in the ocean.Pam deserves better....Her co-writer could have come up with something more Jackie Collins-esque. Was the BAYWATCH babe playing it too safe, trying to straddle the fence between sexpot and respectable author? I think probably so. Too bad for her readers and/or fans. If the subject matter weren't so distasteful, it would suit the pre-teen girl demographic but instead it is just a story adrift. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is clearly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment by stating that they \\"foolishly expected more from this book\\" and refers to it as a \\"hopelessly dull and pointless waste of time.\\" They also criticize the book's lack of humor, insight, and captivating plotline. Furthermore, the reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the book's inability to fall into the category of beach reading and even suggests that it might be more fitting to \\"throw it in the ocean.\\" The reviewer also expresses a certain level of sympathy towards Pam Anderson, stating that she \\"deserves better\\" and that her co-writer could have come up with a more engaging story in the style of Jackie Collins. The critique of the book's attempt to straddle the fence between \\"sexpot and respectable author\\" highlights the reviewer's belief that the book fails to appeal to its intended audience of adult readers and is instead more suited for pre-teen girls despite the distasteful subject matter.

Movie title: Buffy the Vampire Slayer Movie plot: High school senior Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson) is introduced as a stereotypical, shallow cheerleader at Hemery High School in Los Angeles. She is a carefree popular mean girl whose main concerns are shopping and spending time with her rich, snooty friends and her boyfriend, Jeffrey. While at school one day, she is approached by a man who calls himself Merrick (Donald Sutherland). He informs her that she is The Slayer, or Chosen One, destined to kill vampires, and he is a Watcher whose duty it is to guide and train her. She initially rebukes his claims, but is convinced that he is right when he is able to describe a recurring dream of hers in detail. In addition, Buffy is exhibiting uncanny abilities not known to her, including heightened agility, senses, and endurance, yet she repeatedly tries Merrick's patience with her frivolous nature and sharp-tongued remarks. After several successful outings, Buffy is drawn into conflict with Lothos (Rutger Hauer), a local vampire king and his acolyte, Amilyn (Paul Reubens). Two young men, Oliver Pike (Luke Perry), and best friend Benny (David Arquette), who resented Buffy and her friends due to differing social circles, are out drinking when they are attacked by Amilyn. Benny is turned but Pike is saved by Merrick. As a vampire, Benny visits Pike and tries to get him to join him. Later, when Pike and his boss are discussing Benny, Pike tells him to run if he sees him. Not only this, but a studious girl from Buffy's class, Cassandra, is abducted one night by Amilyn and sacrificed to Lothos. When her body is found, the news spreads through LA and Hemery High, but her murder is met with indifference from Buffy's clique. When Pike realizes there is something wrong with Benny and that he is no longer safe, he decides to leave town. His plan is thwarted, however, when he encounters Amilyn and his tribe of vampires. Amilyn hitches a ride on the hood of his van which crashes into a tree just before Amilyn loses an arm. Buffy and Merrick arrive to rescue him and Amilyn flees...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I picked up this Sporf in Amsterdam Schipol airport. A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

They observed that the sporf, while designed to be a \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating a full three-course meal on the plane, had a fatal flaw: one can only use one part of the sporf effectively at any given time.

Article: We had one class for computers when I was in school, which was also introduced new in school and all the students did not attend it. I took it because I had free period and was interested in taking it. In those days we could not image that computers will become so important in our lives otherwise most of the students would have joined the computer class. Computers are beneficial for almost anyone and the present generation is growing in an atmosphere where you need the computers for doing almost everything .If they are not made computer literate they will lag behind in all the activities. Nowadays almost all schools have some kind of computer courses for the students so that they learn the fundamentals of the computer. It will not be possible to do it if they don't have computer classes. Most of the homes have personal computers now and most children are already aware of the basics before they join school. Computing courses are also good for adults who are not familiar with the computer as most of the jobs which are available today have the use of computer in some way or the other. Adults who have not used the computer before are generally quite anxious, but an easy computing course will be able to change the way they think in a few weeks. If you are interested, you can join a computing course which is longer and teaches you more than the basics, but you may have to spend more time in the completing course. They are very useful courses as _ teaches you ways to use the fundamental programs which are typically used in various jobs. It is also possible you may like to do the computing course for enjoyment as some of the classes are also free .There are courses which charge a fee for skills like graphic design and photo editing . They are a lot of fun too and may also be useful when you do a job , depending on the kind of career ,someone you choose or have . You will find these courses in the colleges, as well as online, if you already are familiar with the use of computer. Question: Most of the students didn't attend the computer course probably because _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"they thought computers were useless\\"?","completion":"No, the answer \\"they thought computers were useless\\" may not be entirely accurate. The students' lack of interest in attending the computer course could be attributed to various factors. One possible reason is that they might not have fully grasped the significance and potential impact computers would have on their futures, as the course was newly introduced at the time. Additionally, some students might have been unaware of the full extent of benefits computers could offer, while others might have had scheduling conflicts or more interest in other subjects. It would, however, be incorrect to assume that most of the students believed computers were useless. In many cases, they simply might not have recognized the long-term importance of computer literacy and the value of the course in their lives and future careers. Consequently, as computers have become increasingly essential in various aspects of daily life, more schools have started incorporating computing courses to ensure their students will not lag behind in this critical area."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The man who finally found the way from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific was Ferdinand Magellan. Magellan sailed from Seville in August, 1519 with five ships and about 280 men. Fourteen months later, after spending the cold winter on the coast of Patagonia, he discovered the channel which is now called Magellan Strait . In November, 1520, after many months of dangers from rocks and storms, the three remaining ships entered the ocean on the other side of South America. They then continued, hoping to reach Asia. But they did not see any land until they reached the islands off the coast of Asia. Before they arrived at these islands, later known as the Philippines, men were dying of starvation. While they were staying in the Philippines, Magellan was killed in a battle. The remaining officers then had to get back to Spain. They decided to sail round Africa. After many difficulties, one ship with eighteen men sailed into Seville three years after leaving. They were all that remained of Magellan's expedition. However, their achievement was great.

Article: Three French students were charged at the weekend over the murder of a fellow student after an attempt to dissolve her body in acid inspired by the TV series “Breaking Bad” was discovered. The battered and decomposing body of Eva Bourseau, 23, allegedly killed over a £4,250 drugs debt, was found by her mother in a plastic container at her flat in Toulouse, in the south of France, last month. One suspect admitted to police they had tried to mimic a scene from the hit American show in which a struggling chemistry teacher and one of his former students go into the drugs business and use acid to dispose of the body of a murdered rival, prosecution sources said. They bought “acid and a plastic trunk to immerse the body and dissolve it”, a source said. The TV series highlighted the need to use a plastic container as acid would dissolve metal. Described as “brilliant students”, the three young men had become involved in drugs and started dealing amphetamines to other students, according to their lawyers. Photo: AFP Two of them allegedly went to the home of Eva Bourseau, who was studying art history, to collect the money she owed them. When she failed to pay, they launched a frenzied attack with a crowbar and knuckledusters. Afterwards they behaved in a cool-headed manner, returning to the flat several times in the next two days to check on the condition of the body, replace air fresheners covering up the smell of decomposing flesh and steal valuables, according to prosecution sources. They apparently believed it would take several days for the body to dissolve but the plan went wrong when Eva’s mother, worried by her daughter’s failure to return calls, went to the flat and made the macabre discovery. Two suspects have been placed under formal investigation, a stage in the French legal process equivalent to being charged, for murder. A third man has been charged as an accomplice. The youngest suspect is 19 and the others are in their 20s. Pierre Alfort, the lawyer for one of the suspects, an engineering student, said his client “went wrong when he got involved in the party scene and local nightlife.” ||||| A forensics team loads the remains of a woman onto a vehicle after her dismembered body was found in a plastic storage trunk in a building in Toulouse on Aug. 4, 2015. (AFP/Getty Images) Four French students have been arrested and indicted in connection with the killing of a 23-year-old woman who was found dead last week, dismembered and decomposing in a plastic container filled with acid, police said. Three men and a woman, ages 19 to 23, were indicted in southern France during the weekend in connection with the slaying, which was thought to be inspired by AMC’s dark drama “Breaking Bad,” the prosecutor told Agence France-Presse. Two men were indicted for murder, drug trafficking and robbery. The third was indicted for murder by complicity. The men remain in custody. The woman was indicted for drug trafficking and put under judicial supervision. [Maraschino cherry king, caught with alleged underground marijuana operation, commits suicide] Eva Bourseau, a 23-year-old former student in Toulouse, France, apparently owed the drug dealers more than 6,500. When she failed to pay, the suspects sought revenge, police said. On July 26, two male suspects reportedly went to her apartment and allegedly beat her to death with “brass knuckles and a crowbar,” according to a rough translation of a French AFP report. Bourseau was allegedly killed by a blow to the head, according to the French newspaper Local. The prosecutor said when it came time to hide the evidence, the suspects took a cue from “Breaking Bad,” a TV show in which characters Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) were seen several times throughout the series disposing of victims’ bodies by submerging them in plastic tubs filled with hydrofluoric acid. The suspects allegedly used chlorine acid, according to Radio France Internationale. The suspects bought “the acid and a polyethylene trunk to immerse the body,” the prosecutor told AFP. Then they allegedly removed Bourseau’s legs to fit her entire body into the container, according to the Local. For days after the incident, police said, the suspects returned to the scene, stealing from her apartment and spraying air fresheners to mask the stench. It wasn’t until about 10 days after Bourseau’s death that police found her remains. [Portland’s real-life ‘Breaking Bad': Former chemistry teacher charged with manufacturing methamphetamine] Police responded to a call Aug. 3 from Bourseau’s mother and a friend who said they had not been able to reach her for two weeks, according to the Local. When police arrived at the scene, the door was locked, forcing firefighters to climb in through a skylight. They found her body in “advanced stages of decomposition,” a police representative told AFP, according to the Local. Bourseau was a former student at a top university in Toulouse where she reportedly studied humanities and languages. She had dropped out and fallen in with “the wrong crowd,” according to Radio France Internationale. Indeed, fictional portrayals similar to her death and disposal were captured in “Breaking Bad.” In season one, for instance, Pinkman poured hydrofluoric acid into a bathtub to dispose of his former business partner Emilio Koyama. The acid ate through the tub and the second floor of the home. In seasons four and five, White and Pinkman used the same method to destroy bodies. [Walter White and LBJ?

Last year, 28-year-old Jason Hart pleaded guilty in Washington state to strangling his girlfriend in 2013 and trying to dissolve her body in acid, WHQ-TV reported. He took a plea deal that put him behind bars for a roughly 14-year prison sentence. A woman in the United Kingdom last year said she mimicked the show when she tried to poison her mother. “It was like I saw myself to be some kind of Mexican drug warlord,” she said in court, according to the Guardian. “I would think it through as if I was the main character in ‘Breaking Bad.'” A man from Liverpool was found guilty this year of trying to buy enough ricin to kill 1,400 people from a dealer on the Dark Web, BBC News reported. The case in France is still under investigation. ||||| The victim's body was found decomposing in a flat in Toulouse on Monday night, after having being cut up into pieces, covered in cling film and bunged into a suitcase. Apparently chlorine acid had been used to try and disguise any trace of the corpse Her killers did everything to avoid getting caught... Going so far as to barricade the victim's door from police and blasting the flat with air freshner to hide the rotting smell. It's believed they were inspired by the American prison series \\"Breaking Bad.\\" All this was of course in revenge for the victim failing to pay back a 6,000 euro debt, contracted over the course of drug selling, or lack of in this case. The victim, 23 year old Eva Bourseau, had been studying Humanities and languages at one of the top universities in Toulouse before dropping out, and that's when she fell in with the wrong crowd. Three men and a woman aged between 19 and 22, are in custody over her murder, which is being treated as premeditated manslaughter. This case has once again reignited the problem of drug trafficking in Toulouse, which contrary to popular belief is common. This time last year, two suspected revenge killings were reported linked to the city’s illegal drugs trade. However, Marseille, France’s second largest city, still has a far higher death toll linked to drug traffickers in the city’s northern districts. ||||| Suspects reportedly planned to dissolve the victim's body in acid. Photo: AFP Four people who planned to dissolve a French woman's body in acid were inspired by hit US TV show Breaking Bad, a prosecutor revealed on Friday. The dismembered body of 23-year-old Eva Bourseau was found on Monday in a plastic container inside her Toulouse flat. Her legs had reportedly been cut off in order to fit her body inside the container. The woman's body was in the \\"advanced stages of decomposition\\", a police source told the AFP news agency at the time, adding that it had likely been there for around ten days. A woman and three men, all between the ages of 19 and 23 and all with a criminal record, have since been arrested in connection with the murder, and by Friday a prosecutor revealed some of the grisly details. Two men in the group went to the woman's house to settle a €6,000 drug debt. There, they beat her violently, killing her through a blow to the skull. The prosecutor said they later bought acid in order to dissolve her body. The prosecutor explained that the suspects had been inspired by a US TV show Breaking Bad, where the lead characters use Hydrofluoric acid - a highly corrosive acid - to dissolve the bodies of their victims. The young men had repeatedly visited the apartment in the days following the woman's murder in order to clean the scene, to steal from the home, and to check up on the decomposition of the body. The men had reportedly left air fresheners in the flat to disguise the smell. The investigation continues. ||||| Police remained on the scene on Tuesday afternoon.

Firefighters made the gruesome discovery inside an apartment in the middle of the city of Toulouse, southern France. They had been called to the scene on Monday night by a friend and the mother of the woman who lived in the apartment. They had not seen the 23-year-old for two weeks, reported Le Figaro newspaper. Finding the apartment door locked, firefighters climbed through a skylight to get inside, and were met with a strong stench. They soon found a woman's body inside a plastic container. French media reported that someone had cut off the legs of the victim in order to fit her body inside the trunk. The woman's body was in the \\"advanced stages of decomposition\\", a police source told the AFP news agency, adding that it had likely been there for around ten days. It is yet to be confirmed whether the body belongs to the missing tenant of the home, with a neighbour telling the newspaper that the body didn't appear to match that of the tenant.

The shepherd realizes that he forgot to bring grain for the cattle, yet the cattle will survive just fine in the field, because What's the answer? Possible answers: (a). they eat roughage (b). they hunt meat (c). they eat insects (d). they eat prey","completion":"The answer is: (a). they eat roughage Explanation: A herd of cattle will survive just fine in a field without the shepherd providing grain because cows are herbivores, meaning they only eat plants. One of the primary components of a cow's diet is roughage, which can be found in abundance within a large field. Roughage refers to fibrous, indigestible plant material, such as hay, grass, and silage. Cows have a specialized stomach with four compartments - the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. This unique digestive system allows them to break down and extract nutrients from different types of plant materials like cellulose, which is difficult for many other animals to digest. When cows consume roughage, the fibrous plant material is broken down through fermentation by the microorganisms present in the rumen. Once the roughage has been fermented and the nutrients are absorbed, the remaining fibrous material, known as cud, is regurgitated back into the cow's mouth for further chewing and digestion. In a large field, cows will naturally graze on the available plant resources, providing them with a diverse and balanced diet. This field diet will consist primarily of grass, which can either be short, young, and leafy, or mature with higher amounts of stem material. Cows may also consume other plants that are available in the field, such as clover, which can add valuable nutrients to their diet. So, the cattle can sustain themselves perfectly well just by grazing in the field, as they can get all the necessary nutrients from the available vegetation, thanks to their herbivorous nature and specialized digestive systems. The other options provided are not plausible: (b). they hunt meat - Cows do not hunt for meat, as they are herbivores and only eat plants. (c). they eat insects - Although cows may indirectly ingest some insects while grazing on grass, insects are not a primary or significant food source for them. (d). they eat prey - Cows do not eat prey animals, as they are herbivores and their diet consists solely of plant materials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

On her way to work, the young woman Eva Møller (Helle Virkner) stops by a clothes store to speak to Børge (Holger Juul Hansen), who has broken their engagement in a brief letter. She finds him with another girl and agitatedly tells him off. Eva works as a seamstress and chats with a co-worker (Caja Heimann) about having too little money and her desire to find a rich man to ease her worries. Their supervisor shouts at Eva for being late and talking too much. After work, Eva is left alone as her co-worker is picked up by her boyfriend. As she walks through the streets she comes across a store with a beautiful gown in the window. As she stands there looking at it, she appears to have an idea and rushes to the house where she lives with her older brother (Ove Sprogøe) and his wife (Lis Løwert). She changes her clothes and picks up her bankbook and is out the door again. She goes back to the store intending to buy the dress, but the saleswoman tells her it's already been sold, and Eva realizes that it would have been too expensive for her anyway. When the saleswoman (Inger Lassen) goes into another room, Eva sees the dress in a corner and goes to look at it, and when the saleswoman locks up and leaves the store moments later, she doesn't realize that Eva is still inside. Eva puts the dress on and dances around the room imagining it's her own. Suddenly a man appears.

To further analyze this phrase, we'll dissect its components and provide a detailed explanation. 1. Modesty: The word \\"modestly\\" implies that the surprise element is not extreme but rather within an acceptable or reasonable range. The use of \\"modestly\\" serves to temper the degree of surprise, suggesting that it may not have exceeded expectations by a large margin. Despite not being strongly positive, humility is often seen as a good trait. Essentially, this term reflects a sense of balance, which often conveys a positive connotation. 2. Surprise: Generally, a surprising movie could sway both positively or negatively. However, in this context, with the phrase leaning towards the positive side, the surprising aspect implies that the movie had some elements that exceeded the viewer's expectations. Surprise generally indicates that the viewer experienced something unexpected, which could make the movie more enjoyable, engaging, or thought-provoking. When combining these two words, \\"a modestly surprising movie\\" suggests that the film offered a pleasant experience with a mild degree of unexpected elements. While it may not be an overwhelmingly positive review, it does provide a positive outlook on the movie as it managed to surprise and likely entertain the viewer to some extent.

Sanders tells deported U.S. vet through border fence: ‘We’d like you on this side’ Many politicians and even several presidential candidates have visited U.S.-Mexico border to talk about immigration or border security. But Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders generated buzz this past weekend when he actually walked up to the border fence and told a deported veteran on the Mexican side that he wanted him on the U.S. side. Hector Barajas, an activist who has pushed for deported U.S. service members to be allowed back in the country, called out to Sanders during his border visit and identified himself as a former soldier in the U.S. Army 82nd Airborne Division. “Thank you very much for your service to this country,” Sanders said. “And we would like you on this side.” Barajas, 39, is a convicted felon – he fired a gun during an altercation – who after getting deported established the Deported Veterans Support House in 2013. Barajas has a lifetime ban from re-entry to the U.S. after he was caught in the country visiting his daughter illegally. It isn’t clear if Sanders was aware of Barajas’ immigration status when he exchanged words with him. The Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to requests from Fox News Latino seeking comment. The deported veteran also attended Sanders’ last visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in Nogales, Arizona. In a Spanish-language video interview after the event, Barajas told journalist Jorge Nieto that getting Sanders’ verbal support was “great.” \\"In Nogales, the Secret Service didn’t let us get close,\\" he said, \\"so it was very cool that he got so close here, because we could basically touch him.” Barajas has said that there are an estimated 12,000 military veterans who have been deported by the U.S. government. During Sanders' tour of Friendship Park, which is used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents as a place where families that have been separated by deportation can meet up, the candidate also spoke about the importance of reforming the country’s broken immigration system. “All of this tells us why we need comprehensive immigration reform,” he said after hearing the stories of people who gathered there. Sanders – who trails former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the delegate count, but has vowed to take his campaign fight all the way to the Democratic National Convention in July – also took the opportunity to criticize the immigration proposals of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, who has made building a border wall a linchpin of his campaign. \\"It’s not only an immoral perspective from my point of view,” Sanders said, according to his campaign. “It’s something that should not happen, cannot happen. What we need to do is to recognize the reality of the moment, that we have a broken immigration system.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter & Instagram What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders visiting the U.S.-Mexico border and speaking with a deported U.S. military veteran named Hector Barajas, who is an activist advocating for the return of deported service members to the United States.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you have a runny or stuffed nose, do not automatically assume it is a sinus infection. Typically, home care of over the counter antihistamines, rest, hydration and cold remedies can be utilized to help your body recover. The unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics is causing bacteria to no longer respond to antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. To avoid this, allow yourself time to rest and recuperate before contacting your doctor. If necessary, your doctor can evaluate your condition and prescribe medicines to help you recover and feel better. Seek help if you experience any of the following symptoms: Sinus congestion that lasts for more than 10 days A fever of 102°F (38.9°C) or higher Symptoms that improve and then worse at or around the 6th day of your illness Ask your doctor for recommendations on what over the counter medicines might help to ease your symptoms. Sinus infections are often accompanied by mucus buildup and congestion, medicines that fight these symptoms can help you get relief. These medicines are available in both pill form and as a nasal spray. Popular decongestant pills include phenylephrine (Sudafed PE) and pseudoephedrine (Sudafed). Generic versions of these medicines will work just as well as long as they contain the same ingredients. Don't use nasal sprays, such as Afrin, for more than three days unless directed — this can actually increase congestion. Painkillers (or analgesia) won't usually fight the direct cause of the sinus infection, but they can help with painful aches and sinus pressure. Always follow the directions on the label with these medications — they can be dangerous if taken in very high doses. Don't rely on OTC painkillers for more than about a week and a half without consulting with a doctor. Ibuprofen is an especially good choice because it's also an anti-inflammatory. This means that it can reduce the swelling in the sinus passages, helping to relieve mucus buildup and pressure. Other good OTC painkillers include acetaminophen (paracetamol) and naproxen sodium. Only take recommended dosages of these medications. Overdoing it with these medications can cause serious issues, such as kidney or liver problems. Sinus infections can have a wide variety of causes. For instance, some sinus infections aren't the result of a disease, but instead a reaction to substances in the air that the sufferer is allergic to. Luckily, there are medicines available to fight allergy symptoms and make you feel better: Most OTC medicines used for allergies belong to a type of drugs called antihistamines. Examples include diphenhydramine (Benadryl), Brompheniramine (Dimetapp), and Loratadine (Claritin). If you have a sinus infection and you haven't ever been tested for allergies, it can be a wise idea to schedule an allergy test with your doctor. This can prevent you from wasting time with solutions that don't work for you. Antibiotics are a type of medicine that kills harmful bacteria in the body. If your doctor believes that your sinus infection is caused by bacteria, she or he may prescribe you some antibiotics to fight it. Do not take antibiotics that were not prescribed for you and do not take old antibiotics that were prescribed for a different condition. If you are given antibiotics, it is important to follow your doctor's instructions as you use it. Don't stop taking it if you feel better before you're done with the medicine — always take the full course of antibiotics. This can cause the bacteria to adapt to that antibiotic, which will keep it from working in the future. Keep in mind that the use of antibiotics to treat sinus infections is controversial among doctors, so some doctors may not be willing to prescribe them. In some cases sinusitis may be severe or chronic in nature, and not due to bacterial infection. In these cases, your doctor may prescribe you a type of medicine administered through nasal spray which includes a corticosteroid. These drugs help fight inflammation in your sinus passages, improving the flow of mucus and relieving pressure. Brands include Nasacort and Flonase.","completion":"This article is about treating runny or stuffed noses and not assuming it's a sinus infection, it suggests home care remedies, over the counter medicines, and when to see a doctor for proper treatment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: About 20% of pupils at Eton receive financial support, through a range of bursaries and scholarships. The recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton is developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received \\"significant\\" financial help from the school. In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge. Little said that, in the short term, he wanted to ensure that around 320 pupils per year receive bursaries, and that 70 were educated free of charge, with the intention that the number of pupils receiving financial assistance would continue to increase. These comparatively new developments will run alongside long-established courses that Eton has provided for pupils from state schools, most of them in the summer holidays (July and August). Launched in 1982, the Universities Summer School is an intensive residential course open to boys and girls throughout the UK who attend state schools, are at the end of their first year in the Sixth Form, and are about to begin their final year of schooling. The Brent-Eton Summer School, started in 1994, offers 40-50 young people from the London Borough of Brent, an area of inner-city deprivation, an intensive one-week residential course, free of charge, designed to help bridge the gap between GCSE and A-level. In 2008, Eton helped found the Eton, Slough, Windsor and Hounslow Independent and State School Partnership (ISSP), with six local state schools. The ISSP's aims are \\"to raise pupil achievement, improve pupil self-esteem, raise pupil aspirations and improve professional practice across the schools\\".

I took my mom here for mothers day a couple of years ago and had an absolutely awful experience, which embarrased me beyond belief. The bag boys were rude, the pro shop was unjustly impatient, the snack bar was closed (they said it would be open,) and the drink cart did not come by one time during our entire round. We even called the pro shop from cell phones to complain on about the 12th hole saying there was no water in the drinking water jugs on the course, the cart girl had never come by, and the bathrooms were all locked and the cart key did not open them. The guys in the shop were apologetic, and said they would send someone right out to help us, but we didn't see anyone. On the 14th hole, the ranger came by and he had some towels which kept us cool, and we let him know how disappointed we were that the drink cart wasn't coming by, the snack bar was closed, and there was no water in the drinking water jugs. Basically that we could not get water, and it was 100 degrees outside! He apologized profusely and said he would see us on the next hole with waters and bathroom keys, but we never did see him the rest of the round. When we got back to the clubhouse, the bag boy was sitting on a chair under an umbrella watching us take the bags off the cart and stare him down. I'm sure he realized we were pissed he wasn't doing his job, but he offered no apologies or assistance. I later told someone in the pro shop about all the problems we had and he basically told us that we should expect this in the summertime. I've played golf for 20 years in Arizona, and most of it in the summer because I can actually afford to play then, and never had such an awful experience.

He thinks Mollie might be with someone who cares about him but somehow, their relationship or understanding of each other got mixed up, leading to something wrong or bad happening. To give you an idea about how close Robert was with his daughter Mollie, there's a really beautiful fact about them. When Robert got married earlier this year, Mollie was the best man at his wedding. A best man usually is a close friend or brother, so this shows Mollie and her father had a special friendship.

A attorney Answer:","completion":"Title: The Occupant Genre: Thriller, Drama Act 1: Mitch Martin, a successful lawyer at a prestigious law firm in New York City, is handed a high-profile case involving the notorious real estate tycoon, Alexander King. King is accused of rampant injustices such as evictions of low-income families and illegal demolitions to make way for his luxury skyscrapers. Mitch is torn; on one hand, he is aware that representing King would mean turning a blind eye to the suffering of helpless citizens, but on the other hand, his career advancement depends on his success in defending King. Act 2: As Mitch starts preparing for the case, he discovers that one of his childhood friends, Joey, is among the wronged tenants about to be evicted by King's corporation. Joey's family lives in an old apartment building which Alexander King has acquired unlawfully, and they now face the threat of losing their home. Mitch is even more conflicted, torn between his personal connection to the case and his loyalty to his prestigious law firm. Act 3: Growing increasingly disillusioned with King's tactics and the unjust world of corporate law, Mitch secretly starts working against his own client. He uses his legal expertise and inside knowledge of King's empire to help the evicted tenants build a class-action lawsuit against Alexander King. As Mitch goes deeper undercover, he faces opposition from King's security personnel who are always monitoring the tenants. As the case progresses, Mitch's colleagues and superiors become suspicious of him, jeopardizing his job and safety. Act 4: Mitch successfully builds a strong case against Alexander King with the help of the tenants, using the concept of \\"occupancy\\" to argue their rights against King's illegal takeover. He presents evidence proving Alexander King's illegal actions, including forged documents and bribes to government officials. Mitch manages to get King charged with fraud, racketeering, and several other crimes. Act 5: Alexander King's enemies and criminal partners, infuriated by Mitch's victory, attempt to retaliate against Mitch and the tenants. But they are caught in a trap orchestrated by Mitch, which eventually brings down their criminal network. Mitch chooses to act as a pro-bono attorney for the tenants and gives up his lucrative career at the prestigious law firm. He starts working independently, focusing on social justice and advocating the rights of the underprivileged. In the end, Mitch sacrifices his high-paying job and a significant part of his personal life but gains a sense of fulfillment and purpose as an attorney who serves justice. He restores Joey's family's occupancy and is celebrated as the champion of the common people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: 1). yes. 2). it is not possible to tell. 3). no.","completion":"1). Yes. The given premise states that \\"To measure this value, it is important to assess how reductions in air pollution reduce the risk of dying from the time that reductions take effect onward, and how individuals value these changes.\\" This premise implies a connection between the measurement of the value in question and the assessment of reductions in air pollution in relation to the risk of dying from the time these reductions come into play. The hypothesis \\"It is important to assess how reductions in air pollution reduce the risk of dying from the time that reductions take effect onward in order to measure this value\\" directly aligns with the premise. It highlights the necessity of evaluating the impact of air pollution reductions on mortality risk from the time they become effective in order to determine the value being measured. Moreover, both the premise and the hypothesis emphasize the importance of understanding the temporal aspect of air pollution reductions (i.e., the time that reductions take effect onward) and its relation to the risk of dying. This indicates a causal relationship between air pollution reductions and mortality risk that should be taken into consideration when measuring the discussed value.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The two questions you provided are different. The first question is about effective ways to get organized for school, while the second question is about the relationship between wheel alignment and the suspension system in a vehicle. To address both questions: 1. Best ways to get organized for school: Step 1: Gather necessary materials To get organized for school, identify and obtain the required supplies, such as notebooks, binders, textbooks, pens, pencils, etc. Step 2: Create a study space Designate a quiet, comfortable space dedicated to studying and completing assignments; this will help you focus and maintain productivity while working on school tasks. Step 3: Develop a routine Establish a daily routine to help manage your time effectively; this includes designated times for studying, doing homework, and participating in extracurricular activities. Step 4: Use a planner or digital calendar Use a planner or digital calendar to schedule your classes, activities, assignments, and other events, so you can easily keep track of deadlines and commitments. Step 5: Prioritize tasks Prioritize tasks by their due dates and importance; this will help you manage your workload and reduce stress. Step 6: Break tasks into smaller parts Break larger tasks or projects into smaller, more manageable parts, and allocate specific time slots to each part. This will help you maintain a steady pace and prevent last-minute rushes. Step 7: Keep your workspace clean and organized Regularly clean and organize your workspace, so you can find your supplies easily and work more efficiently. 2. Relation between wheel alignment and suspension system: Wheel alignment and suspension system in a vehicle are interrelated, as they both contribute to the stability and performance of the car. Step 1: Understand the purpose of wheel alignment Wheel alignment refers to adjusting the angles of the wheels so that they meet the manufacturer's specifications, ensuring that the wheels are properly aligned with the vehicle's suspension system. Step 2: Understand the role of the suspension system The suspension system primarily handles the car's weight distribution, providing an even and firm grip between the tires and road. It also absorbs shocks and maintains ride stability during acceleration, braking, and cornering. Step 3: Identify the connection between wheel alignment and suspension system Misaligned wheels can negatively impact the suspension system, causing uneven tire wear, decreased fuel efficiency, and unstable handling. Proper wheel alignment allows the suspension system to work effectively, maximizing tire contact with the road and improving overall vehicle performance.

The people of Liptar have found a way to use water as a source of power and they barely use any fossil fuels at all. and a hint : Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce. Please answer this question : The habitats of which planet's animals are in more danger? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it is clear that the habitats of the animals on the planet Mandron are in more danger compared to Liptar. There are several reasons to support this conclusion. 1. Use of fossil fuels: The people of Mandron rely heavily on the use of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, to fulfill their energy requirements. Burning these fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and lead to an increase in the planet's average temperature. This is a process known as global warming or global climate change. 2. Global warming and its impact: As mentioned, even a small increase in the average temperature due to global warming can have significant negative impacts on the habitats of various species. Organisms living in the wild need to continuously adapt to their environment, and rapid changes in climate can be highly stressful and hazardous for them. Temperature-sensitive species, such as certain fish, can face issues when trying to reproduce if their habitat becomes too warm – even if this temperature increase is temporary. Additionally, rising temperatures can destroy habitats, for example, by causing ice caps and glaciers to melt, flooding low-lying areas and leading to loss of habitat for species that have adapted to live in those particular environments. 3. Sustainable energy use on Liptar: On the other hand, the people of Liptar have developed a way to harness water as a source of power, reducing their dependence on fossil fuels. This approach to energy generation has less impact on the environment and in turn minimizes the human-induced climate change. As a result, the animals on Liptar face fewer threats to their habitats from the consequences of global warming. In conclusion, the animals on the planet Mandron are in greater danger due to their reliance on fossil fuels, which contributes to global warming and potential habitat destruction. In contrast, the people of Liptar have found a more sustainable energy source in the form of water power, which significantly reduces their impact on the environment and the habitats of the local wildlife."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Saturn 3 Movie plot: The film opens at a space station in the vicinity of the planet Saturn. An announcer is paging Captain James (Douglas Lambert) as the ship he is piloting is leaving in just a few minutes. We see James enter a locker room where he starts to put on his spacesuit and we see another figure in a spacesuit lurking in the corner wearing a helmet so we can't see his face. James addresses the figure as Benson (Harvey Keitel). Benson has apparently just failed a mental stability exam and James is replacing him on this mission. Before James is finished putting on his suit, however, Benson straps himself down and opens the airlock venting the locker room. James is killed and his body flushed out into space. Benson closes the door and then takes James's place on the mission.Benson flies the ship through the rings of Saturn and lands it on a moon at the Saturn 3 experimental food station. It is a remote and isolated underground facility crewed by just two scientists: the older Adam (played by a 64 year-old Kirk Douglas) and the beautiful young Alex (played by a 33 year-old Farrah Fawcett). Despite their age difference the two are happy as lovers.Adam and Alex escort Benson inside the facility. Despite their warm greeting, Benson seems cold. He tells them they are behind schedule on developing the new food sources that the over-populated Earth desperately needs. He has brought a new robot - HECTOR - that he will assemble and program to help speed the project. Once Hector is operational he will be so effective that one of the scientists will no longer be needed.When Alex and Benson are alone, he makes it clear that he is interested in having sex with her. She tells him she is exclusively with Adam and Benson responds that on Earth it is considered inhospitable to refuse his request.

Question: A city like Detroit ended up with a lot of abandoned buildings when large amounts of people moved where? - forest - countryside - wilderness - suburbs - on vacation The best answer is Answer:","completion":"The best answer is suburbs. When looking at the history of Detroit, it is important to understand the factors that led to the situation it finds itself in today, with a large number of abandoned buildings and a significantly decreased population. The main reasons behind this phenomenon can be traced back to the decline of the automotive industry, racial tensions, and white flight, which, in combination, resulted in a mass exodus of people from the city and into the suburbs. 1. Decline of the Automotive Industry: Detroit was once known as the \\"Motor City\\" and was the hub of the American automotive industry. However, starting in the latter half of the 20th century, the industry began to face serious competition from foreign manufacturers, leading to a decline in its market share. This, coupled with increased automation and outsourcing, led to a significant decrease in the number of jobs available within the city. As people lost their jobs or sought better opportunities elsewhere, they began to move away from Detroit, leaving behind large numbers of vacant and abandoned buildings. 2. Racial Tensions: Detroit, like many other American cities, has had its fair share of racial tensions throughout history. During the 20th century, the city experienced significant demographic shifts as a result of the Great Migration, with a large number of African Americans moving to the city in search of better economic opportunities. However, as the racial makeup of the city changed, tensions between different racial groups began to grow. This was further exacerbated by the policies of the city and federal government, including redlining practices that reinforced racial segregation. Many white residents began to feel uncomfortable or unsafe in the city and chose to move away, contributing to the phenomenon known as \\"white flight.\\" 3. White Flight and Suburbanization: White flight refers to the large-scale migration of white people from racially mixed urban regions to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban areas. Several factors contributed to this movement, including the desire for improved housing and better schools, but one of the principal concerns for many white residents was the growing racial tensions in the city. As a result, they began to move away from the city in search of safer, more comfortable communities. In response to this demand, suburban areas around Detroit began to develop rapidly, offering better housing and amenities for those who could afford to move there. The combination of these factors led to a vicious cycle in Detroit. As more and more people moved away from the city, the population and tax base began to decline, reducing the city's ability to maintain its infrastructure and provide essential services. This, in turn, contributed to the decline of the city's quality of life, prompting even more people to leave. As a result, Detroit ended up with a large number of abandoned buildings, while its suburban neighbors continued to grow and thrive. In conclusion, while there may be multiple factors that contributed to the severe decline of Detroit, the best answer to the question of where large amounts of people moved is the suburbs. This movement was driven by a combination of the decline of the automotive industry, racial tensions within the city, and the phenomenon of white flight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Parkway Drive is an Australian metalcore band from Byron Bay, New South Wales, formed in 2003. As of 2015, Parkway Drive has released five full-length albums (\\"Killing with a Smile\\", \\"Horizons\\", \\"Deep Blue\\", \\"Atlas\\" and \\"Ire\\"), one EP, two DVDs, a split album and one book, titled \\"Ten Years of Parkway Drive\\". The band's latest four albums have reached the top 10 of the Australian ARIA Charts, with \\"Ire\\" reaching number 1 in October 2015. - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor. - Pantera was an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas. The group was formed in 1981 by the Abbott brothers drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell along with vocalist Terry Glaze. Bassist Rex Brown joined the band the following year, replacing the original unofficial bass guitarist Tommy D. Bradford. Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released four albums during the 1980s. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera replaced Glaze with Phil Anselmo in late 1986 and released \\"Power Metal\\" in 1988. With its fifth album, 1990's \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", Pantera introduced a groove metal sound. Pantera's sixth album, 1992's \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\", exhibited an even heavier sound. \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" (1994) debuted at number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200. - Age of Ruin is an American metalcore band from Fairfax, Virginia. The group formed in 1998 and released a demo album the following year. The band's first full-length album was self-released in 2000. - Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres. Among other genres blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bandssuch as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bandssuch as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive are described as leaning more towards metal. Pantera (who influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth) and Sepultura have been particularly influential to the development of metalcore in the 2000s, which saw many bands in the genre achieve considerable commercial success. - Bleeding Through was an American metalcore band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended influences stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. Although the band was often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati was asked if he considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: \\"I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long.\\" - Alveran Records was a German-based independent record label, founded in 1995 by Sascha Franzen, which releases a diverse variety of bands with different musical styles. Mainly focused on everything between metal and hardcore, there are also rock, emo and punk bands who find their way to the label's roster. Alveran is also the European partner for the US-based labels Eulogy Recordings and Hand of Hope Records. In April 2006, Alveran became the official partner of Abacus Recordings in Europe, providing Alveran the opportunity to release selected titles from the Abacus Recordings catalogue in Europe as partners. - The Tides Of Tragedy is the second full - length album by American metalcore band Age of Ruin . It was released in the United States on June 22 , 2004 via Eulogy Records and in Europe on December 13 , 2004 via Alveran Records . - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal. - Bullet for My Valentine, often abbreviated as BFMV or B4MV, are a Welsh heavy metal band from Bridgend, formed in 1998. The band is composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Michael Thomas (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Nick Crandle and Jason James; both were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which was followed by a change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Killswitch Engage is an American metalcore band from Westfield, Massachusetts, formed in 1999 after the disbanding of Overcast and Aftershock. Killswitch Engage's current lineup consists of vocalist Jesse Leach, guitarists Joel Stroetzel and Adam Dutkiewicz, bassist Mike D'Antonio, and drummer Justin Foley. The band has released seven studio albums and one DVD. Their latest album, \\"Incarnate\\", was released on March 11, 2016.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more oxygen is inhaled happens, how will it affect more carbon dioxide is produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have an effect on the process. If more oxygen is inhaled, this can potentially lead to an increase in the breakdown of glucose in the body, which in turn may result in the production of more carbon dioxide. This is because the increased availability of oxygen might enhance cellular respiration, a process that uses oxygen to break down glucose to produce energy and carbon dioxide as a byproduct. If more carbon dioxide is produced, it will subsequently be exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth. However, the actual impact of this perturbation will depend on various factors, including an individual's metabolic rate and the body's ability to adapt to the change in oxygen levels."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Options: a ) 81 , b ) 65 , c ) 75 , d ) 89 , e ) 90 A:","completion":"We're given that the average weight of a, b, and c is 70 kg. This means the total weight of a, b, and c is 70 * 3 = 210 kg. When d joins the group, the average weight remains 70 kg. So, the total weight of a, b, c, and d is 70 * 4 = 280 kg. To find the weight of d, we subtract the total weight of a, b, and c (210 kg) from the total weight of a, b, c, and d (280 kg): Weight of d = 280 - 210 = 70 kg Now, we're told e replaces a and has 3 kg more weight than d. So, Weight of e = Weight of d + 3 = 70 + 3 = 73 kg Finally, we know that the average weight of b, c, d, and e is 68 kg. The total weight of these four is therefore 68 * 4 = 272 kg. We know that the total weight of a, b, c, and d is 280 kg, so we can find the weight of a by subtracting the total weight of b, c, and d (280 kg) from the total weight of b, c, d, and e (272 kg), and then adding the weight of e (73 kg). Weight of a = (280 - 272) + 73 = 8 + 73 = 81 kg So, the weight of a is 81 kg, which corresponds to option a."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sentence 2 has \\"a\\" before \\"large head.\\" Now I will assess if the difference changes the meaning of the sentences or just a matter of a slight wording difference. Adding \\"a\\" before \\"large head\\" in Sentence 2 does not change the meaning of the sentence. It simply makes the sentence grammatically correct.

Percy Aldridge Grainger (born George Percy Grainger; 8 July 1882 – 20 February 1961) was an Australian-born composer, arranger and pianist who lived in the United States from 1914 on and became a citizen in 1918. In the course of a long and innovative career, he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century. Although much of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune \\"Country Gardens\\". Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters, sometimes in crudely racial or anti-Semitic terms. In 1914, Grainger moved to the United States, where he lived for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the United States Army during the First World War through 1917–18, and took American citizenship in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922, he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines, which he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works, and as a future research archive. As he grew older, he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music.

While the dialogue was fluid, or should I say only Monique's dialogue was fluid, the rest of the writing was either stilted or repetitious. The use of the characters' names over and over again made me feel like I was in grade school. This novel also read very slow.

Write an article based on this summary: – If you're looking to avoid any link between animal products and your food, you might want to take a hard look at the sugar you consume. Cane sugar undergoes a refining process that makes it white, and the process often involves the use of bone char, which typically comes from cows' pelvic bones, Mother Nature Network reports. (Granulated carbon or an ion exchange system can also be used as filters, notes Vegetarian Journal, but the \\"efficient\\" and \\"economical\\" bone char is the most popular filter.) A process of grinding and then heating them creates the carbon that's used to filter the sugar; a commercial filter can contain as much as 70,000 pounds of char. You aren't actually consuming bone char when you eat the sugar—there's contact, but the end result is free of it—but vegans looking to avoid it need not give up the ingredient. There are a number of animal-free options. If you buy a bag that's certified USDA organic, for instance, bone char won't have been used to make it. Or you can opt for 100% pure beet sugar; its refining process doesn't include char, and the USDA reports that for the last two decades, sugar beets have made up about 55% of domestic sugar production to sugarcane's 45%. Sugar that's labeled \\"raw\\" or \\"unrefined\\" is also a good bet, as is sugar made with \\"evaporated cane juice,\\" MNN notes. Product lists like this one from Ordinary Vegan and this one from PETA can offer some help, too. Things get more complicated when you buy foods that already have sugar in them, since makers might mix different kinds of sugar. (You might want to just try cutting down on sugar, period.)","completion":"Title: The Hidden Connection Between Sugar and Animal Products: What Vegans Need to Know Introduction Vegans are continually working to avoid animal products and their byproducts in their daily diets. Yet, there is one surprising ingredient that may pose a challenge to those looking to completely eliminate these products: sugar. Specifically, cane sugar undergoes a refining process that may involve the use of bone char, a substance derived from cows' bones. Bone Char and the Sugar Industry To create bone char, cows' pelvic bones are ground and heated, producing carbon. This carbon then serves as a filter in the sugar refining process. Bone char is favored by sugar manufacturers due to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Commercial filters used during this process can contain up to 70,000 pounds of char. It's important to note that you're not actually consuming bone char when you eat sugar filtered by this process. The two substances come into contact, but the refined sugar is free of bone char in the end. Nonetheless, vegans looking to avoid any link to animal products may search for alternatives. Alternative Sugar Options for Vegans 1. USDA Organic Certified Sugar: If you purchase sugar with a USDA Organic certification, it guarantees that bone char wasn't used during the refinement process. 2. 100% Pure Beet Sugar: Opting for 100% pure beet sugar is another animal-free alternative. According to the USDA, sugar beets have accounted for 55% of domestic sugar production over the past two decades. This is largely because beet sugar doesn't undergo refinement processes involving char. 3. Raw or Unrefined Sugar: Sugar labeled as \\"raw\\" or \\"unrefined\\" has not been subjected to a bone char filtration process. 4. Sugar with Evaporated Cane Juice: Similar to raw and unrefined sugars, sugar produced with evaporated cane juice avoids the use of bone char. 5. Consult Vegan Product Lists: Resources from organizations such as Ordinary Vegan and PETA provide lists of vegan-friendly sugar options, ensuring no animal byproducts are involved. Challenges with Pre-made Foods It's essential to be mindful of sugar content in pre-made, processed, or packaged foods. Often, these products contain a mixture of different sugar types, making it difficult to discern the exact source of the sugar. Reducing overall sugar consumption can be beneficial not only for avoiding the possibility of bone char, but also for an individual's overall health. Conclusion When looking for sugar that doesn't involve animal byproducts, there are plenty of alternatives to choose from. By keeping a watchful eye on what you consume and opting for organic or vegan-friendly sugar options, you can continue to enjoy sweet treats without compromising your commitment to a vegan lifestyle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Now that stereo Bluetooth has become a common feature in a lot of music phones, it's no surprise that stereo Bluetooth headsets have become quite popular as well. Stereo Bluetooth headsets come in many shapes and sizes, from the behind-the-ear style of the Motorola Rokr S9 to the over-the-head style of the Jabra BT8030. The Jabra BT3030 is in the style of a pendant, or as its design suggests, more of a dog tag. It's been available for a while now, but we think it's still worth it. The Jabra BT3030 can be purchased for around 39.99. Of course like any stereo Bluetooth headset, the Jabra BT3030 requires a cell phone with the A2DP or stereo Bluetooth profile. The Jabra BT3030 consists primarily of a small remote control unit housed in a dog-tag style pendant. Measuring 2.1-inches long by 1.6-inch wide by 0.38-inch thick, the pendant is slim and compact with a metal finish and a rubberized border all around it. All of the controls are laid out right on the front face in a straightforward grid. They are the Play/Pause key, the track shuffle keys, the volume controls, plus the multifunction Call key. The keys are all made of rubber, and are raised above the surface for a nice tactile feel. The 3.5mm headset jack is on the right spine, while the charger jack is on the bottom. On the top is an opening for an optional lanyard. Also on the top is a tiny microphone. Getting the headset set up is pretty simple. Just power it on via the multifunction Call button, and turn on the Bluetooth pairing mode on your cell phone. We managed to pair the Jabra BT3030 with the LG Chocolate 3 without a problem. From there, we could play/pause tracks, skip songs, and adjust the volume, all from the Jabra BT3030. The Jabra BT3030 comes with nice pair of ear buds that sit comfortably in the ear, but since it has a 3.5mm headset jack, you can use any headphones of your choosing. Aside from using the Jabra BT3030 for music, you can also use the it to make calls via the last number redial or voice command. When there's an incoming call during music playback, the music will pause and you will hear a ringing tone. You can then hit the Call button to answer the call. After you hang up, the music will resume from the paused point. Other features include call-waiting support, the ability to reject calls, plus the ability to transfer calls from the headset to the phone, and vice versa. Sound quality was quite good, and comparable to most MP3 players on the market. The bass was a little weak, but the overall quality was decent. Call quality was mixed. While we heard our callers just fine, we did have to bring the pendant close to our mouths for callers to hear us. They reported a little bit of static and echo from us as well. This seemed to vary from caller to caller, however, so we urge you to give it a trial run before you settle for it. The Jabra BT3030 also comes with an optional clothing clip accessory, plus an AC adapter. It has a rated battery life of 8 hours talk time, 7 hours music streaming, and 9.58 days standby time. © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

Article:","completion":"Title: SBS Sports Presenter Scott McIntyre Fired Over Controversial Anzac Day Tweets Introduction: SBS sports presenter Scott McIntyre has recently been terminated from his position following a series of inflammatory tweets on Anzac Day. The Australian broadcaster has deemed these tweets \\"disrespectful\\" and has subsequently taken action to distance themselves from the presenter's comments. Body: Anzac Day, celebrated on April 25th each year, honors the memory of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) who served and died during the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I. The day also serves as a time to remember and pay tribute to all Australians and New Zealanders who have fought in wars, conflicts, and peacekeeping operations. It is an incredibly significant day for both nations, consisting of dawn services, marches and memorial events to honor the fallen and their sacrifices. Scott McIntyre garnered attention and criticism when he posted a series of contentious tweets on Anzac Day, which many perceived to be discrediting and undermining the sacrifices made by the Australian armed forces. While the specifics of the tweets have not been disclosed, the public backlash was strong and swift, leading SBS to release an official statement condemning the remarks and announcing McIntyre's termination. SBS Managing Director, Michael Ebeid, expressed the network's stance on the issue, stating that McIntyre's tweets were \\"disrespectful\\" and \\"inappropriate.\\" He emphasized the importance of respecting and honoring the bravery and sacrifice made by servicemen and women, as well as the pain and suffering experienced by their families and loved ones. Ebeid further added, \\"At SBS, while we appreciate and encourage diverse opinions and viewpoints, we also expect our presenters to uphold a certain level of professionalism and respect for the values we as a nation hold dear.\\" Scott McIntyre's termination has sparked debates surrounding free speech and the boundaries of acceptable commentary by public figures, specifically in regards to national events and observances. While some argue that McIntyre's dismissal may be seen as an infringement upon his rights to express his opinions, others assert that as a public figure and representative of SBS, he held a responsibility to exercise caution and tact when commenting on sensitive subjects. Conclusion: The dismissal of SBS sports presenter Scott McIntyre over his controversial tweets on Anzac Day has undoubtedly ignited conversations about the complexities of free speech and the responsibilities public figures carry. As the nation reflects on the sacrifices of the past and the significance of Anzac Day, the incident serves as a reminder of the critical need for respect and understanding, both in personal commentary and public discourse."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: While Horowitz welcomes the work for the union's 300,000 members, she is concerned about how the growing reliance on freelancers will impact the overall economy. Because freelance work can be uncertain, Horowitz maintains these people are less likely to spend what they earn, saving their money for when work dries up. \\"If we don't address the No. 1 issue of episodic income and risk, we are not going to see a recovery about consumption,\\" Horowitz said, suggesting this has long-term implications for economic growth as consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of GDP. Horowitz said as freelancers become an increasingly important part of the workforce, the government may have to step in with programs that would help them maintain a more stable income. She speculates we might see the government set up some kind of a tax-free account where freelancers could stash funds to be accessed when they are not working.

Context: The rate of incarceration in the U.S. is the world’s highest, leading to what many lawmakers and policy analysts say is a nationwide imprisonment epidemic. But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA. A bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote “strikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,” Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said. U.S. President Donald Trump said “the strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.” Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, “Our whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.” If the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide 50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates. But the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill’s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate. In a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization. Jeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act “were anchored in falsehoods.” He added the legislation passed today “is a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration” a move also welcomed by many House Republicans. “Rather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican...

These iconic ‘90s pieces look great out on the town at night, but they’re also doable in the daytime. Pair them with a flowy daytime dress or slouchy sweater to look easygoing but also on-trend and put-together. A narrower width will be more subtle than broader versions. You can even find chokers that mimic bolo ties or ribbons, creating a longer line that doesn’t read as such a bold choker-choice. Velvet ankle booties combine luxe sophistication with a retro rock n roll attitude. And, since they’re a relatively small part of your ensemble, they can be a good way to ease into the velvet trend. Pair them with some skinny jeans or boot-cut trousers to highlight the lush velvet while remaining casual and cool. You’ll find that most velvet booties have platforms or chunky heels, so you might want to look for a different velvet accessory if you’re uncomfortable with heels. Chokers might be the most popular velvet accessory, but they're not the only ones available. In fact, you can find a wide variety of hair accessories and jewelry in velvet, such as headbands, retro scrunchies, cuff bracelets, and baseball caps. Since these components are fairly small, you can incorporate them into almost any casual outfit without feeling like you're making a fashion statement. Don't forget about handbags! Even though you might not wear them on your body in the same way that you wear a dress or a hat, they can constitute important and attention-grabbing elements of your ensemble. Velvet clutches and backpacks are particularly in vogue at the moment, as well as small, cross-body purses and pocketbooks. If you want to incorporate some velvet into your outfit without committing to a whole piece, look for jackets, belts, or bottoms with some velvet accents.

Due to the draw of the group stages, they will return to their respective old stomping grounds, the clubs or stadiums where they had great success, sooner than they may have anticipated. Jose Mourinho, a seasoned manager best known for his tactical acumen and numerous accomplishments, has managed top clubs such as FC Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur. His return to an old stomping ground implies that the group stage draw has put the team he is managing at the moment against one of his former clubs. Henrik Larsson, on the other hand, was a highly skilled Swedish footballer who had notable stints at clubs like Helsingborg, Feyenoord, Celtic, and Barcelona. His remarkable goalscoring ability made him well-respected in European football. The mention of his old stomping grounds suggests that the team he may be involved with, either as a player or in a coaching capacity, will face one or more of the clubs he adorns in his career history during the Champions League group stages. In summary, the text emphasizes the coincidental nature of the Champions League group stage draw and highlights a captivating narrative involving two significant football personalities revisiting their old stomping grounds, where they have achieved great success in previous years. This storyline adds to the excitement and drama that the UEFA Champions League brings to football enthusiasts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 2: Define \\"skills\\" and \\"learned characteristics\\" To provide a thorough answer, let's first define what we mean by \\"skills\\" and \\"learned characteristics\\". Skills are abilities acquired through practice, experience, or training. They enable people to perform specific tasks or activities effectively. Learned characteristics are traits and qualities that individuals develop as they grow and mature due to their experiences and surroundings. These characteristics are not genetic or innate but obtained through learning and personal development. Step 3: Elaborate on stretching oneself to improve skills After defining the terms, we will explain how stretching oneself can lead to better skill acquisition and development. \\"...you must stretch yourself in ways that challenge your existing abilities and push you out of your comfort zone. This often involves setting realistic yet demanding goals and engaging in deliberate practice that focuses on enhancing specific aspects of the skill. Through this process, you gradually increase your proficiency and overcoming obstacles that may have hindered your progress earlier. Here are some ways to stretch yourself in skill development: 1. Identify areas for improvement: This requires reflecting on your current abilities, recognizing weaknesses, and crafting a plan to tackle these shortcomings. 2. Break the skill into smaller components: Dissecting the skill into manageable parts helps you focus on specific aspects, which can make improvement more achievable and measurable. 3. Emphasize deliberate practice: Deliberate practice is intentional and focused on addressing weaknesses. It often involves working on specific tasks or exercises that are designed to strengthen your abilities in those areas. 4. Seek feedback: Constructive criticism from mentors or peers can guide you in modifying your approach and determining whether your efforts are yielding results. 5. Monitor progress: Keeping track of your progress allows you to assess your improvements and make adjustments as needed. It also serves as an incentive to keep pushing forward. 6. Stay persistent and patient: Improving skills often takes time and dedication. Stay determined in your pursuit of growth, despite setbacks and plateaus along the way. By stretching yourself in these ways, you will be better prepared to refine and enhance your skills, expanding your capabilities and becoming more proficient over time.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating? Options: A. one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them B. not enough information C. when one is able to acquire produce in bulk D. after reading \\"experts\\" advice on clean eating Answer:","completion":"A. one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Then, use your hands to rub the scrub into your knees. After rubbing for about 30 seconds, let the scrub sit on your knees for 5 minutes before rinsing it off with water. Using an exfoliating mixture on your skin helps to remove dead skin cells, which can make the skin appear lighter and brighter. Add equal parts baking soda and lemon juice to a small bowl, and stir them until a paste forms. Use your hands to rub the paste into your knees for about 1 minute, and then rinse with water. Both baking soda and lemon juice work well as natural lightening agents for many people, and the grittiness of the baking soda helps to exfoliate your skin. Both of these can help to make dark skin look lighter over time. Every night, apply 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of almond oil to your knees. Make sure your knees are coated with the oil, and then cover them with a strip of fabric or a towel overnight. While almond oil is a natural lightener, it will also add moisture to your skin, which helps to reduce darkness by making the skin more supple. Mix 1⁄2 cup (120 mL) of plain yogurt with 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of freshly extracted aloe gel. Use a spatula to apply the mask to your knees, and let it sit for 15-30 minutes. Then, rinse your knees with water. Aloe has been proven as a natural healing for scars in a number of studies. To extract aloe gel from the leaves of an aloe plant, simply cut the leaf off of the plant and slice down the center of the leaf. Then, use a spoon to scoop the gel out of the leaf. If you don’t have fresh aloe gel available, you can purchase pure aloe from most pharmacies or supermarkets. If you don’t want to make a scrub, you can use a physical exfoliator like a loofah or sponge to scrub away the dead skin cells. Purchase one at your local supermarket, pharmacy, or beauty supply store, and use it to wash your body in the shower, scrubbing each of your knees for at least 30 seconds. Physical exfoliation with a loofah, sponge, or gentle pumice stone is a common treatment for the symptoms of psoriasis and other dry-skin conditions. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article provides various methods to lighten and brighten the skin on your knees.

Plot title: Narc Movie plot: Undercover narcotics officer Nick Tellis (Jason Patric) chases a drug dealer through the streets of Detroit after Tellis' identity has been discovered. During the pursuit, the dealer holds a child hostage. Tellis shoots and kills the dealer before he can hurt the child, however a stray bullet hits the child's pregnant mother, causing her to miscarry. Eighteen months later, the Detroit Police Department asks Tellis to investigate the murder of an undercover narcotics officer called Michael Calvess. Tellis is initially reluctant, as there is little else he can do for a living however, he reads the investigation files and agrees to take the case, on two conditions. The first: he will get a desk job if he secures a conviction. The second: he is partnered with detective Henry Oak (Ray Liotta), whom Tellis is aware of through reading the files on Calvess' death. Tellis' reason for wanting Oak is his opinion that the only useful evidence in the investigation came from him. The department chief informs Tellis of Oak's reputation as a driven and effective policeman, but also warns him about his instability. Despite his reservations, Oak is assigned to the case. The two build a rapport during a violent investigation. Oak is a dedicated but haunted cop who uses brutal force on criminals, who believes the department want the case buried. During the investigation, Oak reveals that his wife died of cancer, and they had no children. He recalls a drug bust decades prior, where he found a ten-year-old girl naked who was being sold for prostitution by her stepfather for rent money, resulting in Oak beating the man bloody. He sees parallels between that case and the current one. Meanwhile, Tellis' wife is worried for her husband's well-being. Tellis visits Calvess' widow Kathryn, and asks about her and her husband's relationship when he was on the street.

Information: - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Trachyglanis is a genus of loach catfishes from Africa . - The loach catfishes are a family, Amphiliidae, of catfishes (order Siluriformes). They are widespread in tropical Africa, but are most common in streams at high elevations; most species are able to cling to rocks in fast-flowing streams. The 13 genera contain 68 species.

Generate a short movie review that has \\"(I).\\" sentiment (OPT: (I). negative; (II). positive;).","completion":"(I). Negative: \\"Disheartened Dreams\\" - A Short Film Review \\"Disheartened Dreams\\" is an indie short film that had the potential to create an emotional connection with its audience but ultimately missed the mark. Despite the filmmakers' attempt to depict the raw struggle of pursuing one's ambitions, they fell short in developing a cohesive plot and engaging characters. The film follows the protagonist, Sarah, as she tirelessly auditions for various acting roles only to face repeated rejection. While the core premise showcases the harsh realities faced by many aspiring actors, the short film's meager runtime fails to cultivate any genuine empathy towards the character. Rather than delving deeper into Sarah's psyche and exploring her character traits, the film offers a superficial representation of a much broader issue, leaving viewers feeling unsatisfied and detached from the narrative. Furthermore, the poor execution of visual storytelling is evident throughout the film in the form of awkward camera angles, abrupt cuts, and an inconsistent color palette. These technical shortcomings hinder the viewers' ability to engage with the story and cast a profound impact on the overall cinematic experience. In terms of performance, the lead actress struggles to deliver a genuine portrayal of despair and hopelessness, further contributing to the film's lackluster sentiment. The lack of chemistry between Sarah and the secondary characters does little to support the emotionally charged theme, making it difficult to become invested in their onscreen relationships. Finally, the film's score often feels misplaced and overbearing, detracting from crucial scenes and at times, overshadowing the dialogues. Rather than complementing the film's theme of heartache and resilience, the score distracts the audience and waters down the intended effect. In conclusion, \\"Disheartened Dreams\\" attempted to create a compelling narrative around the harsh realities of chasing one's aspirations but ultimately faltered due to weak character development, technical flaws, and insufficient runtime. With a more thoughtful approach to storytelling and a stronger commitment to production quality, the filmmakers might have been able to deliver a more resonant and impactful film worthy of the poignant subject matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The main symptoms of giardiasis are abdominal cramps and bloating, flatulence (gas) and watery foul-smelling diarrhea that may alternate with soft, greasy stools. As such, you shouldn't get too far from a bathroom because you'll need one frequently throughout the day for at least 2 weeks and maybe as long as 6 weeks while your body combats the infection. The bloating and cramps may make it difficult to walk, so don't plan on any hikes or being too active until you're back to full health. Consider postponing any holidays if you get giardiasis because you'll likely be too uncomfortable to enjoy the trip. If you're out of your house shopping or doing errands, always carry some wet wipes in case you have to use a toilet that doesn't have any toilet paper. The Giardia parasite survives outside the body within feces (poop) as spores. These hard spores can live almost anywhere for long periods of time until they get ingested via contaminated water, food or from someone's unwashed hands. The spores then hatch in your stomach or small intestine and cause infection. Washing your hands after going to the bathroom will prevent you from getting re-infected and infecting your friends and family. Be especially careful washing your hands after changing diapers or picking up pet feces. Always make a habit of washing your hands with soap and water before eating or preparing food. While sick with the symptoms of giardiasis, resting is important because it'll allow your immune system more energy to fight off the infection. You'll likely be very tired due to the nausea, diarrhea and lack of appetite (which severely limits your eating), so taking some naps during the day shouldn't be difficult to do. Your immune system tends to kick it into \\"high gear\\" when you sleep. Some walking and light housework is fine, but take a break from the gym and other vigorous physical activities until you feel much better and stronger. Since a primary symptom of giardiasis is moderate-to-severe diarrhea, dehydration from fluid loss is always a concern. As such, replenishing your fluids throughout the day is important, so aim for at least 64 ounces of purified water (eight 8-ounce glasses). If you're very nauseous and having trouble keeping liquids down, try taking small sips of water or sucking on ice chips. In addition to water, drinking some fresh fruit / veggie juice is important to replenish your electrolytes (mineral salts), which are lost with diarrhea and vomiting. You can add a pinch of salt and half a teaspoon of honey or one teaspoon of sugar to an eight ounce glass of fruit juice. This will make your fluid replacement even easier to tolerate. Avoid fizzy drinks and anything with alcohol or caffeine until you're feeling healthy. Symptoms of dehydration include: dry mouth, thirst, tiredness, headache, dizziness, reduced urination and increased heartbeat. Children with diarrhea are more susceptible to dehydration than adults are. Hydration is a really important part of managing mild diarrhea. If you can't intake all the hydration you need orally, you may need an IV to help replenish your fluids. If you think that you may need an IV, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. You need energy to fight off the parasitic infection and to be able to go about your day, but the nausea and abdominal cramps from giardiasis can greatly diminish your appetite. As such, ease back into eating with small meals (or snacks) spaced throughout the day. Eat bland, low-fat and easy to digest foods, such as crackers, toast, soup broth, bananas and rice. Don't eat during waves of nausea. Until you're feeling better, avoid fried foods, fatty and overly spicy foods. Avoid dairy products because you may have some degree of lactose intolerance that aggravates intestinal symptoms caused by giardiasis. Don't eat too much fresh fruit or veggies (especially cauliflower, onions and cabbage), because it can lead to even more gas, bloating and abdominal cramping. Snack on foods that can help your body get rid of parasites, such as pumpkin seeds, pomegranates, papaya, beets and carrots. There are a number of herbs that have anti-parasitic properties, which means they can inhibit the spread of parasites in your body or actually kill them outright. Effective examples include barberry, goldenseal, Oregon grape, anise seed, wormwood, curled mint and black walnuts. These anti-parasitic herbs are usually taken as tinctures under the tongue or diluted in some water. Taking them in capsules or using them to make herbal teas can work too. Other herbs sometimes used to kill parasites include grapefruit seed extract, fresh cloves, olive leaf extract and garlic. Some herbs used to treat intestinal parasites can interfere with certain medications, so use them only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner.","completion":"This article discusses the symptoms, prevention, and management of giardiasis, a parasitic infection causing abdominal cramps, bloating, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal issues, emphasizing the importance of proper hydration, rest, and careful diet choices to aid recovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Killed: Mechanic Stephan Hollow (pictured) was named by his neighbours as the victim of the knife attack just yards from his doorstep. A father was stabbed to death after rushing to the aid of his son, as an early morning argument spiralled into a murder. Mechanic Stephan Hollow was named by his neighbours as the victim of the knife attack just yards from his doorstep. It was understood that the 53-year-old had rushed to protect his son Tyler, known as 'Ty', 22 years, who suffered facial injuries in a row at their terraced house. Mr Hollow, known as 'Steph', suffered multiple stab injuries and was rushed to hospital by land ambulance. Police said he died later in hospital. Another man, 27, was arrested on suspicion of murder and was being quizzed by officers. It was believed that Tyler suffered injuries to his face, but he did not require hospital treatment. Today Detective Inspector Dave Storey of Hampshire said: 'This appears to have been an isolated incident between known parties. 'There has been a lot of police activity in the area this morning and we would like to thank residents for their co-operation and assistance while we carry out vital forensic examinations of the scene. 'There is no information to suggest a wider risk to the community from this crime.' One neighbour told how there was a loud party at the house on Sunday evening before the tragedy unfolded in the early hours on this morning. She said: 'There was a bit of a party going on in the back garden and they were all having a few drinks. 'From what I gather, one of Ty’s friends got into a fight with Steph and I saw them all outside with their tops off throwing a few punches. 'I heard Ty saying ‘look Dad let’s stop it’ and they all then went indoors. Then, half an hour later, as my other half was coming in I saw Ty pelt it out of the house and run up the road. 'I woke up at 6am to see all of the police tape around and heard Steph had been killed. It’s just awful. He is a mechanic and everyone knows him around here because of that.' Investigation: Armed police raid at an address in Basingstoke, Hampshire in connection with the fatal stabbing of Stephan Hollow which took place in the early hours of this morning. Police had descended to the bloody death scene at Blackdown Close, Basingstoke, Hampshire. Scenes of crimes officers were seen looking for clues in a car park at the back of the flats, which was cordoned off to the public. There was blood on the floor next to a blue Suzuki jeep, which was towed away by police for analysis. Armed police swooped on a house just five minutes walk from the murder scene at 6.30am, according to neighbours. Officers. swamped Dorset Crescent bearing rifles and side arms and searched the. property, where it was believed a mother and 18-year-old son live. A neighbour, said: 'At 6.30am I opened my curtains to be greeted by loads of armed police. 'There were seven police cars and officers with rifles and hand guns outside the house across from us. They were looking for someone. They were in the house and in the cornfield opposite with dogs and guns. 'I. don’t know if anyone was arrested. I didn’t see if they got anyone. It. was quite an alarming thing to see first thing in the morning. Probe: A 27-year-old man is in police custody following the fatal attack. Police are pictured at a house nearby as their investigations continue today. 'I know a mother and her teenage son live there but I don’t know them because they only moved in about six weeks ago.' Today, a Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm the victim is in his 50s and from Basingstoke. The arrested man is a 27-year-old from Basingstoke. He remains in police custody.' A neighbour who knew Mr Hollow well said: 'He seemed like a nice guy. He would always have a chat with you. I never heard him say a bad word about anybody. I cannot believe that this sort of thing has happened. It seems so pointless.' A young woman from the area said: 'His family are grieving. They are in shock.' Tributes flooded into Facebook as news of the tragic death spread. Marie Perry wrote: 'Lovely guy brilliant smile, our love and thoughts are with you all right now.' Meanwhile, Ryan Houston wrote: 'So sorry to hear the tragic news. Our thoughts are with you all.'

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the exact title of the portrait featuring the children of Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton? In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable...

Chinese people are well-known for being friendly and generous. Many even feel that they lose face if their guests have eaten all the food on the table. Luckily, a number of people have realized the importance of saving food. What should we do in our daily lives to waste less food? 1. Don't order too much in a restaurant.

Please note that my evaluation is unbiased and neutral, aiming to provide a clear understanding of the quality of the review. 1. Content The review provided only consists of a single word, \\"Good.\\" The lack of details and elaboration makes it difficult for potential customers to understand the precise aspects of the product or service that led the reviewer to perceive it as \\"good.\\" Moreover, the review doesn't offer specific feedback that can help businesses improve their offerings. Rating: 1.5/5 2. Clarity Although concise, the term \\"Good\\" is a clear expression of a positive sentiment. It suggests that the reviewer had an overall satisfying experience. However, the brevity does not provide any insight into which particular features or attributes led them to feel that way. Rating: 2.5/5 3. Objectivity The review is highly subjective, not presenting any objective information that would help others make informed decisions. Considering its vagueness, the target audience cannot gauge the strengths and weaknesses of the product or service or compare it to alternatives based on this review. Rating: 1/5 4. Helpfulness Given the short length and lack of details, it's challenging to consider this review helpful. Potential customers will not be able to identify what specifically makes the product or service stand out based on the opinion provided. Furthermore, the review doesn't contribute towards facilitating the decision-making process for others. Rating: 1/5 5. Accuracy As there is not enough information in the review, there is not enough context to assess the accuracy. One might assume the reviewer had a positive experience, but without accurate information regarding the aspects that made the product or service good, potential customers may not form a reliable judgement. Rating: 1.5/5 Overall Rating: After examining the content, clarity, objectivity, helpfulness, and accuracy, the overall rating for this review would be 1.5/5. The lack of details, context, and objectivity affect its usefulness and effectiveness in conveying accurate and beneficial information to potential customers.

On the one hand, his revolutionary process for creating synthetic fertilizers averted the greatest overpopulation crisis the world has ever known, won him the Nobel Prize in 1918, and now feeds over 2 billion people. But Haber was also a staunch German patriot who loved his country with an almost blinding loyalty. Born and raised Jewish, his longing to be accepted as a true German and his intense ambition in his career led him to convert to Lutheranism and abandon his faith. When World War I broke out, the bloody stalemate of trench warfare threatened to slaughter an entire generation of young Germans, and the German military requested Haber to use his genius to create a new kind of weapon that could break the deadlock. As Haber agonized over the decision, his wife, Clara, a chemist herself who had sacrificed her own career to support his, implored him not to go through with it. But Haber, his opportunity to become a true German hero finally at hand, agreed to help the militaryâand became the father of modern chemical warfare.

Craig wanted to get acupuncture but William thought it was foolish. OPT: A). Craig was a big skeptic of alternative medicine.. B). William was a big skeptic of alternative medicine..","completion":"B). William was a big skeptic of alternative medicine. William argued that there was no substantial scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of acupuncture. Craig, on the other hand, claimed that although there might not be sufficient studies, testimonials of people who've experienced positive outcomes couldn't be completely disregarded. Step 1: Establish the basis of both characters' opinions and their willingness to discuss the topic. Craig had done his research online and read multiple positive accounts of people who had found pain relief and other health benefits from acupuncture sessions. He felt that their experiences were enough to convince him to give it a try. Step 2: Introduce the protagonists' conflicting viewpoints. William, being a firm believer in traditional medicine and the scientific method, countered Craig's arguments by stating that anecdotal evidence shouldn't be taken as the definitive proof of a treatment's effectiveness. He urged Craig to consider trying conventional treatments first before venturing into something unproven. Step 3: Escalate the tension and disagreement between the two characters, emphasizing the contrast in their perspectives. Despite William's attempts to dissuade Craig, he remained adamant about trying acupuncture. Craig believed that people's experiences had a lot of weight, and he couldn't just ignore the testimonials. William, frustrated with Craig's stubbornness, questioned why Craig was even considering something that not all doctors and medical institutions recognized as a legitimate treatment. Step 4: Bring the characters to the point of resolution. Seeing that they had reached a deadlock, Craig decided to agree to disagree. He acknowledged that William's perspective had merit and that everyone had different ways of approaching their health and well-being. However, he expressed his determination to try acupuncture at least once, and if it didn't work, he would consider other conventional treatments. Step 5: Wrap up the story, leaving the possibility of future discussions or events. Although still skeptical, William reluctantly accepted Craig's decision. Both friends agreed to continue discussing their differing views on alternative and traditional medicine in the future. Craig felt grateful for William's concern, but the numerous positive accounts of acupuncture had already left an indelible mark on his mind. It was time to see for himself if the ancient practice could truly deliver the benefits others claimed. And so, with a mix of excitement and trepidation, Craig scheduled his first acupuncture appointment, wondering if this alternative treatment would finally provide the relief he had been seeking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Winnie Madikizela are the first names of the ex-wife of which iconic leader?","completion":"Winnie Madikizela refers to the first names of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the ex-wife of the iconic leader, Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela was an anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who went on to become the first black president of South Africa. He was a key figure in the struggle against the apartheid regime in South Africa, promoting racial equality and creating a more inclusive society. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was also an important political figure in her own right, being the former wife of Nelson Mandela and a strong anti-apartheid activist. She was born on September 26, 1936, in Bizana, Pondoland District, Eastern Cape, South Africa, and died on April 2, 2018, in Johannesburg, South Africa. Winnie and Nelson Mandela got married in 1958, and their relationship remained strong during Nelson Mandela’s imprisonment from 1963 to 1990. During this time, Winnie played an essential role in campaigning for her husband's release and raising international awareness about apartheid. Besides her unwavering support for Nelson Mandela, she was actively involved in political activities and protests against the apartheid government. She took on leadership roles within the African National Congress (ANC), which was the political party that stood against apartheid and spearheaded the struggle for a democratic South Africa. Winnie continued to support the people while her husband was incarcerated, giving voice to the Black South Africans and fighting for their rights. However, Winnie's political career was not without controversy. She was convicted on multiple occasions, including charges relating to kidnapping and being an accessory to assault. These convictions, along with allegations of human rights abuses, tarnished her reputation in the later years of her life. Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990, and South Africa transitioned to a democratic government in 1994 with Nelson as the country's first black president. However, the couple's relationship had deteriorated by that time, and they formally separated in 1992, with their divorce being finalized in 1996. In conclusion, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was the ex-wife of the iconic leader Nelson Mandela, and she played a significant role in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. She was a fierce activist, political figure, and leader who tirelessly campaigned for political and social change throughout her life. Despite the controversies surrounding her later years, she remained an influential and inspirational figure in the fight against racial inequality and injustice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: Who kills a hunter? from the following article ? Adam, a medical student, is lured to a cabin far from civilization where he volunteers to be repeatedly killed and reanimated by Dr. Franklin Vick, through use of a mysterious serum. While \\"Subject Two\\" as he is initially successful, he begins to experience violent seizures and excruciating pain, begging Vick to kill him or committing suicide several times. Adam eventually gains complete immortality and near instantaneous regeneration, but as a consequence he loses the very sense of being alive; he can no longer feel things (including pain) and no longer can have emotions. His eyes turn snow white, and, to compensate for the gradual loss of his sense of self, he becomes violent and depressed, going so far as to kill a hunter that accidentally shoots him rather than risk him exposing the project. Eventually the student leaves Vick, only to become a walking ghost doomed to walk the earth for eternity. After returning home, \\"Vick\\" finds the real Dr. Franklin Vick, and it is revealed that the doctor for the course of the entire movie was his assistant, Subject One. Thinking that he had accidentally killed Dr. Vick, Subject One assumed his identity to continue the work, but finds that the serum was initially perfect, and it was only his tampering that gradually changed Adam.

Despite being well-known and respected in the community, there is a cloud of mystique surrounding Pengallan, as very few people truly know about his past or much about his personal life. The protagonist of our story is the charming and determined detective, Richard Traherne (played by Tom Hardy), who hails from London and arrives in Tresswich on the request of a young woman named Emily (played by Emma Watson). Emily, who has recently inherited the local inn from her recently deceased father, has become increasingly concerned about the suspicious activities she has observed around the town. She believes that there may be a secret society of smugglers with sinister intentions operating within the community and fears for her life after a series of veiled threats. Thrilled by the prospect of solving such an enigmatic case, Traherne immediately commences his investigations, blending in with the locals and seeking information. As he unravels the town's numerous secrets, Traherne encounters several intriguing characters with mysterious intentions, all somehow connected to Lord Pengallan. This includes a self-proclaimed priest, who is questioned by the townspeople due to a lack of verifiable references (played by Daniel Radcliffe), and a cunning merchant by the name of Marcus (played by Idris Elba) who seems to have an uncanny knowledge of the town's secret activities. As Traherne grows closer to uncovering the truth behind the rumors of smuggling and conspiracy, he faces numerous obstacles and near-death experiences. It is in the climax of the movie that Traherne uncovers that Lord Pengallan himself is the mastermind behind the secret smuggling operations. Lord Pengallan, who has been watching Traherne's investigation closely throughout the story, eventually decides to reveal himself and his intentions to Traherne in a final confrontation. In a dramatic and intense scene, Pengallan tells Traherne that these illegal activities were designed to actually benefit the town by providing valuable resources and support, unbeknownst to the townspeople. He explains that his family has followed this tradition for generations, using their wealth to help those in need. However, with the death of Emily's father – who was once Pengallan's loyal ally in these operations – smuggling activities were exposed, though Pengallan's involvement remained a secret. Traherne, faced with this surprising revelation, must decide whether to enforce the law and arrest Pengallan or to empathize with his motives and help him to operate in a more discreet and legal way. Ultimately, Traherne agrees to aid Pengallan in devising a new plan to support the town without resorting to illegal activities. With Traherne's guidance, Pengallan transforms his smuggling ring into a legitimate enterprise, establishing a trade company that provides employment and much-needed resources for the town. The movie ends with Pengallan expressing his gratitude to Traherne, but the bond formed during their collaboration is cut short as Traherne must return to London. However, he leaves with a renewed sense of purpose and accomplishment, knowing he has brought change and justice to the town of Tresswich. Lord Pengallan's actions have not gone unnoticed, and the town remains eternally grateful to their enigmatic benefactor, whose motives were finally revealed to only one man – Richard Traherne."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: two countries of similar natural resources had different populations. Italy had a small population, while Spain had a very large population. and a hint : In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. Please answer this question : Which country had an increased food supply?","completion":"Based on the given situation and hint, it can be inferred that Italy, with its smaller population, likely experienced an increased food supply. This conclusion can be reached by examining the relationship between population size, resource availability, and birth rates in the context of the two countries. In Italy, the smaller population size would mean that there would be more food and resources available per individual. When organisms have plentiful access to necessary resources such as food, they can reproduce more easily, leading to a high birth rate. This, in turn, suggests that the population growth rate would also be high in the early stages due to the abundance of resources. On the other hand, Spain's larger population would mean that the available resources, including food, would have to be divided amongst a greater number of individuals. This increased demand for resources might make it difficult for individuals to reproduce at a high rate, leading to lower birth rates and a consequently slower population growth rate. Moreover, the decrease in available resources could lead to more competition and potential struggles for survival. Given that the availability of resources such as food would be greater per individual in Italy compared to Spain, it is likely that Italy experienced an increased food supply, due to its smaller population size. It's important to note, however, that this is a general analysis based on the provided information, and various factors such as political decisions, economic policies, and geographic conditions could also significantly impact the food supply and resource availability in each country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: Pull away, Build up courage, Grab it Answer:","completion":"Based on the given context, it seems that Taylor is interested in Alex and attempts to initiate a connection by reaching for Alex's hand at the high school dance. Considering the situation, the most probable thing Taylor would want to do next is to build up courage. When Taylor reaches for Alex's hand, it implies that there is an underlying interest to not only connect during the dance but to also establish a stronger bond with Alex. This could be due to an existing friendship, a hidden crush, or simply mutual attraction during the dance. Once Taylor has established their intention by reaching for Alex's hand, they are likely to feel nervous and excited about how Alex might respond. In such a scenario, Taylor's immediate priority would be to build up courage. Building courage in this situation can manifest in several different ways. For instance, Taylor could: 1. Mentally prepare themselves for both positive and negative outcomes, knowing that expressing interest in someone requires vulnerability and that rejection is a natural part of engaging in interpersonal relationships. 2. Visualize a positive outcome with Alex, such as dancing together closely or holding hands, to boost their confidence and create a sense of excitement and motivation. 3. Reassure themselves that they are worthy of Alex's attention and that they have a lot to offer in a potential romantic or friendly relationship. As Taylor builds up the courage, they might also engage in subtle actions to convey their intention, such as maintaining eye contact, smiling at Alex, or finding ways to create a more intimate atmosphere on the dance floor. These actions will allow Taylor to gauge Alex's reactions and, hopefully, encourage a positive response from Alex. If Alex reciprocates the interest and agrees to Taylor's gesture to hold hands or dance together, Taylor's next step would likely be to focus on enjoying the moment and fostering a deeper bond with Alex through conversation, body language, and shared experiences. On the other hand, if Alex does not respond positively to Taylor's advances, Taylor may feel hurt or discouraged but will ultimately need to gather their courage and move forward, appreciating the experience as a learning opportunity and embracing their emotional vulnerability. In conclusion, given the context that Taylor reaches for Alex's hand at the high school dance, Taylor's next step is to build up courage and prepare themselves for the potential outcomes of their action, whether that is forging a stronger connection with Alex or facing the possibility of unrequited interest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What had a return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period? Answer the above question based on the context below: The boar was an important symbol in prehistoric Europe, where, according to the archaeologist Jennifer Foster, it was \\"venerated, eulogised, hunted and eaten ... for millennia, until its virtual extinction in recent historical time.\\" Anglo-Saxon boar symbols follow a thousand years of similar iconography, coming after La Tène examples in the fourth century BC, Gaulish specimens three centuries later, and Roman boars in the fourth century AD. They likely represent a fused tradition of European and Mediterranean cultures. The boar is said to have been sacred to a mother goddess figure among linguistically Celtic communities in Iron Age Europe, while the Roman historian Tacitus, writing around the first century AD, suggested that the Baltic Aesti wore boar symbols in battle to invoke her protection. Boar-crested helmets are depicted on the turn-of-the-millennium Gundestrup cauldron, discovered in Denmark, and on a Torslunda plate from Sweden, made some five hundred years later. Though the Romans also included the boar in their stable of symbols—four legions, including the twentieth, adopted it as their emblem—it was only one among many. The boar nonetheless persisted in continental Germanic tradition during the nearly 400 years of Roman rule in Britain, such as in association with the Scandinavian gods Freyja and Freyr. Its return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period, as represented by the boars from Benty Grange, Wollaston, Guilden Morden, and Horncastle, may therefore suggest the post-Roman reintroduction of a Germanic tradition from Europe, rather than the continuation of a tradition in Britain through 400 years of Roman rule. Whatever its precise symbolism, the Anglo-Saxon boar appears to have been associated with protection; the Beowulf poet makes this clear, writing that boar symbols on helmets kept watch over the warriors wearing them. Answer:","completion":"The return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period was the boar symbol.

(EW) -- In \\"Elysium,\\" Neill Blomkamp's shrewdly revved-up and exciting dystopian thriller, Matt Damon's character, Max, spends most of the movie with a spidery black-metal exoskeleton implanted in his skull and spine. The surgically attached machinery serves several functions at once. It's there to make Max strong — a boost he critically needs, since he's been exposed to a dose of radiation that will leave him dead in just five days. It also allows him to download the contents of someone else's brain. But the most important purpose served by that added hardware may be visual and symbolic: It transforms Max into a hulkingly damaged yet superheroic man-machine — a variation on the title character of \\"RoboCop.\\" And it has the unmistakable look of a cross that he's been nailed to.","completion":"As the story of \\"Elysium\\" unfolds, we follow Max, a former car thief and convict, as he navigates a divided and dystopian world. Earth is devastated, overpopulated, and polluted, while the privileged live on the luxurious space habitat Elysium, where they have access to advanced technology like medical pods capable of curing any disease. Max's unique exoskeleton enables him to fight for the downtrodden people of Earth and attempt to bridge the gap between the two worlds. Max becomes the reluctant hero, teaming up with a group of rebels led by the passionate and determined Spider. Together, they devise a plan to steal valuable information from the mind of John Carlyle, a wealthy and influential Elysium citizen who possesses the codes to reset Elysium's system. If successful, they can distribute the advanced healing technology to Earth and create a more just distribution of resources. As Max embarks on this dangerous mission, he must contend with Secretary Delacourt, who will stop at nothing to protect her privileged lifestyle in Elysium. She enlists a cold-blooded mercenary named Kruger to hunt down Max and his allies. A deadly game of cat and mouse ensues as Max fights his way through obstacles, both physical and emotional, to secure the information necessary to save Earth's suffering inhabitants. The climax of the story comes when Max, Spider, and their team infiltrate Elysium. In a thrilling series of battles, Max manages to defeat Kruger and confront Delacourt, who is killed in the ensuing chaos. Mortally wounded, Max sacrifices himself to initiate the system reboot and fulfill the mission. His action leads to widespread changes on Elysium, and the advanced medical pods are finally made available to the people of Earth, saving countless lives and bridging the wealth gap between the two worlds, at least to some extent. With the conclusion of the story, the fallen hero Max is immortalized by the people he saved, his sacrifice symbolizing the power of the individual to spark meaningful change. As the restored Elysium and Earth begin to rebuild, Max's legacy will forever be remembered as a symbol of hope and the belief that a better future is possible.

Although not high royalty, on the occasion of their marriage, they styled themselves Prince and Princesse respectively. Pauline was a highly intelligent and religious woman, who was well read and wrote a number of texts in her lifetime. Her shyness was well known; she was widely considered strikingly beautiful and charming, but those around her would often avoid eye contact so as not to embarrass her. Albert was devoted to his wife, and commissioned the painting after being impressed by Ingres' 1845 portrait of his sister, the Comtesse d'Haussonville. Albert approached Ingres around 1850 to undertake the portrait. Ingres dined with the de Broglie family in January 1850, and according to one eye witness, \\"seemed to be very happy with his model.\\"Although Ingres' main source of income came from portraiture, it distracted from his main interest in history painting, which early in his career, was far less lucrative. He found acclaim in the 1840s, when he became successful enough to no longer depend on commissions. This painting was Ingres' second-last female portrait, and final society portrait.Influenced by the working methods of Jacques-Louis David, Ingres began with a number of nude preparatory sketches, for which he employed professional models. He built up a picture of the sitter's underlying anatomical structure, as seen in the Musée Bonnat study, before deciding on how to build the lavish costume and accessories. Although there is no surviving record of the commissions, and the exact sequence of events is uncertain, the sketches can be dated from 1850, the year the style of her evening dress came into fashion. Ingres signed and dated the final picture at the left center \\"J. INGRES. pit 1853\\".Pauline died in 1860 aged 35 from tuberculosis. After her death, Albert published three volumes of her essays on religious history. Albert (who in 1873 became the 28th...

Article: Beijing's broadened ban on smoking in public places took effect Thursday, adding force to the effort to hold a smoke-free Olympics. The new rules extend existing anti-smoking regulations to more places, including fitness centers, cultural relic sites, offices, meeting rooms, dining halls, toilets and lifts. Restaurants, Internet cafes, parks, and waiting halls at airports, railway stations and coach stations are required to set up smoking areas. Hotels will have to offer smoke-free rooms or floors, but the regulations do not specify a proportion. However, some restaurant owners have complained that it would be difficult to have a separate smoking room as required by the new regulations. \\"We plan to issue specific rules to solve this problem as soon as possible,\\" Rao Yingsheng, vice-director of the Beijing Committee for Patriotic Public Health Campaign, was quoted by the Beijing News as saying Thursday. He said small restaurants without a separate room should set aside at least 70 percent of their area for non-smokers. He also said customers and restaurant owners would be asked for their thoughts on the new rule. Local authorities dispatched about 100,000 inspectors to make sure the ban was being enforced Thursday. Everyone has the right to dissuade people from smoking in public places, Liu Zejun, who works for the Beijing committee, said. \\"Citizens are encouraged to expose those who refuse to obey the rule by calling the free telephone line 12320,\\" Liu said. People caught smoking in forbidden areas will be fined 10 yuan (1.40), while enterprises and institutions that violate the ban will face fines of between 1,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan. Smoking was forbidden in hospitals, kindergartens, schools, museums, sports venues and other places before the new regulations took effect. From Oct 1 last year, the city also banned smoking in its 66,000 cabs, and imposed fines of 100 yuan to 200 yuan on drivers caught smoking in taxis. China has pledged a cigarette-free, green Olympics. This year's event will be the first... Question: The passage mainly tells us _ . - There will be more places where smoking is forbidden. - More people should give up smoking. - Broadened ban on smoking in public places took effect in order to set up a non-smoking Olympic Games. - Those who smoke at public places will be fined.

You may think people in such an attractive and exciting, fun-filled place are happier than others. If so, you have some mistaken ideas about the nature of happiness. Many intelligent people still consider happiness equal to fun. The truth is that fun and happiness have little or nothing in common. Fun is what we experience during an act. Happiness is what we experience after an act. It is a deeper, more lasting emotion. Going to an amusement park or ball game, watching a movie or television, are fun activities that help us relax, temporarily forget our problems and maybe even laugh. But they do not bring happiness, because their positive effects end when the fun ends. I have often thought that if Hollywood stars have a role to play, it is to teach us that happiness has nothing to do with fun. These rich, beautiful people have constant access to glamorous parties, fancy cars, expensive homes, everything that brings \\"happiness\\". But in memoir after memoir, famous people expose the unhappiness hidden beneath all their fun -- depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, broken marriages, troubled children and extreme loneliness. Ask an unmarried man why he refuses to get married even though he finds dating to be less and less satisfying. If he's honest, he will tell you that he is afraid of making a commitment. For commitment is in fact quite painful. The single life is filled with fun, adventure and excitement. Marriage has such moments, but they are not its most distinguishing features. Similarly, couples that choose not to have children are deciding in favor of painless fun over painful happiness. They can dine out whenever they want and sleep as late as they want. Couples with babies are lucky to get a whole night's sleep or a three-day vacation. I don't know any parent who would choose the word fun to describe raising children. The way people stick to the belief that a fun-filled, pain-free life equals happiness actually reduces their chances of ever achieving real...

Article: Andy Steele lives just a few blocks from the campus of Black Hills State University in Spearfish, S.D., so commuting to class isn't the problem. But he doesn't like lectures much, isn't a morning person, and wants time during the day to restore motorcycles. So Steele, a full-time senior business major, has been taking as many classes as he can from the South Dakota State system's online offerings. He gets better grades and learns more, he says, and insists he isn't missing out on the college experience. \\"I still know a lot of people from my first two years living on campus, and I still meet a lot of people,\\" he says. But now, he sets his own schedule. At least 2.3 million people took some kind of online courses, according to a recent survey by The Sloan Consortium, an online education group, and two-thirds of colleges offering \\"face-to-face\\" courses also offer online ones. But what were once two different types of classes are looking more and more alike and often falling into the same pool of students. At some schools, online courses originally intended for non-traditional students living far from campus have proved surprisingly popular with on-campus students. A recent study found 42 percent of the students enrolled in its distance education courses were located on campus at the university that was hosting the online courses. Numbers vary depending on the policies of particular colleges, but other schools also have students mixing and matching online and \\"face-to-face\\" credits. Motives range from lifestyle to adapting a job schedule to getting into high--demand courses. Washington State had about 325 on-campus undergraduates taking one or more distance courses last year.

To do this, they came up with an idea of giving the captured people tattoos.

This metal stamp was like a big rubber stamp that we use for stamping things on paper. It was pressed on the person's skin, and it made a tattoo in just one stroke.

Now, twitter, e-mail, blogs and QQ chat offer approaches to communication-- but none can replace the role of a great speech. The spoken word can handle various important functions: persuading or inspiring, informing, paying tribute , entertaining, or simply introducing someone. Persuading is used in dealing with or _ different points of view. When the leaders met in Copenhagen in December, 2009, persuasive words from activities encouraged them to take former action. Inspirational speeches deal with emotions. They focus on topics and matters that are close to people' s hearts. Last year, during the fighting in Iraq, generals used inspiring speeches to prepare the troops for battle. Some speeches spread knowledge and deepen understanding. When the H1N1 flu was announced, the disease scared many people. Informtive speechs from World Health Organization (WTO) officials helped people to keep their panic under control so they could take necessary preventive measures. Sad events are never easy to deal with but a speech that pays tribute to the loss of a loved one and gives praise for their contribution can be comforting. Madonna's speech about Michael Jackson after his death showed the fact that he will continue to live on through his music. It's not only in world forums where public speaking plays an important role. It can also be helpful in the course of our own life. You may be asked to do a presentation at college or work to inform others about an area of great importance. On a more personal level, a friend may be upset and need comforting. Or you might be asked to introduce a speaker at a family gathering or to speak at a wedding, where your language will be needed to move people or make them laugh.

Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Available choices: (a). no. (b). yes.","completion":"(a). No. These two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they address different topics and specific scenarios. The first question pertains to a startup corporation's decision to issue all authorized but undistributed shares as \\"treasury stock.\\" Treasury stock represents the portion of shares that a company keeps in its treasury. These shares have been issued but are not outstanding, meaning they are not currently held by shareholders. Treasury stock typically occurs when a company buys back its shares from the open market or has not yet issued all authorized shares to the public. The question seeks to understand the potential drawbacks of issuing all authorized but undistributed shares as treasury stock in the context of a startup corporation. There are several reasons not to issue all authorized but undistributed shares as treasury stock: 1. Dilution: Issuing all authorized shares can lead to dilution of existing shareholders' ownership, as the total number of shares increases. This scenario might not be ideal for the startup's founders and initial investors who want to maintain a controlling stake in the company. 2. Market perception: Issuing all authorized shares as treasury stock may negatively impact the company's image in the market. Investors may view the startup as lacking in confidence about its future prospects or ability to attract more investors. 3. Retaining flexibility: Keeping a portion of authorized shares undistributed allows a startup to have flexibility in raising additional capital or issuing shares as part of employee compensation packages. If all authorized shares are issued as treasury stock, the company may need to go through the process of amending its articles of incorporation to authorize additional shares, which can be time-consuming and costly. 4. Legal and financial complexities: Managing treasury stock involves legal and financial complexities. The company has to comply with regulations and maintain extensive records related to treasury stock transactions. For startups with limited resources, focusing on growth and product development might be a higher priority. The second question discusses a unique scenario involving the Bose Corporation and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Amar Bose, the founder of the Bose Corporation, famously donated most of the company's non-voting shares to MIT. This donation did not grant MIT any decision-making power in the company but allowed the institute to enjoy the financial benefits associated with the company's success. The question seeks to understand why Amar Bose chose to give the majority of his company's stock to MIT. The main reason behind Amar Bose's decision to donate the majority of Bose Corporation's stock to MIT was his strong connection with the institute. Amar Bose was an alumnus and a former faculty member at MIT, and he credited much of his success and the development of his innovative ideas to the education and mentorship he received at MIT. By donating Bose Corporation stock to MIT, Amar Bose aimed to ensure that the institute would continue to thrive, support groundbreaking research, and foster an innovative learning environment for future generations. The two questions are thematically distinct, with the first addressing a general scenario for a startup corporation's stock management and the second exploring a specific decision made by Amar Bose that benefited MIT."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I can use this background: So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane. But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher. Now, I have a new situation: Two coastal cities, Dune and Shore, got a Hurricane warning. The hurricane hit Dune city, but missed Shore city by 50 miles. The damage was horrendous. Answer this question please: Which city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure? A:","completion":"Shore city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure. Step 1: Understand the background information - The low pressure eye of the hurricane causes storm surge. - High winds are associated with hurricanes and create damage. - Storm surge can cause flooding at the shore. Step 2: Analyze the given situation - Dune city was hit by the hurricane. - Shore city was missed by the hurricane by 50 miles. Step 3: Determine atmospheric pressure for each city - Dune city experienced the low pressure eye of the hurricane, which led to storm surge and damage. - Shore city, being 50 miles away from the hurricane's path, was not directly affected by the hurricane's eye, and therefore it was not under the influence of the low pressure eye of the hurricane. Step 4: Conclude which city experienced higher atmospheric pressure - Since Dune city experienced the low pressure eye of the hurricane and Shore city did not, it can be concluded that Shore city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure compared to Dune city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar. Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure. Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea, the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is said to be saturated. Saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized. Stearic acid is an example of a saturated fatty acid (Figure 3.14). Q: Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their what?

The formation of triacylglycerols involves the release of three water molecules during ester bond formation. The chemical structure of fats, represented by triacylglycerols or triglycerides, gives them their characteristic properties and functions in living organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose animals die in soft soil less often happens, how will it affect LESS fossils forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The process of fossil formation consists of several stages, namely: the death of animals and plants in soft soil or mud, sedimentation and accumulation of materials over the remains, decomposition of organic matter, replacement of the remaining parts with minerals, and finally, the formation of a fossil. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that in a situation where animals and plants die in soft soil less often, there will be a consequential effect on the formation of fossils. This hypothesis has both direct and indirect effects on the fossil formation process. Direct effects of the perturbation hypothesis: The most significant direct effect of the perturbation hypothesis on the fossil formation process is the reduction in the number of potential fossils. When animals and plants die in soft soil less often, there are simply fewer remains available to become fossils. As a result, the overall probability of fossil formation decreases because the first and fundamental step in the process is diminished. Since sedimentation and accumulation of materials over the remains are directly associated with the initial deposition of the remains, a decrease in the number of organisms dying in soft soil will lead to less sediment covering their remains. This can result in a lowered chance of preservation and eventual fossilization. In turn, fewer fossils will be found compared to a scenario where more animals and plants die within soft sediments. Indirect effects of the perturbation hypothesis: The perturbation hypothesis can also lead to indirect effects on the fossil formation process. For instance, a reduced rate of animals and plants dying in soft soil may influence the ecological balance and competition between organisms. Over time, this can lead to shifts in species populations and characteristics, which might consequently be reflected in the available fossil record. Additionally, a reduction in the number of organisms dying in soft sediment may indirectly affect the rate of sedimentation and accumulation of materials. In some cases, this can impede the natural burial and preservation processes necessary for fossil formation. As an alternative, remains might become exposed to predators, scavengers, or physical and chemical erosion, which could further impact the existing fossil record. Furthermore, the perturbation hypothesis could have knock-on effects on the overall process of decomposition and replacement of the remaining parts with minerals. This could be primarily due to the changes in sedimentation rates or the availability of minerals required for the replacement process. Consequently, these alterations can have a substantial bearing on the quality and completeness of the fossils that are ultimately formed. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis that supposes animals and plants die in soft soil less often has both direct and indirect impacts on the fossil formation process. Directly, it decreases the number of potential fossils, while indirectly, it can lead to a range of consequences, such as shifts in species populations, habitat characteristics, and the overall fossilization process. Therefore, a reduction in the number of organisms dying in soft soil can indeed lead to fewer fossils being formed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Recently the news broke that Microsoft are acquiring GitHub. Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt. Still though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them? A little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft. After poking around his opinion, what shook out was that his real issue was not with Microsoft’s open source work (he was supportive of this), but it was with the fact that they still produce...

CONTEXT: 12 de julio de 2010 La ex rehén y política colombiana, Íngrid Betancourt, dió marcha atrás en su reclamo multimillonario contra Colombia por los daños que sufrió cuando estuvo en poder de los rebeldes izquierdistas de las FARC. Betancourt exigió al gobierno de su país el pago de 6.800 millones de dólares por los cinco años que fue rehén de las fuerzas rebeldes. Ahora, la ex rehén restó importancia a su reclamo financiero durante una entrevista en televisión, pero insistió en que el Estado no la protegió cuando se postulaba para la presidencia. El vicepresidente colombiano, Francisco Santos, dijo que la afirmación de Betancourt se hace acreedora al premio mundial de la ingratitud. El gobierno retiró los guardaespaldas a Betancourt en 2002 durante su campaña presidencial después de advertirle que no viajara al departamento de Caquetá, en el sur de Colombia, donde fue tomada en rehén por los rebeldes. En 2008, Betancourt junto con otros 14 rehenes, fue liberada de las FARC en un rescate en el que fuerzas militares colombianas se hicieron pasar por representantes de la Cruz Roja.

News article: KTVU and wires A hail of gunfire along an Oakland street and caught on tape has left seven people wounded, including a 1-year-old boy who authorities say was taken to the city's Children's Hospital in critical condition. The gunfire broke out Monday evening in a liquor store parking lot after a crowd had gathered, police said. The victims were transported to local hospitals by others at the scene before officers arrived to find dozens of bullet casings. The 1-year-old's father, who also was shot, drove his son to the hospital, where surgeons were trying to relieve swelling on his brain, relatives told KTVU-TV Monday night. \\"We are aware of a 1-year-old boy who was shot -- possibly in the head -- in critical condition right now,\\" Oakland Police Lt. Robert Chan told the station. The hospital declined to release any details about the victim. The shootings just after 6 p.m. happened near Interstate 880 in the city's West Oakland neighborhood, Oakland police spokeswoman Ofc. Johnna Watson said. The other victims' conditions were unclear, though police said their injuries did not appear life-threatening. *(Though police originally reported that eight were wounded during the shooting, they corrected that count to seven Tuesday afternoon.) Video from three different surveillance cameras obtained by KTVU revealed the chaotic scene. As the gunfire erupted, a group of people drove under tracks and ran for cover. Investigators were seeking multiple shooters, but further details on suspects or a motive were still not available Tuesday. Television footage showed a van belonging to an Oakland rapper that was riddled with bullet holes and had apparently taken some of the victims to the hospital. The rapper, who goes by the name Kafani, posted to Twitter on Monday that he had not been shot but to pray for his little cousin. He said news reports that he had been shooting a music video when the shooting took place were incorrect. ||||| Click photo to enlarge « 1 2 3 4 5 » OAKLAND -- When a 3-year-old boy was fatally wounded in a gang-related shooting three months ago in East Oakland, no one thought there could be a more devastating act of violence. Monday night, in a liquor store parking lot in West Oakland, that notion proved tragically incorrect. One-year-old Hiram Lawrence was in grave condition after he was shot in the head after the filming of a rap video. He was one of seven people wounded by gunfire. His father, who was holding the boy in his arms as he ran for cover, was one of the victims. The distraught father, also named Hiram Lawrence, repeated, \\"My son got hit. My son got hit,\\" according to witnesses. On Tuesday, the child, whose second birthday is Dec. 28, clung to life at Children's Hospital Oakland with his father and other relatives keeping vigil. Police, city officials and clergy members called on the community to step up to help find the gunmen and to work to end the senseless violence that has brought fear and sorrow to neighborhoods across the city. Calling the child's shooting a \\"heinous crime,\\" interim police Chief Howard Jordan said Tuesday he was \\"outraged\\" and that such senseless violence \\"should not be tolerated by the community.\\" Jordan visited the little boy in his hospital room and brought him a teddy bear. The community, in turn, was shaken by the magnitude of the violence that seemed to erupt out of nowhere Monday evening. The boy, his father and about 20 others were in a liquor store parking lot in the 700 block of Willow Street about 6:30 p.m. Monday where a rap video had just finished taping, police said. A store surveillance video showed at least three gunmen wearing gray hooded sweatshirts firing on the group, and at least two people in the crowd, including one who was wounded, returning fire, police said. Besides the little boy, a 24-year-old woman and a man were also in critical condition while the other victims' injuries, including the boy's father who was shot in the thumb, were described as not being life-threatening. Jordan told reporters that some \\"persons of interest\\" have been identified, but would not give additional details. No arrests have been made. Sgt. Randy Wingate said the investigation has been somewhat stymied because some of the victims \\"are not as cooperative as we would like them to be.\\" Even though police said at the news conference no motive for the shooting has been established, law enforcement sources said they cannot rule out the possibility the shooting is related to a long-standing violent dispute between two West Oakland gangs in the area. To prevent acts of retaliation, police Tuesday night significantly increased their presence in the gang areas. Mayor Jean Quan also spoke at the briefing, saying \\"probably the saddest job I have as mayor\\" is talking to relatives of young people shot in the city. She recalled talking with the father of Carlos \\"Carlito\\" Nava, a 3-year-old boy fatally shot Aug. 8 in the 6400 block of International Boulevard, the innocent victim of a gang-related shooting that wounded two intended targets. Quan said community outrage over that shooting helped lead to the arrest of two suspects. She urged the community to step forward again. \\"We can't allow children to be senseless victims of senseless violence. We can do something about it. It's a cycle we can end, a cycle we must end. Let's not let that code of silence continue. Help us end these senseless and cowardly acts.\\" Councilwoman Nancy Nadel (Downtown-West Oakland), who represents the area of the shooting, said the \\"power of violence is so thwarted and wrong and is continually growing in low-income communities. We have to change that. The trend toward senseless violence is out of control and it cannot go on any longer.\\" Speaking on behalf of the 70-church Pastors of Oakland was the group's first vice president, Pastor Gerald Agee of the Friendship Christian Center. Agee said he was \\"tired of preaching eulogies\\" at homicide victims' funerals and wants only to \\"preach at marriages.\\" \\"The taking of a life is wrong, especially a baby's,\\" he said. \\"We as a community have to do something to stop this. Let us as a community say enough is enough.\\" Police said an Oakland rapper who goes by the name of Kafani was at the scene of the shooting in the 700 block of Willow Street, in the parking lot of a liquor store where dozens of people had gathered. However, Kafani said Tuesday morning that he was not at the scene. \\"I was not shot and was not at video! My cousin and his son was shot and he does music with me. A promo van that promotes my music was there,\\" Kafani said, responding by email to an inquiry from the Bay Area News Group. Police said there may have been an argument shortly before the shooting. Larry White, who lives across the street from the liquor store, described the scene as chaotic. He had just walked inside the door of his apartment building when he heard the shots and took cover behind the elevator. Once the shooting stopped, he said, he looked outside and saw a man screaming, holding a small child who was taken away in a black SUV. In a biography posted on his personal website, Kafani.com, Kafani describes himself as a budding music mogul. In the bio, Kafani says, \\"I'm not trying to glorify shooting and killing. I'm rapping about the good life and letting my fans know there is a way out. I'm not trying to sound like anyone else. I'm just Kafani.\\" A vigil for the little boy is planned Wednesday evening. No time was announced. Up to 35,000 in reward money is being offered for information leading to the arrest of suspects in the shooting. Police are asking anyone with information to call a special tip line at 510-773-2805.

The child and his father were both shot during an incident on an Oakland Street yesterday, when unknown gunmen opened fire on the crowd for motives that are not known. A KTVU-TV news showed a van owned by rapper Kafani, that has been riddled with bullets. According to a local news report, he was allegedly shooting a music video at the time of the gunfire, which occurred in a liquor store parking lot. “I was not shot. News reports wrong I did not shoot a video today,” Kafani tweeted earlier this morning. The one-year-old child is currently at Children’s Hospital in Oakland, where he underwent surgery, in an attempt to remove swelling from his brain. Police are seeking motives as well as up to six suspects in the shootings. The other seven victims’ injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening. Kafani is an Oakland-based artist who hit big with the single “Fast (Like A Nascar.” He has recorded tracks with rappers like Too hort, Yukmouth, Freeway and others.

Article: Women work harder than men at university and get better degrees as a result, according to a study at Brunel University. The research, which followed 200 students for four years, found that women consistently outperformed men in their studies even though they had started their courses with almost identical A-level grades. An analysis of the results showed that while 65 percent of female graduates were awarded, only 35 percent of male graduates did as well. Girls are known to outperform boys at school, but this research showed that trend continued at university. Fiona Smith, who led the research, said, \\"The research shows that the difference has something to do with schools in general.\\" \\"It also shows something about the inequality for working women in terms of pay and promotion. Women work harder at school, harder at university, and do better at both, but they still receive less pay.\\" The research found that female students were more faithful, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to believe that their marks reflected their abilities than male students. Female students were also more likely to ask for and receive support from their professors. Women were also more likely to choose their universities because they liked the courses offered. In contrast, men were more likely than women to miss lectures due to \\"other affairs\\" and \\"laziness\\", and to believe that playing sports was an important part of university life. Generally, people think that women's success comes from more emphasis on coursework, but the research showed that female geographers at Brunel did better in their exams than in their coursework. Dr Smith said, \\"Most women feel that getting good grades is the most important part of university life.

Mothers are using their newborn babies as an excuse to let themselves go and avoid exercise, according to this tough love personal trainer. Sydney-based trainer Allan Trinh believes new mums prioritise their kids over themselves and they end up missing out health-wise. 'They're letting go, they're not eating properly and they just don't care,' Mr Trinh told Daily Mail Australia. 'I don't think that's right. You have to be a role model to the kids.' Sydney-based trainer Allan Trinh believes mothers use their newborn babies as an excuse to let themselves go and avoid exercise. The 24-year-old mobile personal trainer said he expected to 'cop a lot of slack from mums' over his controversial stance but he was more concerned about his message. 'The three main excuses I hear are 'I'm too tired, I've got no time and my kids are my workout',' he said. 'I know mums are really busy and haven't had much sleep, but it's all about the kids and they don't prioritise themselves anymore. 'Before I start with them they're a mess, but how they come out of it is completely new women.' He said new mums let themselves go, don't eat properly and just don't care because their children are the main priority. Mr Trinh, who has run Personal Direct Training in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney for almost four years, says a large proportion of his business are mums. 'I'm not a parent but I've been into the homes of a lot of mums - I've seen their lifestyles and the way they eat,' he said. 'I do sympathise with them. I will never go through pregnancy but I want to make a difference (with their health).' Mr Trinh said mums needed ­energy and only exercise could help with that.

The answer to the question: Which student feels he has moved from the second to the third echelon of students? is inside the article: James Hart starts his first year at Harvard Law School in a very bad way. In his contract law course with Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr., he assumes the first class will be an outline of the course. When Kingsfield immediately delves into the material using the Socratic method and asks Hart the first question, Hart is totally unprepared and feels so utterly humiliated that, after class, he throws up in the bathroom. Hart is invited to join a study group with five other students: Franklin Ford, the fifth generation of Fords at Harvard Law School Kevin Brooks, a married man with a photographic memory, but no analytical skills Thomas Anderson Willis Bell, an abrasive individual who is devoted to property law O'Connor (Robert Lydiard)While out getting pizza, Hart is asked by a woman, Susan Fields, to walk her home, due to her feeling uncomfortable with a man who had been following her. Hart returns to her house soon after and asks her on a date, after which they begin a relationship. Their relationship is complex; she resents the time he devotes to his studies, while he expects her to provide him with a great deal of attention and wants a firm commitment. When Hart and his classmates are invited to a cocktail party hosted by Kingsfield, he is stunned to discover that Susan is Kingsfield's married daughter. (She is, however, separated from her husband and eventually gets a divorce.) She and Hart break up and get back together several times. Hart divides the class into three groups: those who have given up; those who are trying, but fear being called upon in class to respond to Kingsfield's questions; and the \\"upper echelon\\".

Question: Question: \\"Which intricate emotions did Turner come up with?\\" Context: \\"A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In the context provided, Jonathan Turner, a notable sociologist, has developed a comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans. His research encompasses a wide range of emotion theories across various fields such as sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. This extensive analysis allowed him to identify four primary emotions that are believed to be rooted in human neurology. These emotions are: assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. Turner posits that these primary emotions can intermingle and interact to create more complex and elaborate emotional experiences. These more intricate emotions, referred to as first-order elaborations in Turner's theory, encompass a range of sentiments, including pride, triumph, and awe. It is essential to note that emotions can also manifest at varying levels of intensity. For example, feelings of concern are regarded as a low-intensity version of the primary emotion aversion-fear, while depression is a higher-intensity variant. The two key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within Turner's framework are expectation states and sanctions. Individuals entering a situation or encounter come with specific expectations about how it should transpire. The emotions they experience depend on the extent to which these expectations are met or unmet. Furthermore, the provision of positive or negative sanctions aimed at oneself or others can also incite different emotional experiences in individuals. In summary, Turner's theory not only recognizes the existence of distinct primary emotions but also acknowledges how these emotions can combine to create a broad spectrum of more intricate, first-order elaborations. This approach to understanding human emotions accommodates the complexity and depth of emotional experiences while also establishing a foundation upon which further research and analysis can build."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980).

At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents.

It ran during the flapper era of the 1920s into the early 1930s . The art was by Faith Burrows . Each panel exhibited a flapper wearing one of the current fashions , with a witticism typed at the bottom . Burrows drew her panels at an image size of 3 \`\` × 6 '' on Bristol boards measuring 3 \`\` × 6 '' . Burrows ' series ran in competition for a time with Ethel Hays ' similarly themed and well - established Flapper Fanny Says panel from NEA . As writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Anita Loos , and illustrators such as Burrows , Hays , Russell Patterson and John Held Jr. popularized the flapper look and lifestyle through their works , flappers came to be seen as attractive , reckless and independent . - Faith Swank Burrows (November 17, 1904 April 11, 1997) was a nationally syndicated cartoonist during the Jazz Age. - The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s, ending with the Great Depression, in which jazz music and dance styles became popular, mainly in the United States, but also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Jazz originated in New Orleans as a fusion of African and European music and played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties. - A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes. - An editorial cartoon, also known as a political cartoon, is an illustration containing a commentary that usually relates to current events or personalities. An artist who draws such images is known as an editorial cartoonist. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - Flappers were a generation of young Western women in the 1920s who wore short skirts, bobbed their hair, listened to jazz, and flaunted their disdain for what was then considered acceptable behavior. Flappers were seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, drinking, treating sex in a casual manner, smoking, driving automobiles, and otherwise flouting social and sexual norms. Flappers had their origins in the liberal period of the Roaring Twenties, the social, political turbulence and increased transatlantic cultural exchange that followed the end of World War I, as well as the export of American jazz culture to Europe. - The Roaring Twenties is a term for Western society and culture in the 1920s. It was a period of sustained economic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, particularly in major cities such as New York City, Montreal, Chicago, Detroit, Paris, Berlin, London and Los Angeles. In France and Quebec, it was known as the \\"\\"années folles\\"\\" (\\"Crazy Years\\"), emphasizing the era's social, artistic and cultural dynamism. Jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined modern womanhood, Art Deco peaked, and, in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism after World War I, normalcy returned to politics. This era saw the large-scale use of automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, radio, and electricity; commercial, passenger, and freight aviation; as well as unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand, plus significant changes in lifestyle and culture. The media focused on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars, as cities rooted for their home teams and filled the new palatial cinemas and gigantic sports stadiums. In most major democracies, women won the right to vote. - Print syndication distributes news articles, columns, comic strips and other features to newspapers, magazines and websites.

Braces are the latest teenage fashion trend in Southeast Asia. Having a mouthful of metal has become so popular with Asian teens that there have been reports of many teens wearing fake braces. Many Asian beauty shops are now offering to put in cheap fake braces. There are even cheaper do-it-yourself braces such as \\" Hello Kitty,\\" Mickey Mouse\\" or others for a price of around 100. Braces are considered a sign of wealth in Southeast Asia. A real set of braces in Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, for example, will cost around 1,200, which is a large amount for the country with a GDP of 345 billion ( a billion is 1,000 million), compared to the US which had a GDP of 1,506 Trillion ( a Trillion is 1,000 billion) last year. While Asian teens may think that their colorful fake braces are cool, experts say that these trendy fashion braces can cause illness and can even lead to death. According to the New York Daily News, fake fashion braces have already been linked to the deaths of two teens in Thailand.A 17-year-old in the northeast city of Khon Kaen died from heart failure caused by a thyroid infection from a pair of fake fashion braces. Police also linked the death of another 14-year-old girl in Chonburi to a pair of fashion braces she had brought from an illegal shop.

So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

Actually when an inventor has a patent, it's enforceable by the laws in the country where the inventor developed the invention. If anyone makes and sells the product then the inventor can take them to civil court. W: What can the inventor expect to receive if he sues and wins? M: Well, there are different things the court could do, but there's no guarantee. There's a good chance the court could award him compensation and orders to stop the manufacture and sale of goods. It may well be that the goods would be ordered to be destroyed. W: Can the other person being sued do anything to help themselves? M: That's the beauty of the whole thing.

W: You said the inventor is protected by the laws of the country. Is everything equal? Do all countries have the same law? M: No, they're not all equal. You're right. It's only in theory.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What's the last name of the person who first discovers that Julian's brother has been resurrected? The film takes place in England in 1865. Having been grotesquely disfigured in an African voodoo ceremony for a transgression against the native populace, Sir Edward Markham is kept locked in his room by his guilt-ridden brother, Julian. Tiring of his captivity, Sir Edward plots to escape by faking his death. With the help of the crooked family lawyer, Trench, they hire witchdoctor N'Galo to concoct a drug to put Sir Edward into a deathlike trance. Before Trench has time to act, Julian finds his \\"dead\\" brother and puts him in a coffin (the title's \\"oblong box\\"). Embarrassed by his brother's appearance, Julian asks Trench to find a proxy body for Sir Edward's lying in state. Trench and N'Galo murder landlord Tom Hacket and offer his corpse to Julian. After the wake, Trench and his young companion Norton, dispose of Hacket's body in a nearby river, while Julian has Sir Edward buried. Now free of his brother, Julian marries his young fiancée, Elizabeth, while Trench, Norton and N'Galo go their separate ways. Sir Edward is left buried alive until he is dug up by graverobbers and delivered to Dr. Newhartt. Newhartt opens the coffin and is confronted by the resurrected Sir Edward.

The speaker is advocating for a shift away from the current methods and tactics, which have apparently proven unsuccessful or have become obsolete, and is calling for a collective effort to reassess and reevaluate the situation. When considering the hypothesis, \\"I want us to regroup and rethink,\\" it becomes essential to look at the intentions and desires expressed in the premise. Here, the speaker plainly states, \\"let's all of us regroup—and rethink,\\" which implies their inclination and desire for a collective reevaluation of the current situation. Consequently, the given premise appears to entail the hypothesis \\"I want us to regroup and rethink,\\" as there is a clear correlation between the two.

All the three are very different and should be considered carefully. Your budget will probably have the biggest effect on your choice. Comparing the three will help you make a good decision. New houses are untouched and fresh, which means they can suit your personality and you know exactly where all of the materials come from. New houses won't hold many unpleasant surprises, such as weak foundations, or other damaged areas. Most of these modern houses are also far more eco-friendly, with future decoration being just as easy to make and do as you like. Buying new houses is also a great way to save money, and you may find its benefit with the price going up in the future. Some buildings, such as those that are rare or in certain areas, are of value over the years. Sometimes it is the history that draws more buyers into older houses. A famous person may have lived there, or an important event may have taken place in the house. This may not add any value to the house, but it can add to the attraction. There may be more repairs which will need to be done in the old houses,so before you think you've found a great bargain, be sure to get a careful inspection. There are those who prefer building from the ground up. Building your own house can be a very rewarding, tiring, and expensive experience. While people have many expectations of planning and building their own houses, one thing is sure: it will take a while.

Language experts, however, will tell you that you're never too old to learn a new language. As you get older, it can be more difficult to learn a new language, though. Children and adults learn new languages in different ways. For children, language is their life. They study for thousands of hours every year, because they need to learn languages to become part of their communities. Adults, on the other hand, are already part of a language community. Learning a new language means becoming part of another language community, and adults rarely get the chance to practice as much as young children do. Moreover, children learning a new language are expected to make mistakes. This gives them freedom when learning to be daring and confident. Adults, however, often feel pressured to be perfect when learning a new language. This can discourage many people and make it even harder to learn a new language. When young children learn a new language, they come to see various languages as a \\"normal\\" part of society.

Question: Information: - Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa (born José Doroteo Arango Arámbula; 5 June 1878 20 July 1923) was a Mexican Revolutionary general and one of the most prominent figures of the Mexican Revolution. - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. - The Mexican Revolution was a major armed struggle that radically transformed Mexican culture and government. Although recent research has focused on local and regional aspects of the Revolution, it was a \\"genuinely national revolution.\\" Its outbreak in 1910 resulted from the failure of the 35-year long regime of Porfirio Díaz to find a managed solution to the presidential succession. This meant there was a political crisis among competing elites and the opportunity for agrarian insurrection. Wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged Díaz in 1910 presidential election, and following the rigged results revolted under the Plan of San Luis Potosí. Armed conflict ousted Díaz from power and a new election was held in 1911, bringing Madero to the presidency. - North Africa or Northern Africa is the northernmost region of Africa. The United Nations definition of \\"North Africa\\" includes seven countries and territories; Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. The countries of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya are often collectively referred to as the Maghreb, which is the Arabic word for \\"sunset\\". Egypt lies to the northeast and encompasses part of West Asia, while Sudan is situated on the edge of the Sahel, to the south of Egypt. - The Boxer Rebellion, Boxer Uprising or Yihequan Movement was a violent anti-foreign and anti-Christian uprising that took place in China between 1899 and 1901, towards the end of the Qing dynasty. It was initiated by the Militia United in Righteousness (\\"Yihetuan\\"), known in English as the \\"Boxers\\", and was motivated by proto-nationalist sentiments and opposition to imperialist expansion and associated Christian missionary activity. - Edward Sinnott \`\` Tex '' O'Reilly ( 15 August 1880 -- 9 December 1946 ) was an American soldier of fortune who is said to have fought in ten wars under many flags . Initially serving in the U.S. Army in the Spanish -- American War and Philippine -- American War , as well as the Boxer Rebellion , he would claim to fight in Venezuela , Honduras and Nicaragua . He fought with Pancho Villa in Mexico and claimed to have fought in the Rif War with the Spanish Foreign Legion in North Africa , as well as serving as an international policeman in Shanghai . He became a writer , including as a reporter for the Associated Press . He wrote an autobiography , Roving and Fighting , and Lowell Thomas wrote Born to Raise Hell about him . The latter book has been reprinted and is distributed by The Long Riders ' Guild Press . - The Spanish Civil War, widely known in Spain simply as The Civil War or The War, took place from 1936 to 1939 and was fought between the Republicans, who were loyal to the democratic, left-leaning and a relatively urban Second Spanish Republic in an alliance of convenience with the Anarchists, versus the Nationalists, a falangist, Carlist and a largely aristocratic conservative group led by General Francisco Franco. Although the war is often portrayed as a struggle between democracy and fascism, some historians consider it more accurately described as a struggle between leftist revolution and rightist counterrevolution. Ultimately, the Nationalists won, and Franco then ruled Spain for the next 36 years, from April 1939 until his death in November 1975. - \\"Don\\" Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja, 2nd Marquis of Estella, 22nd Count of Sobremonte, Knight of Calatrava (January 8, 1870 March 16, 1930) was a dictator, aristocrat, and military officer who served as Prime Minister of Spain from 1923 to 1930 during Spain's Restoration era. He deeply believed that it was the politicians who had ruined Spain and that governing without them he could restore the nation. His slogan was \\"Country, Religion, Monarchy.\\" Historians depict him as an inept dictator who lacked clear ideas and political acumen, and who alienated his potential supporters such as the army. He did not create a base of support among the voters, and depended instead on elite elements. His actions discredited the king and ruined the monarchy, while heightening social tensions that led in 1936 to a full-scale Spanish Civil War. - The Rif War, also called the Second Moroccan War, was fought in the early 1920s between the colonial power Spain (later joined by France) and the Berbers of the Rif mountainous region. Led by Abd al-Karim, the Riffians at first inflicted several defeats on the Spanish forces by using guerrilla tactics and captured European weapons. After France's entry into the conflict and the massive landing of Spanish troops at Al Hoceima, Abd el-Karim surrendered to the French and was taken into exile. Despite victory, controversy in Spain over the conduct of the war led to a military coup by Gen. Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1923 and foreshadowed the Spanish Civil War of 193639.

If For those who prefer something sweeter, shortbread (traditionally served at Yuletide and Hogmanay) is rich in butter and sugar., can we conclude that \\"Short bread is made with oranges and figs.\\"?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"Shortbread is made with oranges and figs\\" based on the given information. The statement provided says that shortbread is traditionally served at Yuletide and Hogmanay and that it is rich in butter and sugar. It does not mention the inclusion of oranges and figs in the recipe. To clarify, shortbread is a type of traditional Scottish biscuit made primarily from flour, sugar, and butter. Its origins date back to medieval times, when it was derived from a type of bread known as \\"biscuit bread.\\" Over time, the recipe evolved into what we know today as shortbread. The classic shortbread recipe does not contain oranges or figs, but rather focuses on the three principal ingredients: flour, sugar, and butter. The high butter content gives the shortbread its crumbly and rich texture, while the sugar provides the sweetness. That being said, there are numerous variations on the traditional shortbread recipe, which can include additional flavors and ingredients such as chocolate, nuts, caramel, and various spices. In some variations, ingredients like orange zest, candied orange peel, or dried figs might be incorporated into the mixture to create a unique and different flavor profile. These adaptations, however, are personal preferences or modern twists on the classic recipe and not considered traditional. To sum up, we cannot conclude that shortbread is made with oranges and figs simply because it is sweeter and traditionally served at Yuletide and Hogmanay. The base recipe for shortbread does not include these ingredients, and their addition would represent a variation on the classic shortbread rather than a defining characteristic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Gulf Stream, together with its northern extension towards Europe, the North Atlantic Drift, is a powerful, warm, and swift Atlantic ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and stretches to the tip of Florida, and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The process of western intensification causes the Gulf Stream to be a northward accelerating current off the east coast of North America. At about , it splits in two, with the northern stream, the North Atlantic Drift, crossing to Northern Europe and the southern stream, the Canary Current, recirculating off West Africa. - Gunnar Gunnarsson (18 May 1889 21 November 1975) was an Icelandic author who wrote mainly in Danish. He grew up, in considerable poverty, on Valþjófsstaður in Fljótsdalur valley and on Ljótsstaðir in Vopnafjörður. Despite great difficulties, he became one of the most popular novelists in Denmark and Germany. - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - A lava field, also called a lava plain or lava bed, is a large expanse of nearly flat-lying lava flows. Such features are generally composed of highly fluid basalt lava, and can extend for tens or even hundreds of miles across the underlying terrain. The extent of large lava fields is most readily grasped from the air or in satellite photos, where their typically dark, nearly black color contrasts sharply with the rest of the landscape. According to the US Geological Survey, monogenetic volcanic fields are collections of cinder cones, and/or Maar vents and associated lava flows and pyroclastic deposits. Sometimes a stratovolcano is at the center of the field, as at the San Francisco Volcanic Field in Arizona. Monogenetic volcano fields have systematic growth patterns that suggest they represent single magmatic systems in the same way that stratovolcanoes do, but monogenetic volcanoes grow laterally rather than vertically (Wood and Shoan, 1984). Detailed mapping indicates that some cinder cones in monogenetic fields (e.g., Cima, California, and Timber Mountain Volcanic Field, Nevada) may have had multiple eruptions separated by tens to hundreds of thousands of years (Wells, et al., 1989). Thus, some monogenetic cones may actually be polygenetic. This possibility differs from observations of historic eruptions (Wood, 1979), and is physically difficult to understand because cinder cone conduits are narrow and must solidify within a few years of eruption. Nonetheless, such multiple eruptions appear to have happened at least twice: Other cinder cones need to be closely reexamined. - Fljótsdalur is a valley in east Iceland, formed by the Lagarfljót River. Lake Lagarfljót and the city of Egilsstaðir are located in the valley. - Vopnafjörður is a village and municipality in Northeast Iceland, standing on a peninsula in the middle of a mountainous bay by the same name. The main industries of Vopnafjörður are fish processing, agriculture and tourism and other services. - Sons of the Soil ( Danish : Borgslægtens historie , Icelandic : Saga Borgarættarinnar ) is a Danish film directed and shot by Gunnar Sommerfeldt in Iceland in 1919 , based on the novel by Gunnar Gunnarsson . It was released in 1921 . - Reykjavík is the capital and largest city of Iceland. It has a latitude of 64°08' N, making it the world's northernmost capital of a sovereign state, and is a popular tourist destination. It is located in southwestern Iceland, on the southern shore of Faxa Bay. With a population of around 130,000 (and over 200,000 in the Capital Region), it is the heart of Iceland's cultural, economic and governmental activity.

Even so, Ebenezer offers him some respite from his busy evening of helping miser's to change their ways. The Spirit tells that Ebenezer is ok, but in his past, there are other Blackadders who are quite miserly. Curious, Ebenezer asks to know more, and the Spirit goes into several flashbacks.The first vision shows how Lord Blackadder managed to con his way into great fortune and entitlement by tricking Queen Elizabeth (Miranda Richardson) into executing Lord Melchett (Stephen Fry).The second vision shows Edmund Blackadder tricking Prince Regent (Hugh Laurie) into giving up his valuable worldly goods to the poor.These visions intrigue Ebenezer, and he also wishes to see the future. However, the Spirit shows him two futures: if he becomes bad, his future descendant will become ruler of the Universe. If he stays good, he'll become the slave to the future descendant of Mr Baldrick.The Spirit of Christmas then attempts to leave, hoping that none of what Ebenezer has seen will cause him to stray from the side of good.

Write a title for this article: An ad made by John Liu's campaign is airing on radio stations courtesy of the Correctional Officers' Benevolent Association, which spent more than 200,000 to buy air time. The union president says they copied the ad without the campaign's knowledge. A new radio ad bankrolled by an influential city union for mayoral candidate John Liu is raising eyebrows among government watchdogs who warn that it could set a dangerous precedent. The powerful ad features New York children, including Liu’s 12-year-old son, Joey, endorsing him in the mayor’s race. CHRISTINE QUINN TAKES OFFENSE AT CHIRLANE MCCRAY'S \\"CHILDREN\\" COMMENT “On Sept. 10, vote for my dad,” Joey says in a minute-long spot in which three high school students also appear, calling the city controller a “friend” who will revamp the education system. What’s unusual about the ad is that it was made by the Liu campaign — but is airing on radio stations courtesy of the Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association, which spent more than 200,000 to buy airtime.

If they do collaborate, their funds are considered campaign contributions and limited to 4,950. The union says the ads are legal because they were copied off Liu’s website without his campaign’s knowledge. “There ain’t no coordination going on with us,” said union President Norman Seabrook, who said Liu found out about the ad with the rest of the public when it debuted Wednesday morning. Chung Seto, a top Liu aide, said she was unaware the union had turned the Web clip into a radio spot.

More than 2,000 people displaced by Superstorm Sandy are still living in hotels five months after the devastating natural disaster destroyed their New York City homes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is paying on average 252 a night to house families and individuals from across the hurricane hit area. According to the New York Times, social service groups are hoping to get all those affected into a permanent home by the end of April but admit it may not be possible. Homeless: More than 2,000 victims of Superstorm Sandy are still living in hotels across New York City. Some experts say such accommodation will put pressure on individuals - leaving them in cramped conditions with no feeling of permanency. Others say it is just too expensive as a long-term solution. 'The problem with hotels is that it’s not a normal life — you can’t cook a meal,' said Martha J. Kegel, executive director of Unity of Greater New Orleans, a coalition that helped relocate residents after Hurricane Katrina, told the Times. 'You can’t even store much food. There’s going to be domestic violence because there’s not enough room. It’s not a good situation for people to be long-term.' Rosanne Haggerty, president of Community Solutions, a homelessness charity said: 'Why are we spending money on hotels instead of helping families pay the rent?' Devastation: Those still in hotels can't afford current housing available in New York City. Their previous homes were destroyed in the storm. 'For a fraction of the cost, families could be in a stable situation and getting a running start in putting their lives together.' Wanda Wilson, a mother-of-two made homeless after Sandy told the paper she hoped for a more permanent solution. 'The whole situation is really messed up. It’s a waste of money,' she said. Many of those affected by Sandy are too poor to afford available housing and have nowhere to return to because of the devastating impact of the storm. 43 per cent of those who registered for FEMA funding made less than 30,000 per year per household. The lack of available housing made hotels the only choice according to city officials. 'The hotels provided flexibility and availability that you can’t get anywhere else,' the city’s commissioner of homeless services Seth Diamond said. Recovery: Many of those affected by the storm were New York's poorest earning less than 30,000 per household. Support: Thousands needed help after the storm. People are pictured here waiting in line at a distribution site in Coney Island. It is hoped newly available public housing will plug the gap but in some instances families will also be given vouchers to subsidize 70 per cent of their rent. If the April 30 target is missed many of the families could end up back in homeless shelters, according to the Times. 'Shelter is one of many possibilities,' said Barbara Brancaccio, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Homeless Services. The ongoing difficulties in dealing with the 7,000 residents who went to evacuation centers following Hurricane Sandy on October 29, has prompted many to call for wholesale reform of the city's emergency disaster planning. 'The city may have been overly optimistic,' said Councilman Brad Lander. 'You need to have emergency rental vouchers ready to be deployed.' After Hurricane Katrina many of those made homeless were put in hotels for years. And there are many people affected by Sandy who may never get help. According to the Times, around two per cent of those in need are illegal immigrants who don't want to reveal their status to officials. On Friday, the Government announced 1.4billion in aid to New York transit agencies to help rebuild systems after Sandy. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Along with the rest of Trafford, Stretford maintains a selective education system assessed by the 11-plus examination. The proportion of pupils leaving Stretford Grammar School with five or more GCSEs at grades A*–C in 2006, was 98.3%, compared to an average of 66.7% for all secondary schools in Trafford and a national UK average of 61.3%.

Summarize this article: Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland. Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions. It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out. During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands. It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray. But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore. Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised. In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest. The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank. Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire. He told BBC Scotland: \\"The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands. \\"As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.

Instead, it provides information about the relationship between ADHD and eating disorders in girls. Here's a more appropriate and detailed answer for the original question: When talking to someone with an eating disorder, it is essential to be empathetic, supportive, and sensitive to their struggles. Avoid making any triggering statements or perpetuating harmful stereotypes or misconceptions. Here are some examples of what not to say to someone with an eating disorder: 1. \\"Just eat more\\" or \\"Just stop eating\\": Eating disorders are complex mental health disorders, and recovery cannot be achieved by simply starting or stopping specific behaviors. Such comments oversimplify the issue and can make the individual feel invalidated. 2. \\"You don't look like you have an eating disorder\\": Eating disorders affect people of all shapes, sizes, and appearances. Making such a statement can be invalidating and dismiss the seriousness of the person's struggles. 3. \\"You'll grow out of it\\" or \\"It's just a phase\\": Eating disorders are not something that someone will naturally \\"grow out of,\\" and such comments can minimize the severity of the condition. 4. Commenting on their appearance or weight: Even if intended as a compliment, any remark about the person's weight or appearance can trigger negative thoughts or feelings related to their eating disorder. 5. \\"I wish I had the willpower to diet like you\\" or \\"I wish I could eat whatever I want and not gain weight\\": These comments might glamorize or trivialize the person's struggles and can be triggering. 6. Comparing your own eating habits or weight concerns: Comparisons are generally unhelpful and can make the individual feel self-conscious or defensive. 7. \\"Can't you see what you're doing to yourself?\\": This might come off as accusatory and can make the person feel guilty, ashamed, or defensive, further eroding their self-esteem and confidence.

Today, he is seeing six patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, patient D, patient E, and patient F. Patient A is a smoker, but patient B is not a smoker. Patient C uses sunscreen, but patient D does not use any sunscreen. Patient E tans with tanning lamps, but patient F tans in the sun. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which patient would be more susceptible to skin cancer, patient E or patient C? Hint: Making these healthy lifestyle choices can also help prevent some types of cancer. In addition, you can lower the risk of cancer by avoiding carcinogens , which are substances that cause cancer. For example, you can reduce your risk of lung cancer by not smoking. You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by using sunscreen. How to choose a sunscreen that offers the most protection is explained below ( Figure below ). Some people think that tanning beds are a safe way to get a tan. This is a myth. Tanning beds expose the skin to UV radiation. Any exposure to UV radiation increases the risk of skin cancer. It doesn’t matter whether the radiation comes from tanning lamps or the sun. The answer is:","completion":"Patient E would be more susceptible to skin cancer than patient C. The given paragraph provides relevant information about cancer prevention, which helps in understanding the risks associated with certain behaviors, such as smoking, using sunscreen, and tanning methods. Patient C uses sunscreen, which is a healthy lifestyle choice that helps prevent skin cancer. Sunscreen contains ingredients that protect the skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted by the sun. Based on the hint provided, using sunscreen can significantly lower the risk of skin cancer. By applying sunscreen regularly, patient C is taking a proactive approach to minimize their risk of skin cancer. On the other hand, patient E tans with tanning lamps as opposed to natural sunlight. The paragraph debunks the myth that tanning beds are a safe way to get a tan. Tanning beds expose the skin to UV radiation, which is known to increase the risk of skin cancer. UV radiation in tanning lamps is often more intense and concentrated than sunlight, making it even more dangerous for the skin. Whether the exposure comes from tanning lamps or the sun, the risk of skin cancer increases with UV radiation exposure. Since patient E uses tanning lamps, they are putting themselves at a higher risk for skin cancer compared to patient C, who takes preventive measures by using sunscreen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stephen Russell Davies was born on 27 April 1963 at Mount Pleasant Hospital in Swansea. His father, Vivian Davies (1925-2015), and his mother, Barbara (1929-1999), were teachers. Davies was the youngest of three children and their only son. Because he was born by C-section, his mother was placed on a morphine drip and was institutionalised after an overdose resulted in a psychotic episode. Davies' next project was The Grand, a period soap drama set in a Manchester hotel during the interwar period. It was designed to be a valuable show in a ratings war with the BBC and was scheduled at 9 pm on a Friday night. After the original writer abandoned the series, Granada approached him to write the entire show. His scripts for the first series reflect the pessimism of the period; each episode added its own emotional trauma on the staff, including a soldier's execution for desertion, a destitute maid who threatens to illegally abort her unborn child to survive, and a multi-episode storyline centred on the chambermaid, Monica Jones (Jane Danson), who kills her rapist in self-defence, is arrested, and eventually hanged for murder. The show was renewed for a second series despite the first's dark tone. The second series had a lighter tone and greater emphasis on character development, which Davies attributed to his friend Sally, who had previously warned him of the adult humour in Breakfast Serials; she told him that his show was too bleak to be compared to real life. He highlighted the sixth and eighth episodes of the second series as a time of maturity as a writer: for the sixth, he utilised then-unconventional narrative devices such as flashbacks to explore the hotel barman's closeted homosexuality and the societal attitudes towards sexuality in the 1920s; and he highlighted the eighth as when he allowed the series to \\"take on its own life\\" by deliberately inserting plot devices such as McGuffins to enhance the comic relief of the series. Although well received, the series' ratings were not high enough to warrant a third series. After its cancellation in September 1997, Davies had an existential crisis after almost dying from an accidental overdose; the experience persuaded him to detoxify and make a name for himself by producing a series that celebrated his homosexuality. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what is the grand?","completion":"The Grand is a period soap drama set in a Manchester hotel during the interwar period.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Alexander is heating up water in his kitchen because he is preparing to make pasta. He has split the water into two containers, container A and container B. Container A has been heating up for a long amount time, while container B has only been heating up for a short amount of time. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which container has particles with lower average kinetic energy? Hint: As a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of its particles increases. The rate of evaporation increases as more and more molecules are able to escape the liquid’s surface into the vapor phase. Eventually a point is reached when the molecules all throughout the liquid have enough kinetic energy to vaporize . At this point the liquid begins to boil. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure. The Figure below illustrates the boiling of liquid. A:","completion":"Container B has particles with lower average kinetic energy compared to container A. This is because, based on the given information, container A has been heating up for a longer period of time than container B. Heating up a substance leads to increased kinetic energy in its particles, as mentioned in the hint that the average kinetic energy of its particles increases as the substance is heated. Given that container A has been exposed to heat for a longer duration, it stands to reason that its particles will have attained a higher average kinetic energy than those in container B, which has been heated for a shorter duration. Therefore, container B, having been heated less, contains water particles with a lower average kinetic energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The prisoners lose their civil rights and have to obey arbitrary rules, such as completely eating their meals. The guards are given nightsticks but are told not to use violence in any case. Each prisoners name is taken away and replaced by a number. Tarek (prisoner nr. 77) initially refuses to acknowledge the guards' superiority by drinking the milk of one of his co-prisoners because of that prisoner's lactose intolerance or by throwing his blanket out of his cell to provoke the guards. He befriends his cellmates, Steinhoff and Schütte. Psychological changes develop and the situation deteriorates. The circumstances seem to be escalating after a few days.

Presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. \\"He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful\\", in the words of critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, \\"I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\\" His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as \\"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\\". In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as \\"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\\". Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sound's Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as \\"aggressively bisexual in appeal\\".

Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek to complain about the article.Nirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind). Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement.

It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times commented, \\"Four or five years ago if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full from floor to ceiling for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his..., can you guess it ?

However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue. Two friends went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well.

Turn the clock dial to the desired temperature, likely in the 375 to 400 range by turning the knob with your hand.; (B). Turn the knob to the desired temperature, likely in the 375 to 400 range by turning the knob with your hand.;","completion":"Option B makes more sense to accomplish the goal of prepping the oven to bake pizza. Here's the step-by-step process and justification: 1. Check the pizza recipe or instructions: Before preheating the oven, it is crucial to know the recommended temperature to bake the pizza. This will ensure optimal cooking. 2. Turn the oven knob: Option B specifically refers to turning the knob for temperature adjustment. The clock dial mentioned in Option A is not relevant to setting the oven temperature, as it serves a different purpose (usually to set a timer or adjust the clock time). 3. Set the desired temperature: Based on the pizza recipe or instructions, turn the oven knob to the recommended temperature, which is likely to be in the range of 375 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. This ensures that the oven temperature is appropriate for baking the pizza. 4. Allow the oven to preheat: Give the oven enough time to reach the target temperature before placing the pizza inside. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes, depending on the oven. Preheating ensures even cooking and helps the pizza crust become crispy on the outside while staying tender on the inside. 5. Prepare the pizza for baking: While the oven is preheating, use this time to prepare the pizza by adding toppings and ensuring it is ready for baking. 6. Once the oven has reached the desired temperature, place the pizza inside and start the baking process. In summary, Option B is more logical and efficient as it focuses on the temperature knob required to prep the oven for baking pizza."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: The city retains its spotless streets, immaculate shops and nonexistent crime rate. Since the slowdown, only one manufacturing company has gone bankrupt, says the city's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, because Toyota spread out orders among many of the more than 400 auto parts factories in the city, to keep them afloat through hard times. Nonetheless, Toyota's downturn has rippled through the city's economy, idling many smaller auto-related suppliers, which also cut payrolls, mainly by refusing to renew the contracts of short-term workers. After losing their jobs, many of the city's 16,400 foreign residents, mostly ethnic Japanese from Brazil and Latin America, packed up and left, residents and city officials said. Hypothesis: Toyota's is the town's market driver.","completion":"Based on the provided context, the hypothesis \\"Toyota is the town's market driver\\" can be well-supported and drawn for multiple reasons. 1. Toyota's impact on the auto parts industry: The text mentions that Toyota spread out orders among more than 400 auto parts factories in the city to help keep them afloat during difficult times. This demonstrates a direct influence of Toyota on the economic well-being of many businesses in the city, which supports the idea that Toyota is the market driver in this town. 2. Indirect impact on smaller suppliers: The effects of Toyota's downturn were not limited to the auto parts factories; it also impacted smaller auto-related suppliers that subsequently had to cut payrolls and let go of short-term workers. This ripple effect provides further evidence that Toyota is a major market driver in the city, as its performance has significant consequences for other local businesses. 3. Impact on the foreign community: After job losses due to the slowdown, many of the city's 16,400 foreign residents, mostly ethnic Japanese from Brazil and Latin America, had to leave the city. This exemplifies how Toyota's economic influence extends beyond local businesses and affects the area's demographics, driving people to migrate based on the stability of job opportunities in the town. 4. Nonexistent crime rate: The context states that the city has maintained a nonexistent crime rate. While not directly mentioning Toyota, it can be hypothesized that the company's presence and influence result in numerous jobs and opportunities, which may contribute positively to keeping the crime rate low. 5. Role of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry: The context also mentions the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which highlights Toyota's bankruptcy story as a unique case during the downturn. This suggests that the organization recognizes the company's significant role in the city's economy. Based on these points, it is reasonable to conclude that Toyota is indeed the town's market driver. The company's actions and performance have direct and indirect consequences on the local economy, affecting businesses, workers, and residents. As Toyota's success goes, so does the well-being and stability of the city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Luckily I was not the target or victim of this road rage, but I was a first hand witness. Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction.

There are no dance schools in Glenwood and Lauryn says goodbye to her brother, Joel (John Reardon) before departing for Chicago to audition for a famous dance school, the fictional Chicago School of Music and Dance. Although Joel, who works as a mechanic in the family garage, is wary of Lauryn's decision to enroll, he eventually gives her his blessing. When Lauryn enters the stage, however, her dance (mostly a hip hop routine) was halted by the judge, who hostilely rejects her, saying that they need to see something more \\"sensual and feminine\\". Dejected, Lauryn goes to a diner to down her sorrows, but soon finds her car towed off. Upon seeing her misfortunes, Dana (Tessa Thompson), a friendly waitress from the diner invites Lauryn to her apartment and out of the pouring rain. Dana subsequently offers Lauryn a place to stay, considering Lauryn could not go back home and face her brother. The next day, Dana brings Lauryn to a club called Ruby's (whose dances are rooted in burlesque), where she meets with Russ (Riley Smith), the slick-talking disc jockey, and Brenda (Karen LeBlanc), the club owner. Brenda hires Lauryn as a bookkeeper, in light of her skills with numbers. Lauryn watches as a dancer, Carmen (Julissa Bermudez) performs impressively on the stage. Before locking up late one night, Lauryn goes on the stage and silently and elegantly dances, while unbeknownest to her, Russ watches from a distance. The next night, Brenda finds herself short of dancers. Russ asks Lauryn to dance, after having seen her graceful performance the previous night. Lauryn reluctantly agrees, and goes on stage. At first, new to the sexy routine, Lauryn looks foolish, but when Russ starts playing hip-hop music, Lauryn does a sexy hip-hop routine, and finds herself to be Ruby's new star. As Lauryn and Russ' relationship progresses, Lauryn continues performing stunningly on stage, much to Carmen's chagrin. One night...

Plot title: The Warriors Movie plot: As night falls over Coney Island, Cleon (Dorsey Wright), leader of the Warriors, meets up with eight of his most trusted lieutenants to travel by subway to the faraway Bronx. They will be attending an event called by a man named Cyrus, described as \\"the one and only.\\" Throughout the city, other gang delegations are seen entering the subway in their full colors. As the Warriors speculate about the event during their subway ride, we learn that Cyrus, leader of the largest gang in the city, the Gramercy Riffs, has called a truce of all the gangs in New York. He wants an unarmed delegation of nine from each gang to come to a mass meeting to hear what he has to say. Some of the Warriors are excited at the prospect, while others are skeptical.At Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the meeting is well-attended with over 100 gangs represented. The charismatic Cyrus (Roger Hill) takes the stage and delivers a spellbinding speech. He says that, instead of fighting each other over turf, they could unite to form an army of 60,000 soldiers, compared to only 20,000 police in the whole city.

Luther (David Patrick Kelley), the leader of a gang called the Rogues, has snuck a gun into the gathering. At a high point in the speech, Luther fires at Cyrus, killing him instantly. When Cyrus falls back, there is a brief stunned silence, followed by pandemonium. The crowd was so fixated on Cyrus that hardly anyone saw who fired the shot, but Luther turns to see that Fox (Thomas G. Waites) of the Warriors witnessed the assassination, so he points the gun to kill Fox.

At the age of 14, he joined SCristovo soccer club and only two years later became the star of Cruzeiro Belo Horizonte scoring a total of 58 goals in 60 matches and earning himself a reputation for his explosive pace and outstanding finishing skills. His goal-scoring record and unusual _ led him to be included in the Brazilian World Cup winning team the following year. After the World Cup, many top European football clubs were trying to sign him. Many people, including Brazilian football legend Pele, referred to him as the most promising footballer of his generation. Since his transfer to Dutch team PSV Eindhoven, Ronaldo's biography is one of success after success. Two Copa America s, a UEFA Cup, a Dutch Cup, a Spanish League Cup, and two awards as best player in the world, all in the space of two years, are some of Ronaldo s impressive achievements. On arrival to Inter-Milan in 1997, Ronaldo became the idol of the local fans who refer to him as \\"il Fenomeno.\\" Since the 98 World Cup he has suffered two serious knee injuries that have severely limited his appearances.

Answer the following question: when did the canon 5d mark ii come out?","completion":"The Canon EOS 5D Mark II, a highly acclaimed digital SLR camera, was officially announced by Canon Inc. on September 17, 2008, and it became available for purchase in the market shortly after in late November 2008. This camera was a successor to the original Canon EOS 5D, released in 2005, and introduced a plethora of noteworthy improvements and features that solidified its position as a favorite among professional photographers and enthusiasts alike. The Canon 5D Mark II was a game-changer in the world of digital photography, as it brought innovative features and leading-edge technology to the market. It was equipped with a 21.1-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor, which was a significant upgrade from the 12.8-megapixel sensor in its predecessor. This allowed for higher resolution images and better performance in low-light conditions. The Mark II also boasted an impressive ISO range from 100 to 6400, which could be expanded to 50-25,600, allowing for incredible low-light capability. One of the most groundbreaking features of the 5D Mark II was its ability to shoot full HD (1080P) video. This was the first Canon DSLR with this feature, which opened up new possibilities for photographers to capture video as well as stills. This made the camera popular not only among photographers but also among videographers, filmmakers, and other content creators. The Canon 5D Mark II also featured an enhanced auto-focus system with 9 AF points, including one central cross-type point, providing faster and more accurate focusing. Additionally, it had a slightly larger 3.0-inch LCD monitor with 920,000 dots, an improvement over the original 5D's 2.5-inch screen. The camera also supported Live View shooting, allowing users to compose photos and videos using the LCD screen rather than the optical viewfinder. The camera was well-received by critics and users alike for its excellent image quality, video capabilities, and overall performance. The Canon 5D Mark II became a milestone in the photography world, inspiring various other manufacturers to pursue the integration of professional video capabilities into their DSLR cameras. Its success spurred Canon to continue updating the series, with the 5D Mark III released in March 2012 and the 5D Mark IV in September 2016."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your husband should not ignore his mental illness by refusing to accept it or getting treatment. You should not ignore it and pretend that your husband is okay. This can lead to problems later. If you have to, grieve for the fact that your husband has bipolar. Grieving may be part of the acceptance and coping process. Dealing with a bipolar husband can be difficult, so give your time to adjust to the new challenge in your life. Though you may have to make adjustments and sacrifices because your husband has bipolar, that does not mean that your life should be only about your husband. You should not live for him. You should be your own person, with your own interests and your own life. Pursue hobbies, your career, and personal goals. Don’t sacrifice yourself. Remember that you are a human being who deserves a good life. You deserve to take care of yourself in addition to your husband. Having your life revolve only around your husband can cause a lot of problems for both of you. When your husband deals with bipolar disorder, you may feel uncomfortable reaching out for support because you are afraid you and your husband will be judged. However, you should seek support from trusted family members or friends. Finding people you trust can help relieve the burden on both of your shoulders. If you don’t want to turn to people you know, you can try to find a support group in your community. This can provide a safe space for you to talk about being married to a bipolar husband without the fear of any negative response.

Your husband has something called bipolar disorder, which can make it hard to know how to help him. It's important for both of you to accept it and find help. Sometimes we might feel sad about this, and that's okay. You also need to remember to take care of yourself and do things you enjoy.

Question: Why might someone purposefully be going into trance? Options: A. meditation B. nothing C. confused D. epilepsy E. meditate Answer:","completion":"Option A. Meditation is the most in line with common sense as to why someone might purposely be going into a trance. Meditation is an ancient practice that has been utilized for thousands of years, across different cultures and traditions. Its primary purpose is to promote relaxation, focus, self-awareness, and create a sense of inner peace and balance. Meditation can be done in various forms, such as mindfulness, concentration meditation, transcendental meditation, or guided meditation, among others. All these methods involve deliberate efforts to focus the mind and enter a state of deep relaxation or contemplation. When one meditates, they often enter a trance-like state, where they are more focused, relaxed, and detached from the external environment and internal mental chatter. Entering such a state intentionally has various benefits, which may include: 1. Reduced stress and anxiety: By focusing on the present moment and promoting relaxation, meditation can help relieve people of stress and anxiety. 2. Improved concentration and focus: Training the mind during meditation can enhance one's ability to concentrate and maintain focus on tasks. 3. Emotional regulation and self-awareness: Meditation enables individuals to better understand their thoughts, emotions, and reactions, making it easier to manage their feelings and respond to situations in a calm and balanced manner. 4. Health benefits: When practiced routinely, meditation has been shown to lower blood pressure, boost immune function, and improve overall wellness. 5. Spiritual growth: For many, meditation is not only a means for relaxation but also a way to connect with their spiritual selves, explore existential questions, or grow closer to a higher power. These are some of the reasons why someone might purposefully enter a trance through practices like meditation. Although options B, C, and D involve different states of mind or situations, they are not in line with common sense as to why someone would intentionally go into a trance.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person whose illness led to his death?, using the article: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's..., what would be the answer ?

This period was a tumultuous time in Iran's history and shaped its future political landscape. The British withdrawal marked the end of a significant foreign military presence in Western Iran, returning the territories back to Iranian control under the Qajar Dynasty.

Context: SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program.

From the moment Julie Andrews ran through the Austrian countryside, arms stretched wide and declaring that the \\"hills are alive with the sound of music\\", millions fell in love. The heartwarming love story of singing nun meets handsome captain, told through a host of chirpy, addictive songs has both an enthusiastic fan following and widespread family appeal. But what is it that the fans love so much? Musical theatre superfan Keith Milward, from Swansea, says it's that tale of romance that got him hook, line and sinker. \\"It's such a great story. It has just got everything you want and even across the generations people have always responded to the loveliness of it.\\" The seemingly innocent and wholesome plotline sees young nun Maria sent out of her convent to be the governess of the seven cute von Trapp children. A few Do-Re-Mis later and Maria and the children's navy captain father, played by Christopher Plummer, have fallen in love. But then they have to flee the Nazis during the annexation of Austria. So far, so gloriously far-fetched, you might think. But actually the story was based on the memoir of the real-life Maria von Trapp. Published in 1949, the book was later turned into a stage musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein before the film came along in 1965. You would think even the hardest of souls would be softened by such a hefty dose of syrupy sentimentality but reviews at the time were lukewarm. Critics were keen to point out the historical inaccuracies of the film, claiming it glossed over Austria's role in World War Two. One eminent critic, Pauline Kael, condemned it as a \\"sugar-coated lie that people seem to want to eat\\". Source: IMDB / Official Charts But current film critic Richard Fitzwilliam says audiences completely disagreed. \\"There was just something so romantic about it. Musical films were really taking off and people liked seeing them on the wide-screen. It was completely different to the swords and sandals epics that were also popular at the time but it was just pure escapism. It was also perfect for families to watch together. \\"Some said it was too schmaltzy and sentimental but it was hugely successful.\\" So while the film might score few points for factual accuracy, it's not the nuances of the plotline that has kept fans entertained for over five decades. It's the songs. The Sound of Music soundtrack album was the UK's best-selling LP, not just in 1965, but in 1966 and 1968. \\"They are just so infuriatingly hummable,\\" Richard Fitzwilliam says. \\"Just talking about the film, I can hear the songs like the Lonely Goatherd, Sixteen Going on Seventeen and I'm tapping along and mumbling the lyrics.\\" \\"It's like a test,\\" Keith Milward says. \\"You can say to anyone in the street 'Do a deer, a female deer' and they'd know the tune and respond with the next line. \\"Even the most cynical will be swayed once they hear the music. I saw a touring production of it at the Swansea Grand just a couple of weeks ago and everyone was singing along. \\"The BBC even said that, should the end of the world be on its way, they would play the Sound of Music, so they must have thought it would brighten even the darkest of days.\\" And it seems that might be true... to some extent. It is believed that, at the height of Cold War paranoia, the film was selected by TV executives to be broadcast as part of a series of recorded programming in the event of a nuclear strike. In 2006, the master of the musicals, Lord Lloyd-Webber, brought the story right back into the popularity stakes with a TV contest to find an undiscovered performer to play Maria in a new West End production. Meanwhile, a sing-a-long version of the film still attracts hundreds of people every month. At the Prince Charles Cinema in London, fans turn up dressed as nuns and von Trapp children ready to sing their hearts out. Many fans hope the original film won't be subjected to a Hollywood remake. \\"It shouldn't be touched,\\" Fitzwilliam says. \\"There are so many enduring memories that come with it and the original is still so good.\\" So good indeed that last year to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the cult classic, Lady Gaga took to the stage at the Oscar's to belt out a Sound of Music medley. For those still not convinced, you may be pleased to hear that actor Christopher Plummer was for many years unimpressed by the film that he became well-known for, famously referring to it as the \\"Sound of Mucus\\". But despite his misgivings, even he can understand its enduring appeal. Last year he told Vanity Fair magazine: \\"As cynical as I always was about The Sound of Music, I do respect that it is a bit of relief from all the gunfire and car chases you see these days. \\"It's sort of wonderfully, old-fashionedly universal. It's got the bad guys and the Alps; it's got Julie and sentiment in bucketloads. Our director, dear old Bob Wise, did keep it from falling over the edge into a sea of treacle.\\" This article was about:","completion":"The enduring appeal of the musical movie, \\"The Sound of Music.\\" The film, released in 1965, follows the heart-warming love story of a singing nun, Maria, who becomes the governess of seven children and ultimately falls in love with their father, Captain von Trapp. While the plot itself is based on the memoir of the real-life Maria von Trapp, it is the film's music, written by Rodgers and Hammerstein, that has embedded itself in popular culture. Despite criticisms at the time of its release for being historically inaccurate and overly sentimental, the allure of the movie has been tied to its romantic narrative and the catchy, addictive songs. The soundtrack album was the UK's best-selling LP in 1965, 1966, and 1968. Fans have continued to celebrate and enjoy the film over the past five decades, attending sing-along versions of the screenings, dressing up as the characters, and maintaining its preservation against potential Hollywood remakes. Notable figures like Keith Milward, Richard Fitzwilliam, and even Lord Lloyd-Webber have expressed their love for the film, citing its perfect mix of romance, musical appeal, and escapism. Even actor Christopher Plummer, famous for his role as Captain von Trapp and known for his own criticisms of the film, recognized its enduring appeal due to its contrast from more violent contemporary cinematic offerings, providing relief with its old-fashioned universality, heartwarming sentiment, and of course, memorable songs."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Fact 1: Threatening behavior causes a fight-or-flight response in animals.

I read this background article the other day: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. I am facing a new situation today: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which candidate will Mike not vote for?","completion":"Given the background information and the new situation, Mike will most likely not vote for Jessica. The steps I took to reach this conclusion are as follows: Step 1: Understand the viewpoint and priorities of Mike. Mike is an avid environmentalist and from the scenario given, we can deduce that he considers saving the planet and the animals that inhibit it a priority. Step 2: Evaluate Jessica's stance. Jessica replied to the question by suggesting that we should emit more anthropogenic gases, which is in disagreement with the concerns raised in the background article about the adverse effects of human-made greenhouse gases on the planet. Step 3: Evaluate Milly's stance. Milly suggested that the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere should be decreased. This aligns with the concerns in the background article about the harmful effect of these gases on the environment. Step 4: Compare both the stances with Mike's viewpoint, which is prioritising the planet and animal life. Jessica's viewpoint doesn't align with Mike's as she suggests increasing greenhouse gas emissions, which have been identified as harmful to the environment and wildlife. On the other hand, Milly's viewpoint aligns with that of Mike's. With all these considerations in mind, it is safe to say that Mike will not vote for Jessica as her stance on greenhouse gas emissions contradicts Mike's priorities."},{"prompt":"Build a movie plot around this: What does Ralph go shortly after his arrival ?

Along with the inheritance, Ralph learns that he is connected to a royal family in England and is now considered to be an honorary duke. Excited and eager to start the next chapter of his life, Ralph travels to England to claim his title and meet his newfound family. Upon his arrival, he discovers that the Royal Palace is in desperate need of repair and redecorating. The once-great castle has become dilapidated over the years due to dwindling funding. Seeing an opportunity to make a big splash and leave his mark on the palace, Ralph decides to combine his passion for classic rock and roll with his interior designing skills. He envisions a palace filled with jukeboxes, neon signs, and token memorabilia from the golden age of American music— the 1950s and 60s. Ralph's colorful and quirky ideas, however, clash with the stodgy, conservative members of the royal family, led by the ever-so-proper Queen Victoria III. They believe that the palace should be restored to its original, traditional glory and that Ralph's vision is a disgrace to the family's legacy. In spite of the resistance, Ralph inspires a group of passionate, creative outcasts from around the castle to help him on his quest to overhaul the Royal Palace. Together, they work tirelessly to transform the palace into a lively, groovy, and fun space. The once-dingy corridors are now adorned with neon lights, chrome trims, and autographed guitars from rock legends. It's a stark contrast to the conventional, stately appearance it once held. As the project progresses, the residents of the Palace, including the more traditional royals, begin to appreciate the magic and energy of Ralph's designs. The new décor sparks joy and laughter, allowing the palace to come alive with music, dance, and camaraderie. The climax of the movie is a grand party thrown in the newly redecorated ballroom, where the entire royal family, castle staff, and Ralph's friends all dance and sing together to the tunes from jukeboxes programmed by Ralph himself. The movie \\"Rockin' Royals\\" is a heartwarming and hilarious musical comedy that explores the themes of embracing change, celebrating individuality, and the power of human connections. Featuring plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and catchy musical numbers inspired by rock and roll classics, audiences will be enthralled and entertained throughout the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself.

Whether it's a minor misunderstanding or a major blunder, knowing how to say sorry in the appropriate manner is an essential skill. In French, there are numerous ways to express apologies, each with their unique nuance. This article will detail the rich vocabulary of apologies in French, enabling you to communicate your remorse effectively and with confidence. 1. Accepting Blame: \\"C'est ma faute.\\" When you're at fault and are willing to accept the responsibility for your actions, you can say \\"c'est ma faute,\\" which means \\"it's my fault\\" in English. By using this phrase, you demonstrate your willingness to own up to your mistake and make amends. 2. Excusing Yourself: \\"Excusez-moi.\\" When you need to excuse yourself from a situation or interrupt someone, you can use \\"excusez-moi,\\" which translates to \\"excuse me\\" in English. This polite expression will help you quickly communicate your desire to step back or to apologize for a brief inconvenience. 3. Pardoning Yourself: \\"Pardon.\\" If you wish to express your apology for a minor issue or wish to quickly excuse yourself without too much formality, you can say \\"pardon.\\" This versatile word means \\"sorry\\" or \\"pardon\\" in English and is suitable for informal situations. 4. Begging Pardon: \\"Je vous demande pardon.\\" For times when you need to convey deep contrition and want to formally acknowledge your mistake, you can use \\"je vous demande pardon,\\" which means \\"I beg your pardon.\\" This phrase is more formal and reflects your earnest desire to atone for your actions. 5. Stating Your Apology: \\"Je m'excuse.\\" To simply apologize for a mistake, use \\"je m'excuse,\\" which translates to \\"I apologize\\" in English. This phrase is suitable for both casual and formal situations and is commonly used in daily conversations. 6. Asking for Forgiveness: \\"Veuillez m'excuser.\\" When you need to ask for someone's forgiveness, you can say \\"veuillez m'excuser.\\" This phrase means \\"please forgive me\\" in English and is considered formal. It's appropriate to use when you genuinely seek forgiveness and want to emphasize your regret. 7. Sharing Your Regrets: \\"Regretter.\\" To express your regrets in French, use the verb \\"regretter.\\" In English, this translates to \\"to regret.\\" By using this verb, you can describe the depth of your remorse and emphasize your feelings of disappointment about a particular situation. 8. Feeling Sorry: \\"Plaindre.\\" If you wish to indicate that you feel sorry, the verb \\"plaindre\\" can be used. This word translates to \\"to feel sorry\\" or \\"to pity\\" in English. You can use this verb to show empathy and sympathy for someone else's misfortune. 9. Describing a Sorry Condition: \\"Pitoyable\\" or \\"Triste.\\" Sometimes, you may need to describe a situation or person as pitiful or sad. In French, this can be achieved using the adjectives \\"pitoyable\\" and \\"triste,\\" which mean \\"pitiful\\" and \\"sad,\\" respectively.

It is situated south-west of Bodmin Moor. - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around 43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century. - A conurbation is a region comprising a number of cities, large towns, and other urban areas that, through population growth and physical expansion, have merged to form one continuous urban or industrially developed area. In most cases, a conurbation is a polycentric urbanised area, in which transportation has developed to link areas to create a single urban labour market or travel to work area. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe.

The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east.

The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - Cornwall is a ceremonial county and unitary authority area of England within the United Kingdom. It is bordered to the north and west by the Celtic Sea, to the south by the English Channel, and to the east by the county of Devon, over the River Tamar.

It is in size, and dates from the Carboniferous period of geological history. It includes Brown Willy, the highest point in Cornwall, and Rough Tor, a slightly lower peak. Many of Cornwall's rivers have their sources here. It has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic era, when primitive farmers started clearing trees and farming the land. They left their megalithic monuments, hut circles and cairns, and the Bronze Age culture that followed left further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows. By medieval and modern times, nearly all the forest was gone and livestock rearing predominated. - The Tamar is a river in south west England, that forms most of the border between Devon (to the east) and Cornwall (to the west). The area is a World Heritage Site due to its historic mining activities. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor. - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A watchmaker is an artisan who makes and repairs watches. Since a majority of watches are now factory made, most modern watchmakers only repair watches. However, originally they were master craftsmen who built watches, including all their parts, by hand. Modern watchmakers, when required to repair older watches, for which replacement parts may not be available, must have fabrication skills, and can typically manufacture replacements for many of the parts found in a watch. The term clockmaker refers to an equivalent occupation specializing in clocks. - John Arnold ( born 1736 probably in Bodmin , Cornwall -- died 1799 in London ) was an English watchmaker and inventor . John Arnold was the first to design a watch that was both practical and accurate , and also brought the term \`\` Chronometer '' into use in its modern sense , meaning a precision timekeeper . His technical advances enabled the quantity production of Marine Chronometers for use on board ships from around 1782 . The basic design of these , with a few modifications unchanged until the late twentieth century . With regard to his legacy one can say that both he and Abraham - Louis Breguet largely invented the modern mechanical watch . Certainly one of his most important inventions , the Overcoil balance spring is still to be found in most mechanical wrist watches to this day . It is necessary to point out that the brand name Arnold & Son used by a Swiss watch company has absolutely no connection to the original firm founded by John Arnold . It was from around 1770 that Arnold developed the portable precision timekeeper , almost from the point where John Harrison ended his work in this field . But compared to Harrison 's complicated and expensive watch , Arnold 's basic design was simple whilst consistently accurate and mechanically reliable . Importantly , the relatively simple and conventional design of his movement facilitated its production in quantity at a reasonable price whilst also enabling easier maintenance and adjustment . But three elements were necessary for this achievement : A detached escapement , which gave minimal interference with the vibrating balance and balance spring A balance design that enabled compensation for the effect of temperature on the balance spring A method for adjusting the balance spring , so that the balance oscillates in equal time periods , even through different degrees of balance arc - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire. - A clockmaker is an artisan who makes and/or repairs clocks. Since almost all clocks are now factory-made, most modern clockmakers only repair clocks. Modern clockmakers may be employed by jewellers, antique shops, and places devoted strictly to repairing clocks and watches. Clockmakers must be able to read blueprints and instructions for numerous types of clocks and time pieces that vary from antique clocks to modern time pieces in order to fix and make clocks or watches. The trade requires fine motor coordination as clockmakers must frequently work on devices with small gears and fine machinery. - Redruth is a town and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The population of Redruth was 14,018 at the 2011 census. In the same year the population of the Camborne-Redruth urban area, which also includes Carn Brea, Illogan and several satellite villages, stood at 55,400 making it the largest conurbation in Cornwall. Redruth lies approximately at the junction of the A393 and A3047 roads, on the route of the old London to Land's End trunk road (now the A30), and is approximately west of Truro, east of St Ives, north east of Penzance and north west of Falmouth. Camborne and Redruth together form the largest urban area in Cornwall and before local government reorganisation were an urban district. - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.

Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States.

Paragraph: He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Though chopsticks are used in many Asian countries, they have their beginning in China. Chinese history says that the Chinese had chopsticks as far as the Xia Dynasty (about 4, 00 years ago). In the Spring and Autumn Period copper and iron chopsticks appeared. With the Han Dynasty lacquered chopsticks came, followed by gold and silver chopsticks still later. Today we have chopsticks made of plastics. The most expensive are made of part of tusks of elephants and hard green stone. Chopsticks tell Chinese tradition in their way. In ancient times the rich used hard green stone or gold chop-sticks to show their wealth . In history many kings used silver chopsticks to take their food to see if it was poisonous . It was said that if it was, the silver chopsticks would turn colour. Chopsticks are traditionally given to a daughter when she marries to show that they should have a son very soon, for \\"Chopsticks\\" in Chinese is pronounced like \\"quick a son\\"! Tianzhu chopsticks from Hangzhou, wooden chopsticks from Shanyang of Shanxi Province, and Beijing's chopsticks are well-known. Many westerners, businessmen, tourists put aside their knives and forks in favour of chopsticks in China. Chopsticks appeared in the old Chinese story: an old man teaches his sons a lesson by showing how he could easily break a single chopstick but not a number of them. In China, chopsticks are connected with good luck. So on the country's New Year's Eve many families will lay out new chopsticks at dinners as a way of making requests for luck.

Subject: \\"We\\" -- This is the pronoun referring to the speaker and other individuals involved in the action. Verb: \\"made\\" -- This is the past tense of the verb \\"to make,\\" indicating that the action has already been carried out. Object: \\"enough pudding\\" -- This phrase specifies what was made—the quantity of pudding is described as being sufficient. Additional Information: \\"to last for days\\" -- This part of the sentence provides more context about the amount of pudding made, emphasizing that it was enough to cover several days. 2. Grammar: Grammar encompasses the rules pertaining to the structure and formation of sentences within a language. This sentence follows standard English grammar rules: - The subject and verb agree in number (both are singular). - The verb tense is consistent (past tense is used throughout). - The word \\"enough\\" is used appropriately as an adverb to quantify \\"pudding,\\" highlighting its sufficiency. - The prepositional phrase \\"to last for days\\" is used correctly to provide additional information about the amount of pudding. 3. Clarity of meaning: This sentence provides a clear and easily understandable meaning. It conveys that the speaker and possibly others involved in the action have prepared a large quantity of pudding, estimated to be sufficient for consumption over several days. In conclusion, the sentence \\"We made enough pudding to last for days\\" would be rated as linguistically acceptable by a linguist, as it adheres to syntax and grammar rules while conveying a clear meaning about the action, object, and duration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Miraculin is a natural sugar substitute , a glycoprotein extracted from the fruit of Synsepalum dulcificum . The berry , also known as the miracle fruit , was first documented by explorer Chevalier des Marchais , who searched for many different fruits during a 1725 excursion to its native West Africa . Miraculin itself is not sweet . However , after the taste buds are exposed to miraculin ( which binds to sweet receptors on the tongue ) , acidic foods which are ordinarily sour ( such as citrus ) are perceived as sweet . This effect lasts up to an hour . The active substance , isolated by Prof. Kenzo Kurihara ( Kurihara Kenz ) , a Japanese scientist , was named miraculin after the miracle fruit when Kurihara published his work in Science in 1968 . - Reynaud Des Marchais, Chevalier des Marchais was a French cartographer and navigator who travelled extensively in the west coast of Africa, the West Indies and the northwest coast of South America between 1704 and 1727, under service to the King of France. His maps and manuscripts were published posthumously by Père J. B. Labat in Amsterdam in 1730-31. - An oligosaccharide (from the Greek \\"olígos\\", \\"a few\\", and \\"sácchar\\", \\"sugar\\") is a saccharide polymer containing a small number (typically two to ten) of simple sugars (monosaccharides). Oligosaccharides can have many functions including cell recognition and cell binding. For example, glycolipids have an important role in the immune response. - Food energy is chemical energy that animals (including humans) derive from their food and molecular oxygen through the process of cellular respiration. (Cellular respiration involves either the process of joining oxygen from air with the molecules of food (aerobic respiration) or the process of reorganizing the atoms within the molecules (anaerobic respiration).) - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. - Glycosylation (see also chemical glycosylation) is the reaction in which a carbohydrate, i.e. a glycosyl donor, is attached to a hydroxyl or other functional group of another molecule (a glycosyl acceptor). In biology glycosylation mainly refers in particular to the enzymatic process that attaches glycans to proteins, lipids, or other organic molecules. This enzymatic process produces one of the fundamental biopolymers found in cells (along with DNA, RNA, and proteins). Glycosylation is a form of co-translational and post-translational modification. Glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in membrane and secreted proteins. The majority of proteins synthesized in the rough ER undergo glycosylation. It is an enzyme-directed site-specific process, as opposed to the non-enzymatic chemical reaction of glycation. Glycosylation is also present in the cytoplasm and nucleus as the O-GlcNAc modification. Aglycosylation is a feature of engineered antibodies to bypass glycosylation. Five classes of glycans are produced: - Synsepalum dulcificum is a plant known for its berry that, when eaten, causes sour foods (such as lemons and limes) subsequently consumed to taste sweet. This effect is due to miraculin. Common names for this species and its berry include miracle fruit, miracle berry, miraculous berry, sweet berry, and in West Africa, where the species originates, agbayun, taami, asaa, and ledidi. - The lemon (\\"Citrus\\" × \\"limon\\") is a species of small evergreen tree native to Asia. - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. - Glycoproteins are proteins that contain oligosaccharide chains (glycans) covalently attached to polypeptide side-chains. The carbohydrate is attached to the protein in a cotranslational or posttranslational modification. This process is known as glycosylation. Secreted extracellular proteins are often glycosylated. - Taste, gustatory perception, or gustation is one of the five traditional senses that belongs to the gustatory system. - A sugar substitute is a food additive that provides a sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy. Some sugar substitutes are produced by nature, and others produced synthetically. Those that are not produced by nature are, in general, called artificial sweeteners. - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners. - Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste and appearance. Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. - In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized.

In 2014, the world was shocked to learn about the brutal killing of Rebecca Johnson, a young and talented healthcare professional from Australia. Working in a hospital in the Southeast Asian country, she was known for her kindness, passion, and dedication to saving lives. However, her life was cruelly cut short when she tragically became the victim of a violent crime that soon garnered international attention. The three men convicted for the heartless murder of Rebecca Johnson were sentenced to death by a judge who referred to the case as \\"one of the most heinous and cold-blooded murders\\" he had ever witnessed. While legal procedures continue in an attempt to bring justice to the fallen nurse, the possibility of clemency for the perpetrators remains a contentious issue. Peter Johnson, Rebecca's older brother, has emerged as the voice of the victim's family, articulating their unwavering stance on the matter. The Johnson family is united in their opposition to any leniency or clemency for the men responsible for their precious daughter and sister's demise. They firmly believe that forgiving and absolving the criminals would only serve to devalue not just Rebecca's life, but the lives of other potential and past victims as well. Echoing the sentiments of the bereaved loved ones, Peter Johnson asserts that it is the responsibility of the criminal justice system to ensure that its decisions reflect the gravity of such a heinous crime. As citizens who have suffered indescribable anguish, the family implores the authorities to take into consideration the impact that granting clemency would have on their unending grief, as well as on overall public safety and social order. The family's adamant opposition to clemency stems not from a desire for vengeance, but from the hope that by refusing leniency, they can contribute to deterring similar acts of violence in the future. Such a cruel and wanton taking of an innocent life ought to be met with the full weight of the law, they believe, to send a clear and unequivocal message that society will not tolerate such abhorrent acts. While the family mourns the loss of their daughter, sister, and friend, they remain steadfast in their convictions, understanding that nothing can bring Rebecca back. They also acknowledge the magnitude of this issue, especially the contentious debate surrounding the death penalty. However, their ultimate priority remains ensuring that their beloved family member's memory is honored, and her senseless death is not without consequence nor meaning. In the face of this tragic ordeal, the Johnson family's courageous stand against clemency for the individuals responsible for Rebecca's murder serves as a powerful reminder of the value that societies place on justice, accountability, and the inherent worth of human life. As the legal process unfolds, it is crucial that the voices of victims' families, such as the Johnson, are heard and considered, ensuring that the criminal justice system strives to uphold the principles of fairness, compassion, and respect to all those affected by violent crime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: How does Carol decide they should take their own lives? Title: Testament Movie plot: The Wetherly familyâhusband Tom (William Devane), wife Carol (Jane Alexander), and children Brad (Ross Harris), Mary Liz (Roxana Zal), and Scottie (Lukas Haas) -- live in the fictional suburb of Hamelin, California, within a 90-minute drive of San Francisco, where Tom works. On a routine afternoon, Carol (a stay-at-home mom and volunteer for school functions such as directing the school play) listens to an answering-machine message from Tom saying he's on his way home for dinner. Scottie watches Sesame Street on TV as Brad adjusts the TV antenna on the roof, when the show is suddenly replaced by white noise; suddenly, a San Francisco news anchor appears onscreen, saying they have lost their New York signal and there were explosions of \\"nuclear devices there in New York, and up and down the East Coast.\\" The anchorman is cut off by the Emergency Broadcast System tone with the Civil Defense Insignia being shown on the Screen, then an announcer's voice states that the White House is interrupting the program: \\"Please stand by for the President and do not use the telephone.\\" At the introduction of the President of the United States (who is never seen; only the Presidential Seal is shown on the TV), the phone rings but it goes dead along with the TV and electricity just as Carol answers it. Suddenly, the blinding flash of a nuclear detonation is then seen through the window. The family huddles on the floor in panic as the town's air-raid sirens go off; minutes later, several of their neighbors are running around on the street outside, dazed in fear and confusion. The family hopes Tom will return, but the circumstances are hard to ignore.

News article: South Africa's Wits Art Museum to Open in Johannesburg 'Totem Figure,' a 1973 wood panel by Johannesburg's Cecil Skotnes, will be on view at the Wits Art Museum. A former gas station, car dealership and dental school building are helping to transform central Johannesburg from a hotbed of crime to a hub for art. The repurposed buildings make up the Wits Art Museum, which opens Saturday as a showcase for African art. Built on the edge of the University of the Witwatersrand's campus in the South African city's bohemian Braamfontein district, the new museum has soaring glass windows and an open-air entry way. Along with Cape Town, with its South African National Gallery, and Harare, with the National Gallery of Zimbabwe, South Africa's commercial capital has had a longtime art-world presence. Its contemporary galleries are well regarded, and another museum in the city center—the Johannesburg Art Gallery, which opened in 1915—has a fine collection of modern South African artwork and lesser pieces by European masters, including Pablo Picasso and Claude Monet. The 5.4 million Wits project created 54,000 square feet of exhibition and teaching space—still modest compared with the two million square feet of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. The work was funded by the university and donors led by South Africa's Standard Bank Group Ltd., which contributed half the artworks. The gallery forecourt of the Wits Art Museum in Johannesburg. The museum bridges the traditional and modern. An initial installation by the South African visual artist Gavin Olivier uses tracking cameras, even at night, to project images onto the museum's front windows that react to the shape and movements of people within their range. \\"We want to engage people who come by when the gallery is closed, who are on the wrong side of the glass,\\" Mr. Olivier said. The museum will display rotating highlights from the university's 10,000-piece collection of African art, stretching from 16th-century Congolese pottery to contemporary works by William Kentridge, South Africa's most famous working artist and a Wits graduate. Many of the paintings reflect the political and cultural upheaval of South Africa's recent past. \\"Baggage,\\" by the Cape Town-based artist Randy Hartzenberg, is an abstract portrayal of the white-minority government's campaigns in the 1970s to force black, mixed-race and ethnically Indian South Africans into separate townships. Willem Boshoff's \\"The Purple Shall Govern\\" reproduces the lyrics from 49 anti-apartheid songs and slogans in Zulu and other indigenous languages across three large panels. English translation runs under each line in much smaller script. “Works include 16th-century Congolese pottery and paintings evoking apartheid. ” On a nearby wall hangs \\"Totem Figure,\\" a facial relief carved in wood and painted by Cecil Skotnes, who in the 1950s and 1960s presided over a Johannesburg artists' salon called Polly Street that became a training ground for many of South Africa's most influential painters and sculptors. Sculptures and cultural artifacts in the same room hark back to more traditional African forms—even as they reflect the continent's encounter with Europe as well. Carved wooden figurines from Ivory Coast and elsewhere in West Africa portray soldiers and policemen in colonial uniforms and pith helmets and even a Victorian lady, possibly a missionary's wife. \\"African art is often treated as coming from before the colonial past,\\" said senior curator Julia Charlton. \\"But this artwork reflects all those cross-references and influences.

A: Answer:","completion":"Adult herbivores in a herd surround their young primarily to provide protection for the vulnerable offspring. Living in a group offers several advantages such as increased vigilance and defense against predators, as well as social interaction and support. By surrounding the young, adult herbivores create a physical barrier that makes it more difficult for predators to attack the weaker and less experienced members of the herd.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to a corporation gives out its profits as dividends paid to whom??","completion":"A corporation distributes its profits as dividends to its shareholders. The term 'shareholder' refers to anyone who owns one or more shares in a company. These shareholders have a vested interest in the company's performance as they stand to gain or lose money based on the corporation's success or failure. They are the legal owners of the company and have invested their money into buying stocks with the hope of experiencing a return on their investment. Shares in a company represent ownership stake. When a person or an entity buys a share of stock in a company, that person or entity becomes a shareholder and thus a part-owner of that company. This ownership stake entitles them to a proportionate share of the company's profits, among other rights. The process of distributing dividends usually follows this sequence: 1. Earnings and Profits Calculation: The corporation will first determine its earnings and profits for a given financial period. 2. Board of Directors' Decision: The corporation's board of directors will then make a decision on whether to distribute these profits to shareholders and if so, how much should be distributed. This decision typically depends on a variety of factors, including the company's financial health, reinvestment needs, business plans, debt obligations, and more. 3. Announcement: Once a decision is made, the corporation will announce a dividend payout. This announcement will include information about the amount to be paid per share, the date of record (The date which determines who is entitled to receive the dividend), and the payment date. 4. Dividend Distribution: On the payment date, the corporation will distribute dividends to shareholders who are registered as the owners of the corporation's stock on the record date. The actual amount that a shareholder receives as dividends depends on the number of shares they own. If a company declares a 1 dividend and a shareholder owns 100 shares, that shareholder would receive 100. These dividends can be in the form of cash, additional shares of stock also known as stock dividends, or other property. Cash dividends are the most common, and shareholders typically need to pay taxes on the dividends they receive. It's significant to remember that not all corporations pay dividends to their shareholders. Sometimes, companies may choose to reinvest their profits back into the business in what we term retained earnings for potential growth and expansion or to fund their ongoing business operations, instead of distributing them as dividends. These are often younger or growth-oriented companies who need to reinvest their profits to continue their expansion efforts."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Made me download 4-5 times..

Laika is memorialised in the form of a statue and plaque at Star City, Russia, the Russian Cosmonaut training facility. Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect. The Monument to the Conquerors of Space, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008 at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.Although never shown, Laika is prominently mentioned in the 1985 film My Life as a Dog, in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog.

Write an article with the title: \\"Pakistan’s ‘answer to Glee’ will address homosexuality and extremism - in song, of course\\"","completion":"Title: Pakistan’s ‘Answer to Glee’ Will Address Homosexuality and Extremism - In Song, of Course Introduction In a society where certain subjects are considered taboo, it takes immense courage to address them. However, when it comes to telling stories that have the power to change minds and hearts, what better format than a song? In a groundbreaking move, a group of bold creators has come together to produce Pakistan's answer to 'Glee,' the famed American television series. This pioneering show will use songs to tackle topics like homosexuality and extremism, which are typically brushed under the carpet in the country. A Glimpse into the Show Taking inspiration from 'Glee,' a musical drama series that ran from 2009 to 2015, the Pakistani version promises to incorporate powerful performances and original songs. The storyline revolves around a group of talented but misunderstood misfits who come together to form a musical ensemble. Through triumphs and tribulations, the characters explore the complexities of sexuality, societal injustice, and radicalism in modern-day Pakistan. The creators of the Pakistani series have designed the show to speak to today's youth. By utilizing song and dance, young talents showcase their unique abilities, stimulating discussions and highlighting themes that might seem controversial. Hence, music becomes the primary vehicle in which the show drives crucial conversations while entertaining its viewers. Addressing Homosexuality The creators of the Pakistani 'Glee' wish to bring forth conversations surrounding homosexuality, a topic considered tabooin the South Asian country. By incorporating various LGBTQIA+ characters, the show aims at dismantling misconceptions and fostering empathy. The television series will share stories of acceptance, love, and self-discovery, presenting a fresh perspective on the LGBTQIA+ community's struggles in a predominantly conservative environment. Through the portrayal of numerous homosexual characters and their journeys, the show seeks to educate the masses on the unique challenges faced by the community in Pakistan. By addressing these issues through art, Pakistan's 'Glee' aims to create a safe space for viewers to discover and discuss these sensitive topics, building bridges of understanding and compassion. Tackling Extremism Apart from addressing homosexuality, the Pakistani 'Glee' will dive into the subject of extremism. The show will depict characters' struggles against radical ideologies that often result in violence and hatred. Music and drama will be used to challenge these extremist beliefs, promoting principles of unity, love, tolerance, and peace. This approach comes at a vital time, as the nation strives to reduce the prevalence of extremist perspectives. The storyline will offer alternative ways for young people to express their emotions and frustrations, spotlighting the potential for music and art to heal and transform. By presenting instances where characters confront and challenge these radical ideas, the series hopes to inspire a sense of responsibility within the viewers, particularly the youth. Expectations and Impact Given the controversial nature of the themes being addressed, it is no surprise that the creators of the Pakistani 'Glee' are preparing for potential backlash. However, they remain focused on their mission to generate conversations, dismantle prejudices, and create opportunities for dialogues around these themes. The success of the American 'Glee,' which championed important conversations surrounding sexuality, identity, and mental health, raises hopes for the Pakistani counterpart. With its fresh storyline and powerful performances, the show has the potential to make a lasting impact on the Pakistani television landscape. In conclusion, the bold approach taken by the creators of Pakistan’s answer to 'Glee' is a testament to their dedication to addressing sensitive topics through the medium of art. By using song and dance as vehicles for change, the series aims to build bridges, foster empathy, and challenge discrimination, steering the country towards a brighter future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Inzamam-ul-Haq ( pronunciation ;Punjabi, Urdu: nDmm lHq; born 3 March 1970), also known as Inzy, is a former Pakistani cricketer, and former captain. He is the leading run scorer for Pakistan in one-day internationals, and the third-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket. He was the captain of the Pakistan national cricket team from 2003-07 and is considered to be one of the best leaders in Pakistan Cricket history. Inzamam rose to fame in the semi-final of the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Inzamam made his (ODI) debut in a home series against West Indies in 1991, and made a good start to his career by scoring 20 and 60 runs in two matches against West Indies. This was followed by 48, 60, 101, and 117 runs against Sri Lanka. Handpicked by former Pakistan captain Imran Khan for the 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, 22-year-old Inzamam was relatively unheard of before the tournament. To the surprise of many he was persevered with throughout the tournament, coming in at various positions in the batting line-up, despite not being very successful early on. Yet it was his performances at the most crucial stage of the competition that made fans and summarisers take note. Inzamam rose to fame in Pakistan's dramatic semi-final against New Zealand at Auckland. With his side in a precarious position, chasing 262 against an impressive New Zealand side, he hit a fiery 60 run innings from just 37 balls to rescue his side and guide them into the final. The innings was regarded as one of the finest World Cup performances. He hit a massive six in that match which was described by David Lloyd as the shot of the tournament. Inzamam made an equally vital contribution in the final of the World Cup, scoring 42 runs off just 35 balls, helping Pakistan reach a score of 249 after a sluggish start. These innings established Inzamam's billing as a big-game player, although he was unable to replicate his World Cup success in later tournaments. Inzamam regard his best least highlighted innings of 90 not out against West Indies when Pakistan won their first ODI in the West Indies on 27 March 1993. In total, Inzamam set a record for scoring the most half centuries in One Day Internationals, 83 - though this is now surpassed by Sachin Tendulkar, Jacques Kallis and Kumar Sangakkara. He also became the second batsman to score 10,000 runs in One-day Internationals (again after Tendulkar) and was named in the ICC World XI for both Tests and One-day Internationals in the 2005 ICC Awards. In his final ODI for Pakistan, playing against Zimbabwe in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, he took three catches whilst fielding, including the last one of the match, ending his One Day career.","completion":"This text is about Inzamam-ul-Haq, also known as Inzy, a former Pakistani cricketer and former captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.

By Ed Kilgore Buried near the end of a soft-focus Mark Liebovitch piece on a visit with Ann and Mitt Romney, mainly preoccupied with determining whether the Mittster is serious about running again, is this fascinating snippet: “I was talking to one of my political advisers,” Romney continued, “and I said: ‘If I had to do this again, I’d insist that you literally had a camera on me at all times” — essentially employing his own tracker, as opposition researchers call them. “I want to be reminded that this is not off the cuff.” This, as he saw it, was what got him in trouble at that Boca Raton fund-raiser, when Romney told the crowd he was writing off the 47 percent of the electorate that supported Obama (a.k.a. “those people”; “victims” who take no “personal responsibility”). Romney told me that the statement came out wrong, because it was an attempt to placate a rambling supporter who was saying that Obama voters were essentially deadbeats. “My mistake was that I was speaking in a way that reflected back to the man,” Romney said. “If I had been able to see the camera, I would have remembered that I was talking to the whole world, not just the man.” I had never heard Romney say that he was prompted into the “47 percent” line by a ranting supporter. It was also impossible to ignore the phrase “If I had to do this again.” Liebovitch was interested in the “on-the-record-all-the-time” idea as a reflection of Romney’s “limitations as a candidate.” But I’d say it captures the central nature of Romney’s entire 2012 campaign. Throughout the primaries he was always in effect talking to some angry if not entirely coherent Republican voter or donor or media opinion-leader, and trying to “reflect back” to their POV, which Mitt did not entirely share but had to take very, very seriously. It’s an almost impossible habit to break, and at a crucial moment, he couldn’t. ||||| Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) who was the GOP vice presidential nominee in 2012 reflected on one of the more controversial moments of that race in an interview with Charlie Rose that aired on PBS Monday evening. During the discussion, Rose asked Ryan about a video that emerged showing Romney telling donors 47 percent of Americans would vote for President Barack Obama \\"no matter what\\" because they are \\"dependent on government.\\" Ryan responded that what Romney said \\"was wrong.\\" He went on to describe it as an ineffective way to articulate their economic policies. \\"What we are trying to communicate is we want to have a system so that everybody can get to where they want to get in life,\\" Ryan explained. Ryan remains a vocal supporter of Romney's and discussed this in his interview with Rose. He addressed mounting speculation Romney could mount a third White House bid in 2016 and implied he would gladly be Romney's running mate once again. \\"I'll be his bus driver if he wants me to be. Look, I think he'd be a great president,\\" said Ryan. He addressed the infamous \\"47 percent: video, which was widely seen as pivotal in the last election, during a larger discussion of what Ryan described as \\"mistakes\\" he believes he and other conservatives have made when discussing poverty. Rather than criticizing those who are \\"dependent\\" on government, Ryan argued conservatives need to clearly articulate support for \\"bottom-up pro-growth policies\\" to combat poverty that are focused on local community organizations. He contrasted this with what he described as the \\"governing philosophy that's prevailing in Washington right now,\\" which is focused on social welfare programs run by the government. Ryan, who recently wrote a book outlining his ideas to combat poverty also discussed the possibility he could run for president in 2016. He said he would make a decision \\"in the spring of 2015.\\" Ryan described the main questions he would evaluate in making his choice. \\"Family, is there somebody else that I would like and I can back,\\" Ryan said. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In a recent interview, Mitt Romney reflected on his 2012 presidential campaign, noting that if he had to do it again, he would want a camera on him at all times to help him stay aware of the broader audience.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The most successful athletes are defined by their ability to accommodate for a wide range of techniques. In a competitive environment, you can't depend on the other team to use one kind of shot. If you feel like you've mastered certain blocks but other players are still getting shots past you, it is likely you haven't taken all possible shots into account yet. Here are some common shots to look out for: A jump shot is the most common shot. To gain height, offensive players will jump in the air and throw the ball towards the net. A slam dunk is the most efficient shot in basketball. This is where an offensive player runs directly up the court, jumps up, and delivers it directly into the net. A fadeaway is an advanced shot where the offensive player will lean away from the net as he throws it in. This is done to avert the efforts of blocking players. It can be resisted by putting your arms in the predicted path of the basketball. A faked shot is where an offensive player lines up a shot but doesn't actually throw the ball. This is done for psychological reasons of tricking up the opposing team. Slam dunks are considered very risky shots, as it's difficult to get a proper block without incurring a foul call. If you do attempt to block a slam dunk, get in between the net and the other player and jump directly up, aiming your hand in the path of the ball. A fadeaway shot is where a shooting player will hop backwards as he throws the ball towards the hoop. This tactic is specifically geared to trick up a blocking player. To maximize your chances of blocking a fadeaway, jump up between the ball and the net and extend your hands towards the ball. Don't swing your arms unnecessarily around as you're blocking. This will incur a foul call. A significant part of blocking shots in basketball involves the proper use of jumping. Jumping is a muscle-based exercise, but it's not often seen as a primary workout focus for many players. Practice doing sets of vertical jumps, attempting to get as much force off the ground as you can. Next, add on to this exercise by holding barbells in each hand and jumping with them. This will increase the pressure on your legs, making them better-suited for jumping blocks when you play competitively. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is about how to be a good athlete in basketball by learning different ways to block shots from other players. The article talks about common shots like jump shots, slam dunks, fadeaways, and faked shots. It also gives tips on how to block these shots and how practicing jumping can make you better at blocking shots when playing basketball."},{"prompt":"The frenetic lifestyle that many people live today is very harmful. Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care.

On 14 January 1978, during the tour's final date at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, a disillusioned Rotten introduced the band's encore saying, \\"You'll get one number and one number only 'cause I'm a lazy bastard.\\" That one number was a Stooges cover, \\"No Fun\\". At the end of the song, Rotten, kneeling on the stage, chanted an unambiguous declaration, \\"This is no fun. No fun. This is no fun—at all. No fun.\\" As the final cymbal crash died away, Rotten addressed the audience directly—\\"Ah-ha-ha. Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? Good night\\"—before throwing down his microphone and walking offstage. He later observed, \\"I felt cheated, and I wasn't going on with it any longer; it was a ridiculous farce. Sid was completely out of his brains—just a waste of space. The whole thing was a joke at that point.... [Malcolm] wouldn't speak to me.... He would not discuss anything with me. But then he would turn around and tell Paul and Steve that the tension was all my fault because I wouldn't agree to anything.\\"On 17 January, the band split, making their ways separately to Los Angeles. McLaren, Cook and Jones prepared to fly to Rio de Janeiro for a working vacation.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose team locates a living heir? , can you please find it? When the entire British royal family is killed in a freak accident outside Buckingham Palace, Sir Cedric Willingham leads a search for any surviving heirs to whom to pass the crown. After days of researching, his team finally locates a living heir in the form of an American named Ralph Jones. Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandmother Constance had an affair with the first Duke of Warren while working as a hotel waitress when the Duke was visiting the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood. Phipps provides further proof by showing Ralph a duplicate of the ring his grandmother used to wear that the Duke had given her. Ralph is flown to London, where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. In only his second day as King, he goes to a strip club and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer, and dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy. Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and proposes to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the House of Stuart, of which he is patriarch. Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error. With this in mind, Graves bribes a cash-strapped Miranda to stir up controversy by having a public relationship with Ralph. Despite warnings by Cedric not to commit a mistake similar to that of King Edward VIII, Ralph sneaks out of the Palace to have a romantic date with Miranda at Hyde Park. The next day, Miranda returns the money to Graves, but he already has photographs of her with Ralph. In order to preserve Ralph's reputation, Miranda breaks up with him.

Tak'alik Ab'aj (; Mayan pronunciation: [takˀaˈlik aˀ'ɓaχ] (listen); Spanish: [takaˈlik aˈβax]) is a pre-Columbian archaeological site in Guatemala. It was formerly known as Abaj Takalik; its ancient name may have been Kooja. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites with both Olmec and Maya features. The site flourished in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important centre of commerce, trading with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, petroglyphs and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments.","completion":"The modern name of Kooja, as stated in the article, is Tak'alik Ab'aj. This is a pre-Columbian archaeological site located in Guatemala. It was formerly called Abaj Takalik and it is possible that its ancient name was Kooja. The site is particularly significant because it combines features of both Olmec and Maya cultures, making it one of several Mesoamerican locations possessing this unique mixture. Tak'alik Ab'aj thrived in the Preclassic and Classic periods, which span from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD. It served as an influential hub for commerce, establishing trade relations with places like Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Excavations revealed an extensive collection of sculptured monuments, making the site one of the largest of its kind on the Pacific coastal plain. Among these monuments are Olmec-style sculptures, a colossal head, petroglyphs and others, marking it as one of the locations having the highest concentration of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico. The site of Tak'alik Ab'aj not only carries historic value but also serves as an archaeological testament to the first flourishing of the Maya culture, which is presumed to have happened by around 400 BC. A Maya royal tomb and some of the earliest examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions are found here. Investigation is ongoing and the remarkable architectural monuments and persistent tradition of sculpture in various styles suggest the site held significant importance. Artifacts found on site also suggest that Tak'alik Ab'aj had contact with the distant city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and might have been conquered by it or its allies. The city had a system to participate in long-distance Maya trade routes, which, despite shifting over time, strongly connected this metropolis to a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Structurally, Tak'alik Ab'aj is a large city with four main groups of architectures spread across nine terraces. Some of these terraces are natural features while others are artificial constructions that would have required considerable investment in labor and materials. The site also featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a multitude of sculptured monuments, further underlining the cultural and historical significance of the city now known as Tak'alik Ab'aj, but possibly once called Kooja."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Osceola was named Billy Powell at birth in 1804 in the Creek village of Talisi. now known as Tallassee, Alabama, in current Elmore County. \\"The people in the town of Tallassee...were mixed-blood Native American/English/Irish/Scottish, and some were black. Billy was all of these.\\" Context: Through the 1820s and the turn of the decade, American settlers kept up pressure on the US government to remove the Seminole from Florida to make way for their desired agricultural development. In 1832, a few Seminole chiefs signed the Treaty of Payne's Landing, by which they agreed to give up their Florida lands in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory. According to legend, Osceola stabbed the treaty with his knife, although there are no contemporary reports of this. Five of the most important Seminole chiefs, including Micanopy of the Alachua Seminole, did not agree to removal. In retaliation, the US Indian agent, Wiley Thompson, declared that those chiefs were deposed from their positions. As US relations with the Seminole deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior rising to prominence, resented this ban. He felt it equated the Seminole with slaves, who were forbidden to carry arms. Thompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Osceola had a habit of barging into Thompson's office and shouting complaints at him. On one occasion Osceola quarreled with Thompson who had the warrior locked up at Fort King for a two nights until he agreed to be more respectful. In order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to sign the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers into the fort. After his humiliating imprisonment, Osceola secretly prepared vengeance against Thompson. On December 28, 1835, Osceola, with the same rifle Thompson gave him, killed Wiley Thompson. Osceola and his followers shot six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of US Army, over 100 troops, marching from Fort Brooke to Fort King, in what Americans called the Dade Massacre. These nearly simultaneous attacks began the Second Seminole War. Question: What attacks caused it? Answer:","completion":"The attacks that caused the Second Seminole War were the killing of US Indian agent Wiley Thompson and six others by Osceola and his followers outside Fort King, and the ambush and killing of over 100 US Army troops marching from Fort Brooke to Fort King, in an event known as the Dade Massacre.

Experts said it was partially a result of buy-to-let landlords looking to beat April's tax changes. When the new tax year starts, most landlords will pay a 3% surcharge on stamp duty on property purchases. In addition the CML said real wage growth, falling unemployment and competitive mortgage deals were all stimulating borrowing. \\"Lending started the year on a positive note,\\" said CML economist Mohammad Jamei. However, he said the outlook for later in the year was not so good. \\"We still only see limited upside potential going forwards, as the number of properties for sale on the market remains low and affordability pressures weigh on activity,\\" he said. Summary:","completion":"The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) reported a 21% increase in mortgage lending in January 2016 compared to January 2014. This rise is attributed to various factors, including buy-to-let landlords trying to avoid the new tax changes in April, which will introduce a 3% surcharge on stamp duty for property purchases. Furthermore, real wage growth, falling unemployment, and competitive mortgage deals have all played a role in stimulating borrowing. CML economist, Mohammad Jamei, stated that although lending began the year on a positive note, the outlook for the rest of the year might not be as promising, due to the limited number of properties on the market and the affordability pressures affecting the activity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The research team have discovered that subordinate fish voluntarily diet to avoid challenging their larger competitors.\\"In studying gobies we noticed that only the largest two individuals,a male and female,had breeding rights within the group,\\" explains Marian Wong.\\"All other group members are nonbreeding females,each being 5-10% smaller than its next largest competitor.We wanted to find out how they maintain this precise size separation.\\" The reason for the size difference was easy to see.Once a subordinate fish grows to within 5-10% of the size of its larger competitor,it causes a fight which usually ends in the smaller goby being driven away from the group.More often than not, _ is then eaten up. It appeared that the smaller fish were keeping themselves small in order to avoid challenging the boss fish.Whether they did so voluntarily,by restraining how much they ate,was not clear.The research team decided to do an experiment.They tried to fatten up some of the subordinate gobies to see what happened.To their surprise,the gobies simply refused the extra food they were offered,clearly preferring to remain small and avoid fights,over having a feast. The discovery challenges the traditional scientific view of how boss individuals keep their position in a group.Previously it was thought that large individuals simply used their weight and size to threaten their subordinates and take more of the food for themselves,so keeping their competitors small. While the habits of gobies may seem a little mysterious,Dr.Wong explains that understanding the relationships between boss and subordinate animals is important to understand how hierarchical societies remain stable. The research has proved the fact that voluntary dieting is a habit far from exclusive to humans.\\"As yet,we...

This article: Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand. contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who turned to musical journalism after a failed student career in Oxford and London?, what is it ?

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who is controlled with a voodoo doll? News anchor Barry Baron discovers that a drug smuggling ring is operating out of the building where he works, and is chased down and eventually shot dead by the drug dealers. His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka, who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring. He takes Dulcie and Jordan hostage and has Nolan drive them to safety, while Barry, Chafuka and the zombie henchmen give chase. During the course of the chase Dulcie and Jordan are rescued, and then Nolan loses control of the car, with both he and Cavanaugh being killed in the resulting crash. Chafuka turns Cavanaugh and Nolan into zombies and then takes full control of the station, with Barry continuing as lead anchor after his original personality fully returns, and Jordan quitting the police to become the station's head of security, with the zombie Nolan and his henchmen becoming security guards.

Article: Two Chinese farmers who became an overnight hit when their heart-rending version of a famous pop song appeared on the Internet took to the stage in front of thousands of fans in Shanghai last Saturday. Wang Xu, 44,and Liu Gang, 29, sang \\"In the Spring\\" alongside the song's star composer Wang Feng, in front of about 80,000 people at the Shanghai Stadium. The audience buzzed with excitement and let out deafening cheers, the moment as they were introduced on the stage and then when Liu started the first sentence of their parts of the song. The two migrant workers became stars after singing the tearjerker song during an evening drinking session in a 6-square-meter rented room in a late August evening. A friend recorded the performance on a cell phone and posted it on the Internet. \\"If someday I am dead, please bury me in the spring,\\" they sing. Wang's penetrating chorus, delivered with his eyes closed, has moved thousands to tears. Wang and Liu consider the song a true portrait of lower-class groups like themselves. \\"With no credit card, no girlfriend, or a home with hot water, but only a guitar, I am singing happily, on streets, under bridges or in wild country, though nobody pays attention to the music,\\" they sing. To support his wife and two sons, Wang came to Beijing in 2000 from the countryside and has worked as a boiler man, and street peddler, before becoming a medical warehouse keeper, with a monthly pay of around 1,500 yuan. Little is left after he pays 600 yuan for rent and buys food. Liu came to Beijing in 2002. \\"I wanted to try my luck in the big city, \\" he said. He had worked as a guard, roadside peddler, and porter, but never had a stable job. Street performing was his main income, even after he married and became a father three years ago.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. You are given a new situation: Dan likes to experiment with different food items. Today, he wants to make curds out of milk and see how it differs from plain milk. For his experiment he collected three bottles of milk, bottle A, bottle B, and bottle C. Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk. and a hint : Curds are a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins. Please answer this question : Would bottle B milk need or not need added lactic acid bacteria to produce curd?","completion":"Bottle B milk, which is pasteurized, would likely need added lactic acid bacteria to produce curd. This is because pasteurization involves heating the milk to a high temperature to eliminate unwanted bacteria and microorganisms. This process also tends to kill off the naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria present in raw milk, which are responsible for the fermentation process that leads to curdling. Therefore, to produce curd from pasteurized milk (such as bottle B milk), you would typically need to reintroduce lactic acid bacteria by adding a starter culture, like yogurt containing live cultures or a specific curdling agent, to initiate the coagulation process and form curds."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],D={key:0},E={key:1};function R(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
