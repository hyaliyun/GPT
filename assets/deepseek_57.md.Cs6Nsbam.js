Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \\"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.\\" Dave Marsh calls the performance one of \\"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\\".By January 1969, the single \\"If I Can Dream\\", written for the special, reached number 12.

Question: Given the fact that: Plug-in hybrids run for a longer time on electricity and so are less polluting than regular hybrids. Answer the question: Would a diesel powered submarine release less pollution if it were running on its diesel engine or its battery backup power?? Answer:","completion":"A diesel-powered submarine would release less pollution when running on its battery backup power as compared to running on its diesel engine. This can be explained by examining the differences between the two power sources and their potential environmental impacts. 1. Diesel Engine: When a submarine operates on its diesel engine, it burns diesel fuel to generate the necessary power. The combustion process of diesel fuel produces various pollutants, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM). These emissions contribute to air pollution, climate change, and health issues. Diesel engines are also inherently less efficient than electric motors, leading to higher fuel consumption and, consequently, increased emissions. 2. Battery Backup Power: Submarines equipped with battery backup systems store electrical energy in batteries, which is then used to power the electric motor when the diesel engine is not in use or when the submarine needs to operate silently. While running on battery power, the submarine does not produce any direct exhaust emissions since there is no combustion taking place. It is worth mentioning that the environmental impact of a battery-powered submarine depends on the source of the electricity used to charge the batteries. The electricity could come from a variety of sources, such as fossil fuels (coal, natural gas), nuclear power, or renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro). The environmental impact of these sources varies significantly, with renewables having the lowest carbon footprint. However, even when considering emissions related to electricity production, running on battery backup power generally results in lower emissions compared to using diesel engines. It is important to note that the battery production process also has an environmental impact. Battery production involves the extraction and processing of raw materials such as lithium and cobalt, which can lead to habitat destruction, water pollution, and other ecological consequences. Battery disposal and recycling also pose environmental challenges. Despite these factors, the overall emissions produced during the use of battery backup power remains lower than when operating on diesel engines. In conclusion, a diesel-powered submarine releases less pollution when running on its battery backup power compared to operating on its diesel engine. While both battery production and electricity generation have their environmental implications, the absence of direct exhaust emissions and the potential to use cleaner sources of electricity make battery backup power a less polluting option for submarines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists","completion":"To determine the sentiment of the movie review sentence, I will analyze the keywords and phrases in the sentence. 1. The sentence starts with \\"from laughing at the ridiculous dialog,\\" where \\"laughing\\" and \\"ridiculous\\" are crucial words. The word \\"ridiculous\\" is usually employed to imply something negative, and in the context of a movie review, it suggests that the dialog might not have been of high quality or failed to meet the viewer's expectations. 2. The next phrase is \\"the oh-so convenient plot twists.\\" Here, \\"oh-so convenient\\" implies something that is overly simplistic or too easy to predict. This phrase often points out flaws or clichés, suggesting a negative sentiment about the plot twists. Based on these analyses, I conclude that the sentiment of the movie review sentence is negative, as it criticizes the dialog as ridiculous and the plot twists as overly convenient. The reviewer seemingly did not find these aspects of the movie appealing or well-executed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Deadly Explosion Levels Two Apartment Buildings, At Least 9 People Unaccounted For Amid Ongoing Search Efforts Introduction: An explosion in [CITYNAME] has resulted in the death of at least three people, while nine others remain unaccounted for, according to city officials. The blast occurred on [DATE] and leveled two residential buildings, leaving rescuers facing challenges as they work tirelessly to search for victims and survivors. Step 1: Describe the incident in detail - the explosion and its effect on the buildings. On [DATE], a massive explosion took place in a residential area in [CITYNAME], destroying two apartment buildings in the process. The cause of the blast is currently unknown, with officials and emergency crews investigating the scene. The explosion was so powerful that many nearby residents and businesses felt the impact, with some reporting shattered windows and shaking floors. Step 2: Report the number of casualties, and include a personal story from a victim's family member. City officials have confirmed that at least three people were killed in the blast, with nine others still missing. A woman told CNN that her aunt was among those who lost their lives in the tragic incident. Families and loved ones are anxiously awaiting any news on the safety of those who remain unaccounted for, with emergency services working around the clock to locate and rescue survivors. Step 3: Discuss the challenges faced by search and rescue teams due to the sinkhole. The search and rescue efforts have been further complicated by a large sinkhole which opened up in front of the collapsed buildings. The unstable ground has presented a significant obstacle for emergency crews, as they must proceed cautiously to avoid further damage to the surrounding area or harm to individuals still trapped beneath the rubble. Step 4: Emphasize the ongoing efforts of emergency services. Despite the challenges posed by the sinkhole and unstable building remnants, emergency services, including firefighters, paramedics, and police, are working diligently to find those who are still missing. Crews are using specialized equipment and trained sniffer dogs to help detect signs of life amid the wreckage.

The group was active throughout the 1980s and responsible for reviving the blues, inspiring many later blues and rock musicians. Formed in Austin, Texas, by 1985 the group consisted of Vaughan, Chris Layton (drums), Tommy Shannon (bass), and eventually Reese Wynans (keyboards). While with Vaughan the band was billed Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble. The band's desire to experiment grew as they recorded Soul to Soul, beginning in March 1985. Vaughan recalled using two wah-wah pedals for \\"Say What!\\", sitting on a stool and working them separately. Parts of the album featured work by Joe Sublett, Doyle Bramhall and Reese Wynans, who was hired as the band's keyboardist. The group's cocaine use increased however, especially Vaughan's, as witnessed by Bramhall, who recalled seeing \\"mounds of cocaine on top of the organ\\". He said of Vaughan's cocaine use: \\"Where I was doing a lot, Stevie was doing five times, ten times more than I was doing.\\" Nearly 800 minutes of the studio recordings were devoted to the sessions and leaked into the collector's market. Released in September, Soul to Soul received mixed reviews from critics. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented, \\"For all of its positive attributes, Soul to Soul winds up being less than the sum of its parts, and it's hard to pinpoint an exact reason why. Perhaps it was because Vaughan was on the verge of a horrible battle with substance abuse at the time of recording or perhaps it just has that unevenness inherent in transitional albums.\\" In July 1986, the band recorded three shows in Austin and Dallas for a live album, later released as Live Alive. One month later, Vaughan learned that his father was hospitalized for an illness, and flew to his hometown of Dallas to be with his family; he died three days later from complications associated with asbestos. After attending his funeral, Vaughan immediately flew to Montreal for a performance in Jarry Park, which was reportedly the highest paying show for the band at the time. A fan recalls the Montreal concert: \\"He played for a solid two hours and never said a word to the crowd until he came back for an encore and said, 'This one's for you, daddy.' I was in the front row that night, and many times during the set he was crying while playing. I will never forget that performance.\\" During a tour of Europe a month later, Vaughan was hospitalized in Ludwigshafen for near-death dehydration from years of alcohol and substance abuse. After two weeks of treatment in London, he checked into Peachford Hospital in Atlanta and spent a month in rehabilitation, emerging fully recovered and healthy; he would often attend local Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings on tour. Vaughan rejoined with Double Trouble to tour in support of Live Alive for the next two years, visiting countries such as England, Italy, and Germany. The band also performed at the inaugural party for President George H. W. Bush in Washington, D.C. Did he play Soul to Soul?","completion":"Based on the information provided, it does not specifically mention whether Stevie Ray Vaughan played \\"Soul to Soul\\" during the concerts or tours. However, since \\"Soul to Soul\\" was an album released in September 1985 and the band continued to tour and perform through the mid-to-late 1980s, it is possible that they played songs from the \\"Soul to Soul\\" album during their concerts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It was 1:30 a.m. Monday at London's Savoy Hotel and, with autograph books and cameras, a group of brighteyed tennis fans of all ages were waiting for just a glimpse of Maria Sharapova . The 17-year-old girl defeated champion Serena Williams 6-1 6-4 in the Wimbledon final on Saturday in London to become the first Russian to win a single title at the championships. A silver lining to a depressing, rain-hit Wimbledon, she has raised heated passion. Nobody was complaining, though, for the 1.83-metre Sharapova has created a welcome wave of interest in tennis, something missing in recent years. Not even Anna Kournikova evoked such passion when she broke on to the scene. To look good on court is one thing, but Sharapova can actually play the game too. Extremely well. She proved it over 13 days at the world's most prestigious tournament. Playing tennis of the highest quality throughout, the Russian's triumph not only lifted the tournament from fits of rain-induced depression but also salvaged(;) the season for the woman's tour. Sharapova was given no easy ride in the tournament, having to beat 1999 champion Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals and twice-champion Serena Williams for the title. Neither caused her much concern. \\"I don't remember too much about the final,\\" Sharapova giggled. \\"I was in my own place.\\" She will find it increasingly hard to find any place to call her own from now on after advertisers identified her as the most marketable woman in sport.

The Confederation of African Football (CAF, ; ; ) is the administrative and controlling body for African association football. CAF represents the national football associations of Africa, runs continental, national, and club competitions, and controls the prize money, regulations and media rights to those competitions. CAF is the biggest of the six continental confederations of FIFA. Since the expansion of the number of teams at the World Cup finals to 32 in 1998, CAF has been allocated five places, though this was expanded to six for the 2010 tournament in South Africa, to include the hosts. CAF was founded on 8 February 1957 in Khartoum, Sudan, by the Egyptian, Ethiopian, South African and Sudanese FAs, following former discussions between the Egyptian, Somali, South African and Sudanese FAs earlier on 7 June 1956 at the Avenida Hotel in Lisbon, Portugal. Its first headquarters was situated in Khartoum for some months until a fire outbreak in the offices of the Sudanese Football Association when the organization moved near Cairo. Youssef Mohammad was the first General Secretary and Abdel Aziz Abdallah Salem the president. Since 2002, the administrative center has been located in 6th of October City, near Cairo. CAF currently has 56 member associations: 55 are full members, including former associate Zanzibar (admitted in March 2017), while Réunion remains an associate member (see the CAF Members and Zones section below).

Where might it be? Possible A: town, office building, patient, medical center, candy shop Why is \\"office building\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","completion":"\\"Office building\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense for this question is due to several factors. Firstly, let's look at the context provided by the question. Bobby had a toothache, and he needed to visit a dentist. The immediate reaction for humans would be to think of a dentist's clinic or an office where the dentist practices. Secondly, the given location options for the dentist's office range from typical to less conventional. Let's discuss each option in some detail: 1. Town: In general, a dentist's office could be found in a town. However, referring to a \\"town\\" does not identify a specific location within the town, which makes it less precise as an answer. It is more a general area than a particular place. 2. Office building: This answer aligns well with human common sense because dental clinics are often located in office buildings or commercial spaces. In urban settings, dentists usually have a designated office space within a commercial area, making the \\"office building\\" a suitably specific location for finding a dentist. 3. Patient: A dentist's office would not typically be located within a patient, making this answer choice illogical or nonsensical. 4. Medical center: Though it is possible to find a dental clinic in a medical center, given it is a place where various healthcare services may be offered, it may not be the first or most common location that comes to mind regarding a dental clinic. People might generally think of standalone dental offices or buildings containing other healthcare offices when thinking of a dental clinic. 5. Candy shop: A candy shop is an unconventional and unusual location for a dental clinic. Considering that candy is primarily associated with harms to dental health, a dentist office in a candy shop would seem illogical or counterintuitive. Taking the above evaluation into account, \\"office building\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense as it is a more specific and conventional location for a dental clinic compared to other options. People typically associate dental offices with commercial spaces or office buildings, so choosing this answer option makes the most sense in this context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Continue the following story. Tim needed to mount his flat screen TV on his wall but the","completion":"instructions that came with the mounting kit were not clear enough. Frustrated, he threw the instructions away and decided to give it a go on his own. Tim began by scouting for the perfect spot in his living room where he could have the best possible view of his new TV. After searching for a few minutes, he zeroed in on a spot above the fireplace. He believed he found the perfect balance between aesthetics and practicality – the heat emanating from the fireplace would not affect the TV, and it offered a great view from all the sitting positions in his living room. Pleased with himself, Tim got to work. He unpacked the mounting kit and inspected the contents, which included various screws, clamps, brackets, and a sturdy frame. Tim tried to assemble the mounting frame by connecting the pieces together, but without the instructions, he was unsure whether he was doing it right. He fumbled with the pieces for about half an hour before he finally managed to put it together – or so he thought. Next, Tim picked up his power drill to create holes for the bracket into the wall above the fireplace. He glanced back at the bracket from time to time, ensuring its alignment was correct before drilling the holes. After some precision work, he successfully mounted the bracket on the wall, securely fastening it with the provided screws. Victorious in his feat, Tim proceeded to the final step – attaching the flat screen TV to the mount. Carefully, he lifted the TV and began aligning it with the mounting frame. However, Tim encountered a problem – the frame did not fit the TV as it should. Frustration mounted within him as he realized he had assembled the mounting frame incorrectly. Begrudgingly, Tim took down the mounting frame and started over, attempting to assemble it in a way that would properly support his TV. After several failed attempts, a light bulb went off in Tim's head - he decided to search online for a tutorial video on how to assemble this particular mounting kit. With guidance from the video, he realized his mistake and correctly assembled the mounting frame. Energized and determined, he reattached the frame to the wall bracket and proceeded to mount the flat screen TV once more. Finally, success! The TV was now securely fastened to the mounting frame and perfectly positioned on his wall. The challenge of mounting the TV without clear instructions made the end result even more satisfying. Tim spent the rest of the evening testing out his new TV, browsing different channels and streaming services. The exceptional picture quality and surround sound turned his living room into a mini theater that he could enjoy every day.

Village Beta was bigger, because their inhabitants already knew about and practiced agriculture. and a hint : Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Please answer this question : Which village had a smaller food supply? Answer:","completion":"Village Alpha had a smaller food supply. Step 1: Understand the information given. - Village Alpha is from 11,000 years ago. - Village Beta is from 9,000 years ago and practiced agriculture. - Agriculture was invented about 10,000 years ago. Step 2: Identify the correlation between agriculture and food supply: - The invention of agriculture provided a bigger, more dependable food supply and allowed people to settle in villages and cities with increased birth rates.

By Lucy Osborne An A-level pupil expected to achieve top grades at Margaret Thatcher’s old school was killed on her way to class when her friend drove into a lorry. Emily Challen, 17, died almost instantly when the car she was in ploughed into the back of the stationary HGV at 40mph. Driver Aimee Culpin failed to see it because she had been looking over her right shoulder at the traffic, a court heard yesterday.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves A:","completion":"The final step of the process, after the bat hears the echoed sound and its ear folds and brain adaptations help it determine the size, shape, and position of the object, is the bat using this information for navigation, hunting, and obstacle avoidance. This entire process is known as echolocation, which is a biological sonar system employed by bats and some other animals for detecting and locating objects in their environment. In the final step, the bat's brain processes the information gleaned from the echoed sound waves and translates that into a precise mental representation of the environment. This \\"auditory map\\" allows the bat to swiftly navigate its surroundings, avoid obstacles, and locate prey with remarkable accuracy, even in complete darkness. For hunting, by identifying the size, shape, and position of an object, the bat can determine whether the object is a potential prey (like an insect) or a non-target (like a tree branch). Once the bat confirms the object to be its prey, it can use the echolocation data to estimate the distance, angle, and speed at which it needs to approach and strike the prey. It continuously emits and receives echoes during this activity to update the relative positions and movements of the target, refining its strategy accordingly. This enables the bat to be an efficient and dynamic predator in terms of both foraging and capturing prey. For navigation and obstacle avoidance, the bat continuously emits and listens to the echoes in its environment as it flies. This allows the bat to perceive obstacles, differentiate them from the prey (based on their size, shape, and position) and avoid them by adapting its flight path accordingly. This process helps the bat navigate its natural surroundings, such as dense forest or cave systems, with ease. In conclusion, the final step of the process is the bat making use of the interpreted information from the echoed sound waves, which allows it to navigate its environment, locate and identify prey, and avoid obstacles effectively. This remarkable capability, known as echolocation, is a fascinating example of biological adaptation and showcases the incredible sensory and cognitive abilities of these nocturnal creatures."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

What is the sentiment of the following review? I love KCPA. The venue is awesome for just about everything. I attend the symphony series, the chamber music series, and the ballet. I've enjoyed some of the greats in music and dance there. The staff and volunteers are cordial and efficient. I also attend the Salon series that showcases rising young talent who have earned prestigious awards. This is a fun series. The seating is limited and on the stage, up close and personal with the artist. Prior to the performance, champagne and finger foods are served. The food is exquisite. After the performance, coffee and truffles or petit fours are served. It's a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon. The Promenade shop offers an array of esoteric items ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime. Intermezzo offers some tasty sweets and savories and a yummy Jamaican coffee blend. Only complaint here is that they only have one cashier which slows things down, especially during intermissions. I do remember fondly the old Intermezzo that had an even wider array of decadent sweets to delight the palate and destroy the waistline. And then there is the Stage 5 Bar. I have sampled several of their wine offerings and can only say that I have never been able to go beyond one sip. I have abandoned further attempts with the wine and moved on to my old standby cocktail, the Black Russian. There is a young lady who frequently tends bar there who makes the best Black Russian. I've yet to try the food platters at Stage 5, although I have seen them. Meager portions. It seems, however, that they are always out of the one(s) I want. I am a contributor to KCPA and urge others to do likewise. This great venue brings in a wealth of fine entertainment one would only expect to find in big cities.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Wave energy does the work of erosion at the shore. Waves erode sediments from cliffs and shorelines. The sediment in ocean water acts like sandpaper. Over time, they erode the shore. The bigger the waves are and the more sediment they carry, the more erosion they cause ( Figure below ). Q: What type of energy causes erosion at the shore? A: A:","completion":"Wave energy is the type of energy that causes erosion at the shore. As detailed in the given paragraph, this process occurs when waves constantly impact the shorelines and cliffs. The energy from waves is transferred to the sediments, such as rocks, sand, and other particles that make up the coastal environment. These sediments, carried by the ocean water, act like sandpaper against the shorelines and cliffs. The constant motion of waves, combined with the abrasive action of the sediments, gradually wears away the landforms and causes them to erode. Erosion can result in dramatic changes to shorelines over time, creating features such as coves, arches, and sea cliffs. The magnitude of erosion caused by wave energy depends on various factors. One such factor is the size of the waves – larger waves typically carry more energy, leading to a more powerful erosional force. Additionally, the amount and type of sediment carried in the ocean water also play a significant role in the effect of wave energy on shoreline erosion. The more sediment present in the water and the coarser the sediment particles are, the more damage the waves can potentially inflict on the coastal landscape. Other factors can also influence the erosion process, including tidal patterns, storm surges, seasonal weather patterns, and human activities (such as construction along coastal areas). While erosion from wave energy is a natural process and part of the Earth's ongoing geological activity, it can also cause challenges for coastal communities, who may need to manage changes to their local shores and habitats. In summary, wave energy is the primary force responsible for causing erosion at the shore. This energy is transferred from waves to the shore's sediments, which then act as abrasive agents that gradually wear down coastal landforms over time. The size of the waves, the amount of sediment carried by the ocean water, and other environmental factors can all contribute to the overall impact of wave energy on shoreline erosion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Most were shot down by American combat air patrols, and no damage was done to the U.S. ships. A few Japanese planes survived and made their way to land bases on Luzon. During the night, Halsey had passed tactical command of TF 38 to Admiral Mitscher, who ordered the American carrier groups to launch their first strike wave, of 180 aircraft, at dawn—before the Northern Force had been located. When the search aircraft made contact at 07:10, this strike wave was orbiting ahead of the task force. At 08:00, as the attack went in, its escorting fighters destroyed Ozawa's combat air patrol of about 30 planes. The U.S. air strikes continued until the evening, by which time TF 38 had flown 527 sorties against the Northern Force, sinking Zuikaku, the light carriers Chitose and Zuihō, and the destroyer Akizuki, all with heavy loss of life. The light carrier Chiyoda and the cruiser Tama were crippled. Ozawa transferred his flag to the light cruiser Ōyodo.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. John Stevens. The richest must pay more tax, Nick Clegg said yesterday as he set out plans to raise money after the general election next year. The Liberal Democrat leader revealed his party’s manifesto would target the wealthy with measures including a reformed ‘mansion tax’. In a speech seen as the start of a fight back after the Lib Dems’ disastrous European and local election results, Mr Clegg also indicated he is prepared to borrow to build homes and boost the economy through infrastructure projects. Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg speaks at Bloomberg, central London where he announced the revival of his party's 'mansion tax' as a means to get more money out of the wealthy. Mr Clegg said the party was committed to reducing the deficit, but said he believed it should be done ‘in a fundamentally different way to the Conservatives’. He said: ‘The Tories have now ruled out asking the very wealthy to pay even just a bit more in tax to help the ongoing fiscal effort. Instead, they’ve said they’ll take billions more from the welfare budget.’ He added: ‘We’ll finish the job (of eliminating the deficit), of course we will – but we’ll finish it in a way that is fair. ‘So not just through further spending cuts, but also by asking those with the broadest shoulders to make some additional contributions too, including for instance through our banded Mansion Tax - extending new tax bands to higher value properties.’ The Lib Dems want the levy, which would be paid in addition to council tax, to be introduced for properties worth more than £2million. Nick Clegg said he was committed to ‘significantly’ reducing the national debt as a percentage of GDP every year from 2018/19 but said he would borrow to invest in projects to boost growth. He said: ‘We are prepared to put our shoulders to the wheel and use the muscle of the state - if necessary through borrowing - to rewire and revamp our infrastructure.’ Mr Clegg's wife Miriam Gonzalez, Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, and British Business Secretary Vince Cable listen as the Lib Dem leader speaks at Bloomberg's central London headquarters yesterday. Up to 300,000 new homes a year are needed to meet demand, he said, adding: ‘It’s time to put our money where our mouth is. 'We have to give people the homes they need and protect the country from another crisis - and if that means borrowing a bit when times are good and debt is falling, so be it.’ He added: ‘We are not the Tories. We don’t believe in an ever-shrinking state. We are not so ideological about making cuts that we’ll deny people the things they need. ‘We’re not so dogmatic about borrowing that we’ll jeopardise Britain’s economic health. Responsibility, yes, austerity forever, no.’ Mr Clegg admitted that a series of ‘gory’ spending decisions have left young voters who ‘dream of a better future’ questioning whether the Liberal Democrats are there for them. The ‘notorious’ decision to ditch their pledge on tuition fees and the ‘pretty gritty’ and ‘downright unappealing decisions’ the party has taken in government means they have a lot of work to do to win back younger voters, he conceded. He shrugged off questions over the future of his position as party leader insisting it would not be ‘sensible’ to put someone new at the helm. He said: ‘If I thought a year before the general election all the issues that face us could be solved magically and could float off like the morning mist by just changing personnel at the top and spending several months talking to ourselves of course I’d think. But I just think - obviously I don’t think - that is sensible for the party.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"So this person named Nick Clegg, who is the leader of a group called the Liberal Democrats in the UK, wants rich people to pay more taxes. He even has an idea for a 'mansion tax' that would make people who own very expensive houses pay more. He wants to use this money to build more houses and other stuff that's good for the country. This is different from another group called the Conservatives, who want to save money by cutting other things instead. He also talked about how his group, the Liberal Democrats, needs to do better to get young people to like them more, after he made some decisions that they didn't like very much."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Teach your children that it is okay for them to be different, and they do not have to follow the crowd. Teach them right from wrong when they are young, and they will (more often than not) be able to make their own decisions, instead of listening to or following others. Remember that your child is not an extension of yourself. Your child is an individual under your care, not a chance for you to relive your life through them. When your children get old enough to make decisions for themselves, you should encourage them to choose which extra-curricular activities they want to do or what friends they want to play with. Unless you think an activity is very dangerous, or a playmate is a very bad influence, you should let your children figure things out for themselves. A child may have an opposite disposition, such as being introverted when you are extroverted, and will not be able to fit into the pattern and style that you choose, and will make his or her own decisions instead. Don't routinely do things for your children that they can learn to do for themselves. While getting them a glass of water before bed is a nice way to make them get to sleep faster, don't do it so often that they come to expect it. If you want your child to be well-behaved, then you should model the behavior and character you hope your children will adopt and continue to live by the rules that you set. Show them by example in addition to verbal explanations. Children have a tendency to become what they see and hear unless they make a conscious and concerted effort to break the mold. You don't have to be a perfect person, but you should strive to do as you want your children to do, so you don't look hypocritical if you tell your children to be polite to others when they find you getting in a heated argument in the supermarket. It's perfectly okay to make mistakes, but you should apologize or let your child know that the behavior is not good. You can say something like, \\"Mommy didn't mean to yell at you. She was just very upset.\\" This is better than ignoring that you made a mistake, because that will show the child that he or she should model this behavior. Want to teach kids about charity? Get involved and take your kids with you to a soup kitchen or homeless shelter and help serve up meals. Explain to them why you do acts of charity so they understand why they should. Teach kids about chores by setting a schedule and having them help you out. Don't tell your child to do something, but ask for their help. The earlier they learn to help you, the longer they will be willing to. If you want your son or daughter to learn to share, set a good example and share your things with them. Respect their privacy as you would want them to respect yours; for example, if you teach your child that your room is out of boundaries to them, respect the same with their room. Allow them to feel that once they enter their room, they can know that no one will look through their drawers, or read their diary. This will teach them to honor their own space and to respect the privacy of others. If your child catches you snooping through his or her things, then it may take him or her a long time to be able to truly trust you again. Allow your child to maintain their personal space and accept that it's normal for them to sometimes keep secrets from you, especially as they get older. You can balance this by having an open door policy so that they can approach you if they need help with an issue. It's important to make sure that your children eat healthy food as much as they can, that they get plenty of exercise, and that they get enough rest every night. You should encourage positive and healthy behavior without harping on it too much or making it seem like you're forcing your children to eat or act a certain way. Be the adviser, not the dictator. Let them come to these conclusions on their own while helping them see the meaning and importance of a healthy life. One way to encourage them to exercise is to get them to play a sport early on in life, so they find a passion that is also healthy. If you start over-explaining to the child that something is unhealthy or that they shouldn't get it, they may take it the wrong way and feel like you are condemning them. Once this happens, they may no longer want to eat with you, and they may feel bad eating around you, which could make them want to sneak and hide junk food from you. When trying to enforce healthy eating habits, start it at a younger age. Giving rewards of candy to children may create a bad habit, because once they get older, some may feel they should reward themselves which can lead to obesity. While they are young, start them out with healthier snacks. Instead of chips, try goldfish (crackers), grapes, etc. The eating habits they learn as they are younger are the ones they continue to have. Emphasize on finishing their plates, and teach them to take a small portion at a time; they can always take more afterwards, but they can't put food back after it has been on their plate. If your child has questions about sex, it is important to answer their questions calmly and without embarrassment. If you don't answer their questions, this can leave them uninformed and ashamed, which can harm them later in life. Be aware of your child's age. It is recommended to teach toddlers about their anatomy and explain conception during early childhood. Teach about puberty, privacy, and maybe sexual intercourse during middle childhood (ages 5-8). Teach tweens about contraception, the pros and cons of sex, and relationships. Although teenagers are very private people, communicate to your teenager that they can approach you if they encounter something difficult or dangerous. If your child sees you having sex, stop right away and ask them to leave. Tell them that you were having sex after the fact. They probably feel as uncomfortable as you do. Never make your child feel uncomfortable or ashamed about masturbation. Contrary to some beliefs, masturbation will not harm your child in any way. If your child speaks to you about masturbation, answer them openly and try not to feel embarrassed. Don't make decisions for them all the time; they must learn how to live with the consequences from the choices they make. After all, they will have to learn to think for themselves sometime. It's best they start when you are there to help minimize the negative consequences and accentuate the positive ones. They need to learn that their own actions have consequences (good and bad). By doing so, it helps them to become good decision makers and problem solvers so that they are prepared for independence and adulthood. Life is a great teacher. Don't be too quick to rescue your child from the results of their own actions if the consequences are not overly severe. For example, cutting themselves (in a minor way) may hurt, but it's better than leaving them unaware of why sharp objects should be avoided. Know that you can't protect your children forever, and they're better off learning life's lessons sooner than later. Though it can be hard to stand back and watch your child make a mistake, this will benefit both you and your child in the long run. You shouldn't say \\"I told you so\\" when your child learns a life lesson on his own. Instead, let your child draw his own conclusions about what happened. Be there for your child when he makes a mistake, whether big or small. By not preventing every little issue but providing helpful guidance to let them work through the effects, you can help teach them problem-solving and coping skills. Throughout this process, be supportive and helpful; just don't do it for them or isolate them from the real world. Gambling, alcohol and drugs can jeopardize your child's financial security. Smoking, for example, almost always introduces health hazards to your child's environment. Second-hand smoke has been linked to several respiratory ailments in children. It could also contribute to the early death of a parent. Alcohol and drugs might also introduce health hazards or violence to your child's environment. Of course, if you enjoy having some wine or a few beers now and again, that's perfectly fine, as long as you model healthy consumption of alcohol and responsible behavior while you do it. There's a difference between wanting your child to be a responsible, mature individual and forcing your child to be perfect or to live up to your idea of what perfect should be. You shouldn't push your child to get perfect grades or to be the best player on his soccer team; instead, encourage good study habits and good sportsmanship, and let your child put in the effort that he is capable of. If you act like you only expect the best, your child will feel like he or she may never measure up, and may even rebel in the process. You don't want to be the person that your child is afraid of because he feels like he will never measure up. You want to be a cheerleader for your child, not a drill sergeant. Though you may think you have already molded and raised your child into the person he or she will become by the time your child dons his or her graduation cap, this is far from true. Your parenting will have a life-long effect on your child and you should always give your child the love and affection he needs, even if you're hundreds of miles away. While you won't always be a constant daily presence in your child's life, you should always let your children know that you care about them and that you'll be there for them, no matter what. Your children will still turn to you for advice, and will still be affected by what you say no matter what age they are. As the years go on, you can not only improve your parenting techniques, but you can start to think about how to be a good grandparent! Summary:","completion":"Teaching kids to be different and make their own decisions is important. Show them good behavior by being a good example. Help them learn to do things for themselves and respect their privacy. Teach them about healthy eating, exercise, and rest. When they ask about difficult topics like sex, answer them honestly without making them feel ashamed. Let them make decisions and learn from their own mistakes, and be there for them when they need your support. Avoid pushing them too hard to be perfect, and be a cheerleader instead of a drill sergeant.

Your task is to summarize them. If you're moving to a newly built house, say goodbye to mail delivery at your door. And if some House Republicans get their way, all door-to-door mail delivery will go away. The U.S. Postal Service is marching towards a more \\"centralized delivery,\\" where residents pick up their own mail from clusters of mail boxes located in their neighborhood. Local postmasters are sending hundreds of letters to fast-growing communities, warning that cluster boxes will be the way mail will be delivered to new developments. In the past year, the cash-strapped Postal Service has been asking companies in industrial parks and shopping malls to also adopt this form of mail delivery. But Rep. Darrell Issa, the California Republican leading the House effort to save the postal service, wants more. He has made doing away with doorstep delivery a key part of his bill, which would require everyone to get mail at a curbside box or from a cluster box. \\"A balanced approach to saving the Postal Service means allowing USPS to adapt to America's changing use of mail,\\" said Issa, who is chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Moving away from door-to-door delivery saves a lot of money. Right now, 35 million residences and businesses get mail delivered to their doorstep. It costs 353 per stop for a delivery in most American cities, taking into account such things as salaries and cost of transport. By contrast, curbside mail box delivery costs 224, while cluster boxes cost 160, according to a report from the Postal Service's Office of Inspector General. Delivering mail is the agency's largest fixed cost -- 30 billion. Ending such door deliveries would save 4.5 billion a year. That's more than the 3 billion it would have saved from ending Saturday mail service, according to government reports. Related: Los Angeles is worst for mail carrier dog bites That's why ending door delivery has drawn industry support from groups like the Greeting Card Association, which supports Saturday service. But unions say it's a bad idea to end delivery to doorsteps and will be disruptive for the elderly and disabled. \\"It's madness,\\" said Jim Sauber, chief of staff for the National Association of Letter Carriers. \\"The idea that somebody is going to walk down to their mailbox in Buffalo, New York, in the winter snow to get their mail is just crazy.\\" Yet postal officials say everything's on the table, when it comes to cost-cutting. Earlier this year, it tried to end Saturday mail delivery, but later reversed its decision. The Postal Service continues to struggle with mail volume, especially drops in first-class mail, its big revenue driver, as more Americans move to electronic billing and e-mailing. In 2012, the agency lost 16 billion. Last year, the agency twice defaulted on payments owed to the federal government to prefund retiree health care benefits totaling 11 billion. The agency has also exhausted a 15 billion line of credit from the U.S. Treasury. Ending a Congressional mandate to make large annual payments toward retiree health care benefits would help solve the agency's woes. As it awaits for help from Congress, the postal agency has been trying to do what it can on its own. One of the initiatives is pushing cluster boxes on new developments. \\"Prior to this spring, we'd work with the construction companies and they could decide if the houses would get cluster boxes or curbline delivery --- now the Postal Service makes that decision,\\" said Postal Service spokeswoman Sue Brennan. Related: Wave of federal retirees to hit government In Cranberry, Pa., the community is up in arms after getting a letter in April from the Postal Service saying cluster boxes would be going in new developments. Community leaders say they understand the boxes are cheaper but they want a better plan that takes into account safety, access and maintenance. Township leaders and the postal service are holding talks over the boxes. \\"We understand what's driving this is a cost savings,\\" said Cranberry Township Manager Jerry Andree. \\"But you can't just take a cluster box and drop it into the community without planning for its safety, use and access.\\" For now, residents already receiving door delivery will see no change, unless the route is deemed dangerous because a dog bites a mailman or Congress changes the law, said Steven Hutkins, a professor of literature at New York University, and a postal service expert. \\"The big thing will be if they get approval in legislation to make the switch for existing door delivery customers,\\" said Hutkins, who writes the blog Save the Post Office. ||||| Congressional effort to cut Postal Service losses proposing an end to door-to-door mail delivery. The Postal Service will end Saturday delivery for first class mail this summer, Postmaster General Patrick Donahue said Wednesday. (Photo: Doug Benz for USA TODAY) Story Highlights Proposal could affect up to 37 million addresses Labor-intensive door-to-door delivery costs the post office an average 353 a year per address Cluster boxes cost the agency just 160 a year First, it was doing away with Saturday delivery. Now, door-to-door service could be coming to an end. In an effort designed to cut costs at the cash-strapped agency by up to 4.5 billion a year, congressman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., is proposing that the U.S. Postal Service phase out door-to-door delivery and shift service curbside and to neighborhood cluster boxes. The proposal — due for vote by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday — would affect about 37 million residences and businesses. The Postal Service spends about 30 billion annually on mail delivery, losing 15.9 billion last year alone. It does not receive federal assistance, getting revenue from postage sales, delivery services and other products. But mail service has dropped nearly 25% from 215 billion pieces delivered in 2006 to a current volume of 160 billion, says Postal Service spokeswoman Sue Brennan. The Postmaster General's office estimates labor-intensive door-to-door delivery costs an average 353 a year. Curbside delivery averages 224; cluster boxes, just 160. The Postal Service, currently making 54 million curbside deliveries and 40 million to cluster boxes and central locations, has been moving toward collective deliveries at shopping malls, business parks and newer residential developments. \\"A balanced approach to saving the Postal Service means allowing USPS to adapt to America's changing use of mail,'' Issa said in a statement. \\"Done right, these reforms can improve the customer experience through a more efficient Postal Service.\\" Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe has been seeking flexibility in the way the Postal Service delivers mail, such as cutting Saturday delivery — which drew strong public and congressional criticism when it was proposed last year. In April, the Postal Service said it was scuttling plans to end Saturday service this summer, although ending six-day service is still eventually possible, says Ali Ahmad, communications adviser to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which Issa chairs. The National Letter Carriers Association, which opposes ending six-day delivery, is also against ending door-to-door delivery, which is says would hurt jobs and harm elderly and shut-ins who would have difficulty receiving mail. Issa's proposal would allow for free hardship exemptions and door-to-door deliveries for small, unspecified fees, Ahmad says.

When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid.

In the second sentence, \\"Rebels consolidated their grip on a troubled northeastern Congolese town Tuesday as residents identified at least 112 dead after a week of fighting,\\" the tone suggests that the consolidation of control by the rebels is a realized outcome, and the process of residents identifying the dead is highlighted. This sentence provides additional information about the residents' involvement in the aftermath. Despite the nuanced differences, both sentences emphasize the rebels' strengthened grip on the town, the timeline of events (Tuesday and a week of fighting), and the tragic outcome of at least 112 deaths. Thus, they share the same core meaning and relay similar information to the reader."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, let's do the subtraction for 22661 - 28297 - 33397. 22661 - 28297 = -5636 (because we took away a bigger number from a smaller number, the result is negative) Now, let's subtract 33397 from the result we just got: -5636 - 33397 = -39033 So now we have the equation: -39033 = -513*j + 29196 Now, we need to solve the equation for 'j'. First, let's move 29196 to the other side of the equation. To do that, we'll subtract 29196 from both sides: -39033 - 29196 = -513*j -68229 = -513*j Now, we want to find the value 'j'. To get that, we'll divide both sides by -513: -68229 / -513 = j j ≈ 133 So the answer is j ≈ 133. (It means that 'j' is very close to 133, but not exactly 133.)"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory. - 3D Monster Maze is a computer game developed from an idea by J.K.Greye and programmed by Malcolm Evans in 1981 for the Sinclair ZX81 platform with the 16 KB memory expansion. The game was initially released by J. K. Greye Software in early 1982 and re-released later the same year by Evans' own startup, New Generation Software. Rendered using low-resolution character block \\"graphics\\", it was one of the first 3D games for a home computer, and the first game incorporating typical elements of the genre that would later be termed survival horror. - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Escape is an early ZX Spectrum video game developed and released by New Generation Software in 1982 . \`\` Can you ESCAPE from the monsters ?

If \\"A man with a white jacket is playing the acoustic guitar.\\", does this mean that \\"The man is playing an electric guitar.\\"?","completion":"No, the statement \\"A man with a white jacket is playing the acoustic guitar\\" does not mean \\"The man is playing an electric guitar.\\" These two sentences refer to different kinds of guitars. To fully understand this, we need to distinguish between an acoustic guitar and an electric guitar. The fundamental difference between these two types of guitars is tied to their mechanism of sound production. An acoustic guitar is designed to produce sound primarily through acoustic means. Its sound is produced using its own resonant chamber, the soundboard. This architecture amplifies the vibrations of the strings, which the player plucks or strums, creating a fuller, rich sound. There is no need for any external amplification like amps or electricity because the guitar's design itself aids sound projection. Acoustic guitars have been around for hundreds of years and are widely used in many types of music including blues, country, classical, and folk. On the other hand, an electric guitar relies on electronic amplification to produce sound. Electric guitars have magnetic pickups installed that pick up the vibration of the strings and convert it into an electronic signal, which is then sent to an amplifier. The amplifier, upturns the signal and sends it to a speaker which outputs the sound. Hence, the sound an electric guitar produces is in fact, an amplified version of the string vibrations. This makes them suitable for diverse styles of music like rock, pop, jazz, and heavy metal. To encapsulate, the specific type of guitar that a person is playing – whether acoustic or electric – can bring about significant differences in terms of the sound produced, the required equipment, and also the playing technique. Therefore, saying a man with a white jacket is playing an acoustic guitar does not equate to saying the man is playing an electric guitar. The distinction is important because an acoustic guitar and an electric guitar are different instruments, despite both being types of guitars."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Does the sentence \\"At this time Eisenhower gave his Chance for Peace speech in which he attempted, unsuccessfully, to forestall the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What speech did Eisenhower give after Stalin died?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence does provide a valid answer to the question \\"What speech did Eisenhower give after Stalin died?\\" The Chance for Peace speech, also referred to as the \\"Atoms for Peace\\" speech, was delivered by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower on April 16, 1953. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, passed away on March 5, 1953. The chronological sequence of events aligns, making the speech an appropriate response to the question. To give more context, during the early years of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, both sides were engaged in an intense arms race, culminating in the creation and deployment of nuclear weapons. After Stalin's death, there was a brief window of opportunity to reassess the relationship between the two superpowers and potentially alleviate the tensions between them. In the Chance for Peace speech, President Eisenhower expressed his concerns about the consequences of the arms race and offered an alternative vision for the future. He advocated cooperation between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., along with other nations, on peaceful applications of nuclear energy. Eisenhower proposed that both countries pool their resources to create an international organization that would oversee peaceful nuclear development, emphasizing its potential benefits in the fields of energy, agriculture, medicine, and other areas of global importance. Unfortunately, Eisenhower's vision did not come to fruition during the time. Trust between the two superpowers remained low, and the arms race continued, leading to the development and proliferation of even more powerful nuclear weapons. However, his speech did inspire ideas later adopted by the international community, like the establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1957, which is responsible for promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. To summarize, the sentence accurately answers the question by pointing out that Eisenhower gave his Chance for Peace speech after Stalin's death. It also briefly mentions the main idea of the speech, which was an attempt to offer opportunities for peaceful cooperation between the U.S. and Soviet Union and slow down the nuclear arms race."},{"prompt":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today. The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984.

The group consists of the Corr siblings; Andrea (lead vocals, tin whistle, ukulele); Sharon (violin, vocals); Caroline (drums, percussion, piano, bodhran, vocals) and Jim (guitar, piano, keyboards, vocals). They are from Dundalk, County Louth, Ireland. The Corrs have released seven studio albums and numerous singles, which have reached Platinum in many countries, and have sold 40 million albums worldwide. Context: In 2000, The Corrs returned to mainstream success with their third album. Unlike their previous albums, In Blue moved towards mainstream pop. In Blue hit number one in its first sales week in the UK, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and debuted at No. 2 in France and Norway. It climbed to the top spot during its second week in Sweden and Spain. The Corrs worked with Alejandro Sanz on In Blue, recording \\"Una Noche (One Night)\\", a duet between Sanz and Andrea Corr; Sanz played Andrea's love interest in the music video. In return, The Corrs performed \\"Me Ire (The Hardest Day)\\" with him on his album, El Alma Al Aire. The Corrs collaborated with Robert Lange to produce a mainstream hit single, \\"Breathless\\", which reached number 20 in the Billboard Hot 100, number seven in Australia, number three in Ireland and New Zealand, and topped the charts in the UK. The album went straight to number one in the Irish Albums Chart, the third highest single-week sales in the history of the charts, behind U2's The Best of 1980-1990 and Oasis' Be Here Now. In Blue achieved Platinum sales in the US, double platinum in the UK, and 4x Platinum in Australia. During the production of the album, the Corrs' mother, Jean, died while waiting for a lung transplant. She was buried at St. Patrick's cemetery in Dundalk and Bono, Larry Mullen, Jr., Brian Kennedy and Paul Brady were among the congregation at the funeral. \\"No More Cry\\", written by Andrea and Caroline Corr for the album, was written to help their father get over his grief. In 2001, The Corrs released their first compilation album, Best of The Corrs. The album featured previously released songs and new tracks, such as the singles \\"Would You Be Happier?\\", \\"Make You Mine\\" and \\"Lifting Me\\". The album did not chart highly in Ireland but reached Platinum status in Australia. The Corrs collaborated with Josh Groban, recording Canto Alla Vita, for his eponymous debut album. When the band returned to Ireland, they hosted another live concert at Ardmore Studios, where they previously performed for the MTV's Unplugged series. Guest performers included Bono from U2 and Ronnie Wood from The Rolling Stones. During the concert, Bono joined Andrea Corr for a duet of Nancy Sinatra's \\"Summer Wine\\" and a performance of Ryan Adams' \\"When the Stars Go Blue\\". Ronnie Wood joined the band onstage to play guitar on their version of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Little Wing\\" and the Rolling Stones' \\"Ruby Tuesday\\". These performances were recorded and compiled on a live album, VH1 Presents: The Corrs, Live in Dublin, which was released in the UK. Question: what was different about this album?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The difference about the album \\"In Blue\\" by The Corrs is that it moved towards mainstream pop music, unlike their previous albums which combined pop rock with traditional Irish themes. This change in style helped them gain mainstream success, and the album reached number one in several countries.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. You are given a new situation: John was sitting at point C near a railway track. Suddenly, he heard a train coming towards him from point A with constant sound of its horn. Eventually, it reached very close to him at point B. Then the train sped by him at point C where he was sitting, reaching point D after some time. Finally, it reached even farther from him at point E. and a hint : Look at the police car in Figure below . The sound waves from its siren travel outward in all directions. Because the car is racing forward (toward the right), the sound waves get bunched up in front of the car and spread out behind it. As the car approaches the person on the right (position B), the sound waves get closer and closer together. In other words, they have a higher frequency. This makes the siren sound higher in pitch. After the car speeds by the person on the left (position A), the sound waves get more and more spread out, so they have a lower frequency. This makes the siren sound lower in pitch. A change in the frequency of sound waves, relative to a stationary listener, when the source of the sound waves is moving is called the Doppler effect . You’ve probably experienced the Doppler effect yourself. The next time a vehicle with a siren races by, listen for the change in pitch. For an online animation of the Doppler effect, go to the URL below. Please answer this question : Which point would have lower frequency, point D or point E? Answer:","completion":"Point E would have a lower frequency compared to point D. This is due to the Doppler effect, which states that when a source of sound waves is moving relative to a stationary listener, the perceived frequency of the sound waves changes. In this scenario, John sitting at point C hears the train coming towards him from point A. As the train moves past point C and travels from point D to point E, the sound waves become more spread out since the train is moving away from John. This causes the frequency of the sound waves to decrease, resulting in a lower pitch. Therefore, the frequency is lower at point E compared to point D."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who is the current dean of the Columbia Business School? Title: Inside Job Movie plot: The documentary is split into five parts. It begins by examining how Iceland was highly deregulated in 2000 and the privatization of its banks. When Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and AIG collapsed, Iceland and the rest of the world went into a global recession. Part I: How We Got Here[edit] The American financial industry was regulated from 1940 to 1980, followed by a long period of deregulation. At the end of the 1980s, a savings and loan crisis cost taxpayers about 124 billion. In the late 1990s, the financial sector had consolidated into a few giant firms. In March 2000, the Internet Stock Bubble burst because investment banks promoted Internet companies that they knew would fail, resulting in 5 trillion in investor losses. In the 1990s, derivatives became popular in the industry and added instability. Efforts to regulate derivatives were thwarted by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, backed by several key officials. In the 2000s, the industry was dominated by five investment banks (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns), two financial conglomerates (Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase), three securitized insurance companies (AIG, MBIA, AMBAC) and the three rating agencies (Moodyâs, Standard &amp; Poor's, Fitch). Investment banks bundled mortgages with other loans and debts into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which they sold to investors. Rating agencies gave many CDOs AAA ratings. Subprime loans led to predatory lending. Many home owners were given loans they could never repay. Part II: The Bubble (2001â2007)[edit] During the housing boom, the ratio of money borrowed by an investment bank versus the bank's own assets reached unprecedented levels. The credit default swap (CDS), was akin to an insurance policy. Speculators could buy CDSs to bet against CDOs they did not own. Numerous CDOs were backed by subprime mortgages. Goldman-Sachs sold more than 3 billion worth of CDOs in the first half of 2006. Goldman also bet against the low-value CDOs,... A:","completion":"Can't answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all. How long does someone need to stay on the Mediterranean diet for? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - As long as they would like - not enough information - until it gets too expensive - on occasion Answer:","completion":"As long as they would like. The Mediterranean Diet is essentially a lifestyle choice rather than a short-term diet plan. When adopting the Mediterranean Diet, individuals can choose to stay on it for as long as they would like. This diet emphasizes long-term healthy eating habits, moderation, and the consumption of nutrient-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, fish, and healthy fats like olive oil. By incorporating these foods and habits consistently, it can help to promote overall health, potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases, improving heart health, and promoting good digestion. While some people may find the Mediterranean Diet expensive due to the focus on high-quality, fresh ingredients, the potential long-term health benefits that come with following the diet can potentially offset these costs. Additionally, one could find creative ways to make the diet more affordable by purchasing in-season produce, buying grains and legumes in bulk, and reducing overall food wastage. As with any diet or lifestyle change, it is essential to recognize that every individual is different, and one's personal preferences, dietary needs, and health conditions should be taken into account when deciding to adopt the Mediterranean Diet. It is crucial always to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before making significant changes to your dietary habits."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When they took just one point from Chelsea and Manchester City in the space of a week, any title challenge from Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United was written off. Their defence was porous, their midfield void of invention and their forwards misfiring. Even David Moyes had fared better than the new Dutch boss. A winter of discontent lay in store as November beckoned. But the forecast has changed at Old Trafford. Winter, thus far, has been a season of contentment for Van Gaal. The title race, having doubled in size when Chelsea stalled and City surged, now has a third competitor. United, after six wins on the spin, have hit top speed. Wayne Rooney is mobbed by his Manchester United team-mates after opening the scoring against Liverpool. Rooney sent Liverpool goalkeeper Brad Jones the wrong way to set up United's win over their chief rivals. Louis van Gaal has transformed United in the past six weeks, in which his side have won six times. As it stands: The Premier League table on Monday. The 3-0 victory over Liverpool was not without its flaws and they did, of course, need goalkeeper David de Gea at his best. But there was an air of inevitability about their triumph; such expectancy is what has marked United as champions throughout the Premier League era. They were quicker, stronger, more hungry and clinical. There was cunning, too, exemplified by the brilliant Michael Carrick. Van Gaal, it was said, was considering Carrick for the captain’s role before he was injured in the same week as the manager’s unveiling. Armband or not, he is leading their renaissance. Six starts: six wins. His return has facilitated the realisation of this team’s potential, of which there were early-season glimpses. Now, it is there for all to see. Robin van Persie, having baffled all with his failure to produce despite the arrival of his mentor, now has four goals from four games. Without his strikes two seasons back, Sir Alex Ferguson would not have signed off with a league winner’s medal. Likewise this time around - without an on-form and on-target Van Persie, they cannot challenge. At Southampton, where United were admittedly poor, the Dutch striker had two chances and took them both. They won 2-1. That is the difference. Then there is Wayne Rooney. While Van Persie has four in four, the captain has three in that period. Having worn a frown for much of last season, he is playing with a smile, free of the pressure which had appeared to weigh so heavily amid the failings of his team-mates. Robin van Persie has scored four goals in his last four games to find his best form again at last. The return of Michael Carrick (left) has provided experience and helped inspire United's recent resurgence. David de Gea (centre) has been a rock in goal, almost single-handedly repelling Liverpool on Sunday. Even the supporting cast are now playing their part; Juan Mata, Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young are all enjoying new direction under Van Gaal. 20 Dec Aston Villa vs Man Utd. 26 Dec Man Utd vs Newcastle. 28 Dec Tottenham vs Man Utd. 1 Jan Stoke vs Man Utd. 4 Jan Accrington or Yeovil vs Man Utd (FA Cup third round) 11 Jan Man Utd v Southampton. 17 Jan QPR v Man Utd. 31 Jan Man Utd v Leicester. Fellaini, aided by Carrick, is helping to shield a backline previously left brutally exposed. They have conceded just once at Old Trafford in six hours and, in De Gea, they finally boast a goalkeeper worthy of mention alongside the likes of Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar. Monday’s Champions League draw took place minus the previously ubiquitous United. But that is no bad thing. Even better, they managed to dodge the Europa League and made an early exit from the Capital One Cup. Chelsea, meanwhile, have a League Cup quarter-final at Derby County on Wednesday, while Europe will serve as a distraction to domestic affairs when the knockout rounds resume with a tie against Paris Saint-Germain in February. Manchester City, too, are not without their worries. Sergio Aguero is sidelined until the new year, as is his replacement Edin Dzeko and skipper Vincent Kompany. Barcelona lie in wait in the Champions League and then there is Frank Lampard, match-winner again on Saturday and a player they can ill afford to lose to the MLS, where he is contracted to play in 2015. Chelsea have seen their lead at the top of the Premier League cut to just three points. Manchester City must cope without star striker Sergio Aguero until the new year due to injury. Rooney (left), Van Persie and Juan Mata celebrate the win that confirmed United among the title contenders. VIDEO 6 wins in a row, my wife is happy - Van Gaal. Before the new year, United face Aston Villa, Newcastle and Tottenham. They will be favourites to extend their winning run to nine matches, all the while quickening the pace in pursuit of the top two. It is all a far cry from the anonymity of their mid-table malaise just six weeks ago. Chelsea were as good as champions, City would take second and, as for United, they could do battle with Southampton, Swansea and West Ham for the Europa League places. They were 10th, residing only in the top half by virtue of goal difference over West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle United. They were closer to the bottom than the top. But United are motoring through the gears, the title race is on and there are three teams who can win it... Head here to Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

What is the correct answer to this question?","completion":"The sentence that describes a characteristic of offspring produced by sexual reproduction is \\"Offspring produced by sexual reproduction have genetic variation, resulting from the combination of genes from both parents.\\" Sexual reproduction is a type of reproduction that involves the fusion of two different types of specialized cells called gametes. One of these gametes is the egg from the female parent, and the other is the sperm from the male parent. This fusion, called fertilization, results in the formation of a zygote. This process involves the combination of genetic material from both parents, thereby producing offspring with genetic variation. This variation is observed because the genes from each parent may come together in innumerable ways during the formation of gametes. Moreover, during the process of meiosis, where these reproductive cells are produced, natural genetic recombination occurs which introduces additional genetic diversity. These combinations result in an offspring that is genetically unique, differing even from their parents and siblings unless they are identical twins. It's important to highlight that genetic variation plays a crucial role in the survival and adaptability of a species. The diversity within a population offers a higher chance of individuals being better suited to withstand changes in environment, diseases, or alterations in the availability of resources. If a significant change occurs in a species' environment, it may wipe out those individuals that have less favorable characteristics, while those with more favorable traits may survive and reproduce, passing on these advantageous traits to their future generations. Also essential to remember is that sexual reproduction usually also involves the processes of courtship and mating. These often complex behaviors add an additional level of selection, where traits that increase an individual's chances of mating successfully (like physical attributes or certain behaviors) might be passed on at a greater frequency. So, in summary, the most fundamental characteristic of offspring produced by sexual reproduction is the genetic variation that results from the mixing of parental genes, providing a rich source of diversity upon which natural selection can act."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: London Underground The world's first subway was built in London in 1863. At the time,the government was looking for a way to reduce traffic problems in the city of London. The poor areas of the city were so crowded with people that it was almost impossible for horse carriages to get through. The city officials were interested in trying to make it possible for workers to live outside of London and travel easily to work each day. If people had a cheap and convenient way that they could depend on to go to and from work, they would relocate their homes outside of the city. This would help ease the pressure of too many people living in the poor parts of London. From these problems,the idea of the London Underground,the first subway system,was born. The plans for building the Underground met with several problems and delays,but the fast track was finally opened in January 1863. A steam train pulled the cars along the fast underground track which was 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) long. About 30,000 people got on the subway the first day. Riders were treated to comfortable seats (standing up while the train was moving was not allowed), and pleasant decorations inside each of the cars. However, the smoke from the engine soon filled the air in the tunnels with ash and soot , as well as chemical gases. Fans had to be put in the tunnels later to keep the air clean enough for people to breathe. Even with its problems,riding in the Underground did . It carried 9 million riders in its first year.

Premise: Receipt of the invoice or bill from the supplier or vendor represents a claim against the government for the items sent or delivered per the government's purchase order. Hypothesis: Invoices and bills are never sent out. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. To understand why, let's break down and analyze the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: \\"Receipt of the invoice or bill from the supplier or vendor represents a claim against the government for the items sent or delivered per the government's purchase order.\\" The premise highlights the process of how an invoice or bill is used to make a claim against the government in the context of items sent or delivered according to a purchase order. An invoice or a bill serves as a legal document issued by a supplier or vendor to a customer (in this case, the government) as evidence for the claim. It indicates details about the items, their quantity, agreed prices, and other necessary terms. When the government receives an invoice or bill, it recognizes that the supplier or vendor requests payment for the delivered goods or services provided in accordance with the purchase order. Hypothesis: \\"Invoices and bills are never sent out.\\" The hypothesis presents an alternative scenario where invoices and bills are not sent out at all. In this case, there would be no legal document to substantiate claims for payment related to goods or services provided. Without invoices or bills being sent out, the suppliers or vendors would have no backing for their claims against the government as per their purchase orders, which would ultimately disrupt the entire procurement process. In conclusion, the hypothesis is not supported or entailed by the given premise. The premise discusses the importance of invoices and bills as necessary legal documents for the suppliers or vendors to claim payment against the government. In contrast, the hypothesis assumes a situation where invoices and bills do not exist, which would invalidate the mechanism described in the premise. These two statements do not complement or imply each other; thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of King Krishnadevaraya court jester? is inside the article: The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam. In his court were eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars (Ashtadiggajas) of the literary assembly. The most famous among them were Allasani Peddana who held the honorific Andhrakavitapitamaha (lit, \\"father of Telugu poetry\\") and Tenali Ramakrishna, the court jester who authored several notable works.

Police Detain Student Gunman After Moscow School Shooting Updated Feb. 3, 2014 12:38 p.m. ET MOSCOW--Frantic parents came to collect their children, police swarmed and walled off the premises and crowds huddled outside a pink-and-white school in the freezing cold, shivering in the aftermath of a violent shooting by a student. It's a scene all too familiar in the U.S. after tragedies such as Columbine and Sandy Hook, but until Monday such a harrowing sequence of events largely hadn't transpired in modern Russia, a country already on high security alert days before hosting its first Winter Olympic Games. Fifteen-year-old straight-A student Sergei Gordeyev stormed into Moscow's School 263 mid-day in a long women's fur coat that concealed two rifles, and proceeded to shoot his geography teacher point-blank in the chest and head before taking a classroom hostage, fellow student Lyudmila Arkhipova recalled in a Russian television interview. \\"He said he wanted to know if there is life after death,\\" Ms. Arkhipova, who was among the hostages, told Russia's LifeNews. \\"It was clear that he was really scared and was not himself.\\" She said he was also carrying a bag with extra bullets and a knife. Soon, Mr. Gordeyev's mother and grandmother began calling on his mobile phone to try to calm him down, and eventually his father showed up at the classroom and talked his son out of the situation, Ms. Arkhipova said. \\"(His father) literally saved our lives,\\" she said. In a separate interview, she said his father talked him out of killing himself. But for some inside the school it was already too late: Geography teacher Andrei Kirillov, 29, died on the spot, and Mr. Gordeyev shot also two policemen when they arrived at the scene, killing one and wounding another, Investigative Committee Spokesman Vladimir Markin said in a statement. Mr. Gordeyev has been detained and is being investigated for hostage-taking, murder and assault on law-enforcement officers, Mr. Markin added. \\"Investigators are questioning the detainee with the help of experts,\\" he said. \\"They are investigating the reasons that impelled the teenager to commit the crime. Psychological and psychiatric examinations have been ordered, and investigators will soon decide the question of restrictive measures against him.\\" High-profile school shootings are nearly unprecedented in Russia. Monday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin ordered an immediate check of safety measures at the capital's schools. The incident comes nearly a decade after a group of terrorists took a school hostage in the southern city of Beslan, leaving hundreds dead. Some officials on Monday began to blame the incident on a corrupting American influence. \\"I can barely remember something like this ever happening,\\" Valery Ryazansky, a senator in Russia's Federation Council, told the Interfax news agency. \\"We're not America, where a school shooting happens practically every day. This teenager probably got an eyeful of these American plots.\\" At a meeting with cultural officials on Monday in the Russian city of Pskov, President Vladimir Putin urged the country to better teach its young generation to understand and value theater, drama and music. \\"Maybe if we did that in the right way, the kind of tragedies like the one in Moscow today wouldn't happen,\\" he said. Mr. Putin did not elaborate on the shooting. For students at the Moscow school, the event brought unprecedented shock. Fifteen-year-old Anton Alifatov was in the middle of Russian class on the third floor when the events began unfolding two floors below. He said the students suddenly heard a pop. \\"We thought something probably had fallen,\\" Mr. Alifatov recalled. Then another teacher came into his classroom to break the news, and everyone began to evacuate into neighboring school and local government buildings, he said. Outside the school--a three-story building sandwiched between Soviet-era block apartments in a working-class part of northeast Moscow--a picture began to emerge of a tall-and-skinny top achiever who had excelled in Russia's high-pressure physics and math culture and showed few if any signs of violent behavior. \\"He's very smart, outgoing enough,\\" said 16-year-old classmate Anna Dmitrieva, who didn't go to school Monday but came to the building with her twin sister once she heard the news. \\"He didn't have a ton of friends because he studied a lot.\\" Ms. Dmitrieva described him as a tall teenager with curly brown hair who looked skinny but actually was known among his classmates for being able to do a lot of push-ups and pull-ups. She said she believed he intended to go to a top university and become a physicist. A number of students, including Ms. Dmitrieva, said he didn't seem to have any sort of known conflict with the geography teacher who was killed. She said Mr. Kirillov, was \\"great.\\" \\"I would say he was one of the best teachers in the school,\\" Ms. Dmitrieva said. Russia's Ministry of Education released a statement saying Mr. Kirillov leaves behind a wife and a young baby. \\"Students loved him, colleagues greatly respected him. Thanks to his heroism, this teacher was able to save tens of lives of children and adults,\\" the Ministry of Education said. There are signs that Mr. Gordeyev was familiar with guns. \\"He told me about how he went to a shooting range and learned how to shoot, and said that he did very well and his father brought him there,\\" Roman Klimenko, a classmate who was also among those taken hostage, said in a television interview with LifeNews. \\"He told his dad that he wanted to go shooting, to learn,\\" Mr. Klimenko said. \\"It was a normal training firing range. Where he got the weapon from (on Monday) isn't clear.\\" Mr. Gordeyev's family could not be reached for comment. —Olga Razumovskaya contributed to this article.

So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force. Story: John wanted to invent a machine. To that end, he devised an experiment in which he used three components, comp A, comp B, and comp C.

Article: Many drivers say the large digital billboards flashing ads every few seconds along Bay Area freeways are just too bright and too distracting. And they may be right. A Swedish study published in the journal Traffic Injury Prevention concludes that digital billboards hold the gazes of drivers longer than two seconds. Previous studies have shown that anything that takes a driver's eyes off the road for that length of time increases the risks of a crash. \\"This study proves what is common sense when it comes to digital billboards,\\" says Mary Tracy, president of Scenic America, a national nonprofit group that seeks to limit billboards. \\"Bright, constantly changing signs on the sides of roads are meant to attract and keep the attention of drivers, and this study confirms that this is exactly what they do.\\" The Federal Highway Administration allowed digital signs for the first time in 2007 after concluding they did not pose a significant danger. But a follow-up report is pending and could be released this year. California has no law banning the billboards, and is one of 39 states that allows them. \\"We would need to review more research, so it's too early to call for a ban,\\" says Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. \\"There is a role for digital messaging, such as conveying urgent information and other safety messages.\\" There are more than 1,800 digital billboards nationwide, more than double the number five years ago. While no data indicate an increase in accidents due to the Bay Area signs, many drivers are opposed to them. \\"Monstrosities\\" is what Merlin Dorfman of San Jose calls them, while insurance agent David Whitlock says he has found them a major distraction. \\"They're much too bright at night,\\" he says. \\"When the advertisement switches from a bright color to a darker one, your eyes cannot adjust fast enough, and you end up losing sight of the roadway.\\" Officials with sign companies could not be reached for comment, but Bryan Parker, an executive vice president for...

Natural environment: Observational research allows for the study of behavior in a natural, real-world setting, which can produce more ecologically valid results. 2. Useful for complex behaviors: Observational research can help to study complex behaviors that may be difficult to study through controlled experimental methods. 3. Studying rare events: Observational research can be a useful tool for studying rare events or behaviors that are difficult to reproduce in a controlled environment. 4. Ethical considerations: Observational research might be more ethical in situations where interventions or manipulations in experiments would be inappropriate. Disadvantages of observational research: 1. Lack of control: Observational research lacks the strong control that experimental methods offer, making causal inferences difficult to determine. 2. Potential bias: Observers may inadvertently introduce bias by influencing the subjects' behavior or interpreting the observations based on their own perspective. 3. Time-consuming: Observational research can be time-consuming, particularly when trying to obtain a large enough sample or capture rare events. 4. Ethical concerns: There can be ethical concerns when conducting observational research, especially when the subjects are unaware that they are being observed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the steam has done its work by pushing the piston and powering the train's motion, it needs to be released to make room for fresh steam to enter the cylinder. This is accomplished by a valve system, which directs the used steam out of the cylinder and into the exhaust. As the used steam exits the system, it loses pressure and cools down, turning back into water.

Options: - lakes - shore line - shallow waters - tidepools - atlantic ocean Explain why a human would choose \\"shore line\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"shore line\\" to answer the question above because of the following step-by-step reasoning: 1. Understand the context: A crab is trying to reach the ocean, and we need to determine what it must cross to achieve this goal. 2. Evaluate each option: a. Lakes: Crabs are marine creatures that primarily live in oceans, so crossing a lake wouldn't necessarily help them reach the ocean. Lakes are not always connected to the ocean. b. Shore line: This term typically refers to the area where the land meets the ocean. For a crab to enter the ocean, it would have to cross the shore line, making this option a plausible choice. c. Shallow waters: Shallow waters often are a part of the shoreline, so this option might also be considered. However, crossing shallow waters alone wouldn't necessarily guarantee that the crab reaches the ocean. d. Tidepools: Tidepools are isolated formations that occur within the intertidal zone where water gets trapped during low tide, which can contain various marine creatures, such as crabs. While some crabs may utilize tidepools temporarily, crossing these wouldn't directly lead them to the ocean. e. Atlantic Ocean: Since the question asks about a crab's journey to the ocean in general, specifying the Atlantic Ocean isn't necessary and limits the scope of the answer. 3. Choose the best option: Out of all options offered, \\"shore line\\" is the most logical choice because it accurately represents the area that a crab must cross to reach the ocean, regardless of the specific body of water it may be entering. This is why a human would choose \\"shore line\\" as the answer to the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The boyfriend and I were looking to branch out from our usual breakfast haunts but the minute we pulled up to Black Bear Diner we should have kept driving to The Farmhouse in Gilbert. One look at this place and we should have known this was not gonna be great. Black Bear Diner is pretty much a bear-themed Denny's. I ordered the \\"small portion\\" breakfast and boyfriend ordered pancakes. My small breakfast was 2 eggs, a huge portion of hashbrowns, a gigantic biscuit and bacon. There was nothing small about this breakfast. The menu said for seniors and smaller appetites. They've got some hungry seniors in Gilbert apparently. The eggs were tasteless and the bacon was meh. The hashbrowns were good though, I'll give them that. Boyfriend's pancakes were also flavorless and really thick and heavy. Nothing light and fluffy about these flapjacks.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the sentiment: 1. The reviewer starts off by sharing their intention to try a new breakfast place, but as they pull up to Black Bear Diner, they express immediate regret for not going to their preferred location instead. 2. The reviewer's description of the diner as a \\"bear-themed Denny's\\" suggests that it is not a unique or special experience. 3. The mention of the \\"small portion\\" breakfast being much larger than small and not meeting the menu expectations leads to disappointment. 4. The reviewer describes the taste of various menu items as either tasteless or mediocre, with only the hashbrowns receiving a positive remark. 5. Boyfriend's pancakes are also described negatively, being flavorless, heavy, and unfluffy. 6. The last sentences express regret for wasting their weekend breakfast and doubt they would return for lunch or dinner.

Select from the following. - no - yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: What are some causes of a small lump in my earlobe? A small lump in your earlobe can have several potential causes. Some of the most common causes include: 1. Cysts: A cyst is a fluid-filled sac that can develop in your earlobe. Cysts are usually benign, and they may sometimes need to be drained or surgically removed. 2. Sebaceous cysts: These are a type of cyst that form in sebaceous glands, which produce an oily substance called sebum. They are generally not harmful but can become inflamed or infected, in which case they might need to be treated by a doctor. 3. Acne: Pimples and blackheads can affect the earlobe area, leading to small, painful lumps. 4. Keloids: A keloid is an overgrowth of scar tissue that sometimes forms after an injury to the skin, such as a piercing. These raised, thick, and sometimes itchy lumps can be uncomfortable and difficult to treat. 5. Trauma: Injuries to the earlobe can cause inflammation, swelling, and lumps. This can sometimes result from an allergic reaction to earrings, sports injuries, or even aggressive earlobe pinching. 6. Lipoma: A lipoma is a benign tumor made of fat cells that can form in the earlobe. They are usually painless and may not require any treatment unless they grow large or become cosmetically concerning. 7. Infections: Some infections can cause swollen glands or a painful lump behind the earlobe or in the surrounding tissues. If you suspect you have an infection, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional. Question 2: Why do I have a lump in my neck? A lump in your neck can be caused by various factors. Some of the most common causes include: 1. Lymph nodes: Swollen lymph nodes, or lymphadenopathy, often cause neck lumps. Lymph nodes play an essential role in your immune system, and they can become enlarged in response to an infection or other medical conditions. 2. Cysts: As in the earlobe, cysts can also occur in the neck and cause a lump. These fluid-filled sacs can be benign but might require treatment if they become infected, inflamed, or grow large. 3. Lipoma: A lipoma is a benign fatty tumor that can occur in the neck, leading to a painless lump. They generally do not require treatment unless they become bothersome due to size or cosmetic concerns. 4. Thyroid nodules: Thyroid nodules are growths that appear in the thyroid gland located in the neck. Most thyroid nodules are harmless, but some can cause problems with thyroid hormone production, leading to symptoms. 5. Abscess: A neck abscess is a collection of pus that forms due to a bacterial infection. This can cause a painful lump in the neck that requires immediate medical attention to prevent complications. 6. Tumors: Although less common, neck lumps can sometimes be a sign of more severe conditions, such as malignant tumors. These may arise from various tissues in the neck, including the thyroid gland, lymph nodes, or salivary glands. Select from the following. - no - yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is specifically about the causes of a small lump in the earlobe, while question 2 focuses on the reasons for a lump in the neck. Although some causes may overlap (such as cysts, lipomas, or infections), there are different sets of possible reasons for lumps in these body areas, and consequently, the questions address distinct concerns."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Where could you find a person standing next to a net?

Leaders of different faiths often receive gifts as tokens of appreciation, and each one holds a special memory or significance. In this article, we explore the stories behind some of the most memorable gifts religious leaders have received over the years, delving into the heart and meaning behind these sacred offerings. Step 1: Gather Stories from Various Religious Leaders To create a diverse and inclusive article, we will gather stories from leaders of different faiths including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism. We will reach out to religious leaders to acquire their first-hand experiences, which will give the article a more authentic and personal touch. Step 2: Share the Meaning Behind Each Gift Once we have gathered stories from religious leaders, we will delve into the significance behind each gift and provide context for the reader. This could include descriptions of the gift itself, the occasion it was given, and the relationship between the giver and the receiver. Establishing the meaning behind each gift will allow the reader to better understand the importance of the gift in the context of the particular religious tradition. Example: A Buddhist monk from Thailand recalls a treasured gift he received from a local villager - a simple but beautifully crafted alms bowl.

Additionally, the generous act of the villager highlighted the bond between the spiritual and lay communities in Buddhism.

This can include the use of gifts in rituals, religious ceremonies, and as symbols of faith. By explaining the significance of gifts within each faith, readers will gain a deeper understanding of why these offerings hold such value for religious leaders. Example: In the Islamic tradition, giving gifts is seen as a way to strengthen relationships and create love between people. It's even encouraged to exchange gifts on various occasions like Eid celebrations and weddings. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is known to have said, \\"Exchange gifts, as that will lead to increasing your love for one another.\\" Step 4: Draw a Universal Message To conclude the article, we will draw upon the common threads found in the stories shared by the religious leaders. These universal themes, such as love, generosity, and the importance of community, can be used to craft a message that transcends religious borders. By highlighting these shared values, the article will aim to foster a sense of unity and understanding among people of different faiths. Example: Despite the unique cultural and theological differences between various religious traditions, the stories shared by these leaders demonstrate that at the core, all faiths encourage acts of goodwill, kindness, and generosity. Memorable gifts can serve as powerful reminders of the essential values that unite us all, from the highest spiritual authorities to each individual believer. Conclusion Through the exploration of memorable gifts shared by religious leaders from different faiths, the article aims to reveal the universal values of love, compassion, and community that pervade religious traditions. By understanding the meaning behind these gifts and the role they play in various religious practices, readers will be better equipped to appreciate and respect the bond between humanity and spirituality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1982, the band released the album Hot Space, a departure from their trademark seventies sound, this time being a mixture of rock, pop rock, dance, funk, and R&B. Most of the album was recorded in Munich during the most turbulent period in the band's history, and Taylor and May lamented the new sound, with both being very critical of the influence Mercury's personal manager Paul Prenter had on the singer. May was also scathing of Prenter, who was Mercury's manager from the early 1980s to 1984, for being dismissive of the importance of radio stations, such as the US networks, and their vital connection between the artist and the community, and for denying them access to Mercury. The band stopped touring North America after their Hot Space Tour, as their success there had waned, although they would perform on American television for the only time during the eighth season premiere of Saturday Night Live.

Former U.S. Senator Herb Kohl was the long-time owner of the team, with John Hammond as current general manager; as of April 16, 2014 a group led by billionaire hedge fund managers Wesley Edens and Marc Lasry agreed to purchase a majority interest in the team from Kohl, a sale which was approved by the owners of the NBA and its Board of Governors a month later on May 16. The team is currently valued at 675 million according to \\"Forbes\\", ranking second-to-last in the league. - The Bradley Center (known as the BMO Harris Bradley Center under sponsorship agreements) is an indoor arena located on the northwest corner of North 4th and West State Streets in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop in diameter and mounted at a height of to backboards at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, who would be the first basketball coach of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most successful programs in the game's history. - The 1988 NBA draft took place on June 28, 1988, in New York City, New York. The length was reduced from seven rounds in the previous year to three rounds. - The NBA draft is an annual event dating back to 1947 in which the thirty teams from the National Basketball Association (NBA) can draft players who are eligible and wish to join the league. These are typically college basketball players, but international players are also eligible to be drafted. College players who have finished their four-year college eligibility are automatically eligible for selection, while the underclassmen have to declare their eligibility and give up their remaining college eligibility. International players who are at least 23 years old are automatically eligible for selection, while the players younger than 22 have to declare their eligibility. Players who are not automatically eligible but have declared their eligibility are often called \\"early-entrants\\" or \\"early-entry candidates\\". The draft usually takes place at the end of June, during the NBA off-season. Since 1989, the draft has consisted of two rounds; this is much shorter than the entry drafts of the other major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, all of which run at least seven rounds. Sixty players are selected in each draft. No player may sign with the NBA until he has been eligible for at least one draft. - Alfredo William \`\` Tito '' Horford ( born January 19 , 1966 ) is a retired Dominican professional basketball player who was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2nd round ( 39th overall ) of the 1988 NBA Draft .

Q: how many layers in the earth's core? A:","completion":"A: The Earth's core is divided into two distinct layers, which are the inner core and the outer core. However, to better understand the structure of the Earth and its layers, it's crucial to dive into more detail about the overall composition. The Earth is made up of four primary layers, namely the crust, the mantle, the outer core, and the inner core. These layers vary in terms of their chemical composition, physical properties, and thickness. Let's take a closer look at each layer: 1. Crust: The Earth's crust forms the outermost layer and is composed of solid rocks and minerals. It ranges in thickness from about 5 kilometers beneath the ocean floor to approximately 70 kilometers beneath the continents. The crust is further classified into two types: the continental crust, which primarily consists of granitic rocks, and the oceanic crust, which is primarily composed of basaltic rocks. 2. Mantle: The mantle lies beneath the crust and is Earth's thickest layer, extending about 2,900 kilometers deep. Composed of solid and highly viscous silicate rocks, these rocks are denser than those found in the crust. The mantle is subdivided into two parts: the upper mantle and the lower mantle. The upper mantle, which is in contact with the crust, is relatively cooler and more rigid. In contrast, the lower mantle is hotter and exhibits plastic-like behavior due to the high temperature and pressure. 3. Outer Core: The outer core begins at a depth of around 2,900 kilometers and extends down to approximately 5,150 kilometers. Unlike the crust and mantle, the outer core is composed of mostly liquid iron and nickel, with some lighter elements such as oxygen and sulfur. The high temperatures within this layer cause the metals to remain in a molten state. The movement of the liquid outer core and Earth's rotation generate the planet's magnetic field. 4. Inner Core: Earth's inner core lies at a depth of around 5,150 kilometers and has a radius of about 1,220 kilometers. It is composed primarily of solid iron and nickel, with traces of lighter elements such as sulfur and oxygen. Despite being hotter than the outer core, the immense pressure at this depth keeps the inner core in a solid state. The solidification of the inner core is a result of pressure-induced solidification, a process in which higher pressure forces particles closer together, causing their ordered arrangement and the formation of a solid. In summary, the Earth's core has two main layers - the liquid outer core and the solid inner core. In the context of the entire Earth, there are four primary layers, including the crust and the mantle. Each layer serves a unique function and plays a vital role in shaping the properties and dynamics of our planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton in 1920? I was stationed on the Isle of Grain – a ghastly place but the first line of defence against invasion – and in our battalion of the Suffolks we had a number of professional musicians. So we formed an orchestra and played in the equivalent of the NAAFI during our spare time. I was the principal cello and we were conducted by the bandmaster, one Lieutenant Bonham. The other boys knew that I was longing to conduct and one day when Bonham fell ill with 'flu, they thought \\"old Barby\\" – as I was known – should have a go. It was really rather romantic – I was scrubbing the floor in the Officers' Mess when they came and invited me to take over. We did the Light Cavalry overture and Coleridge-Taylor's Petite Suite de Concert but I can't say I recall the rest of the programme. While in the army, Barbirolli adopted the anglicised form of his first name for the sake of simplicity: \\"The sergeant-major had great difficulty in reading my name on the roll-call. 'Who is this Guy Vanni?' he used to ask. So I chose John.\\" After demobilisation he reverted to the original form of his name, using it until 1922.On re-entering civilian life, Barbirolli resumed his career as a cellist. His association with Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto began with its première in 1919, when he played as a rank and file member of the London Symphony Orchestra. He was the soloist at another performance of the concerto just over a year later. The Musical Times commented, \\"Signor Giovanni Barbirolli was not entirely equal to the demands of the solo music, but his playing unquestionably gave a considerable amount of pleasure.\\" At the Three Choirs Festival of 1920 he took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton, in the LSO cellos. He joined two newly founded string quartets as cellist: the Kutcher Quartet, led by his former fellow student at Trinity, Samuel Kutcher, and the Music Society Quartet (later called the International Quartet) led by André Mangeot. He also made several early broadcasts with Mangeot's quartet.

A: a quitter B: promising C: steadfast A:","completion":"The answer best suited according to the text would be C: steadfast. Here's why: The context is indicating that Taylor is determined and persistent. Taylor has \\"made up his mind to get this job done\\", which suggests that he is firm in his decision and is not going to back down. This indicates a characteristic of being steadfast, which means resolutely or dutifully firm and unwavering. Now let's see why the other options were not suitable: A: a quitter - This would imply that Taylor tends to give up or quit, but there's nothing in the text indicating he's wanting or planning to stop, instead he's just getting started. B: promising - To describe someone as promising usually implies that they show signs of future success. While Taylor's determination to complete the job does hint towards this, the text doesn't provide explicit indications about his potential for success, hence this might not be the best descriptor based on the information we have.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,...

Plot title: Fargo Movie plot: In the winter of 1987, Minneapolis car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (Macy) is desperate for money; repayment is due on a large GMAC loan that he fraudulently collateralized with nonexistent dealership vehicles. Dealership mechanic Shep Proudfoot (Steve Reevis), an ex-convict, refers him to an old partner in crime, Gaear Grimsrud (Stormare). Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota, where he hires Gaear and Carl Showalter (Buscemi) to kidnap his wife, Jean (Kristin RudrÃ¼d), and extort a ransom from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, Wade Gustafson (Presnell). He gives the men a new car from his dealership's lot, and promises to split the 80,000 ransom with them. Back in Minneapolis, Jerry pitches Gustafson a lucrative real estate deal; when Gustafson agrees to front the money, Jerry attempts to call off the kidnapping, but it is already in motion. Then, he learns that Gustafson plans to make the deal himself, leaving Jerry a paltry finder's fee. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean in Minneapolis as planned. While transporting her to their remote cabin hideout, a state trooper pulls them over outside Brainerd, Minnesota for driving without the required temporary tags over the dealership plates. After Carl tries and fails to bribe the trooper, Gaear kills him. When two passing eyewitnesses spot Carl disposing of the body, Gaear kills them as well. The following morning, Brainerd police chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand), who is seven months pregnant, initiates a homicide investigation. Records from the murdered trooper's last traffic stop, along with a phone call to Proudfoot, placed at a local truck stop by two suspicious men, lead her to Jerry's dealership, where she questions Jerry and Proudfoot. While in Minneapolis, Marge reconnects with Mike Yanagita (Steve Park), an old classmate who takes her to dinner, tells her that his wife, another classmate, has died, and attempts to seduce her.

Which of the following will most likely occur?. Answer:","completion":"When cans of soft drinks at 28°C are lowered into a flowing stream containing water at 18°C, several physical phenomena will likely occur. Some of the most prominent effects include heat transfer, temperature equilibrium, and possible changes to the stream's ecosystem. 1. Heat Transfer: The predominant occurrence in this situation is the transfer of heat between the soft drink cans and the water in the stream. Since the soft drinks are at a higher temperature (28°C) compared to the water in the stream (18°C), heat will transfer from the cans to the water until both reach a state of thermal equilibrium. 2. Conduction: The transfer of heat between the two substances will occur through the process of conduction. Conduction is the exchange of thermal energy between two adjacent materials in direct contact. In this case, the soft drink cans and the water in the stream are in direct contact, allowing thermal energy to flow from the higher-temperature cans to the lower-temperature water. 3. Temperature Equilibrium: Over time, the temperature of the soft drink cans and the stream water will approach equilibrium, at which point the rate of heat transfer between the two will slow and eventually stop. The final temperature of the soft drink cans and the water will be somewhere between 18°C and 28°C, depending on the specific heat capacities of the can materials, the soft drinks, and the water, as well as the mass ratios and the initial temperature difference. 4. Convection Currents: As the heat transfers from the cans to the water, local convection currents may form due to the changes in water density with temperature. Warmer water surrounding the cans will become less dense and rise, while cooler water nearby will sink, creating a natural circulation that promotes further heat transfer. 5. Changes to Stream Ecosystem: Although this is not a direct result of the temperature change, submerging cans of soft drinks in a stream could have potential consequences on the stream's environment. If the cans were not sealed properly, the contents might leak into the water, potentially introducing contaminants that could harm plant and animal life within the stream. 6. Thermal Shock: This phenomenon is not expected to occur in this case, as both the cans and the stream's water temperatures are not extreme enough to cause rapid or severe damage to the soft drink cans or the surrounding environment. However, if the temperature difference were significant, rapid heat transfer could lead to structural damage to the cans or even a rapid temperature change in the immediate vicinity that could be harmful to aquatic life. In conclusion, when cans of soft drinks at 28°C are lowered into a stream containing water at 18°C, the most likely occurrence is heat transfer between the two until they reach temperature equilibrium. This process will happen through conduction, the direct exchange of thermal energy between substances in contact. Convection currents may form in the vicinity, promoting further heat transfer. Although unlikely, potential ecological impacts and thermal shock could also occur under specific circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Which American musician, Walt Aldridge or Kurt Cobain is still alive and performing? Answer:","completion":"Kurt Cobain was the lead singer and guitarist of the iconic American rock band, Nirvana. He was born on February 20, 1967, in Aberdeen, Washington. Unfortunately, Cobain passed away on April 5, 1994, in Seattle, at the age of 27. His death was a result of suicide, as he was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head. Consequently, he is not alive and performing today. On the other hand, Walt Aldridge is an American musician, singer-songwriter, and record producer born on November 12, 1955, in Florence, Alabama. Aldridge gained prominence within the music industry primarily as a songwriter, having written numerous successful songs for various artists such as Reba McEntire, Travis Tritt, and Ronnie Milsap. As a performer, Aldridge has been involved in various projects and collaborations, and he released his first solo album, \\"Walt Aldridge – The Corner,\\" in 2017. Given the information above, it is evident that Walt Aldridge is the American musician who is still alive and involved in the music industry. Although his primary focus has been on songwriting and record production, his solo album and various collaborations demonstrate that he continues to perform as a musician. In contrast, Kurt Cobain, an influential figure in music history, tragically passed away in 1994, so he is no longer alive and performing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What does Dreyfus suffer from? Movie title: The Pink Panther Strikes Again Movie plot: At a psychiatric hospital, former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is largely recovered from his obsession to kill the new Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) and is about to be released when Clouseau, arriving to speak on Dreyfus' behalf, drives Dreyfus insane again. Dreyfus promptly escapes from the asylum and once again tries to kill Clouseau by planting a bomb while the Inspector (by periodic arrangement) duels with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk). The bomb destroys Clouseau's apartment and injures Cato, but Clouseau himself is unharmed, being lifted from the room by an inflatable disguise. Deciding that a more elaborate plan is needed, Dreyfus enlists an army of criminals to his cause and kidnaps nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender (Richard Vernon) and the Professor's daughter Margo (Briony McRoberts), forcing the professor to build a \\"doomsday weapon\\" in return for his daughter's freedom. Clouseau travels to England to investigate Fassbender's disappearance, where he wrecks their family home and ineptly interrogates Jarvis (Michael Robbins), Fassbender's cross-dressing butler. Although Jarvis is killed by the kidnappers, to whom he had become a dangerous witness, Clouseau discovers a clue that leads him to the Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. Meanwhile, Dreyfus, using Fassbender's invention, dissolves the United Nations headquarters in New York City and blackmails the leaders of the world, including the President of the United States and his adviser (based on Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger), into assassinating Clouseau. However, many of the nations instruct their operatives to kill the other assassins to gain Dreyfus's favor and possibly the Doomsday Machine. As a result of their orders and Clouseau's habitual clumsiness, the assassins all end up killing each other until only the agents of Egypt and Russia remain. The Egyptian assassin (an uncredited cameo by Omar Sharif) shoots one of Dreyfus' henchmen, mistaking him for Clouseau, but is seduced by the Russian...

They started by playing local clubs which led to touring with Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars opening shows and providing backup for major rock artists of the period. Their name was shortened to Exile in 1973, consisting of guitarist Pennington, leader/lead singer Jimmy Stokley, Bernie Faulkner B3 sax acoustic guitar, Billy Luxon trumpet, keyboardist Buzz Cornelison, bassist Kenny Weir, and drummer Bobby Johns. The band changed musical styles throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. They shortened their name to Exile in 1973 and released their eponymous debut album through Wooden Nickel Records that same year. Singles released from the album proved unsuccessful, and it would be a good five years before the band released a full-length follow-up album. In 1977, the band released the single \\"Try it On\\" on Atco Records, and it became a minor hit. The following year, Mike Chapman, an Australian who had established himself as a record producer in the UK, came to the United States in search of an experienced group who wrote their own material. Chapman heard an Exile demo and went to their next concert. Chapman evidently enjoyed what he saw. He and Exile decided to collaborate and together they produced the Mixed Emotions album on Warner/Curb Records. The first single release from that album was Kiss You All Over. The single reached Billboard's Top 40 on 5 August 1978. It remained on the chart for seventeen weeks and was No. 1 for four weeks in September. It was a best-seller for six months. Their follow up single, \\"You Thrill Me,\\" also from the Mixed Emotions LP did not fare as well, although it did reach the Top 40 for one week on 3 February 1979. The band toured with Aerosmith, Heart, Dave Mason, Boston, Seals & Crofts and other hot pop acts of the late seventies throughout the United States, Europe and Africa. All There Is, the group's second Warner Bros. Records album, recorded a year later with a distinct disco beat, yielded a foreign hit, \\"The Part Of Me That Needs You Most.\\" This single did particularly well in Europe and South Africa. Don't Leave Me This Way, their third album, produced by Peter Coleman, yielded two more singles, \\"Take Me Down\\" and \\"Smooth Sailing.\\" Once again, it did well in Europe and South Africa although their popularity in the United States waned. Numerous personnel changes took place in 1979. Perhaps most significantly, Stokley would leave the group that year, forcing remaining members guitarist/vocalist J.P. Pennington, keyboardist Buzz Cornelison, keyboardist/vocalist Marlon Hargis, bassist/vocalist Sonny Lemaire and drummers Steve Goetzman and Gary Freeman to search for a new lead singer. A young singer, Les Taylor, accepted an invitation to join the group and shared lead vocal duties with Pennington. By the early 1980s, other lineup changes took place, including the exit of original member Buzz Cornelison, plus keyboardist Mark Gray, who co-wrote \\"The Closer You Get\\" and \\"Take Me Down\\", both of which became hits for the group Alabama, played a short stint from 1980 to 1982.

Answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who was almost shot after being identified? Answer the above question based on the context below: Fowzi Nejad was the only gunman to survive the SAS assault. After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who allegedly intended to take him back into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage from the back of the embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by ITN technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005. As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit deportation in cases where the person concerned would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted leave to remain in the UK, but was not given political asylum. The Home Office released a statement, saying \\"We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists.

Short movie review: of cliches Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"The critic's review titled \\"Of Clichés\\" seems to express a negative sentiment about the movie in question. Although the title itself doesn't explicitly state whether the critic views the movie positively or negatively, the term \\"cliché\\" generally carries a negative connotation. In film critique, clichés often refer to overused, hackneyed, or predictable elements within a movie that can ultimately create a lack of originality or novelty. When a movie is criticized for being clichéd, it may indicate that the movie borrows heavily from previously successful films or that it recycles common tropes and character archetypes rather than taking the time to develop a fresh, unique storyline. A critic is more likely to mention cliché elements in a review if it is being presented as a negative attribute, indicating a lack of innovation. Moreover, the short movie review alludes to the critic's disappointment in its inability to differentiate itself from other films in its genre or offer anything new or exciting for the audience to experience. Considering the critic’s focus on clichés, it can be inferred that the review likely mentions other shortcomings as well. These may include underdeveloped character arcs, superficial or one-dimensional characters, forced relationships, uninspired plot twists, or poor pacing. In conclusion, the critic's review titled \\"Of Clichés\\" suggests a negative opinion about the movie, primarily emphasizing the film's lack of originality, its heavy reliance on overused elements, and its inability to set itself apart from other films within its genre. Even though the provided information doesn't offer a comprehensive analysis of the critic’s thoughts, the indication of clichés and the manner in which they are presented strongly supports the implication of a negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"Select from: a.

Usage: A sample input is [27, -69, -48, 18, -77, -18, 82]. This is a list of integers. Part #2: Finding the differences between two consecutive values. Usage: Starting with the first pair (27, -69), the difference is 27 - (-69) = 96. The second pair (-69, -48) has a difference of -69 - (-48) = -21. We will do this for each consecutive pair in the list. Part #3: Finding the absolute value of the differences. Usage: Since we calculated the differences in pairs, we now need the absolute values. For the first pair (27, -69), the absolute difference is |96| = 96. For the second pair (-69, -48), the absolute difference is |-21| = 21. Part #4: Creating a list of the absolute differences.

Here's my take: The Bourne Ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne(Matt Damon) on the coattails of the ones who know everything. He has been running for too long. This time, it ends. The Bourne Ultimatum has a great plot, awesome writing, fantastic direction, suspense, and some of the best action of the summer. Matt Damon delivers possibly his best performance to date.

In talks: Illegal immigrants living in 'beds in sheds' are desperate to leave Britain and return home, Gurmel Singh-Kandola, secretary-general of the Sikh Council, has said. Illegal immigrants living in ‘beds in sheds’ are desperate to leave Britain and return home, an ethnic minority leader says. Gurmel Singh-Kandola, secretary-general of the Sikh Council, said many arrivals from India who had entered the country unlawfully were stuck here, unable to work, and wanted help from the Home Office to go back. His support for a ‘voluntary returns process’ echoes Home Office efforts to persuade some of the estimated one million illegal immigrants in Britain to leave of their own accord. His organisation is now in talks with the department over how migrants with no right to remain might contact officials for help to return voluntarily. His remarks are in stark contrast to the fury provoked by the poster campaign among human rights advocates, refugee groups and left-wing politicians. The posters were mounted on vans driven around parts of London, and stating: ‘In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.’ A text number was provided for advice and help with travel documents. An investigation into whether they were ‘offensive and irresponsible’ was launched yesterday by the Advertising Standards Authority. The watchdog said it had received 60 complaints about the posters including that they were ‘reminiscent of slogans used by racist groups to attack immigrants in the past’. Mr Singh-Kandola believes the message behind the posters could have been delivered ‘more softly’. ‘If it said something like, “If you want to go home contact this number” or “assistance is available to return home” I think it would have been the same message but delivered more softly,’ he said. Many from the Punjab and Delhi were stuck here, impoverished and unable to work, he said. Controversial: This poster campaign caused fury among human rights advocates, refugee groups and left-wing politicians. ‘Their plight is well known; they are sleeping very rough under bridges and in multiple occupancies, sometimes in sheds in the back of people’s gardens. 'We have been quite concerned about the abject poverty in which they are living. Many of them have been trafficked by unscrupulous agents who take a lot of money from them.’ Many illegal immigrants destroyed their passport once they arrived in the country, Mr Singh-Kandola said, making it difficult for them to go home even if they wanted to. It could take six or seven months to get replacement documents papers from the Indian consulate, he said. The Home Office could help them obtain a new passport quickly and buy them a flight home. ‘Our discussions have been for those who want to go back home to facilitate that process in a humane and generous way.’ He said illegal immigrants were victims of ‘hype’ which led them to believe they could live and work in Britain once they arrived. ‘In fact they are stuck. They want to go home on a voluntary basis and what we need is processes to facilitate that.’ Raid: An Uzbekistani man who is said to have. overstayed his visa was detained by UK Border Agency officers in a raid. on a busy central London restaurant on Thursday. Officials said the £10,000 cost of the poster campaign would pay for itself if just one migrant returned home because of the cost of enforced removals. Yesterday, Eric Pickles became the first senior Tory to raise doubts about the use of the vans, and said they should be rolled-out nationwide only if it could be proved they work. The Communities Secretary said: ‘I will be looking at that evidence. I need to see some very persuasive evidence that this should be passed out nationally. If something like this has to happen it needs to be evidence-based.’ The Communities Secretary is cracking down on traveller sites which ‘trash’ the countryside, with new guidance to councils on removing illegal camps. Prepared: The UK Border Agency sent three vans to Soho to seize the employee. Mr Pickles said £60million was being made available to local authorities to help them act more quickly to shut down unauthorised encampments. He told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘We inherited a situation where the number of illegal sites had gone up four-fold and what we expect them to do is obey the law like you and I do. ‘The idea that this is somehow an attack on the traveller community is not true. This is a very good deal for travellers.’ His department hopes the guidance will give local residents a stronger voice in getting authorities to take action against illegal camps, and prevent incidents like the £7million clear-out of Dale Farm in 2011 after a 10-year wrangle.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Jay wanted to fly like his dad","completion":"Yes, the next sentence, \\"Jay wanted to fly like his dad,\\" logically follows the preceding text.

Both Jay and his father attended the same air force school, and Jay's dedication to his training and eventual success as a fighter jet pilot for the United States Air Force further reinforces the idea that he aspired to follow in his father's footsteps. The sentence in question serves as a succinct expression of Jay's motivation for pursuing his goal by clearly stating his ambition to emulate his father's accomplishments in becoming a pilot. This motivation appears to be a central theme throughout the text, as evidenced by Jay's diligent efforts to excel in the academy and eventually achieve top honors in his class.

Review: that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"The sentence provided appears to be a negative movie review. The main indicators of this sentiment arise from the use of specific descriptors and underlying tones. To begin with, the reviewer notes that the movie \\"no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers\\". This sentence fragment suggests that the film has, in some way, diverged from what is widely expected or desired by the viewing audience. By stating \\"no longer,\\" the reviewer is implying that there was a previous point in time when these needs were recognized, heightening the sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction. Further, the \\"needs of moviegoers\\" are referred to in the context of \\"real characters and compelling plots\\". This implies that these components are missing from the movie. \\"Real characters\\" suggests that the figures portrayed lack depth, authenticity, or relatability — all aspects that can significantly affect viewer engagement and empathy. \\"Compelling plots\\" often refer to storylines that are engaging, exciting, or thought-provoking. Thus, if the plot is not described as \\"compelling,\\" the reviewer is suggesting that it is lacking in interest or originality. Therefore, overall, the sentence gravitates heavily towards a negative review of the movie. This conclusion stems from the word choice and implications that suggest disappointment or disapproval, underscoring a lack of quality or enjoyment associated with the film. The reviewer is expressing that the movie doesn't meet the expectations or fulfill the desires of the audience which presumably makes it less enjoyable or satisfying to watch. To make the sentence a positive review, the reviewer could instead talk about how well the movie understands and represents what moviegoers want, or talk positively about the characters and plot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In remarks during a ribbon-cutting ceremony here on Wednesday, Gov. George E. Pataki said he expected the facility to generate thousands more jobs in the Hudson Valley area for contractors and suppliers catering to the factory. He praised IBM for being \\"a critical partner in our economic development efforts\\" in New York state. In a brief speech, Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM's chief executive, emphasized that it was important to make long-term investments despite the current slump in the technology business. \\"To play to win in technology, you innovate and you lead,\\" he said. But manufacturing technology products is a costly and cyclical business. In June, IBM announced that it was taking a charge of more than 2 billion against earnings. The largest single reasons for the charge were the cost of getting out of the business of manufacturing hard disks for storage, which it sold to Hitachi, and closing down some of its older semiconductor operations. But Kelly said the demand for advanced chips, like those produced at IBM's facility in Burlington, Vt., is strong. \\"I need more capacity in that end of the market,\\" he said, \\"and this is factory is critical to meeting that growing demand.\\" If IBM has miscalculated the demand, it will suffer badly as both the high operating costs and depreciation on the huge capital investment for the East Fishkill factory drag down earnings.

The first oligarch to do so is murdered alongside his family by a blue-eyed assassin. Poetics lecturer Perry MacKendrick and his barrister wife Gail are on a holiday in Morocco to try and salvage their marriage after Perry slept with one of his students. Perry strikes up a friendship with Dima, a hearty and boisterous Russian with an eidetic memory. The two men bond over drinks and tennis before Dima invites both MacKendricks to his daughter's birthday. At the birthday party, Dima gets Perry alone and gives him a USB stick that links corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. He fears for his life after hearing of his fellow oligarch's fate, and pleads with Perry to turn the USB stick over to MI6 when he returns to London. Perry turns the information over to MI6 agent Hector, the investigator in charge. The information provided by Dima enables Hector and his supervisor Billy to witness a meeting between the Prince and corrupt politician Aubrey Longrigg. Billy refuses to sanction an investigation on a chance meeting. Hector continues regardless and recruits the MacKendricks to help stage a chance encounter with Dima in France. There, Dima provides all the names of his clients and confirms each banker and politician involved has received £5 million each for their endorsement of the new bank, with Longrigg receiving £30 million.

Magellan was born in northern Portugal in around 1480, either at Vila Nova de Gaia, near Porto, in Douro Litoral Province, or at Sabrosa, near Vila Real, in Tras-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province. He was the son of Rodrigo de Magalhaes, Alcaide-Mor of Aveiro (1433-1500, son of Pedro Afonso de Magalhaes and wife Quinta de Sousa) and wife Alda de Mesquita and brother of Leonor or Genebra de Magalhaes, wife with issue of Joao Fernandes Barbosa. In March 1505 at the age of 25, Magellan enlisted in the fleet of 22 ships sent to host D. Francisco de Almeida as the first viceroy of Portuguese India. Although his name does not appear in the chronicles, it is known that he remained there eight years, in Goa, Cochin and Quilon. He participated in several battles, including the battle of Cannanore in 1506, where he was wounded. In 1509 he fought in the battle of Diu. He later sailed under Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in the first Portuguese embassy to Malacca, with Francisco Serrao, his friend and possibly cousin. In September, after arriving at Malacca, the expedition fell victim to a conspiracy ending in retreat. Magellan had a crucial role, warning Sequeira and saving Francisco Serrao, who had landed. In 1511, under the new governor Afonso de Albuquerque, Magellan and Serrao participated in the conquest of Malacca. After the conquest their ways parted: Magellan was promoted, with a rich plunder and, in the company of a Malay he had indentured and baptized Enrique of Malacca, he returned to Portugal in 1512. Serrao departed in the first expedition sent to find the \\"Spice Islands\\" in the Moluccas, where he remained. He married a woman from Amboina and became a military advisor to the Sultan of Ternate, Bayan Sirrullah. His letters to Magellan would prove decisive, giving information about the spice-producing territories. After taking a leave without permission, Magellan fell out of favour. Serving in Morocco, he was wounded, resulting in a permanent limp. He was accused of trading illegally with the Moors. The accusations were proved false, but he received no further offers of employment after 15 May 1514. Later on in 1515, he got an employment offer as a crew member on a Portuguese ship, but rejected this. In 1517 after a quarrel with King Manuel I, who denied his persistent demands to lead an expedition to reach the spice islands from the east (i.e., while sailing westwards, seeking to avoid the need to sail around the tip of Africa), he left for Spain. In Seville he befriended his countryman Diogo Barbosa and soon married the daughter of Diogo's second wife, Maria Caldera Beatriz Barbosa. They had two children: Rodrigo de Magalhaes and Carlos de Magalhaes, both of whom died at a young age. His wife died in Seville around 1521. Meanwhile, Magellan devoted himself to studying the most recent charts, investigating, in partnership with cosmographer Rui Faleiro, a gateway from the Atlantic to the South Pacific and the possibility of the Moluccas being Spanish according to the demarcation of the Treaty of Tordesillas.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Willy, nicknamed El Casper, is a member of the Mara Salvatrucha gang and lives in Tapachula, a Mexican town near the border with Guatemala. He introduces a young boy into his gang, and the boy is given the nickname Smiley after a violent initiation. Casper later helps Smiley to complete this initiation by helping him execute a rival gang-member. Casper is romantically involved with a girl, Martha Marlen. Fearing for the girl's safety, he keeps the relationship a secret from his gang, but his double life causes his gang to doubt his loyalty. When Martha follows Casper to a gathering of his gang, the gang leader, Lil Mago, escorts her out, despite Casper's misgivings. Mago attempts to rape Martha and accidentally kills her. Later, he blithely tells Casper that he will find another. Shortly afterward, Mago brings Casper and Smiley to La Bombilla, a location along the train tracks where potential illegal immigrants stow away on passing trains on their way to the United States. Among the immigrants is a Honduran family introduced earlier consisting of the teenage girl Sayra, her father, and her uncle, who are on their way to relatives in New Jersey. Lil Mago, Casper, and Smiley rob the passengers for any money they have until Lil Mago spots Sayra and attempts to rape her. Casper intervenes, killing Mago and then sending Smiley off. Smiley goes back to the gang and reports about Mago's death. The new gang leader, El Sol, accuses Smiley of collusion, to which Smiley timidly protests and begs to be sent to kill Casper to prove his loyalty. El Sol agrees and Smiley travels north to track down Casper. On the train, the still shocked Casper is avoided by other passengers. When some try to throw him off the train, Sayra warns Casper and keeps on approaching him, despite her father's warnings. Casper's knowledge from previously smuggling gang members and avoiding the police proves useful, as he eludes his pursuers. He is finally accepted by Sayra's family but decides to leave the train while the others are sleeping....

The ESA requires that critical habitat be designated at the time of or within one year of a species being placed on the endangered list. In practice, most designations occur several years after listing. Between 1978 and 1986 the FWS regularly designated critical habitat. In 1986 the Reagan Administration issued a regulation limiting the protective status of critical habitat. As a result, few critical habitats were designated between 1986 and the late 1990s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a series of court orders invalidated the Reagan regulations and forced the FWS and NMFS to designate several hundred critical habitats, especially in Hawaii, California and other western states. Midwest and Eastern states received less critical habitat, primarily on rivers and coastlines. As of December, 2006, the Reagan regulation has not yet been replaced though its use has been suspended. Nonetheless, the agencies have generally changed course and since about 2005 have tried to designate critical habitat at or near the time of listing.

They get their name (sea robin) from the orange ventral surface of the species in the Western Atlantic (\\"Prionotus carolinus\\") and from large pectoral fins, which, when swimming, open and close like a bird's wings in flight. The large surface area of the fins also permits the fish to glide short distances above the water surface, much like a flying fish. - The scaly gurnard , Lepidotrigla brachyoptera , is a searobin of the family Triglidae , found around New Zealand including the Kermadec Islands , at depths of between 35 and 300 m. Its length is up to 15 cm. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. - The Exocoetidae are a family of marine fish in the order Beloniformes class Actinopterygii. Fish of this family are known as flying fish. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defense mechanism to evade predators. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.

The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), but smaller masses may be measured in grams (g). To measure mass, you would use a balance. In the lab, mass may be measured with a triple beam balance or an electronic balance, but the old-fashioned balance pictured below may give you a better idea of what mass is. If both sides of this balance were at the same level, it would mean that the fruit in the left pan has the same mass as the iron object in the right pan. In that case, the fruit would have a mass of 1 kg, the same as the iron. As you can see, however, the fruit is at a higher level than the iron. This means that the fruit has less mass than the iron, that is, the fruit's mass is less than 1 kg.

Write an article based on this \\"A Flintshire man who went on the run after raping a young child has been jailed for 12 years.\\"","completion":"Title: Flintshire Man Sentenced to 12 Years in Prison for Raping a Young Child Introduction A recent disturbing case in Flintshire, UK has finally come to a conclusion as the man responsible for the heinous crime of raping a young child has been captured and sentenced to 12 years in prison. The man, who fled the scene shortly after committing the crime, was apprehended months later, providing the victim and their family an opportunity to finally seek justice. In this article, we will discuss the timeline of events, the legal proceedings, and the broader implications of such cases on society. Step 1: Establishing the timeline of events The Flintshire man, whose identity has been withheld to protect the victim's anonymity, committed the appalling act of raping a child earlier in the year. After the crime occurred, the man instantly went on the run to avoid being brought to justice. The local law enforcement agencies launched an extensive manhunt to locate the suspect and apprehend him. Step 2: Arresting the perpetrator Through coordinated efforts of the police, the community, and information provided by key witnesses, the Flintshire man was eventually found and arrested months after the incident took place. The apprehension of the suspect brought relief to the victim's family and the local community, who had been living in fear since the news of the brutal crime broke. Step 3: Legal proceedings and conviction Following the arrest, legal proceedings began, and the man was charged with rape of a minor. The trial, which was held in the Crown Court, saw the accused plead guilty and the jury subsequently found him guilty of the crime. The prosecution presented indisputable evidence, including the victim's testimony and forensic evidence that tied the defendant to the crime. As a result, the judge sentenced him to 12 years in prison. Step 4: Discussing the broader implications of such cases This shocking case brings a number of important issues to light. Firstly, the importance of the community and the law enforcement agencies working together cannot be understated. The swift action taken by the police and the assistance offered by members of the public were instrumental in apprehending the suspect. Secondly, the emotional and psychological trauma faced by the victim and their family is an aspect that should not be overlooked. Counseling and support services are essential in helping the victims cope with the aftermath of such atrocious crimes. Lastly, this case exposes the need for continued efforts to raise awareness on child sexual abuse, teach children about personal safety, and empower them to report any form of abuse. Furthermore, stricter sentencing guidelines and legal reforms may be necessary to deter potential offenders and ensure that justice is properly served. Conclusion The Flintshire man's 12-year prison sentence serves as a stark reminder of the consequences that sexual predators face when brought to justice. While no punishment can truly undo the devastating impact of this crime on the victim and their family, this case highlights the importance of law enforcement, community involvement, and legal recourse in dealing with such horrifying incidents. Society as a whole must ensure that we work together to prevent child sexual abuse, support the victims, and hold the perpetrators accountable for their actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, your statement provides a reasonable answer to the question of when airbags deploy in modern vehicles. To expand on your answer, airbags are designed to deploy during moderate to severe frontal crashes, as well as side and rollover crashes, depending on the specific airbag system in a vehicle. Modern vehicles often contain multiple airbag modules located throughout the passenger seating positions, providing a comprehensive safety system in the event of a collision. Airbag deployment is determined using various sensors, which monitor the type, angle, and severity of an impact. These sensors provide real-time information to the vehicle's airbag control unit (ACU). Based on the data received, the ACU will then determine if airbag deployment is necessary and, if so, which airbags it needs to deploy and at what inflation rate. In addition to frontal airbags, some vehicles are also equipped with side-impact airbags, curtain airbags, and knee airbags, among others, each designed to provide protection for specific areas of the vehicle in case of an accident. The precise moment of deployment depends on the signals received by the ACU, which makes a rapid assessment of the collision's characteristics. It is important to note that while airbags provide a vital safety feature in modern vehicles, they are not meant to replace seat belts. Instead, airbags are designed to work in conjunction with seat belts to offer maximum protection during an accident. Wearing a seat belt properly and sitting in an appropriate position in the vehicle are essential for both driver and passengers to ensure the effectiveness of airbags in the event of a collision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The current \\"opt-in\\" system requires a proactive choice by an individual to register to become an organ donor on their death. The Scottish government said it would examine the bill to see if a \\"convincing case\\" could be made for a move to an opt-out system. The new legislation would mean people would have to actively opt out or else their name would be added to the NHS Organ Donation Register. Under the terms of the \\"soft opt-out\\" system, families of deceased patients would be given a say on donation if they could confirm their relative had made an unrecorded objection during their lifetime. Ms McTaggart, who introduced the bill, cited evidence which said that three people died every day across the UK waiting for a transplant. She claimed her legislation could save lives. \\"That's what the bill is about. It's about making more organs available to people who need them, ultimately,\\" she said. According to the government, there has been a 63% increase in the number of transplants carried out on Scottish patients since 2007. Maureen Watt, minister for public health, said: \\"There is currently no consensus amongst experts as to whether this would make a significant difference and the international evidence is not clear. \\"However the Scottish government welcomes any debate in relation to the important issues of organ donation and transplantation.\\" Ms Watt added: \\"In Scotland we lead the UK in increasing donation and transplantation numbers. \\"The transplant waiting list is now at its lowest level to date. In addition, 41% of Scots are signed up to the NHS Organ Donor Register - the highest percentage of any of the four UK countries.\\" Ms McTaggart hosted an event at Parliament to mark the formal introduction of the bill, which was attended by representatives of a number of medical organisations including the British Medical Association (BMA), the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and the Scottish Kidney Federation, as well as transplant recipients and their families. Ms McTaggart said she was \\"delighted\\" with the event, and the introduction of the bill. \\"There's still a long way to go in the legislative process but I'm confident that the overwhelming evidence in favour of my proposals will ensure the success of my bill,\\" she said. Scottish TV presenter Lorraine Kelly, who had previously offered support, reiterated her backing for the bill via a video message where she stated that being an organ donor was a \\"unique opportunity for people to leave behind an amazing gift.\\" The BMA welcomed the publication of the bill. In a statement, Dr Sue Robertson, a member of the BMA's Scottish Council and a renal physician, said: \\"The whole transplant community works tremendously hard to increase the levels of organ donation with significant support from the Scottish government, but there are still people in Scotland waiting for an organ transplant. \\"We believe that more can be done and more lives can be saved and this bill represents a positive step towards that goal,\\" she added. The British Heart Foundation also backs the bill.

CNN followed one aid container from the headquarters of ShelterBox in Cornwall, England, to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to see the hurdles aid groups face. Minutes after the earthquake struck on January 12, the ShelterBox crew sprang into action. The international disaster relief organization is the brainchild of Tom Henderson, who was recognized as a CNN Hero in 2008. \\"If you've lost everything as they have in Haiti, it's all about shelter, warmth, comfort and dignity,\\" says Henderson. \\"That's what ShelterBox is.\\" A ShelterBox container -- containing relief supplies including a 10-person tent, water and blankets -- is designed to be easily carried by two people and stackable for easy storage. To get to Haiti from Cornwall, the box went on four flights and one overland trip over five days before being distributed to a mother and her newborn baby. Once in the Dominican Republic -- Haiti's neighbor -- there were delays because of security concerns and a national holiday that meant local help was limited. The ShelterBox was one of 720 boxes eventually loaded into a four truck convoy in Santa Domingo for a U.N.-escorted drive to Haiti. The drive from Santo Domingo to the Haiti border took about 11 hours because of poor roads and a puncture. Twelve ShelterBoxes are being used to build an emergency field hospital at the airport, said Mark Pearson who is in Haiti for the charity. Each ShelterBox contains individual survival equipment like water carriers, a tool kit and a children's pack containing drawing books, crayons and pens. By February 1, Shelterbox hopes to have more than 7,000 boxes in Haiti, housing up to 70,000 people. But Henderson acknowledges there is much more to be done. \\"There are thousands of people dying every day. That's what drives us forward. This is not a job for us. It's a passion.\\" Want to get involved? Check out ShelterBox's Web site and see how to help. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article highlights the challenges faced by international disaster relief organizations, specifically ShelterBox, to deliver aid to Haiti after the devastating earthquake in January 2010. ShelterBox, founded by Tom Henderson, aims to provide shelter, warmth, comfort, and dignity to those who have lost everything in disasters. Their containers hold relief supplies, including a 10-person tent, water, and blankets. The journey from Cornwall, England, to Haiti took five days, four flights, and one overland trip for a single ShelterBox. Delays were experienced in the Dominican Republic due to security concerns and a national holiday that limited local assistance. The boxes were eventually loaded onto a UN-escorted convoy and arrived in Haiti to be distributed to families and used in building emergency field hospitals. ShelterBox aims to have more than 7,000 boxes in Haiti by February 1, 2010, housing up to 70,000 people, even though the organization acknowledges that much more needs to be done."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Unaware of his departure, on October 6, Texians in Matagorda marched on Presidio La Bahía in Goliad to kidnap him and steal the 50,000 that was rumored to accompany him. On October 10, approximately 125 volunteers, including 30 Tejanos, stormed the presidio. The Mexican garrison surrendered after a thirty-minute battle. One or two Texians were wounded and three Mexican soldiers were killed with seven more wounded.The Texians established themselves in the presidio, under the command of Captain Philip Dimmitt, who immediately sent all the local Tejano volunteers to join Austin on the march to Béxar. At the end of the month, Dimmitt sent a group of men under Ira Westover to engage the Mexican garrison at Fort Lipantitlán, near San Patricio. Late on November 3, the Texians took the undermanned fort without firing a shot. After dismantling the fort, they prepared to return to Goliad. The remainder of the Mexican garrison, which had been out on patrol, approached. The Mexican troops were accompanied by 15–20 loyal centralists from San Patricio, including all members of the ayuntamiento. After a thirty-minute skirmish, the Mexican soldiers and Texian centralists retreated. With their departure, the Texian army controlled the Gulf Coast, forcing Mexican commanders to send all communication with the Mexican interior overland. The slower land journey left Cos unable to quickly request or receive reinforcements or supplies.On their return to Goliad, Westover's group encountered Governor Viesca. After being freed by sympathetic soldiers, Viesca had immediately traveled to Texas to recreate the state government. Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor. This caused an uproar in the garrison, as many supported the governor. Dimmitt declared martial law and soon alienated most of the local residents.

Article: In many romantic movies or TV shows one scene always appears. It involves a handsome man standing outside a young woman's window, singing a love song to her to win her over. However, trying to woo a female with songs is not just something that humans do. A few animals sing love songs as well. Birds and elephants are romantic but the latest animal to _ a female might surprise you--it is the humble mouse. You may find it odd to find out that mice sing. We do not hear them because the frequency of their voice is so high. In fact, scientists have known for some time that male mice make special sounds to females, but it has always been assumed that the sounds are produced instinctively and randomly, with little thought going into the process. But new research suggests otherwise. When male mice with different voices were put in a cage together, scientists found that they would gradually change their pitches to sound like one another. But when a female mouse was put in the cage with two males, one male would change his pitch to match the other. \\"It was usually the smaller animal changing the pitch to match the larger animal,\\" professor Erich Jarvis, leader of the study, from Duke University, US, told BBC News. This ability, known as vocal learning, is rare in the natural world. It had been thought to be limited to some birds, such as parrots--as well as whales and dolphins. The latest findings challenge the long-held opinion that mice cannot learn to adapt their voices. Scientists also found the part of the brain that controls the mice's singing ability. In the experiment, they damaged the cells in this part of the mice's brain and found that the animals couldn't keep their songs in pitch or repeat them any more. This also happened when the mice became deaf. Jarvis said that this finding had changed his understanding of the way mice make sound. \\"In mice we find that the pathways that are at least modulating these vocalizations are in the forebrain, in places where you actually find them in humans,\\"...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: All eyes this week are on North Korea, which looks set to move forward with a provocative long-range missile launch. Last month, Pyongyang announced it would launch a rocket carrying a satellite sometime between Thursday and April 16 to mark the 100th anniversary of its founder, Kim Il Sung. Japan, the United States and South Korea see the launch -- which would violate U.N. Security Council resolutions -- as a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test. And a South Korean intelligence report says it's likely to precede a nuclear test, as it did in 2006 and 2009. Pyongyang insists its intentions are good and have invited foreign journalists, including CNN correspondent Stan Grant, to view the secret launch site. CNN on Monday interviewed Jim Walsh, an international security analyst from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on \\"Starting Point\\" to help explain the tense situation:. CNN: This whole parading the journalists through -- letting people see -- is this Kim Jong Un bragging internally? Is it sending a message to the international community? Both? Jim Walsh: It's a good question. Often when North Korea acts out, its purpose is to communicate with the broader world, communicate to the United States or to Japan or South Korea. This is really about internal messaging, being able to go to its own public and say, \\"Look, all these Western journalists are here, we're really important, we're really a big deal.\\" And why do I say it's internally driven? Because they are going through a political transition. This young guy, this 20-something-year-old, has taken over for his father (Kim Jong Il), and he's in the middle of trying to consolidate his position. And it's the 100th anniversary of Kim Il Sung's birth. ... They've been planning big events for years now for this. So this is all about regime legitimacy and talking to the North Korean people and the military, the elites in the military. CNN: CNN saw what appears to be a satellite. I think most of the media there agree that there definitely is a satellite for this rocket, to launch this satellite into space. ... We also know that this is a country that has nuclear ambitions, no matter how nascent it is or successful it might be. Walsh: Yes, well, you know, this missile is not the greatest missile in the world. There are two characteristics if you have a modern missile program: One is solid fuel, and the other is a modern-guidance system. This missile has neither of those. And four tests, four long-range missile tests over like 15 years, is not a very active missile program. It's more like a tube filled with gasoline than it is anything else. The big worry is they're going to fire it up there, and it will get wobbly on them and start to veer off course like the last two did. That's the real concern I have: not the missile itself but that the missile might stray into foreign airspace and that Japan or South Korea might feel inclined to shoot it down and then suddenly we're off to the races with an international incident. CNN: Are we looking at a scenario where we're going to see a couple of missiles get launched or troops marching down to the (demilitarized zone)? Should people be legitimately scared about this? ... Walsh: Well, I think it is about trying to impress the family and the military. I don't think they're going to march a lot of people toward the DMZ. I think that would be provocative. Certainly, you could see other missile tests. That's a good question. They've done that in the past, short-range missiles. But I'm afraid what we're really looking at here, further down the road, is there's going to be the missile test, then there's going to be international reaction, and then (North Korea) is going to have to push back. So I would not rule out a nuclear test sometime later this year if this continues to ratchet up. CNN: This is obviously very provocative behavior by the North Koreans, even after there was just this highly publicized deal for food for this starving country. So what's the point? What are they trying to do? Walsh: That's the 100,000 question, and we really don't have an answer here. Now I know lot of people who have been following this over the years. They sort of think this is the same old, same old -- that we cut a deal and they've broken the deal; they got something, but they didn't live up to their promises. Well, that's not what's happening here. There was a deal, and we really hadn't given them anything yet. We haven't given them the food aid. So that tells me one (of) two things happened. Either there was some misunderstanding about the contents of that deal -- the Americans thought one thing, the North Koreans the other -- or maybe that deal got back to Pyongyang and then ran into trouble there. Maybe the military pushed back, or there was something else going on. But at this point, we don't know the reason. If we had an answer to that question, that would tell us what's going on inside North Korea. It's the most opaque society in the world -- more than Iran, more than any other place on Earth -- so we really don't know what's going on.","completion":"The article discusses North Korea's intent to launch a long-range missile amid protests from the international community. The proposed launch is in direct violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and is seen as a prelude to a nuclear test, based on similar pattern observed in 2006 and 2009. Jim Walsh, an international security analyst from MIT, weighs in on the situation with a series of incisive points. Firstly, he emphasizes that the move may be tied to internal messaging, aimed at boosting the image of the country's leadership to its citizens, rather than an outward act of aggression. This analysis is buttressed by the fact that the launch coincides with the 100th anniversary of the birth of North Korean founder, Kim Il Sung, and comes in the wake of a political transition following the recent ascension of Kim Jong Un. Secondly, Walsh notes that the missile being prepared for launch is relatively archaic and primitive. The fear is not regarding the successful deployment of the missile itself, but rather the possibility that it could veer off course, potentially provoking retaliatory action from Japan or South Korea, hence escalating the situation. Thirdly, touching on conjecture about a potential military march towards the demilitarized zone or further missile launches, Walsh reassures that while there could be more missile tests, a march towards the DMZ seems unlikely as it would be too provocative. However, he indicates that a nuclear test may not be off the table, dependent on the severity of the international reaction. Lastly, Walsh gives his perspective on North Korea's actions which appear to counter the recent food aid agreement aimed at relieving the country's famine. He suggests two possible reasons: a misunderstanding about the deal or internal resistance when the agreement reached North Korea. Overall, the article illustrates the strategic opacity of North Korea's moves and the high level of concern from the international community regarding the country's visible flirtation with provocative actions. The MIT analyst's insights reinforce the intricacies of North Korea's geopolitical positioning, making clear that an understanding of these actions requires careful consideration of both internal dynamics and international implications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Among the animals, there was a squirrel, a rabbit, and a small bird. They seemed to be having an important conversation. As the guard tried to listen carefully, he could hear the squirrel say, \\"We need to find a way to keep our homes safe from the humans. They keep destroying our homes.\\" The guard, feeling sad for the animals, decided he wanted to help them. He stepped out from behind the bushes and said, \\"Hello, little friends! I heard your conversation, and I want to help you keep your homes safe.\\" The animals were surprised but happy that the guard wanted to help them. They explained that humans were cutting down trees and building homes where their old ones were, leaving them with nowhere to go. So, the guard thought very hard and came up with a plan. He told the animals, \\"I will speak to the other guards and people, telling them how important it is to take care of your homes and not destroy them. We can also put up signs to show other humans which trees your homes are in so they won't cut them down.\\" The animals were very grateful for the guard's help and agreed with his plan. The next day, the guard talked to everyone he could about protecting the animal's homes and putting up signs. Soon, more and more people began to understand the importance of helping these little animals too. Together, the guard and the people created safe places for the squirrel, the rabbit, and the bird. They also shared what they had learned with other people in the area. And that's how the helpful guard and his little animal friends helped protect their homes and the forest for future generations to enjoy."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

So many people have seen this film and just don't get it, and I don't understand why. While watching this film I was taken on a private journey which floored me. I will try to explain this without any spoilers, but be forewarned, I do talk about things that happen in the movie. **** Possible Spoilers **** Be Forewarned!**** His is a life of \\"large moves\\" versus \\"small moves\\". He chooses Natalia to be his Queen, and he and she behave as his Aunt first described the King and Queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy. Listen closely to that description. When someone asks him a question, he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves. (The flashbacks are beautifully lit, by the way.) The flashbacks are quite interesting as well, for they give not only his point of view as a child, but the point of view of the other character as well. It's stunning. Various characters become either his helpers or his enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, their actions enlightening you as to who's side they are on. Even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on. Beautifully done. I will not comment more on what happens to the character of Luhzin, but I hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end. This film is constantly working on many levels, which is why I endorse it. It was a treat and a joy to watch. If you like this film I would recommend a film called Fresh.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: I read this background article the other day: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. I am facing a new situation today: Two groups of people were part of a science study. Group A ate lots of fats(lipids), while Group B had a more balanced diet with few fats. Group A gained a lot of weight over the course of the 6 month study. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which group had normal lipid levels in the blood? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information and the new situation, it is more likely that Group B had normal lipid levels in the blood. Group A, which consumed a high amount of fats (lipids), would have a higher risk of increased lipid levels in their blood due to their high-fat diet. This increase in blood lipid levels may lead to health problems such as cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, Group B followed a more balanced diet with fewer fats, thus reducing the risks associated with a high-fat diet and maintaining a healthier lipid profile in their blood. However, it is essential to note that actual lipid levels would depend on individual body's responses, physical activity levels, genetic factors, and other lifestyle habits."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: In the Netherlands,cycling isn't seen as eccrfriendly exercise; it's part of everyday life, as it's people's top choice to school and work. There are more bicycles than residents in the Netherlands. In cities like Amsterdam and The Hague, up to 70 percent of all journeys are made by bike. So how did cycling become such a popular means of transportation in the European country? In the 1970s, the Dutch government began to improve its cycling infrastructure due to both a social movement demanding safer cycling condition for children and the oil crisis in the Middle East, when oil producing countries stopped their exports to Western Europe. To make cycling safer and more appealing, the Dutch have built the widest cycling net- work in the world. The country has over 40,000 kilometers of bicycle lanes and paths,which are clearly marked. They have smooth surfaces,separate signs and lights for those on two wheels. The lanes are wide enough to allow side-by-side cycling and passing. In many cities the bike lanes are completely segregated from motorized traffic. And in many traffic situations cyclists are given priority over drivers. Sometimes, where space is limited and both must share, you can see signs showing an image of a cyclist with a car behind accompanied by the words \\"Bike Street:Cars are guests\\". As young people aren't allowed to drive alone until they are 18,cycling offers Dutch teen- agers an alternative form of freedom. The government also makes cycling training lessons a compulsory part of the Dutch school curriculum . Bike parking facilities are ubiquitous in the country. Cyclists are accommodated in the way motorists are elsewhere. Take Groningen, a city in the northeastern part of the Netherlands,for example. The city's central train station has underground parking for 10,000 bikes. What does the Dutch government do about teenagers cycling? A) It makes cycling covered by school education. B) It encourages teenagers to cycle alone. C) It will watch over teenagers who ride bikes. D) It suggests teenagers cycling before driving.

Routine medical tests last week uncovered papillary carcinoma in President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's thyroid gland, presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said. Medical exams indicate that the cancer has not spread to her lymph nodes or grown beyond the thyroid gland, he said. Doctors are scheduled to operate on Fernandez on January 4. She will take a medical leave and relinquish power to the South American nation's vice president from January 4-24, Scoccimarro said. Fernandez, 58, was sworn in for a second four-year term earlier this month after she won re-election with more than 54% of the vote. JUST WATCHED Argentina's Fernandez sworn in again Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Argentina's Fernandez sworn in again 01:24 She became Argentina's president in 2007. Her husband, Nestor Kirchner, was president from 2003-2007. He died in October 2010. During Fernandez's presidency, Argentina's economy has enjoyed sustained growth of about 8% annually. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and has an excellent survival rate, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. More than 95% of adults with papillary thyroid carcinoma survive at least 10 years, according to a description on the library's website. Treatment includes surgery, radioactive iodine and medication, the library says. Possible complications in surgery can include damage to a nerve that controls the vocal cords or accidental removal of a gland that helps regulate blood calcium levels, according to the medicine library. Recently doctors have diagnosed several South American leaders with cancer. Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2010. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced that doctors had diagnosed him with cancer in June. He did not specify what kind of cancer he had, but after undergoing several rounds of chemotherapy, he said in October that he had been cured. Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is undergoing treatment for throat cancer. ||||| Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner gestures during a ceremony outside the Casa Rosada Presidential Palace in Buenos Aires December 10, 2011. BUENOS AIRES | BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine President Cristina Fernandez has thyroid cancer and will undergo surgery next month, her government said on Tuesday, adding that the cancerous cells had not spread. Fernandez, 58, was easily elected to a second four-year term in October, vowing to deepen her unorthodox policies despite complaints from business leaders who say her heavy-handed management of the economy is stifling investment. Fernandez was diagnosed with a papillary carcinoma that has not metastasized, said her spokesman, Alfredo Scoccimarro. The operation is scheduled to take place on January 4 and she is expected to take a leave of absence until January 24. \\"The thyroid gland will have to be removed,\\" said Buenos Aires-based cancer specialist Julio Moreno. \\"The prognosis is very good. The chances of being cured are 90 to 98 percent.\\" The cancer was detected last week during a routine check. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and normally affects people under the age of 40, especially women. A skilled orator fond of glamorous clothes, high heels and make-up, Fernandez still wears black as she mourns her husband and closest advisor, former President Nestor Kirchner, who died late last year. When Kirchner died, many thought it spelled the end of the couple's idiosyncratic blend of state intervention, nationalist rhetoric and the championing of human rights in grains exporting powerhouse Argentina, the world's No. 3 soybean supplier. But Fernandez pulled off a remarkable comeback on the back of a brisk economic expansion and an outpouring of public sympathy. She was re-elected with 54 percent of the vote, promising to stay true to her policies despite objections from Wall Street and international investors. Latin America's No. 3 economy is growing at nearly 9 percent a year. But a worsening global economic outlook combined with entrenched high inflation at home are seen reining in Argentina's growth to about 4 percent next year. Fernandez is one of several Latin American leaders to have cancer. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez underwent chemotherapy earlier this year while Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo's lymphatic cancer is in remission. And former Brazilian leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is being successfully treated for a cancerous tumor on his Larynx, according to his doctors.

The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. \\"The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and, ... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons).\\" This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one’s identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one’s development. In social comparison we use reference groups, with respect to both psychological and identity development. These reference groups are the peers of adolescents. This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends and who they communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become.

Article:County Down swimmer Firth, 20, won the S14 100m backstroke title when representing Ireland four years ago but will be among four Northern Irish competitors competing for Great Britain in Rio. Larne woman Claire Taggart, 21, competes in Boccia for Britain with 16-year-old Ballymena youngster Katie Morrow (wheelchair basketball) and Downpatrick man David Leavy (seven-a-side football) also representing Great Britain at the Games. Track and field stars McKillop and Smyth are joined in the Ireland team by seven-a-side footballers Ryan Walker and Cormac Birt plus Dungannon shooter Phillip Eaglesham. Here, BBC Sport takes a more detailed look at the Northern Ireland competitors. Seaforde woman Firth will aim to land gold during Thursday's first day of competition when she defends her S14 100m backstroke title. The 100m backstroke remains Firth's strongest event but she will also compete in the 200m freestyle, 100m breaststroke and 200m individual medley later in the Games. Firth could be a strong gold medal contender in the 200m IM on the penultimate day of the Games as Russian Valeriia Shabalina, who pipped her for gold at this year's European Championships, will not be competing because of the country's ban from Rio. Firth, who competes in the S14 classes for swimmers with an intellectual disability, is one of Northern Ireland's top pool stars and competed in eight events at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. After winning gold in London, Firth won three silver medals at the IPC World Championships in Montreal a year later before opting to switch allegiance to Great Britain. Twenty-one-year-old Larne woman Claire Taggart competes in the Paralympic-specific spot of Boccia, which is similar to Boules and requires major tactical nuance and accuracy from its athletes. Claire was diagnosed with the condition dystonia after beginning to experience difficulties with her walking five years ago. Media playback is not supported on this device But despite now being in a wheelchair, the county Antrim woman maintains a hugely positive approach to life. \\"I'm learning to drive again. The only thing I can't do is walk and to be honest, I'm not that bothered,\\" says Claire. The Larne woman was thrilled by her selection for her first Paralympics and will be part of a strong British squad expected to challenge strongly for medals in both the team and individual events. Downpatrick man David Leavy will be another Paralympics debutant in Rio after being named in Britain's seven-a-side football squad. The Queen's University student captained the Northern Ireland team at last year's Cerebral Palsy World Championships after discovering the sport when watching the London 2012 Paralympics on television. Leavy will be the first ever Northern Ireland player to represent Great Britain in seven-a-side football at a Paralympics. \\"It's a real honour to be selected to represent ParalympicsGB and I'm delighted that all of my hard work in training has paid off,\\" says the 24-year-old. Sixteen-year-old Ballymena girl Katie Morrow was introduced to wheelchair basketball three years ago by Disability Sport Northern Ireland's Wheelchair Basketball Performance Officer Phil Robinson. 2015 was a remarkable year for the Cullybackey College student as she helped the British senior team win European Championship bronze after making her debut earlier in the season, in addition to helping the British Under-25 squad clinch World Championship gold. Away from the basketball court, Katie is a highly talented swimmer having been a club-mate of Ireland star Danielle Hill in a Larne squad which claimed relay medals at Irish and British Age-Group Championships. The world's fastest Paralympian will be aiming to win gold medal number five in Rio after his T13 sprint doubles in Beijing and London. With the International Paralympic Committee dropping the 200m event from the Rio athletics programme, Eglinton man Smyth will run just the 100m at these Games with his opening heat taking place on the first day of competition on Thursday before Friday's final. Media playback is not supported on this device Smyth, 29, set world records of 10.46 and 21.05 as he triumphed in London although his 100m personal best of 10.22 set in 2011 was good enough to earn him a place in the sprint entry alongside Usain Bolt at that year's World Championships in South Korea. Injury problems affected Smyth in the three years after London but his 10.39 clocking in Florida earlier this summer suggests that he should comfortably retain his 100m title. As an eight-year-old, Smyth was diagnosed with the genetic condition Stargardt's Disease, which has left him with less than 10% of normal vision. Like his great friend Smyth, Glengormley runner McKillop will be unable to repeat his double triumph of four years ago after Games bosses also opted to remove the T37 800m from the Rio timetable. Despite a series of injuries since London, which included a broken wrist after he fell off a bike while on holiday in Rome, McKillop has remained unbeatable at world and European level over the last four years. McKillop has not lost in Paralympic competition since a defeat at the 2005 European Championships in Finland, which came three years before his first Paralympics gold medal in Beijing. With the 26-year-old enjoying an injury-free 2016, he will be a strong favourite to clinch a fourth Paralympics gold medal. Nineteen-year-old Armagh man Ryan Walker will make his Paralympic debut on Friday when he lines out for the Ireland seven-a-side football team in their opener against the world's top-ranked team Ukraine at the Deodoro Stadium. The tournament, which is played by footballers with cerebral palsy, will continue for the Irish on Saturday as they face hosts Brazil before they face Great Britain in their final group match. Midfielder Ryan, who hails from Glenanne in county Armagh, has been playing football all his life and is a regular with his Ireland team-mate Cormac Birt and British representative David Leavy in the Northern Ireland team. Ryan hopes to qualify as a personal trainer in the future. Toomebridge 20-year-old Cormac Birt will make his Ireland debut in Rio after being named alongside Walker in the 14-man squad. A former GAA player, Cormac turned his hand to football in 2011 and hasn't looked back since and has been juggling training with his studies as an accountancy student. The county Antrim man has been capped 34 times by Northern Ireland's Cerebral Palsy team and his seven international goals include a wonder strike from the halfway line against England three years ago. Belfast youngster Jordan Walker, 17, was selected to join Walker and Birt in the Ireland squad but had to pull out because of injury. Dungannon man Phillip Eaglesham was serving as a Royal Marine in Afghanistan in 2010 when he contracted Q Fever, a rare airborne bacteria, and the steady deterioration in his condition left him wheelchair bound. However, the father-of-three took began competing in disability shooting competitions in 2012 and despite the constant struggle to manage the physical and mental impact of his illness, he competed in his first IPC World Cup event in the USA in 2015.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A volcanic eruption in Iceland has sent ash across northern Europe. Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 metres thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer of water between glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure lifts. The lava from the volcano then comes up to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's biggest airlines, airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it. Going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane's engines, causing damage to the plane. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and sharp, glass-like rocks all over the countryside. Farmers are keeping their animals inside to stop them eating ash-covered grass or the sharp objects.

He offers a script to the Warner Brothers executive \\"J.L.\\", called The Scarlet Pumpernickel, which he wrote himself (under the name \\"Daffy Dumas Duck.\\") As Daffy reads the script to J.L., the cartoon cuts away to various scenes and then back to J.L.'s office. Each time, Daffy announces a page number. By the cartoon's end, the script has exceeded 2 thousand pages (movie scripts much in excess of 100 pages were usually rejected as too long back in those days). In this script, the clumsy Scarlet Pumpernickel (Daffy) must save the Fair Lady Melissa from being married to a man she does not love, the Grand Duke (Sylvester) under the Lord High Chamberlain's (Porky Pig) orders. Melissa loves Scarlet, but her happy mood is extinguished in a heartbeat when the Chamberlain orders her to \\"Keep away from that masked band-d-d-d-d-a-desperand-d-d-d-d-that masked stinker!\\" The Chamberlain gets a brilliant plan and decides to marry Melissa to the Grand Duke in exchange for killing the Scarlet Pumpernickel.

Question: WHERE IS GOCHEOK DONG BRANCH A:","completion":"To answer the question, it is essential to first break it down and then provide a step-by-step justification for the answer. Step 1: Understand the given information and question The initial information provided states that 21% of the total area of Guro District in Seoul is a restricted zone to be used as a greenbelt, and it is the only arboretum in the city. The question being asked is about the location of Gocheok-dong Branch. Step 2: Identify Gocheok-dong Gocheok-dong is a neighborhood in Guro District, Seoul, South Korea. Step 3: Determine whether Gocheok-dong's location is connected to the greenbelt information The critical part here is to determine whether the location of Gocheok-dong Branch relates to the information about the greenbelt. It is reasonable to assume that the user might be referring to a branch facility or an office located within the Gocheok-dong neighborhood. Step 4: Answer the question considering the connection between the greenbelt information and Gocheok-dong Branch Since the initial information provided is about the greenbelt area within the Guro District, it doesn't offer any insights into the precise location of the Gocheok-dong Branch within the neighborhood. Therefore, the answer to the question—where Gocheok-dong Branch is—cannot be adequately addressed using the provided information about the Guro District's greenbelt area.

Please answer the following question: Jenny and I were twins, and we were always close growing up despite our very different personalities. Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them. Why did the twins sell the house? - It was too large for the two of them. - Neither wanted to set a foot it in again. - So they could invest in other real estate. - not enough information A:","completion":"The twins sold the house because neither of them wanted to set foot in it again.

Sentence 2: Since getting a new accountant, it was easier for him to see where his money was going. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. These two sentences present different scenarios and do not necessarily relate directly to one another. Let's break down each sentence and analyze its content. Sentence 1: \\"The sight of his money flowing liberally unnerved him deeply, even when it flowed to something he valued.\\" This sentence conveys an emotional response to a situation where the individual's money is being spent freely and without restraint. The person is described as feeling unnerved, even when the money is being spent on something he values. This sentence focuses on the emotional state of a person who witnesses their money being spent liberally, regardless of the recipient or whether the expenditure aligns with their values. Sentence 2: \\"Since getting a new accountant, it was easier for him to see where his money was going.\\" In this sentence, the main focus is on a recent change (i.e., getting a new accountant) that has made it easier for the individual to understand and track their financial transactions. This sentence emphasizes the change in visibility and general awareness of the person's spending habits rather than their emotional response to it. Based on the content of these two sentences, they do not directly relate to one another. The first sentence focuses on the emotional response to liberal spending and does not mention the role of an accountant, while the second sentence centers on the improved ability to track spending due to a new accountant without discussing any emotional reactions. Consequently, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence as they each address distinct aspects of financial management and personal reactions to spending."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer is:","completion":"Based on the information provided, France has a higher biodiversity compared to Belgium. Generally, higher biodiversity means there are more species of animals, plants, and other organisms in a particular country. However, the question asks about the number of species that have disappeared or gone extinct in each country. Unfortunately, we cannot directly infer the number of animal extinctions from the given information about biodiversity levels alone. To answer this question specifically, we would need actual data on species extinctions in Belgium and France. However, it is important to note that countries with higher biodiversity usually have more species that could potentially be at risk of extinction due to various factors, such as habitat loss, climate change, and human activities. So, it is possible that France might have experienced a higher number of species loss compared to Belgium, simply because they have more species to begin with.

The Lancashire player has a strike-rate of 117.26 runs per 100 balls faced in one-day cricket and has scored England's three fastest one-day centuries. However, he went 22 international innings without scoring a half-century, between his 66-ball ton against New Zealand in June and his 52-ball 116 against Pakistan on Friday. Since making his Test debut against India in July 2014, where he hit his highest score of 85, Buttler has compiled five half-centuries in scoring 630 runs at an average of 30. Against Pakistan, he scored just 34 runs in four innings, after a summer in which he notched 122 in eight knocks against Australia. Yorkshire's Bairstow, who has a highest score of 95 and averages 26.40, played six successive Tests as a specialist batsman before taking over behind the stumps for the third Test in Sharjah. Asked whether Buttler may return as first-choice wicketkeeper for the first Test against South Africa in Durban on 26 December, Bayliss said: \\"It's something for us to think about. \\"There's got to be a spot available for him, as well. It'll certainly be spoken about, I'm sure.\\" Bayliss believes Buttler may benefit from replicating his attacking one-day style in the Test arena, although he concedes it would take significant commitment from both the player and coaching staff. \\"He probably could,\\" said Bayliss. \\"Whether he would allow himself to actually do it and whether we can get our head around actually playing like a Twenty20 innings in a Test match, I'm not sure.\\" What is a summary of this text?","completion":"This is about two cricket players, Buttler and Jonny Bairstow. Buttler was not doing too well in Test matches, so Jonny Bairstow played instead. But, recently, Buttler played very well in a one-day cricket series. Now, people are trying to decide if Buttler should play in Test matches again. They also wonder if he can play the same way in Test matches as he does in one-day matches. Playing like that might help him, but it would be different and could be a risk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Background: Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dali i Domenech, Marquis of Dali de Pubol (11 May 1904 - 23 January 1989), known professionally as Salvador Dali ( Catalan: [s@lb@'do d@'li]; Spanish: [salba'dor da'li]), was a prominent Spanish surrealist born in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain. Dali was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work. His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters. Context: Dali employed extensive symbolism in his work. For instance, the hallmark \\"melting watches\\" that first appear in The Persistence of Memory suggest Einstein's theory that time is relative and not fixed. The idea for clocks functioning symbolically in this way came to Dali when he was staring at a runny piece of Camembert cheese on a hot August day. The elephant is also a recurring image in Dali's works. It appeared in his 1944 work Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening. The elephants, inspired by Gian Lorenzo Bernini's sculpture base in Rome of an elephant carrying an ancient obelisk, are portrayed \\"with long, multijointed, almost invisible legs of desire\\" along with obelisks on their backs. Coupled with the image of their brittle legs, these encumbrances, noted for their phallic overtones, create a sense of phantom reality. \\"The elephant is a distortion in space\\", one analysis explains, \\"its spindly legs contrasting the idea of weightlessness with structure.\\" \\"I am painting pictures which make me die for joy, I am creating with an absolute naturalness, without the slightest aesthetic concern, I am making things that inspire me with a profound emotion and I am trying to paint them honestly.\\" --Salvador Dali, in Dawn Ades, Dali and Surrealism. The egg is another common Daliesque image. He connects the egg to the prenatal and intrauterine, thus using it to symbolize hope and love; it appears in The Great Masturbator and The Metamorphosis of Narcissus. The Metamorphosis of Narcissus also symbolized death and petrification. There are also giant sculptures of eggs in various locations at Dali's house in Port Lligat as well as at the Dali Theatre and Museum in Figueres. Various other animals appear throughout his work as well: ants point to death, decay, and immense sexual desire; the snail is connected to the human head (he saw a snail on a bicycle outside Freud's house when he first met Sigmund Freud); and locusts are a symbol of waste and fear. Both Dali and his father enjoyed eating sea urchins, freshly caught in the sea near Cadaques. The radial symmetry of the sea urchin fascinated Dali, and he adapted its form to many art works. Other foods also appear throughout his work. Question: What type of symbolism did Dali use? Answer:","completion":"Salvador Dali used extensive symbolism in his artworks, often drawing inspiration from various sources like science, religion, and personal experiences. Some prominent types of symbolism used by Dali include: 1. Melting clocks: Representing the relativity of time and influenced by Einstein's theory. This symbol first appeared in \\"The Persistence of Memory.\\" 2. Elephants: Inspired by Gian Lorenzo Bernini's sculpture in Rome, they symbolize desire and are often depicted with long, multijointed legs, creating a sense of phantom reality and distortion in space. 3. Eggs: Associated with prenatal and intrauterine themes, symbolizing hope and love. They appear in works such as \\"The Great Masturbator\\" and \\"The Metamorphosis of Narcissus.\\" 4. Animals: Various animals like ants (symbolizing death, decay, and sexual desire), snails (connected to the human head), and locusts (representing waste and fear) are present in Dali's works. 5. Sea urchins: Fascinated by their radial symmetry, Dali incorporated sea urchins into his art, drawing inspiration from his experiences with his father and their fondness for eating freshly caught sea urchins. Thus, Dali's symbolism is a vivid and imaginative blend of personal memories, emotions, and experiences, often incorporating elements of science, nature, and art history."},{"prompt":"Question: Who announce their love for each other and decide to marry?

During a ball in Moscow, she encounters the handsome Count Alexei Vronsky. Vronsky is instantly smitten and follows her to St. Petersburg, pursuing her shamelessly. Eventually, Anna surrenders to her feelings for him and becomes his mistress. Though they are happy together, their relationship soon crumbles after she miscarries his child. Karenin is deeply touched by her pain and agrees to forgive her. However, Anna remains unhappy and, to the scandal of respectable society, she openly leaves her husband for Vronsky. Using her brother as an intermediary, Anna hopelessly begs her husband for a divorce. Karenin, under the poisonous influence of her friend the Countess Lydia Ivanovna, indignantly refuses to divorce and denies Anna any access to Seriozha. Distraught by the loss of her son, Anna grows severely depressed and self-medicates with laudanum. Before long, she is hopelessly addicted. With Vronsky she has another child, but he is also torn between his love to Anna and the temptation of a respectable marriage in the eyes of society. Anna becomes certain that Vronsky is about to leave her and marry a younger woman. She travels to the railway station and commits suicide by jumping in front of a train.

They say Qatar backs militant groups including so-called Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda, which Qatar denies. The Saudi state news agency SPA said Riyadh had closed its borders, severing land, sea and air contact with the tiny peninsula of oil-rich Qatar. Qatar called the decision \\"unjustified\\" and with \\"no basis in fact\\". The unprecedented move is seen as a major split between powerful Gulf countries, who are also close US allies. It comes amid heightened tensions between Gulf countries and their near-neighbour, Iran. The Saudi statement accused Qatar of collaborating with \\"Iranian-backed terrorist groups\\" in its restive eastern region of Qatif and in Bahrain. The diplomatic withdrawal was first put into motion by Bahrain, then Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives all followed suit. SPA cited officials as saying the decision was taken to \\"protect its national security from the dangers of terrorism and extremism\\". Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain have given all Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave their territory. The three countries have also banned their citizens from travelling to Qatar. However, Saudi Arabia says it will still allow Qataris to take part in the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. So far, there has been no sign of reciprocal moves by Qatar. In the latest developments: Why this row has erupted Food, flights and football at risk While the severing of ties was sudden, it has not come out of the blue, as tensions have been building for years, and particularly in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE blocked Qatari news sites, including Al Jazeera. Comments purportedly by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani criticising Saudi Arabia had appeared on Qatari state media. The government in Doha dismissed the comments as fake, attributing the report to a \\"shameful cybercrime\\". Back in 2014, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar for several months in protest over alleged interference in their affairs. 'A Qatarstrophe' - social media reacts All you need to know about Qatar The story behind Qatar 'hack' More broadly, two key factors drove Monday's decision: Qatar's ties to Islamist groups, and the role of Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. While Qatar has joined the US coalition against IS, the Qatari government has repeatedly denied accusations from Iraq's Shia leaders that it provided financial support to IS. Wealthy individuals in the country are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hardline Islamist groups in Syria. Qatar is also accused of having links to a group formerly known as the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate. The SPA statement accused Qatar of backing these groups, as well as the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood - banned in Gulf countries as a terrorist organisation - and that it \\"promotes the message and schemes of these groups through their media constantly\\". Saudi Arabia itself is a key backer of Islamist rebels, including hardline jihadist groups, in Syria. Where key countries stand on IS Where does IS get its support? 2.7m population 2m of whom are men 11,437 sq km in size (4,416 sq miles) 77 years life expectancy (men) 80 years for women While on a visit to Riyadh two weeks ago, US President Donald Trump urged Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation, and blamed Iran for instability in the Middle East. \\"It seems that the Saudis and Emiratis feel emboldened by the alignment of their regional interests - toward Iran and Islamism - with the Trump administration,\\" Gulf analyst Kristian Ulrichsen told Reuters news agency. \\"[They] have decided to deal with Qatar's alternative approach on the assumption that they will have the [Trump] administration's backing.\\" Is Saudi to blame for IS? Saudi Arabia, too, has been accused of funding IS, either directly or by failing to prevent private donors from sending money to the group - allegations it denies. In recent days, British Prime Minister Theresa May has also come under pressure from election rivals to publish a report thought to focus on the funding of UK extremist groups by Saudi Arabia. Qatar, which is due to host the football World Cup in 2022, was critical of the decision. The foreign ministry said the decisions would \\"not affect the normal lives of citizens and residents\\". US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking in Sydney, urged the countries to resolve their differences through dialogue. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said there was a need for \\"transparent dialogue and diplomacy\\", adding: \\"No country in the region will benefit from the heightened tension.\\" Qatar's stock market closed down 7.27%. One of the likely knock-on effects is on food stability: about 40% of Qatar's food is believed to come by lorry from Saudi Arabia. The Doha News newspaper reported that people had rushed to supermarkets to stock up on food and water. Nearly 90% of Qatar's population are migrant workers, many of whom are working on the construction boom fuelled by the successful World Cup bid. There have long been tensions not far beneath the surface. Qatar has often seemed out of step with its neighbours. It has tended, for example, to side with Islamist forces in the Middle East - like the Muslim Brotherhood, which is reviled by the Saudis and the current Egyptian leadership. Past efforts by the neighbours to pull the Qataris into line have had limited impact. But now Doha has suddenly come under much greater and more co-ordinated pressure. Emboldened by President Trump's trip two weeks ago, the Saudis and the Emiratis believe that this is the moment to make clear to Qatar that its divergent views will no longer be tolerated. And right now this small country's rulers will probably be feeling very lonely indeed.

Panetta: Muslim protests leveling off, but will go on ABOARD A US MILITARY AIRCRAFT (AP) -- Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says the turmoil raging across the Muslim world is likely to continue into the days ahead, but he says the violence expected by the U.S. appears to be leveling off. He said the Pentagon has \\"deployed our forces to a number of areas in the region to be prepared to respond to any requests that we receive to be able to protect our personnel and our American property.\\" He declined to provide more details on reports that the military may be moving additional military forces so they can respond to unrest in any of a number of regions of concern. \\"I think our approach right now is to not do anything until we've been requested to do it by the State Department,\\" Panetta told reporters traveling with him to Asia. But he noted that, \\"I think that we have to continue to be very vigilant because I suspect that ... these demonstrations are likely to continue over the next few days, if not longer.\\" Meanwhile, the leader of Hezbollah has called for protests against an anti-Islam video starting on Monday but says Muslims must not attack embassies. Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said Sunday that the Shiite militant group will organize demonstrations against the film in different parts of Lebanon. Protests by furious Muslims erupted in countries around the world in recent days, with some spawning violence and even deaths over an anti-Islam video shot in California that denigrates the prophet Mohammed. In places like Libya, Sudan and Tunisia, protesters stormed U.S. embassies, and an American fast food restaurant was burned in Lebanon. In response, the Pentagon dispatched elite Marine rapid response teams to Libya and Yemen, but a team deployed to Khartoum on Friday was turned back when the Sudanese government objected. Asked about Sudan's decision, Panetta said host countries have the right to reject such military deployments. \\"My understanding is that they felt that they could provide sufficient security to be able to protect our embassy and our personnel there,\\" said Panetta. \\"And you know, in many ways, as all of you know the primary responsibility for protecting embassies rests with the host country.\\" Known as a fleet antiterrorism security teams, the units were sent in response to violent protests in Khartoum where protesters tried to climb the walls of the U.S. Embassy, setting off a battle with police. The Navy also moved two warships to positions off the coast of Libya. The two destroyers are largely meant as a show of force, but they carry Tomahawk missiles and can also be available for evacuations or other missions as needed. The intensity of the anti-American fervor initially caught U.S. leaders by surprise, but in the last several days the Obama administration has deployed military units to shore up security in hotspots, and used diplomacy to call for calm and urge foreign governments to protect American interests in their countries. It also has been unclear how much of the violence was spontaneously triggered by the film and how much of it was spurred on by anti-American militants using it as a tool to grow and enrage the crowds. The al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen praised the killing of the U.S. ambassador in Libya in an online statement Saturday and called for more attacks to expel American embassies from Muslim nations. Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, was killed Tuesday along with three other Americans, as violent protesters stormed the consulate in Benghazi. President Obama has vowed that the attackers would be brought to justice, but has also stressed that the U.S. respects religious freedom. The protests were set off by a low-budget, crudely produced film called \\"Innocence of Muslims,\\" which portrays Mohammed as a fraud, a womanizer and a child molester. A 14-minute excerpt of the film, which is both in English and dubbed into Arabic, has been available on YouTube, although some countries have cut access to the site. Panetta was traveling to Asia, where he will visit Japan, China and New Zealand. His visit comes amid escalating tensions in the region including tussles over several disputed islands in the East China Sea. It is Panetta's third trip to the region in the last 11 months, reflecting the Pentagon's ongoing effort to put a greater military focus on the Pacific region.

Turn the heat to medium and cook the bacon for a few minutes.","completion":"As the bacon begins to release its fat and turn slightly crisp, add 1 cup (150 g) of finely chopped shallots and 3 cloves of minced garlic to the skillet. Stir the ingredients together and continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes until the shallots become translucent and the garlic is fragrant, being careful not to let the garlic burn. In the meantime, wash and trim 1 pound (453 g) of fresh green beans, removing any tough ends. Set the beans aside while the bacon, shallots, and garlic are sautéing, allowing them to drain if necessary. Once the bacon, shallot, and garlic mixture is cooked, use a slotted spoon to remove the ingredients from the skillet, leaving the rendered bacon fat behind. Set the cooked bacon mixture aside on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess grease. Now, add the green beans to the skillet with the remaining bacon fat, turning the heat up slightly to medium-high. Stir fry the green beans for approximately 5-7 minutes, or until they are slightly tender but still a bit crisp. If needed, you can add some additional oil, such as vegetable or peanut oil, to ensure that the green beans cook evenly and don't stick to the skillet. While the green beans are stir-frying, mix up the sauce in a small bowl. Combine 3 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar, 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, 2 teaspoons of sugar, and 1 teaspoon of cornstarch. Whisk the ingredients together until the cornstarch has dissolved and the mixture is smooth. Once the green beans have reached the desired tenderness, add the cooked bacon, shallots, and garlic back into the skillet. Pour the sauce over the green beans and the bacon mixture, and stir to coat everything evenly. Allow the sauce to bubble and thicken for about 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep the ingredients from sticking to the skillet. The sauce should begin to coat the green beans and bacon mixture, forming a rich, glossy glaze. Once the sauce has thickened and the green beans, bacon, and shallots are heated through, remove the skillet from the heat. Taste the dish and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper if necessary. To give the dish extra flavor and color, sprinkle it with 1/4 cup (30 g) of chopped, toasted almonds for added crunch and nuttiness, and top it off with a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for an optional touch of heat. Serve the stir-fried green beans immediately, as a side dish or over steamed rice for a complete meal. Enjoy the harmonious combination of flavors – the smokiness of the bacon, the sweetness of the shallots, and the savory, umami-laden sauce all working together to elevate the fresh, crisp green beans to new heights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He comes to the realization, after he sees a six-sided hatchway close, that this isn't a meteorite but a large alien spaceship. The hatchway's noise starts a landslide that completely buries the craft. Putnam's story is later scoffed at by Sand Rock's sheriff (Charles Drake) and the local news media. Even Ellen Fields is unsure about what to believe but still agrees to assist Putnam in his investigation. Over the next several days, local people disappear; a few return, but they act distant or appear somewhat dazed.

It makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis. It makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengths or weakens the hypothesis, respectively.

John asked whether Bill left.","completion":"To evaluate the given sentence's acceptability, let's break it down step-by-step: 1. Check for syntactic acceptability: Is the sentence structured correctly and does it follow grammatical rules? The sentence has a subject (John), a verb (asked), and an embedded clause (whether Bill left). The embedded clause also has a subject (Bill), a verb (left), and a conjunction (whether) joining the two clauses. The word order and structure are grammatically correct. 2. Check for semantic acceptability: Does the sentence make sense and convey a clear meaning? The sentence conveys that John is asking about the information or the possibility of Bill having left. The individual words used have clear meanings, and the sentence communicates a coherent message. Based upon the step-by-step analysis, I can conclude that the given sentence \\"John asked whether Bill left\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\"Most of them dropped their ropes and ran in blind panic, trampling over each other in their random flight for safety.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"They were calmed and kept holding their ropes.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"Most of them dropped their ropes and ran in blind panic, trampling over each other in their random flight for safety,\\" we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"They were calmed and kept holding their ropes\\" is not true. Instead, the situation described in the premise presents a scenario that contradicts the hypothesis. The premise paints a picture of a chaotic situation in which people are panicking, dropping their ropes, running, and trampling over each other in an attempt to flee. There are several reasons why the hypothesis does not hold up in light of this premise: 1. The emotional state of the individuals in the premise is described as being in \\"blind panic.\\" This conflicts directly with the hypothesis that they were calmed. Panic implies intense fear, anxiety, and chaos, while to be calmed suggests a state of peace, relaxation, and composure. 2. In the premise, it is stated that most of the individuals dropped their ropes, which again contradicts the hypothesis. The hypothesis asserts that people kept holding their ropes, while the premise tells us that they abandoned the ropes as a result of their panic. 3. The behavior of trampling over each other further illustrates the chaotic nature of the situation depicted in the premise, indicating that the individuals are far from being calm and composed. The frantic need to escape danger took precedence over any concern for the well-being of others in the vicinity. 4. The description of their flight for safety as \\"random\\" implies a lack of order or organization, which is another characteristic that is at odds with the idea of being calmed and maintaining control of their ropes. In conclusion, based on the premise provided, we cannot assert that the hypothesis \\"They were calmed and kept holding their ropes\\" is true. The premise describes a scene of chaos and panic, with the individuals involved frantically dropping their ropes and running for safety without regard for order or the welfare of others. This type of situation is not conducive to maintaining a calm demeanor, nor does it suggest that people kept holding their ropes as hypothesized."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: meaurements on wrong side Review: The numbers on this rule should be on the inside. With them being on the outside, you can't use this rule to measure anything unless it is fully opened. With it partially opened it doesn't lie flat. Why they make it this way is beyond me. The answer is:","completion":"Dissatisfied. The customer who left this review appears to be dissatisfied with the product they purchased. There are several reasons as to why this conclusion can be drawn from the review provided: 1. Negative tone: The customer's language and tone throughout the review indicate their frustration and disappointment with the product. The use of phrases such as \\"Why they make it this way is beyond me\\" and \\"you can't use this rule to measure anything\\" clearly express their dissatisfaction. 2. Inconvenience: The main issue the customer has with the product is that the measurements are printed on the wrong side of the rule, making it impossible to use unless it is fully opened. This renders the product inefficient for its intended purpose, which is likely to contribute to the customer's overall dissatisfaction. 3. Quality concerns: The customer's comment that \\"with it partially opened it doesn't lie flat\\" indicates that they perceive the quality of the product to be lacking. This can be inferred due to their expectation that the rule should be able to lie flat even when partially opened, but it fails to do so, adding to their dissatisfaction with the product. 4. Confusion over manufacturing: The customer questions the rationale behind the design and manufacturing choices, specifically the placement of the measurements. This demonstrates their lack of understanding as to why the product was made this way, likely leading them to be even more dissatisfied. Taking these factors into consideration, it is evident that the customer who left the review was dissatisfied with their purchase. The negative tone, inconvenience caused by the design, perceived low quality, and confusion over manufacturing all contribute to their dissatisfaction with the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: From the time each of my children started school, I packed their lunches. And in each lunch I packed, I left a note. The note might be a thank-you for a special moment, or a few words of encouragement for the coming test or sporting event. When they were little, they loved their notes. And when I went back to teaching, they even put notes in my lunches. As they grew older, my elder son, Marc, told me that he no longer needed my daily notes. Telling him that he no longer needed to read them but I still needed to write them, I continued the tradition until the day he graduated. Six years after high school graduation, Marc called and asked if he could stay at home for a couple of months. He had spent those years well, and he was very successful. He lived far away from home. With his younger sister leaving for college, I was especially looking forward to seeing Marc at home. Since I was still making lunch every day for his younger brother, I packed one for Marc, too. Imagine my surprise when I got a call from my 24-year-old son, complaining about his lunch. \\"Did I do something wrong? Aren't I still your kid? Don't you love me any more, Mom?\\" he asked. I laughingly asked him what was wrong. \\"My note, Mom,\\" he answered. \\"Where's my note?\\" This year my younger son will be in high school. He, too, has said that he is too old for notes.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who played drums for the Smashing Pumpkins? The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014. Chamberlin and Iha officially rejoined the band in February 2018. The reunited lineup released...

The following year, Libyan fighters began intercepting U.S. fighter jets flying over the Mediterranean, signalling the collapse of relations between the two countries. Libyan relations with Lebanon and Shi'ite communities across the world also deteriorated due to the August 1978 disappearance of imam Musa al-Sadr when visiting Libya; the Lebanese accused Gaddafi of having him killed or imprisoned, a charge he denied. Relations with Syria improved, as Gaddafi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad shared an enmity with Israel and Egypt's Sadat. In 1980, they proposed a political union, with Libya paying off Syria's £1 billion debt to the Soviet Union; although pressures led Assad to pull out, they remained allies. Another key ally was Uganda, and in 1979, Gaddafi sent 2,500 troops into Uganda to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders. The mission failed; 400 Libyans were killed and they were forced to retreat. Gaddafi later came to regret his alliance with Amin, openly criticising him.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Muammar Gaddafi, the leader of Libya, sent soldiers into Uganda in 1979 to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"The proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on September 6, 1996, 61 Fed.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The Federal Resister published a proposed rulemaking in 1996.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"The proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on September 6, 1996, 61 Fed.\\" is true, then it supports the hypothesis \\"The Federal Register published a proposed rulemaking in 1996.\\" The premise provides specific information about a rulemaking that took place in the given year, 1996, which confirms the idea presented in the hypothesis. To further understand the connection between the premise and the hypothesis, let's break down the information in the premise. 1. The rulemaking mentioned is a \\"proposed\\" rulemaking, which indicates that it is a suggested regulation or amendment to an existing rule that was open for discussion, debate, and consideration. This proposed rulemaking could have been in its initial stage or could have been revised after taking feedback from the stakeholders or public. 2. The premise indicates that the proposed rulemaking was \\"published\\" in the Federal Register. The Federal Register is the official daily publication for rules, proposed rules, and notices from federal agencies and organizations, executive orders, and other presidential documents. As a result, the published rulemaking would have been accessible to the public, stakeholders, and other interested parties. 3. The publication date for the proposed rulemaking is mentioned as \\"September 6, 1996,\\" which falls within the given year. This point is critical in supporting the hypothesis, as it confirms that the publication of the proposed rulemaking occurred in 1996. 4. Lastly, the \\"61 Fed.\\" notation refers to the volume number of the Federal Register (Vol. 61) in which the proposed rulemaking was published. This information is significant, as it helps locate the exact document within the daily editions of the Federal Register for archival and referencing purposes. In summary, the premise \\"The proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on September 6, 1996, 61 Fed.\\" provides enough information to support the hypothesis \\"The Federal Register published a proposed rulemaking in 1996.\\" By presenting the nature of the rulemaking, its publication in the Federal Register, a specific date within 1996, and the volume number in which it appeared, the premise strengthens and corroborates the hypothesis's claim."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Final Cut Context: The serial opens with Prime Minister Francis Urquhart shooting his gun dog, now too old to perform its duties â a scene which establishes the theme of the ending of a career. Shortly afterwards, Urquhart attends the fictional state funeral of Margaret Thatcher. He publicly praises Thatcher as his mentor, but privately begrudges her record as the longest-serving prime minister in recent history,[note 1] a record that Urquhart himself is soon to surpass. To \\"leave my mark on the world,\\" Urquhart champions a treaty resolving the Cyprus dispute while secretly working to bring offshore oil deposits under the control of the Turkish authorities on the island so that a Turkish-British consortium will have the drilling rights; an executive of the consortium has promised to provide for Urquhart's retirement fund in return. Urquhart also has a personal connection to Cyprus: as a nineteen-year-old British Army lieutenant serving there in 1956, he killed two young EOKA guerrillas while trying to get information from them. Urquhart has frequent nightmares and flashbacks of this event, and also of the murders of Mattie Storin and others, shown in the previous series. On a motorway near London, Urquhart's car is rammed by another car containing three drunken louts. The attackers are quickly killed by his security staff. Urquhart sustains minor head injuries in the collision, but his life is not endangered. When Elizabeth arrives at hospital, he is delirious and confuses the incident on the motorway with the incident in Cyprus. Tom Makepeace, Urquhart's Foreign Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister, chairs a cabinet meeting while Urquhart is in hospital; Urquhart considers Makepeace â the actual negotiator of the Cyprus treaty â as a potential challenger, although he doesn't take the threat very seriously, considering him \\"not a fighter\\" but \\"a sentimental dreamer\\".

What is the title of this article: From its origins in the fur trade, the Hudson's Bay Company is the oldest corporation in North America and was the largest department store operator in Canada until the mid-1980s, with locations across the country. It also previously owned Zellers, another major Canadian department store which ceased to exist in March 2013 after selling its lease holdings to Target Canada. Other department stores in Canada are: Canadian Tire, Sears Canada, Ogilvy, Les Ailes de la Mode, Giant Tiger, Co-op, Costco and Holt Renfrew. Grocery giant Superstores carry many non-grocery items akin to a department store. Woolco had 160 stores in Canada when operations ceased (Walmart bought out Woolco in 1994). Today low-price Walmart is by far the most dominant department store retailer in Canada with outlets throughout the country. Historically, department stores were a significant component in Canadian economic life, and chain stores such as Eaton's, Charles Ogilvy Limited, Freiman's, Spencer's, Simpsons, Morgan's, and Woodward's were staples in their respective communities. Department stores in Canada are similar in design and style to department stores in the United States.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how many airports in israel Suggested answer: Plane landing at Be'er Sheva (Teyman) Should I validate this answer?","completion":"I recommend not validating this answer, as it does not accurately provide the information requested in the question. The question asks for the number of airports in Israel, while the suggested answer provides information about a specific airport without specifying the total number of airports. To provide a detailed and long answer about the number of airports in Israel, it's essential to consider various types of airports. Israel has a relatively efficient and comprehensive air transportation network, which includes both international and domestic airports as well as military airbases. The total number of operational airports in the country can also be subject to changes due to expansion, improvements, or closure. As of now, Israel has two main international airports: 1. Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV) - Located in the city of Lod, near Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion International Airport is the largest and the busiest airport in Israel. It handles both passenger flights and cargo services and serves as the main gateway for domestic and international flights. 2. Ramon International Airport (ETM) - Situated 18 kilometers north of Eilat, Ramon International Airport is a new airport that started operations in 2019. It mainly serves the southern region of Israel and functions as the main international gateway to the Red Sea resort area. In addition to these international airports, Israel operates several smaller airports for domestic flights and general aviation purposes: 1. Sde Dov Airport (SDV) - Located in Tel Aviv, Sde Dov Airport handled mostly domestic flights before ceasing its operations in 2019. Its operations were transferred to Ben Gurion International Airport. 2. Eilat Airport (ETH) - Eilat Airport formerly served the city of Eilat. It ceased operations in 2019 when the Ramon International Airport opened. 3. Herzliya Airport (HRZ) - As a small regional airport, Herzliya is primarily used for general aviation, flight training, and private flights within the country. 4. Rosh Pina Airport (RPN) - Also known as Ben Yaakov Airport, Rosh Pina Airport offers domestic flights and serves the northern region of Israel. 5. Haifa Airport (HFA) - Also known as U Michaeli Airport, this airport provides regional services, connecting Haifa to other major cities within Israel. Israel also has several smaller airstrips and military airbases, such as: 1. Palmachim Airbase 2. Nevatim Airbase 3. Ramat David Airbase 4. Hatzor Airbase 5. Ovda Airbase Please note that this list is not exhaustive and the number of airports or airbases can change over time. However, taking into account the main international and domestic airports, along with the airstrips and military airbases, there are over ten airports in Israel. This number can serve as a more appropriate answer to the original question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

His friends, the Greasers, are a gang of tough, low-income middle-class teens. The gang includes 14-year-old Ponyboy and his two older brothers, Sodapop (Lowe) and Darrell \\"Darry\\" (Swayze), as well as Johnny (Macchio), Dallas \\"Dally\\" Winston (Dillon), Two-Bit Matthews (Estevez), and Steve Randle (Cruise).

Here's a question: Where are you if you've received bbq after paying? Here are possible answers to this question: - ribs - backyard - texas - restaurant - louisiana I believe the correct choice is \\"restaurant\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"\\"restaurant\\" Step 1: Analyze the given options In this step, I'll look at each possible answer and evaluate whether it could be a suitable response to the question. Option 1: ribs Ribs are a type of food, specifically a cut of meat that is often barbecued, but the location in question is not the food itself, so this answer is eliminated. Option 2: backyard A backyard may be a location where one could have a barbecue, but typically, the act of paying for the food would not take place in this setting, since backyard barbecues tend to be more casual, so this answer is eliminated. Option 3: texas Texas is a region known for its barbecue offerings, but since it is an entire state, it does not provide a specific enough answer to where someone would receive a barbecue after paying, so this answer is eliminated. Option 4: restaurant A restaurant is a place where one can go to order food, like barbecue, and would typically pay for the meal after it is served. This option is most fitting for the situation mentioned in the question. Option 5: louisiana Louisiana is another region known for its food culture, but like Texas, it is too broad to specify a particular location where someone would receive barbecue after paying. So, this answer is eliminated.

The moon rover, known as Yutu in Mandarin Chinese, and the Chang'e-3 lander were restarted by the Beijing Aerospace Control Center (BACC), China's Xinhua news agency said. It had been set to sleep for two weeks to ride out extreme climatic conditions and will finally undertake its scientific mission. The Jade Rabbit was \\" put to sleep\\" on 26 December at the onset of the first lunar night of the mission. One night on the moon lasts for around two weeks on Earth and during this time, temperatures fall to -180degC ---conditions too cold for the equipment to function in. There is also no sunlight to power the Jade Rabbit's solar panels. Zhou Jianliang, chief engineer with the BACC, explained: \\" During the lunar night, the lander and the rover were in a power-off condition and the communication with Earth was cut off. \\" When the night ends, they will be started up with the power provided by sunlight and resume operation and communication according to preset programmes. He added that the Jade Rabbit surviving the lunar night showed Chinese technology had proved successful. The Jade Rabbit and the lander compose Chang'e-3 landed on the moon on 14 December. With the landing, China became one of only three nations to soft-land on the moon, and the first to do so in more than three decades. Scientists said the mission was designed to test new technologies and build the country's expertise of space exploration. The Jade Rabbit will gather scientific data and capture images from the Moon. China was planning further missions planned to collect lunar soil samples and it is thought officials are looking to conduct manned lunar landings if they prove successful.

The short, definite, confident strokes of a barbers straight blade moving across my face is great. I find it all very relaxing. But, I found nothing relaxing about this barber shop. When I walked in, the music was very loud latin music. It reminded me of music you hear at a night club. The towels felt more warm than hot. When I mentioned the towels weren't hot, she argued they were hot!! I'm not sure, but I think the towel might have been hot. I think she pulled it out of the hot box and ran it under hot water. The hot water isn't nearly as hot as the towel when it comes out of the hot box, so it actually would cool the towel. Not positive if that is what happened, but the towel should have been much hotter and the barber should not have argued with me. The barber was a very young woman. She took no care in applying the pre-shave oil. She did not slap it on, but I doubt I would have noticed too much of a difference if she had slapped it on. There was a quickness that felt rushed. Now the worst part....the blade across my face HURT!!!!! It hurt a LOT!!!! I made her stop. I just couldn't take it. I left with only a 1/4 of my face shaved.

The 5.2cm (two inch) coin was taken to the auction house in Dorchester, Dorset, by its owner who was unaware of its significance. The Declaration Pound, which dates from 1643, was described by auctioneers as \\"extremely rare\\". It was struck in Oxford, a year after the English Civil War broke out, at a new mint created to launch an official currency under Royalist control. Duke's Auctioneers had expected the coin to fetch £50,000. It had been handed down through several generations to the current owner, who said she did not know where it had originally come from. The coin marks Charles I's attempts to regain his failing power from the Parliamentarians led by Oliver Cromwell. A legend inscribed on the back of the coin in Latin reads: \\"Let God arise and let his enemies be scattered\\". It is seen as a declaration of the king's power and his belief in absolute monarchy. According to the National Archives, £1 in 1640 would have been worth £85.80 in 2005.

If you're in a relationship with a player, you're probably not the only woman he's seeing. Making your relationship public will make it easier for his lies to be exposed to both you and the other women, and for that reason, he'll usually reject the idea of being public about it. The way he treats you in public will be one good indication. If he refuses to treat you with any special affection or treats you just as affectionately as other women, it might be his way of keeping your relationship a secret. To that end, he might also avoid spending time with you in certain places if he thinks there's a better chance of being caught there. Check social media accounts, too. If he refuses to be “friends” or “followers” with you, or if he never responds to any public comments you make toward him, it could be a sign that he's trying to hide your relationship. Refusing to update his “relationship status” might be another social media clue. Try to spend time with his friends. Most players won't want you anywhere near their friends, and it won't be because they're afraid of another man stealing you away. If he lets you meet his friends, he takes the risk that someone within the group will slip and reveal information about his true self. If you do meet his friends, watch his behavior around them. Some players will drop their guard and show their true colors when they're hanging around their buddies. Invite him to meet your friends and family. Since a player isn't serious about you, he will usually refuse such offers or make excuses to get out of them at the last minute. Moreover, friends and relatives with a keen eye might be able to spot a player when they see one. A player who agrees to meet your loved ones would have to take the risk of being discovered by someone like that. Ask around about the guy and find out if there are any rumors about him. People in his own social circle might cover for him, but anyone who isn't attached to him won't have a need to do so. Ask your close friends to do their own investigating on your behalf, as well. They probably have a few connections you don't have, and one of those connections might have helpful information. You could even consider talking with the guy's ex-girlfriends, but do so with caution. Some exes will intentionally paint a bad picture as an act of revenge. Additionally, an ex-girlfriend who believes that you “stole” the guy away from her may take out her negative feelings on you. Players lack respect for you, but that's because they lack respect for everyone. It can be difficult to tell when a guy is disrespecting you, but it'll probably be easier to detect disrespect he shows toward others. Pay particular attention to the way he treats and talks about other women. Even disrespect he shows toward female relatives can indicate an overall sense of disrespect toward women in general. Watch how he treats workers at the places you visit, too. Players may relish in the authority they have over these staff members.","completion":"The article discusses how to identify if one is in a relationship with a \\"player,\\" highlighting signs such as the individual's reluctance to make the relationship public, noncommittal social media interactions, hesitation to introduce you to their friends due to the risk of their true character being exposed, unwillingness to meet your loved ones, and general lack of respect towards you and others; it also suggests seeking information about the person through your social network and observing their behavior towards other women and service industry workers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through the inscription or recording of signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language but a form of technology that developed as tools developed with human society. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is generally called \\"text\\", and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems. - An illustrator is an artist who specializes in enhancing writing or elucidating concepts by providing a visual representation that corresponds to the content of the associated text or idea. The illustration may be intended to clarify complicated concepts or objects that are difficult to describe textually, which is the reason illustrations are often found in children's books. - Charles Copeland ( 1858 -- 1945 ) was an American book illustrator active from about 1887 until about 1940 . He was a member of the Boston Watercolor Society and the Boston Art Club . His illustrations were used in a variety of books . - An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \\"Artiste\\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.

BBC presenter Chris Evans, CarFest's founder, confirmed his death and said the pilot's family had been informed. A visibly upset Mr Evans delivered a statement saying the display pilot had been killed in a \\"tragic accident\\". The Heritage Aircraft Trust, operator of the Gnat Display Team, said in a statement: \\"Kevin was a Royal Air Force-trained fast jet pilot whose enthusiasm for flying the Folland Gnat was infectious. \\"He will be greatly missed by his family, the team and many friends. \\"Kevin leaves a wife and young daughter.\\" Mr Whyman, who was born in Chester, is a Cambridge University economics graduate. He trained with the university's boat club and coxed Cambridge to victory in the 1996 and 1997 boat races against Oxford. He had a career with the RAF from 1998 to 2001, when he left for a trading job with a US investment bank in the City of London. He completed his civilian flying licences so that he could continue with his passion for flying. BBC producer Justin Bones, on the scene at Oulton Park, said two planes performed a low-level, close-proximity pass just before the crash. One of the aircraft failed to pull up and crashed north of the circuit, he said. Mr Evans said: \\"The event will continue on the advice of the three aviation authorities we are currently involved with, as part of the ongoing investigation to what happened. \\"And the police have also advised us that the best thing, and the safest thing to do, is to carry on with the event, bearing in mind there are 10,000 children here, and that's what we are going to do.\\" Cheshire Police say they are working to establish how the accident happened. Eyewitnesses described horrified spectators screaming as the plane nosedived suddenly. Witness Steve Gluning, who works with aircraft, said: \\"It's an airshow and it's dangerous. You know these things can happen but when they happen in front of you it's shocking. \\"We were at the CarFest, my partner and I. Two Gnats came in. Five or six minutes doing individual and pair displays. They did a crossover. One went north and the other, I saw it jink. It went past the trees. Two or three seconds later there was a fireball. \\"Instantly, you know that could be fatal.\\" Tessa Angel was watching the display with her husband. \\"We saw two planes flying, weaving side by side. One was at a strange angle. My husband said: 'That's low. I hope he comes back up.' Then it went down,\\" she said. \\"People were staring, asking what happened. I didn't see any parachute. There were sirens within seconds, then a helicopter hovering.\\" Aviation expert Julian Bray said the type of Gnat plane involved in the crash had been around since 1955. Peter Collins, a test pilot and former RAF pilot based in Cheshire, is familiar with the aircraft. He told the BBC: \\"I flew it during training. I rate it as one of the best aeroplanes I've ever flown. \\"It was designed as a fighter that was later turned into a trainer.\\" CarFest's organisers said in a statement: \\"Our thoughts are with the family of the pilot and all those affected at this time. \\"We have helpfully received images and footage captured by those close to the site, which will aid with the police investigation. \\"Should anyone else have similar photo or video footage, they are asked to keep hold of it in case the authorities request further information.\\" An Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) spokesman said: \\"AAIB will be investigating and is sending a team to the site.\\" Mr Evans, a car enthusiast who has just become the new presenter of BBC Top Gear, created the motoring and music festival, which raises money for BBC Children in Need. Other celebrities attending CarFest included TV chefs James Martin, Tom Kerridge and Paul Hollywood. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Kevin Whyman, a 39-year-old pilot, was tragically killed when his Folland Gnat aircraft crashed near Oulton Park during a display at CarFest. Chris Evans, the founder of CarFest and BBC presenter, confirmed the pilot's death and announced that his family had been informed. The Heritage Aircraft Trust, operator of the Gnat Display Team, released a statement mourning Whyman's death, stating that his enthusiasm for flying the Folland Gnat was infectious. Whyman had a career with the RAF from 1998 to 2001 and held a civilian flying license. Despite the tragedy, the event continued under the advice of the three aviation authorities involved in the ongoing investigation and the police. Cheshire Police are still working to establish how the accident occurred, and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch is also investigating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 103.50 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.80 males. Question: How many percent were not 65 years of age or older? Answer:","completion":"In the given population statistics, 25.60% of the population were under the age of 18, 9.20% were between 18 to 24 years old, 32.20% were between 25 to 44 years old, and 22.30% were between 45 to 64 years old. The remaining percentage, 10.70%, were 65 years of age or older. To find the percentage of the population not belonging to the 65 years or older age group, we simply subtract the percentage of people who are 65 years or older from the total population percentage, which is 100%. So, we have 100% (total population percentage) - 10.70% (percentage of people 65 years old or older) = 89.30% Therefore, 89.30% of the population were not 65 years of age or older."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Information: - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - In ecology, a niche is a term with a variety of meanings related to the behavior of a species living under specific environmental conditions. The ecological niche describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of resources and competitors (for example, by growing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (for example, limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey). \\"The type and number of variables comprising the dimensions of an environmental niche vary from one species to another [and] the relative importance of particular environmental variables for a species may vary according to the geographic and biotic contexts\\". - In biological classification, subspecies (abbreviated \\"subsp.\\" or \\"ssp.\\"; \\"plural\\": \\"subspecies\\") is either a taxonomic rank subordinate to species, or a taxonomic unit in that rank. A subspecies cannot be recognized independently: a species will either be recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two (including any that are extinct). - The bamboos are evergreen perennial flowering plants in the subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae. In bamboo, as in other grasses, the internodal regions of the stem are usually hollow and the vascular bundles in the cross section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement. The dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent. The absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of monocots, including the palms and large bamboos, to be columnar rather than tapering. - In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \\"taxonomy\\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Michelia is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Magnolia family ( Magnoliaceae ) . The genus includes about 50 species of evergreen trees and shrubs , native to tropical and subtropical south and southeast Asia ( Indomalaya ) , including southern China . - In biological classification, rank is the relative level of a group of organisms (a taxon) in a taxonomic hierarchy. Examples of taxonomic ranks are species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain, etc. - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - Beijing (formerly romanised as Peking) is the capital of the People's Republic of China and the world's third most populous city proper. It is also one of the world's most populous capital cities. The city, located in northern China, is governed as a direct-controlled municipality under the national government with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighbouring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast; together the three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China. - Magnolia is a large genus of about 210 flowering plant species in the subfamily Magnolioideae of the family Magnoliaceae. It is named after French botanist Pierre Magnol. - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants. - Liriodendron is a genus of two species of characteristically large deciduous trees in the magnolia family (Magnoliaceae). - The Magnoliales comprise an order of flowering plants. Classification. The Magnoliales include six families: - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - The Magnoliaceae are a flowering plant family, the magnolia family, in the order Magnoliales. It consists of two subfamilies: Magnolioideae, of which \\"Magnolia\\" is the most well-known genus, and Liriodendroidae, a monogeneric subfamily, of which \\"Liriodendron\\" (tulip trees) is the only genus. - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds. - In botany, an evergreen is a plant that has leaves throughout the year, always green. This contrasts with deciduous plants, which completely lose their foliage during the winter or dry season. There are many different kinds of evergreen plants, both trees and shrubs. Evergreens include: - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, identification and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis. - In biology, a species complex is a group of closely related species that are very similar in appearance to the point that the boundaries between them are often unclear. Terms sometimes used synonymously but with more precise meanings are: cryptic species for two or more species hidden under one species name, sibling species for two cryptic species that are each other's closest relative, and species flock for a group of closely related species living in the same habitat. As informal taxonomic ranks, species group, species aggregate, and superspecies are also in use. - Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\" \\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans).

Delius was born in Bradford in Yorkshire. He was baptised as \\"Fritz Theodor Albert Delius\\", and used the forename Fritz until he was about 40. He was the second of four sons (there were also ten daughters) born to Julius Delius (1822–1901) and his wife Elise Pauline, née Krönig (1838–1929). Delius's parents were born in Bielefeld, Westphalia, of Dutch origin; the family had for some generations been settled in German lands near the Rhine. Julius's father, Ernst Friedrich Delius, had served under Blücher in the Napoleonic Wars. Julius moved to England to further his career as a wool merchant, and became a naturalised British subject in 1850. He married Elise in 1856.The Delius household was musical; famous musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Carlo Alfredo Piatti were guests, and played for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz was drawn to the music of Chopin and Grieg rather than the Austro-German music of Mozart and Beethoven, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller of the Hallé Orchestra, and had more advanced studies under Mr. George Haddock of Leeds. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at Bradford Grammar School, where the singer John Coates was his slightly older contemporary. He then attended the International College at Isleworth (just west of London) between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to the city for Delius to be able to attend concerts and opera.Julius Delius assumed that his son would play a part in the family wool business, and for the next three years he tried hard to persuade him to do so.

Cohan, was an American entertainer, playwright, composer, lyricist, actor, singer, dancer and producer. Cohan began his career as a child, performing with his parents and sister in a vaudeville act known as \\"The Four Cohans.\\" Beginning with Little Johnny Jones in 1904, he wrote, composed, produced, and appeared in more than three dozen Broadway musicals. Cohan published more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including the standards \\"Over There\\", \\"Give My Regards to Broadway\\", \\"The Yankee Doodle Boy\\" and \\"You're a Grand Old Flag\\". Context: From 1899 to 1907, Cohan was married to Ethel Levey (1881-1955; born Grace Ethelia Fowler), a musical comedy actress and dancer. Levey and Cohan had a daughter, actress Georgette Cohan Souther Rowse (1900-1988). Levey joined the Four Cohans when Josie married, and she starred in Little Johnny Jones and other Cohan works. In 1907, Levey divorced Cohan on grounds of adultery. In 1908, Cohan married Agnes Mary Nolan (1883-1972), who had been a dancer in his early shows; they remained married until his death. They had two daughters and a son. The eldest was Mary Cohan Ronkin, a cabaret singer in the 1930s, who composed incidental music for her father's play The Tavern. In 1968, Mary supervised musical and lyric revisions for the musical George M!. Their second daughter was Helen Cohan Carola, a film actress, who performed on Broadway with her father in Friendship in 1931. Their youngest child was George Michael Cohan, Jr. (1914-2000), who graduated from Georgetown University and served in the entertainment corps during World War II. In the 1950s, George Jr. reinterpreted his father's songs on recordings, in a nightclub act, and in television appearances on the Ed Sullivan and Milton Berle shows. George Jr.'s only child, Michaela Marie Cohan (1943-1999), was the last descendant named Cohan. She graduated with a theater degree from Marywood College, Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1965. From 1966 to 1968, she served in a civilian Special Services unit in Vietnam and Korea. In 1996, she stood in for her ailing father at the ceremony marking her grandfather's induction into the Musical Theatre Hall of Fame at New York University. Cohan was a devoted baseball fan, regularly attending games of the former New York Giants.

Angelina appeared in two seasons of the Jersey Shore (out of a total of six seasons) with an intermittent presence. In Season 1, she left halfway through the season. After being evicted from the house by her roommates, Angelina exited the show during the third episode due to her reluctance to work her mandatory shift at the T-shirt store, which was a rule for all house residents. Subsequently, Angelina made a surprising comeback for Season 2, which was filmed in Miami Beach, Florida. However, her return was short-lived as well, as she encountered several conflicts among her fellow cast members, leading to her departure from the show in the tenth episode.

I had high hopes for this book but was completely let down and actually returned it. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"The review depicts the product in an unflattering light for several reasons. Firstly, it is specifically mentioned that this book is only suitable for absolute beginners and holds little value for anyone with existing knowledge of proper eating habits. This statement narrows down the book's target audience, limiting its potential appeal. Secondly, the reviewer implies that the author might have been influenced by corporate interests. This raises doubts about the objectivity and credibility of the content, which can negatively impact the readers' trust in the given advice and recommendations. Additionally, the lack of alternative options or flexibility in food choices may cause accessibility issues for potential readers who do not have access to specific food types or brands. This constraint can discourage people from attempting to follow the suggestions given, hindering their ability to benefit from the book's content. Furthermore, the reviewer describes the workout regimen in the book as \\"completely basic and rudimentary,\\" which implies a lack of innovation or depth in the exercise program. The mention that it may only be suitable for those who have never worked out before or the elderly suggests that the book might be too simplistic for anyone looking for a more challenging or sophisticated workout routine. Lastly, the fact that the reviewer ultimately decided to return the book highlights their dissatisfaction with the product, therefore reinforcing the unflattering depiction of the product. In conclusion, this review presents the product in an unflattering light, painting a picture of a book with limited appeal, lack of flexibility, and questionable credibility, offering little value to its readers, except for those who are entirely new to proper eating and working out."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jimmy Hi, Jimmy, As far as I know, people who have lived abroad often find that the adjustment to returning home is more difficult than their adjustment to living in a foreign culture. Why? We expect to have some problems when we go to a new place, speak a different language and learn the rules of a different culture ... But home? ... we know that place! Your parents expect that the same person who boarded the airplane one year ago will be returning. Especially if they have never been abroad themselves, your parents probably won't understand the changes that living abroad can cause in a person. On the other hand, you may have maintained an ideal mental image of your loved ones while abroad, an image that is broken into pieces when you return. Remember you have been living a different lifestyle in your host country, and you have probably become very independent while staying there alone. Now that you're home, you will be expected to conform again to the lifestyle of your family. As a result, you may be upset about your parents' involvement in your life. Communication is the key to overcoming this problem. Tell your parents how you are feeling. Share with them information about cultural re-entry , and ask them to be patient.

Write a summary based on this article: Nobody told Moody’s it was a holiday-shortened week. After cutting Greece’s credit rating and warning that it was putting Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo under review, the ratings agency took aim at Uncle Sam Thursday afternoon. Moody’s said that if U.S. lawmakers do not make progress on raising the debt ceiling, it “expects to place the US government’s rating under review for possible downgrade, due to the very small but rising risk of a short-lived default.” Raising the ceiling would preserve the Aaa rating, but the outlook could be altered due to longer-term debt concerns, Moody’s said, noting that without a fiscal consolidation plan over the coming weeks the likelihood of progress before the 2012 election is slim. According to Moody’s the implications of the jawboning in Washington are: 1) The likelihood that Moody’s will place the US government’s rating on review for downgrade due to the risk of a short-lived default has increased. Since the risk of continuing stalemate has grown, if progress in negotiations is not evident by the middle of July, such a rating action is likely. The Secretary of the Treasury has indicated that the government will have to drastically reduce expenditure sometime around August 2 if the debt limit is not raised; the initiation of a rating review would precede this date. 2) If a debt-ceiling-related default were to occur, Moody’s would likely downgrade the rating shortly thereafter. The extent of and length of time before a downgrade would depend on how factors surrounding the default affect the government’s fundamental creditworthiness, including (a) the speed at which the default were cured, (b) an assessment of the effect of the default on long-term Treasury borrowing costs, and (c) measures put in place to prevent a recurrence. However, a rating in the Aa range would be the most likely outcome. Any loss to bondholders would likely be minimal or non-existent, as Moody’s anticipates that a default would be cured quickly. 3) If default is avoided, the Aaa rating would likely be affirmed after any review. Whether the outlook on the rating would be stable or negative would depend upon whether the outcome of the negotiations included meaningful progress toward substantial and credible long-term deficit reduction. Such reduction would imply stabilization within a few years and ultimately a decline in the government’s debt ratios, including the ratio of debt to GDP. Moody’s Updates on Rating Implications of US Debt Limit, Long-Term Budget Negotiations. Thursday’s move by Moody’s comes after rival Standard & Poor’s lowered its outlook on America’s ability to repay its debts in April. (See “Little Surprise In S&P’s Negative Outlook On U.S. Debt Rating.”) Those concerns are not being born out in the market to date. The 10-year Treasury yield is just a shade over 3% Thursday. Anyone that was waiting on a ratings agency action to realize that the U.S. is in troubling fiscal shape, or who thinks that such action will suddenly strike up a desire for compromise on Capitol Hill, probably has bigger troubles. ||||| “We didn’t create this mess,” one Republican told Mr. Geithner, according to a person in the room. Independent analyses have shown that more than half of the 14.3 trillion debt is from policies enacted during the past decade when Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress, and much of the rest from lost revenues and stimulus spending and tax cuts since Mr. Obama took office at the height of the financial crisis and recession . Mr. Geithner, as he left the Capitol, told reporters: “I’m confident two things are going to happen this summer. One is we are going to avoid a default crisis. And we are going to reach agreement on a long-term fiscal plan.” Representative Austin Scott, the Georgia Republican who is the leader of the freshman class, said after the meeting that House Republicans had a “fundamental” difference with Democrats on taxes: instead of new tax revenues, the Republicans want additional tax cuts to increase economic growth. Still, he said, “I think we are all hopeful we will get to a resolution.” Earlier, Mr. Obama and Mr. Geithner met privately with House Democrats at the White House about debt-reduction matters, following a similar session on Wednesday with House Republicans. “Just as he discussed with the Republican caucus, the president highlighted the need for both parties to work together to take a balanced approach to deficit reduction, one that allows us to live within our means without hurting our ability to invest in the future or burdening our middle class or seniors,” an administration official said. House Democrats said they would support Mr. Obama if he reached a compromise with Republicans that included long-term spending cuts, but not to Medicare benefits, as well as higher tax revenues, according to those briefed on the meeting.

View all New York Times newsletters. The House speaker, John A. Boehner , said in a statement, “The White House needs to get serious right now about dealing with our deficit and debt.” He interpreted the Moody’s report as bolstering his contention that “a credible agreement means the spending cuts must exceed the debt-limit increase.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Moody’s, however, made no mention of how a deficit-reduction deal should be structured. The Moody’s report was unexpected. In April, Standard & Poor’s lowered its outlook for the AAA rating on United States debt — but not the rating itself — to negative from stable. Moody’s cautionary note was more pointed in that it was pegged to the current political maneuvering over the debt limit and it urged a resolution weeks sooner than the White House and Congressional leaders were aiming for. Its warning was two-pronged. First, Moody’s said, if Congress does not increase the Treasury ’s borrowing authority in coming weeks, the nation’s credit rating may be lowered “due to the very small but rising risk of a short-lived default.” That is likely to translate into higher interest rates at a time when the recovery shows signs of slowing again. And second, Moody’s said, with an implicit slap at both parties, that whether the United States keeps its triple-A rating “will depend on the outcome of negotiations on deficit reduction.” “Although Moody’s fully expected political wrangling prior to an increase in the statutory debt limit, the degree of entrenchment into conflicting positions has exceeded expectations,” the company’s statement said. “The heightened polarization over the debt limit has increased the odds of a short-lived default.” The goal of the bipartisan budget talks that Mr. Obama initiated in April, led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , has been to reach agreement on deep long-term spending cuts by Aug. 2. That is when the Treasury Department has said it will run out of accounting maneuvers to meet the nation’s financial obligations without breaching the 14.3 trillion debt limit, which would provoke a crisis, even default. House Republicans have said they will not agree to an increase without parallel action on spending cuts of an even greater amount. The debt limit would have to be raised 2.4 trillion to carry the government through 2012. Republican leaders engineered a vote on Tuesday evening in which the House voted overwhelmingly not to increase the debt limit. They said that was their way of proving to Democrats that a rise in the debt limit could not pass without spending cuts attached. The Democrats countered that Republicans were risking an adverse market reaction by staging the vote, knowing it would fail. Stock markets did fall more than 2 percent on Wednesday, but analysts generally attributed the slump to the day’s disheartening economic reports and anticipation that the government’s monthly jobs report on Friday would also be disappointing. ||||| “The heightened polarization over the debt limit has increased the odds of a short-lived default,” Moody’s said in an analysis. The Obama administration says a failure to reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling by Aug. 2 will lead the government to default on some of its obligations. If that happens, Moody’s said it was likely to lower the rating, driving up the cost the U.S. government must pay investors to borrow money. The AAA rating identifies the United States as one of the world’s safest investments — and has helped the government borrow at extraordinarily cheap rates to finance its operations. Moody’s warning followed an earlier one from Standard & Poor, another credit rating agency, which lowered the U.S. debt outlook in April to “negative” from “positive,” signaling that a downgrade was possible. So far, investors have shown little concern about the prospect of default. But Moody’s said that it thinks a deal on raising the debt ceiling is less and less likely. Moody’s report comes as President Obama and congressional Republicans are in tense negotiations. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner met with nearly 100 House freshmen — the vast majority Republicans — to press them for an increase in the debt limit. House freshmen have continued to question his warnings of a catastrophic default if the debt ceiling isn’t raised by Aug. 2. “At the end of the day, there is no certainty even on the date, from my perspective,” said Rep. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), one of the leaders of the House freshmen. He pointed out that Geithner had earlier given a different date for a possible default. But Treasury Department officials said the Moody’s report supported Geithner’s warnings about a default on Aug. 2. “This simply underscores the need for Congress to move quickly to ensure that the United States can meet all of its obligations, while continuing to work on a consensus approach towards long term fiscal balance,” said Mary Miller, assistant Treasury secretary for financial markets. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) also found ammunition in the Moody’s report. He noted that it described the discussions over the debt ceiling as an opportune moment for the government to produce a long-range plan for cutting the federal budget deficit. Moody’s said the long-term credit rating would depend on the development of such a plan. “This report makes clear that if we let this opportunity pass without real deficit reduction, America’s financial standing will be at risk,” Boehner said. “A credible agreement means the spending cuts must exceed the debt limit increase.” Geithner’s meeting with House freshmen had been scheduled before the Moody’s announcement. After the session, freshman Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) said that she had drafted a letter to Obama asking for a detailed deficit-reduction plan that could be evaluated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and for a contingency plan in case Congress does not raise the debt ceiling by Aug. 2. Other Republicans sounded an upbeat note. “We obviously have a very serious economic situation that we’re in right now, and we’re going to solve it,” said Rep. Austin Scott (Ga.), the House freshman class president. “And as far as we’re concerned, everything that we got in there from him was a step in the right direction, that we’re having an open and honest dialogue on how we move forward.” ||||| WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Moody’s Investors Service on Thursday issued a mild warning to Congress and the White House over negotiations to lift the debt ceiling, saying that the outlook on the U.S. government’s Triple-A rating could be cut if “substantial” deficit reduction hasn’t occurred. In what effectively was a warning about issuing a warning, Moody’s said it would place the U.S. government’s rating under review for possible downgrade on the “very small but rising risk of a short-lived default.” The Treasury Department said it would exhaust all funds by Aug. 2 if the debt ceiling is not lifted by then, in which case a default on existing obligations becomes a possibility. Click to Play ‘Obama has failed America’ Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney kicks off his Republican presidential campaign in New Hampshire with criticism of President Obama. The rating agency says it’s concerned about the talks. “Although Moody’s fully expected political wrangling prior to an increase in the statutory debt limit, the degree of entrenchment into conflicting positions has exceeded expectations,” the agency said. And it would likely downgrade the U.S. if a debt ceiling-related default were to occur, probably to the Aa range. “Any loss to bondholders would likely be minimal or non-existent, as Moody’s anticipates that a default would be cured quickly,” Moody’s said. But the Moody’s announcement goes further into the terms of any deal to lift the debt ceiling. “The debt limit negotiations represent a real near-term opportunity for agreement on a plan for fiscal consolidation. If this current opportunity passes, Moody’s believes that the likelihood of anything significant being accomplished before the next presidential election is reduced, in part because the two parties each hopes to capture both a congressional majority and the presidency in the 2012 election, after which the winning party could achieve its own agenda,” the rating agency said. The White House and Congressional Republicans have agreed that any deal to increase the debt ceiling will include spending cuts, though the sides disagree on the scope and nature. President Barack Obama met with House Democrats on Thursday after a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday. House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) said the Moody’s announcement “reinforces” the point that major spending cuts are needed alongside a debt ceiling increase. The Treasury Department meanwhile said the Moody’s announcement underscores the need for Congress to quickly raise the debt ceiling. Moody’s rival, Standard & Poor’s, already has put the U.S. Triple-A debt rating under review. See story on Standard & Poor's move. The bond market so far has shrugged off worries about the U.S. ability to repay debt, as bond yields on 10-year debt on Wednesday sunk below 3% on concerns over stagnating economic growth. Steve Goldstein is MarketWatch's Washington bureau chief. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Moody's warned of putting the US government's credit rating under review for a possible downgrade if lawmakers do not make progress on raising the debt ceiling. This comes after rival Standard & Poor's lowered its outlook on America's ability to repay its debts in April. The possible downgrade is tied to the risk of a short-lived default, which has increased with the stalemate in debt negotiations. Moody's stresses the importance of both parties working together for substantial and credible long-term deficit reduction to stabilize and eventually lower the government's debt ratios, including the ratio of debt to GDP."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Being less than perfectly well-dressed in a business setting can result in a feeling of great discomfort that may well require treatment to eliminate (remove). And the sad truth is that \\"clothing mismatches\\" on the job can ruin the day of the person who is wearing the inappropriate attire --and the people with whom he or she comes in contact. Offices vary when it comes to dress codes. Some businesses have very high standards for their employees and set strict guidelines for office attire, while others maintain a more relaxed attitude. However, it is always important to remember that no matter what your company's attitude is regarding what you wear, you are working in a business environment and you should dress properly. Certain items may be more appropriate for evening wear than for a business meeting, just as shorts and a T-shirt are better suited for the beach than for an office environment. Your attire should reflect both your environment and your position. A senior vice president has a different image to maintain than that of a secretary or sales assistant. Like it or not, you will be judged by your personal appearance. This is never more apparent than on _ , when what you wear can say more about you than any business suit ever could. In fact, people will pay more attention to what you wear on dress-down days than on \\"business professional\\" days. Thus, when dressing in \\"business casual\\" clothes, try to put some good taste into your wardrobe choices, and recognize that the \\"real\\" definition of business casual is to dress just one notch down from what you would normally wear of business-professional attire days.

Available options: i. yes. ii. it is not possible to tell. iii. no.","completion":"The premise \\"They're too different\\" does indeed tell us something about the hypothesis in consideration, \\"They are not similar enough for this task.\\" That's because the premise and the hypothesis are significantly linked. The term \\"too different\\" in the premise means the gap or difference between the subjects (probably two things or people) in question is overly significant or considerable. Meanwhile, the expression \\"not similar enough for this task\\" in the hypothesis suggests there's a need for close resemblance or similarity, which isn't present. Hence, we can say there's a strong relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise of being \\"too different\\" generates enough evidence to entail the hypothesis \\"They are not similar enough for this task.\\" This connection arises because both scenarios highlight a profound lack of resemblance, similarity, or equivalency. Therefore, if the premise holds true, it's very likely that the hypothesis is true for the same reason. This particular reasoning falls into the premise-logical-consequence relationship, where a true premise directly influences the validity of a hypothesis or conclusion.

The Antenna itself is unusable. Is this product review negative? pick from the following. [-] Yes [-] No Answer:","completion":"Yes The review of the DX antenna can be categorized as negative. The reason being that the consumer has expressed dissatisfaction with more than one aspect of their purchaser's journey. Firstly, the customer points out the poor packaging, a crucial aspect of any good delivery system. Effective packaging not only secures the product during transportation but also boosts the customer's perception of the business. Poor packaging, therefore, not only poses a risk to the product being delivered in optimal condition but also erodes consumer trust. It would seem that in this case, the poor packaging rendered a negative impression on the customer. Secondly, the customer states that the product was \\"damaged when received,\\" to the extent that the antenna was unusable. This statement from the customer implies that the product's primary purpose couldn't be fulfilled due to the damage it incurred, which is a strong negative sentiment. This drives the point that the customer's needs and wants were not satisfied by the purchase. This also suggests a failure in delivery and quality control processes that let a damaged product be shipped and delivered to the customer. Therefore, considering these significant elements of dissatisfaction - namely, the poor packaging and the delivery of a damaged, unusable product, this product review can comprehensively be classified as negative. It reflects poorly on the seller, the product itself, and the associated delivery method. It may deter potential customers from buying this product and affect the seller's reputation negatively. It's recommended that the seller addresses such buyer's concerns promptly and effectively to recover lost trust and improve their service."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Negative numbers should come before positive numbers. Q: [{'first': 56, 'second': -44}, {'first': 15, 'second': -77}] A:","completion":"Part #1: A list of dictionaries. Usage: [{'first': 56, 'second': -44}, {'first': 15, 'second': -77}] Explanation: In the sample input provided, we have a list that contains two dictionaries. Each dictionary has the keys 'first' and 'second' with respective integer values. Part #2: Sort the list of dictionaries from smallest to largest by their 'first' key. Usage: [{'first': 15, 'second': -77}, {'first': 56, 'second': -44}] Explanation: The list has been sorted based on the 'first' key values. The dictionary with 'first': 15 comes before the one with 'first': 56. Part #3: If there is two dictionaries with the same 'first' value then sort them by their 'second' key. Usage: [{'first': 15, 'second': -77}, {'first': 15, 'second': 10}, {'first': 56, 'second': -44}] Explanation: If there were two dictionaries with the same 'first' value, like 15 in this example, then the one with the smaller 'second' value (-77) comes before the one with the larger 'second' value (10). Part #4: Negative numbers should come before positive numbers. Usage: [{'first': -8, 'second': -3}, {'first': 0, 'second': 2}, {'first': 15, 'second': -77}, {'first': 56, 'second': -44}] Explanation: When sorting the list of dictionaries both based on 'first' and 'second' key values, the negative numbers should come before the positive numbers. In this example, the list is sorted with the dictionary containing 'first': -8 (a negative number) coming before dictionaries with positive 'first' values.

There are many festivals in Australia. The most important one is obviously Christmas. Each year, the summer holidays at every high school last about two months from the beginning of December to February, which covers the Christmas time. Since it is a long holiday, most overseas students love to fly back to their home countries to spend the time with their families and friends, but a few students still stay in Australia during the holiday to get part-time jobs. It is quite easy to find a part-time job at Christmas. Students often take part in another major social activity. They go to the beach to have fun in the sunshine.

Michael John Harrison (born 26 July 1945), known for publication purposes primarily as M. John Harrison, is an English author and literary critic. His work includes the Viriconium sequence of novels and short stories (1971-1984), Climbers (1989), and the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy, which consists of Light (2002), Nova Swing (2006) and Empty Space (2012). He is widely considered one of the major stylists of modern fantasy and science fiction, and a \\"genre contrarian\\". The Times Literary Supplement described him as 'a singular stylist' and the Literary Review called him 'a witty and truly imaginative writer'. Harrison was born in Rugby, Warwickshire, in 1945 to an engineering family. His father died when he was a teenager and he found himself \\"bored, alienated, resentful and entrapped\\", playing truant from Dunsmore School (now Ashlawn School). An English teacher introduced him to George Bernard Shaw which resulted in an interest in polemic. He ended school during 1963 at age 18; he worked at various times as a groom (for the Atherstone Hunt), a student teacher (1963-65), and a clerk for the Royal Masonic Charity Institute, London (1966). His hobbies included electric guitars and writing pastiches of H. H. Munro. His first short story was published during 1966 by Kyril Bonfiglioli at Science Fantasy magazine, on the strength of which he relocated to London. He there met Michael Moorcock, who was editing New Worlds magazine. He began writing reviews and short fiction for New Worlds, and by 1968 he was appointed books editor. Harrison was critical of what he perceived as the complacency of much genre fiction of the time. During 1970, Harrison scripted comic stories illustrated by R.G. Jones for such forums as Cyclops and Finger. An illustration by Jones appears in the first edition of Harrison's The Committed Men (1971). In an interview with Zone magazine, Harrison says \\"I liked anything bizarre, from being about four years old. I started on Dan Dare and worked up to the Absurdists. At 15 you could catch me with a pile of books that contained an Alfred Bester, a Samuel Beckett, a Charles Williams, the two or three available J. G.

Deal became the bassist and backing vocalist for Pixies in January 1986, after answering an advertisement in the Boston Phoenix that said, \\"\\"Band seeks bassist into Husker Du and Peter, Paul and Mary. Please - no chops.\\" Deal was the only person to call them, even though her main instrument was guitar. She borrowed her sister Kelley's bass guitar to use in the band. To complete the lineup, she suggested they hire David Lovering as drummer, a friend of her husband, whom she met at her wedding reception. For the release of the band's first recording Come on Pilgrim (1987), Deal used the nom de disque \\"Mrs. John Murphy\\" in the liner notes. She chose the name as an ironic feminist joke, after conversing with a lady who wished to be called only by her husband's name as a form of respect. For Surfer Rosa (1988), Deal sang lead vocals on the album's only single, \\"Gigantic\\" ( sample ), which she co-wrote with Black Francis.

Paragraph: Background: An outbreak of leishmaniosis was studied in cats and dogs housed together with no separation in an animal shelter in Israel. The study included recording of clinical signs, serology for Leishmania infection by ELISA, PCR of blood for Leishmania DNA by ITS1 HRM and kDNA PCR, parasite quantification, and trapping of sand flies around the shelter. Results: Thirty-seven % (22/60) of the dogs and 75% (50/67) of the cats were seropositive to L. infantum with a significantly higher seropositivity rate in the cat population (χ 2 = 42.160, P < 0.0001). Twenty-five percent (15/60) of the dogs were positive for Leishmania by blood PCR, 12% by the Leishmania ITS1 HRM PCR and 22% by kDNA PCR. Of the cats, 16% (11/67) were positive by kDNA PCR and none by ITS1 HRM PCR. All the PCR-positive animals were infected by L. infantum verified by DNA sequencing and there was no significant difference between the PCR-positivity in the dog and cat populations. Altogether, 43% (26/60) of the dogs and 79% (53/67) of the cats were positive by serology or PCR for L. infantum. The average Leishmania parasite load in the blood of PCR-positive dogs (42,967 parasites/ml) was significantly higher than in PCR-positive cats (1259 parasites/ml) (t (12) = 2.33, P = 0.037). Dogs that were positive by the Leishmania ITS1 HRM PCR and kDNA PCR had significantly higher parasite loads than dogs positive only by the kDNA PCR (t (11) = − 3.186580, P < 0.009). No significant effect was found for FIV seropositivity on Leishmania infection in the cats (χ 2 = 0.506, P = 0.777). A higher percentage of Leishmania-positive dogs showed clinical signs compatible with leishmaniosis compared to Leishmania-positive cats (100 vs 52.8%, χ 2 =15.242, P < 0.0001). Phlebotomus perfiliewi, a proven vector of L. infantum, comprised 92% of trapped sand flies. Comparisons of populations of cats and dogs exposed to sand flies and L. infantum under the same conditions indicated that although a high rate of exposure was detected in cats as manifested by a significantly greater degree of seropositivity, dogs had significantly higher blood parasite loads, and were likely to be more infectious to sand flies than cats.

Article: BY SALENA ZITO szito@tribweb.com It’s been 40 years since Republicans have gone to their convention without a clear nominee, but when they did, Pennsylvania was right at the heart of the struggle – because of the state’s unusual process of assigning delegates. Pennsylvania’s primary contest is unlike others. For years, the Keystone State primary has been a “preferential primary” – simply a beauty contest – and had no connection whatsoever to delegate selection. It’s not winner-take-all. It’s not winner-take-most. It’s not even proportional. The vast majority of Pennsylvania’s Republican delegates are technically “unbound” or “uncommitted.” Used to be they all were, but this year party rules changed slightly, making 14 “at large” delegates bound to vote for the winner of the PA Primary, but on the first ballot only. There are also three “automatic” delegate slots for the state party chairman (Rob Gleason), the National Committeeman (Bob Asher) and National Committeewoman (Christine Toretti). The remaining 54 delegates, elected by Republican primary voters in each of Pennsylvania’s 18 congressional districts (three per district) remain legally “uncommitted.” They are not bound to vote for any particular candidate and are free to exercise their own judgment in selecting a nominee. They may have their own preferences and loyalties, but they appear on the primary ballot without any indication of what those might be. That means there is no guarantee – whatsoever – that the majority of Pennsylvania’s delegates will go with the winner of the Pennsylvania primary. It has happened before. “Pennsylvania’s huge bloc of uncommitted delegates would be pivotal in a contested convention. Pennsylvania would be in the center of every discussion and at the heart of every action,” said Charlie Gerow, a Harrisburg based media strategist. Gerow had a front-row seat to the importance of Pennsylvania’s unique delegate set-up as a member of Ronald Reagan’s political team in the last contested GOP convention in 1976. The 1976 primary race between Reagan and Gerald Ford was so close that Reagan chose Pennsylvania Senator Dick Schweiker as his running mate far in advance of the convention, believing it would help him siphon delegates from Ford. But the delegates – all legally uncommitted – were effectively controlled by Drew Lewis, who held the delegation for Ford, according to Gerow. “Four years later, Lewis devised and executed the strategy that won Reagan the majority of the delegates in that year’s Pennsylvania primary even though (Reagan) lost the primary to George H.W. Bush,” Gerow explained. In 1980, Ronald Reagan lost the primary popular vote to Bush by about 100,000 votes, but he took the lion’s share of delegates because of the state’s unique rules – and thus won the only part of the primary that counts. In short, Donald Trump could win the popular vote in Pennsylvania but lack the organizational infrastructure to fill a slate of delegates who support his candidacy. To date, Marco Rubio had the most impressive organization for getting supporting delegates on the ballot. The John Kasich campaign had been reaching out to people on the ballot even before Rubio dropped out. Gerow has attended 10 consecutive conventions – more than any other Pennsylvanian Republican. He has been a delegate three times and is on the ballot again. “I am currently undecided,” he said, having been an early supporter and national co-chair of Carly Fiorina’s presidential campaign. This story was first posted 1:32 p.m. Thursday, March 17 Comments ||||| HERSHEY, Pa. — Ted Cruz declared definitively on Wednesday that the fight for the Republican presidential nomination is “definitely headed to Cleveland,” where, he said, “the people are going to prevail.” “Nobody's getting 1237 [delegates] – Donald knows that. We’re headed to a contested convention,” Cruz told NBC News while shaking hands after his rally here in a state with 71 delegates up for grabs in next Tuesday's primary. “The reason why he has so many of his media surrogates repeating the mantra that the race has got to be over now is because he knows he cannot earn a majority of the delegates in Cleveland,” Cruz continued, calling Trump “a fringe and marginal candidate.\\" Play Facebook Twitter Embed Ted Cruz: We're fighting for the young people 3:11 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog Cruz exited New York’s primary without winning a single delegate, nearly mathematically vanishing his ability to win the nomination before the convention – a standard he often used last month to indirectly suggest John Kasich and, then, Marco Rubio should leave the race. Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do.” Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2016 But Trump – in order for him to win outright and avoid heading to a contested convention -- would still have to win 57 percent of the remaining delegates. The Cruz campaign is now turning its attention to Pennsylvania, where 54 unbound delegates are in play next Tuesday. A top Cruz campaign aide, while acknowledging the narrative is unfavorable to Cruz in the northeast, said it’s “highly likely” Cruz will pull at least 30 delegates out of Pennsylvania. “Donald and the media want to convince everyone that Pennsylvania is a suburb of Manhattan,” said Cruz, adding: “That's their telling -- Manhattan has spoken and Pennsylvania will quietly file into obedience.” The crowd defiantly jeered before Cruz finished his thought: “You know what, I've got a lot more faith in the people of Pennsylvania.” Play Facebook Twitter Embed Cruz: I've got 'more faith in the people of Pennsylvania' 1:24 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog While addressing the crowd, Cruz reframed the race and the role of Pennsylvania’s delegates, exclaiming he’ll “take ‘em” next week. A campaign aide told NBC News it does not anticipate beating Trump in the popular vote in the state, meaning Cruz would lose out on its 17 at-large delegates, which go to the victor. Polls currently show Cruz losing by around 20 percentage points. But each of the state’s 18 congressional districts will elect three delegates to the national convention. The Cruz campaign is pushing a slate of Cruz-loyalists for 26 of the 54 unbound slots up for the taking. It says others eligible on the ballot to become delegates, particularly longtime state activists able to win on their name alone, have committed to Cruz as well. Cruz has personally met with several of the potential delegates. At Cruz’s Hershey rally, the campaign passed out a flier telling people to “please vote for the delegates in your congressional district that are pledged to support [Cruz] at the convention.” The Cruz campaign passed out a flier telling people to “please vote for the delegates in your congressional district that are pledged to support [Cruz] at the convention.” Frank Thorp/NBC News Those delegates will be able to vote for whichever candidate they desire at the national convention in Cleveland, but the Cruz campaign says it recruited these specific individuals this winter to run as delegates after they pledged to vote for Cruz on the convention floor. The campaign is now looking to target particular congressional districts where it sees itself as having the most viable opportunities to coalesce its supporters around its pre-designated slate of delegates. “As you look at Erie, central Pennsylvania, look at the districts in southwestern Pennsylvania, you’re going to see a lot of Senator Cruz in those areas over the next few days,” said Lowman Henry, the state chair for Cruz, who compared the politics of the state to Wisconsin, where Cruz won big two weeks ago. Patti McCorkle, a mother who attended Cruz’s rally at Hershey’s antique car museum, defended the state’s delegate system, adding she hoped “it’ll work out in this day and age to give us a Ted Cruz presidency.” And citing the Constitution, she noted: “Ted Cruz is for strong states’ rights – as per the Constitution – and the states get to choose how their delegates are going to be chosen and how they’re going to use those delegates.” ||||| Pennsylvania, which holds its primary next Tuesday, uses a nonbinding “loophole” primary — and that could cost Donald Trump the Republican nomination. If the state adopted the delegate rules of any other primary, he would probably be an even-money favorite, or better, to amass the 1,237 delegates needed before the convention. Instead, his chances may come down to the whims of 54 unpledged Pennsylvania delegates. No other state leaves so many of its delegates unbound — allowed to vote for whomever they please at the convention. That’s because it conducts its loophole primary in two parts. First is the “beauty contest,” which is a presidential primary preference vote. The winner of the beauty contest gets all of Pennsylvania’s 17 at-large and bonus delegates. But the remaining 54 — the three delegates awarded to each congressional district — are unbound and elected in the delegate selection primary. In this part, voters directly elect delegates to the national convention. What makes Pennsylvania’s G.O.P. delegate selection primary so distinctive is that the ballot includes no guidance on whom a delegate will support at the national convention (the prospective Democratic delegates commit to a candidate). A voter will just see a list of names — some of whom might be recognizable, but others might as well be Joe Schmo. |||||Summary:","completion":"Pennsylvania's primary contest is unlike other states, as the majority of its Republican delegates are technically unbound or uncommitted which means that they are not tied to voting for any particular candidate and can exercise their own judgment in selecting a nominee. This makes Pennsylvania significant in a contested convention and is important to the current GOP race. In this context, Texas Senator Ted Cruz has declared that the fight for Republican presidential nomination is definitely headed for a contested convention in Cleveland. Pennsylvania holds its primary next Tuesday and Cruz has turned his attention to the state, telling a rally that Donald Trump and the media want to convince everyone that Pennsylvania is a suburb of Manhattan, which he does not believe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The sentence states that a grapefruit can roll a greater distance across an orchard compared to one rolling across a cannery. Step 2: Understand the question. The question is asking which surface (orchard or cannery) will cause the grapefruit to get hotter. Step 3: Make assumptions if necessary. Since we are given no information on the temperature difference between the orchard and the cannery, nor how they might affect the grapefruit, we must make an assumption to solve the problem. Let's assume that the temperature of the grapefruit depends on the rolling distance and the difference between the two surfaces doesn't affect the temperature directly. Step 4: Apply the assumption to the given sentence. Following our assumption, a grapefruit rolling a greater distance in the orchard will generate more heat due to friction between the grapefruit and the ground. Step 5: Compare options A and B. Option A (orchard) aligns with our assumption that the longer rolling distance results in the grapefruit getting hotter. Option B (cannery) suggests the opposite.

В настоящее время экономика многих стран Европы имеет сравнительно хорошую динамику, и это обусловлено рядом особенностей и факторов. Прежде всего, стоит отметить стабильность политических и экономических систем на континенте. Большинство государств Европы функционирует на основе свободного рынка и демократии, что создает устойчивые условия для экономического роста. Благодаря развитой инфраструктуре, привлекательным для инвестиций ставкам налогообложения и высокой квалификации рабочей силы, страны Европы способны привлекать инвестиции из разных частей мира. Инвестиции, в свою очередь, создают рабочие места и способствуют увеличению экономической активности. Европейский союз, как крупнейший интеграционный блок, сыграл значимую роль в поддержании благоприятных экономических условий на континенте. Введение единой валюты – евро – сделало более прозрачным валютный обмен и улучшило экономическую интеграцию между странами-участницами. Кроме того, ЕС использует систему единого рынка, которая позволяет товарам, услугам, капиталу и рабочей силе двигаться свободно между странами-членами, содействуя тем самым экономическому росту. Несмотря на несколько глобальных экономических кризисов, в том числе и последний, вызванный пандемией COVID-19, страны Европы продемонстрировали умение справляться с неблагоприятными ситуациями. Комплексные программы финансовой поддержки и стимулирования экономики помогли сохранить множество рабочих мест и предприятий на континенте. Таким образом, несмотря на преодоленные и текущие экономические трудности и вызовы, многие страны Европы продолжают уверенно двигаться по пути развития.

Jeb said yes, he would have, and so would many other people at that time. But then some people, even those who liked him, said they did not agree with him. One person, named Chris Christie, said if he knew back then what he knows now, he would not have made that choice. This made Jeb think about what he said. Later, Jeb talked to a man named Sean Hannity, and told him that maybe he did not understand the question right the first time. He thought the question was about what people knew back then, not what they know now. So he didn't really know what he would do if he had today's knowledge. Jeb agreed that some mistakes were made in the past, and it was important to learn from them.

Part 2: Determine the relationship between the sentences (entailment, neutral, contradiction) Usage: Analyzing sentence_A and sentence_B and figuring out whether they entail, contradict, or neither (neutral). In this example, both sentences describe a man and two women in a room with candles and a table. However, there are differences in lighting and positions (standing vs. sitting). Since the sentences do not clearly agree or disagree with each other, the relation is deemed neutral. Part 3: Encode the relationship as a numeric value (0, 1, or 2) Usage: Assigning the value 1 to represent a neutral relationship between sentence_A and sentence_B.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Pick a wall that allows the whole room to see the TV and will provide the best picture quality and won’t be affected by sunlight coming in from windows. You also need to consider the position of the furniture in the room and what direction they face. Because you need to screw holes into the wall to mount your LCD TV, be sure of your placement before you begin mounting it! In a living room, the center of the wall across from the main entranceway allows for a wider viewing angle. Place your TV on the wall where it’s most likely to be at eye level when you’re viewing it. If you plan to mostly watch it while sitting on the sofa you’ll want to place it lower than you would if you plan to mostly watch it while standing or at a bar. Use a ruler or tape measure to measure from the floor to the best height to put the TV at eye level and lightly mark the height with a pencil. Placing your TV with the center at 42 inches (110 cm) off the ground will put the screen at eye level with the average adult sitting down. If you plan to view the TV more often while standing, then mount it with the center of the TV 53 inches (130 cm) from the ground. Mount the TV as close to eye level as possible if there’s an obstruction such as an existing appliance or piece of furniture. The cables and wires of your TV and any devices you plan to connect to it can be unsightly. When you’re picking a place to mount your TV, think about how difficult it will be for you to conceal them to help inform your decision. Centering the TV on a bare wall in the center of the room may make it difficult for you to hide the wires. Use furniture placement to help conceal the wires. You need to have a clear area to work in when you’re mounting your LCD TV. Slide over any chairs, tables, or sofas so you can access the wall easily. Take down any paintings, pictures, or decor so they’re out of your way. Gently place the items that were hanging on the wall nearby so you don’t crack or break them. Take down anything hanging on the wall so they can’t wobble, shake, or potentially fall when you’re drilling into the wall.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Since the abolition of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\", and writing: Some minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling.

They could either agree to disagree on the name selection, or perhaps even reconsider the chosen name based on Riley's input. 4.

Sentence 1: A bunch of people twirled past me, dancing. Sentence 2: People were doing the salsa. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine the truth of the second sentence, we need to consider the relationship between the two sentences and the context in which they are presented. Both sentences describe people's actions in a context of dancing. However, they do not specifically mention the same group of people or the same moment in time. In sentence 1, people are described as twirling past the speaker, which suggests a type of dance that includes spinning or rotational movements. Twirling is a general term that can apply to various forms of dance, including but not limited to salsa dancing. This sentence does not specify the style of dance that people are engaging in, but it provides information about the nature of the movement (twirling). In sentence 2, the action becomes more specific - people are stated to be doing the salsa. Salsa, as a distinct style of dance, has identifiable and characteristic movements that include twirling, among other elements. However, it is important to note that the second sentence does not specify that the people doing the salsa are the same as the ones mentioned in the first sentence or that these two instances are happening at the same time. Given this information, we can determine that if sentence 1 is true, it is possible, but not guaranteed, that sentence 2 is also true. The truth of the second sentence depends on whether or not the twirling people in the first sentence are indeed engaging in salsa dancing. In conclusion, while there is some overlap in the actions described in the two sentences, the truth of the first sentence does not automatically guarantee the truth of the second sentence. More information and context would be required to deduce whether the second sentence is true."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions? ? In July 1873 the U.S. Navy dispatched USS Juniata to Greenland, to search for survivors from the Polaris expedition which had disintegrated after the death of its leader, Charles Francis Hall. Juniata's second-in-command was George W. De Long, a 28-year-old graduate of the United States Naval Academy, making his first visit to the Arctic. Ice conditions prevented Juniata from advancing beyond Upernavik; De Long volunteered to take the ship's tender, a small steamer named the Little Juniata, in the hope of finding survivors at Cape York, a further 400 nautical miles (740 km) north.The attempt failed; Little Juniata faced extreme weather conditions, and was forced to retreat a few miles from Cape York. De Long returned to Juniata in mid-August, having found no trace of the Polaris crew—who had meanwhile been rescued by the Scottish whaler SS Ravenscraig—but the experience had profoundly affected his outlook. Having earlier described the Greenland coast in a letter to his wife Emma as \\"a dreary land of desolation ... I hope I may never find myself cast away in such a perfectly God-forsaken place\\", he returned home captivated by the Arctic. Emma wrote: \\"The polar virus was in his blood and would not let him rest\\".The abortive Little Juniata mission brought De Long to public notice, and he saw himself as a possible leader of the next U.S. Arctic expedition. He approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions. Grinnell was not prepared to offer financial support, instead advising De Long to approach James Gordon Bennett Jr., owner and publisher of the New York Herald and a known sponsor of bold schemes. De Long met Bennett in New York early in 1874; the newspaperman was impressed by De Long, and assured him that his Arctic ambitions would have the enthusiastic support of the Herald. In the meantime De Long had applied to the Navy Department for an Arctic command, a request that he was informed would \\"receive due attention\\".

Service dogs almost never leave the side of the people they care for. You will see them working on buses, trains and other public transport systems. But the busy environment in an airport can trouble even the best trained working dog. People with disabilities depend on their dogs. They also need the dogs to remain calmly on duty on the airplane, even when the flight is not smooth. This takes special training. The Air Hollywood K9 Flight School is one place where such help can be found. The school has a piece of equipment that provides the sights, sounds and even the feel of an airplane in flight.

Answer:","completion":"Randy Jackson, an accomplished musician, songwriter, and producer, is best known for his role as a judge on the hit television series \\"American Idol.\\" However, in the early 1980s, he was also a member of the iconic rock band Journey. In Journey, Randy Jackson played bass guitar and contributed backing vocals during his brief tenure with the band. Jackson was a member of Journey for a short period between 1985 and 1987. He was brought in to replace founding member and bassist Ross Valory after some internal conflicts within the band. During this time, Journey underwent a slight lineup change, as the band was transitioning from its height of success in the early 1980s to a period of uncertainty. As the band's bassist, Jackson played on their ninth studio album \\"Raised on Radio,\\" which was released in May 1986. The album, produced by lead vocalist Steve Perry, features some of Jackson's best work as a bassist. With his signature groove, he added depth to songs such as \\"Be Good to Yourself,\\" \\"I'll Be Alright Without You,\\" and \\"Girl Can't Help It.\\" Despite some negative reviews regarding the album's commercial sound, \\"Raised on Radio\\" achieved platinum status and peaked at #4 on the Billboard 200 chart. Simultaneously, Jackson contributed to Journey's live performances during this era. The band embarked on a North American tour called the \\"Raised on Radio Tour\\" between 1986 and 1987 to support the album. Thanks to his remarkable musical skills, Jackson quickly became an essential part of the live shows, even though his tenure with the band was short-lived. Unfortunately, Journey disbanded temporarily in 1987 due to personal issues and a need for a break. Consequently, this marked the end of Randy Jackson's time with the band. When they regrouped in 1991, Ross Valory returned to his role as Journey's bassist. In summary, Randy Jackson played bass guitar and provided backing vocals in Journey during a pivotal time in their history. He performed on the \\"Raised on Radio\\" album and participated in the subsequent tour. Although his time in Journey was brief, his talent and contributions to the band should not be overlooked. Today, Randy Jackson is fondly remembered for his work with the band, along with his long and successful career in the music industry."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Paul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants. They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\".

Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham. Helfeld refused to give his name when he joined the company, so he was listed on the time sheets as \\"Elephant\\" in reference to his bulk.

Answer the following question: Information: - Berman and Company is a Washington , D.C. based public affairs and non-profit management firm founded by lawyer and former lobbyist Rick Berman . In addition to its public relations clients , Berman and Company runs several industry - funded non-profit organizations such as the Center for Consumer Freedom , the Center for Union Facts , and the Employment Policies Institute . The non-profits have worked on issues including obesity , health care , food safety , labor law , alcohol , and government regulation . The firm is known for campaigns that include aggressive advertising , opposition research , and online communications . - The Employment Policies Institute is a fiscally conservative non-profit American think tank that conducts research on employment issues such as minimum wage and health care. It was established in 1991 and has been described as \\"a nonprofit research group that studies issues of entry-level employment.\\" - Public relations (PR) is the practice of managing the spread of information between an individual or an organization (such as a business, government agency, or a nonprofit organization) and the public. Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment. This differentiates it from advertising as a form of marketing communications. Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free, rather than marketing or advertising. An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article. The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them to maintain a certain view about the organization, its leadership, products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, businesses and companies, government, government agencies and public officials as PIOs and nongovernmental organizations, and nonprofit organizations. Jobs central to public relations include account coordinator, account executive, account supervisor, and media relations manager. - Public interest, according to the \\"Random House Dictionary\\", is \\"1. the welfare or well-being of the general public; commonwealth. 2. appeal or relevance to the general populace: a news story of public interest.\\" - A think tank, policy institute, or research institute is an organization that performs research and advocacy concerning topics such as social policy, political strategy, economics, military, technology, and culture. Most policy institutes are non-profit organizations, which some countries such as the United States and Canada provide with tax exempt status. Other think tanks are funded by governments, advocacy groups, or businesses, or derive revenue from consulting or research work related to their projects. - NeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s. Originally known as \\"SunDew\\", its primary authors were James Gosling and David S. H. Rosenthal. The NeWS interpreter was based on PostScript (as was the later Display PostScript, although the two projects were otherwise unrelated) extending it to allow interaction and multiple \\"contexts\\" to support windows. Like PostScript, NeWS could be used as a complete programming language, but unlike PostScript, NeWS could be used to make complete interactive programs with mouse support and a GUI. - A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. - The Center for Union Facts (CUF) is an American interest group that is critical of labor unions. It is one of several advocacy and public relations groups founded by Richard Berman, whose Washington, D.C.-based public affairs firm, Berman and Company, specializes in research, communications and advertising. - An advocate is a type of professional person in several different legal systems and it is also a commonly used \\"honorific\\" for remarkable lawyers, such as in \\"Adv. Sir Alberico Gentili\\". The broad equivalent in many English law-based jurisdictions can be a \\"barrister\\". However, in Scottish, South African, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Scandinavian, Polish, South Asian and South American jurisdictions, advocate is also a word to indicate lawyers of superior classification.

Jesse Donald Knotts was born in Morgantown, West Virginia, the youngest of four sons born to farmer William Jesse Knotts and his wife, Elsie Luzetta Knotts (nee Moore). His parents were married in Spraggs, Pennsylvania. His English paternal ancestors immigrated to America in the 17th century, originally settling in Queen Anne's County, Maryland. Knotts' brothers were named Willis, William, and Ralph. In 1960, Andy Griffith was offered the opportunity to headline his own sitcom, The Andy Griffith Show (1960-1968). Knotts took the role of Barney Fife, the deputy--and originally cousin--of Sheriff Andy Taylor (portrayed by Griffith). Knotts's portrayal of the deputy on the popular show earned him five Emmy Awards for Best Supporting Actor in a Television Comedy, three awards for the first five seasons that he played the character. A summary of the show from the website of the Museum of Broadcast Communications describes Deputy Barney Fife: Self-important, romantic, and nearly always wrong, Barney dreamed of the day he could use the one bullet Andy had issued to him, though he did fire his gun on a few occasions. He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever frustrated that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the sense that he couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons. When the show first aired, Griffith was intended to be the comedic lead with Knotts as his straight man, similar to their roles in No Time for Sergeants. However, it was quickly discovered that the show was funnier with the roles reversed. As Griffith maintained in several interviews, \\"By the second episode, I knew that Don should be funny, and I should play straight.\\" Knotts believed remarks by Griffith that The Andy Griffith Show would end after five seasons, and he began to look for other work, signing a five-film contract with Universal Studios. He was caught off guard when Griffith announced that he would continue the show after all, but Knotts's hands were tied. In his autobiography, Knotts admitted that he had not yet signed a contract when Griffith announced his decision; but he had made up his mind to move on, believing he would not get the chance again. Knotts left the series in 1965. His character's absence on the show was explained by Deputy Fife's having finally made the \\"big time,\\" joining the Raleigh, North Carolina police force. When did the show run for","completion":"The Andy Griffith Show ran for eight seasons, from October 3, 1960, to April 1, 1968.

Given the following context: The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Given the question \\"What will Kendall want to do next?\\", is \\"make a chicken\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"No, \\"make a chicken\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will Kendall want to do next?\\" after spending all day cooking a pot roast. Firstly, when considering the context provided, it is clear that Kendall has devoted significant time and effort into preparing the pot roast. The phrase \\"all day\\" suggests that the process has been lengthy, and the information that the roast is \\"finally\\" done implies a sense of completion and satisfaction. Therefore, it is unlikely that Kendall would immediately want to undertake another potentially time-consuming cooking task, considering that one has already been completed. Furthermore, pot roast is generally considered a main dish that is wholesome and filling on its own. It is more plausible that Kendall would be interested in preparing accompaniments to the pot roast, such as side dishes, a salad, or a sauce that complements the dish. Alternatively, Kendall might want to set the table, serve the pot roast, and perhaps enjoy eating the meal with family or friends. Additionally, it is important to consider the logical sequence of events. It is more reasonable to assume that, after spending all day cooking a dish, Kendall would likely want to focus on the next steps that involve sharing and enjoying the meal, rather than immediately starting another cooking project. This could include cleaning up, storing leftovers, or discussing the pot roast with others. Finally, even if Kendall were interested in making a chicken dish in the near future, it would most likely be planned for a separate mealtime (such as the following day) rather than immediately after finishing the pot roast. Cooking and preparing multiple dishes simultaneously is usually done for special occasions, large gatherings, or when catering for a group with diverse dietary preferences. In this context, there is no indication that any of these scenarios apply. Taking all of these factors into account, \\"make a chicken\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will Kendall want to do next?\\" after spending all day cooking a pot roast. Instead, a more appropriate answer might involve serving the pot roast, enjoying the meal, or preparing complementary dishes to enhance the dining experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the subject(s) and verb(s) in the sentence. Subject: The boy Bill, who I watched (referring to Bill) Verb: was 2. Check for agreement between the subject(s) and verb(s). The subject \\"The boy Bill, who I watched\\" agrees with the verb \\"was\\" since it is a singular subject. 3. Analyze the sentence structure and determine if it is clear and logical. \\"The boy Bill\\" forms a clear subject. However, the phrase \\"who I watched\\" appears as an interruption in the sentence and can be rephrased as \\"whom I watched\\" to ensure proper grammar as the object of the verb \\"watched.\\" The adjective \\"vain\\" describes the noun \\"Bill,\\" which is appropriate in context. 4.

MUST WATCH Former NFL star Sharper turns himself in 00:29 The New Orleans charges are in addition to charges Sharper already faces in California. Nunez turned himself in to the Orleans Parish district attorney's office shortly after 9 a.m. Friday. Last week, Sharper pleaded not guilty to the California charges, which included two counts of rape by use of drugs. CNN reached out to an attorney for Sharper and to Nunez Thursday, but neither returned messages seeking comment. Prosecutors in Louisiana said the two alleged rapes occurred on September 23 in a New Orleans apartment. The alleged rapes in California occurred in October and last month, authorities said. Prosecutors there said the five-time Pro Bowl player, who became an NFL Network analyst, is also under investigation in Arizona and Nevada. Police in Tempe, Arizona, say they expect to file charges against Sharper soon. \\"We have nothing yet. We anticipate filing charges very shortly and we are still waiting on a couple of results from the crime lab,\\" Sgt. Mike Pooley said Thursday. Las Vegas police said Friday that \\"an active and ongoing investigation surrounding Darren Sharper\\" was being conducted by the department's sexual assault unit. Police provided no other details. In addition, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said. According to the report, the woman was with two friends at a Miami Beach club in September or October 2012 when she met Sharper. The woman, her friends and another person went to Sharper's condo, where the woman claims the battery took place. Miami Beach police are investigating the case, Miami Beach Detective Vivian Hernandez said last week. One of Sharper's lawyers disputed all the rape allegations last week at his hearing. \\"It was all consensual contact with women who wanted to be in his company,\\" Leonard Levine said. Sharper played for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints from 1997 through the 2010 season. ||||| Former NFL safety Darren Sharper, right, huddles with attorney Blair Berk in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Feb. 20. Sharper has pleaded not guilty to charges that he drugged and raped two women he met at a West Hollywood nightclub. (Bob Chamberlin / AP / ) New Orleans police have obtained an arrest warrant for former NFL football player Darren Sharper, who is already charged with drugging and sexually assaulting two women in Los Angeles and raping two others in New Orleans. In addition to Sharper, detectives and investigators with the Orleans Parish district attorney's office obtained an arrest warrant for 26-year-old Eric Nunez, described as an acquaintance of the former football player. Sharper is now accused of raping at least eight woman and committing a sexual battery against a woman in Miami. New Orleans police had previously said they were investigating at least one rape allegation against Sharper. Authorities revealed that detectives had learned that two woman were allegedly assaulted by Sharper, both on the night of Sept. 23. \\"New information uncovered also indicates that Nunez allegedly raped both women at the same location,\\" said Remi Braden, a department spokeswoman. In issuing a statement Thursday, the department noted that the crime of aggravated rape carried a potential life sentence of hard labor. Los Angeles County prosecutors charged Sharper with two counts of rape and five other drug charges in connection with two incidents in October and January. He is being investigated in Las Vegas; Tempe, Ariz.; and another in New Orleans. Sharper, 38, who has pleaded not guilty, was ordered to surrender his passport, stay in Los Angeles and avoid all women. He is free on 1-million bail. “We look forward to the true facts being revealed in this case and we are hopeful that Mr. Sharper will be fully exonerated before this case is concluded,” Blair Berk, one of Sharper's attorneys, has said. Court documents allege a disturbing pattern in the incidents, which occurred between Sept. 22 and Jan. 15. Victims reported meeting the five-time Pro Bowl player -- usually at a nightclub -- then going back to his hotel room or home. Sharper allegedly offered the women shots to drink, after which they reported immediately blacking out. Many of the women woke up with little or no memory of what happened after the drinks, but felt as though they had been sexually assaulted, authorities said.

They're especially common in athletes, because they often result from overuse and repetitive stresses, such as those that long-distance runners endure. Sudden increases in activity can also cause stress fractures. For example, if you're usually fairly sedentary but take a hiking holiday, you might end up with a stress fracture. Osteoporosis and certain other conditions that affect bone strength and density make you more prone to stress fractures. Trying to do too much too soon can cause stress fractures. For example, if you're new to exercise and start trying to run a 10k every week, you could end up with a stress fracture. If you feel pain in your foot or ankle that eases when you rest, you may have a stress fracture. If the pain gets worse during normal everyday activities, it's a good sign you have a stress fracture. The pain will also get worse over time. The pain may feel deep inside your foot, toe, or ankle. Pain isn't just weakness leaving your body. If you experience consistent foot pain, especially if it's even during everyday activities or persists when you rest, see your doctor. Ignoring it could lead to worse injury. If you have a stress fracture, you may notice that the top of your foot is swollen and tender to the touch. Swelling may also occur on the outside of the ankle. Sharp pain when you touch an area of your foot or ankle isn't normal. If you experience pain or tenderness when you touch your foot, see your doctor. Bruises don't always occur with stress fractures, but they can. You may be tempted to \\"tough it out\\" with the pain from a stress fracture, but don't. If you do not seek treatment for a stress fracture, it can get worse over time. The bone may even break completely.

At 138 stories (1,800Â ft/550Â m), it is the world's tallest building. Shortly after his arrival, an electrical short starts an undetected fire on the 81st floor. While Roberts accuses the building's electrical engineer, Roger Simmons of cutting corners, Simmons insists the building is up to standards. During the dedication ceremony, public relations chief Dan Bigelow is ordered to turn on the tower's exterior lights to impress the guests and dignitaries. The lighting overloads the electrical system and Roberts orders it shut off. Smoke is seen on the 81st floor and the San Francisco Fire Department is summoned. Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to the 81st floor but fail to prevent a security guard opening a door, leading to a fire flash which burns Giddings (and who is later disclosed to have died). Roberts reports the fire to a dismissive Duncan, who refuses to order an evacuation. Ill-equipped firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze, which soon spreads out of control. SFFD Chief Michael O'Halloran forces Duncan to evacuate the guests in the Promenade Room on the 135th floor, directing them to express elevators. A guest, Lisolette Mueller, who is being wooed by con man Harlee Claiborne, rushes to the 87th floor to check on a young family. Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to stay under budget. Duncan, aided by Senator Parker and Mayor Ramsey, directs the elevator evacuation from the Promenade Room until the fire renders the express elevators unsafe. Not heeding Duncan's directions, one last group takes an elevator to the ground, but are killed when it stops on the fire's floor. The fire also traps Bigelow and his secretary/mistress Lorrie in his 65th floor office, killing them. Security Chief Harry Jernigan and Roberts rescue Mueller and the family from 87.

Q:Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot. Which lake had fewer dissolved nutrients? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, High Lake had fewer dissolved nutrients due to the presence of stratified water layers which limited the mixing of nutrients from the benthos to the photic zone.

They boast over five hundred species of birds, and thousands of species of plants. Across the pond in England the situation is completely different. Centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls have made it one of the least biodiverse place on Earth. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would the ecosystem functions be less or more stable in England than in Nicaragua? Answer:","completion":"The ecosystem functions would likely be less stable in England than in Nicaragua. This is primarily due to the significant differences in biodiversity between the two countries. Biodiversity plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and resilience of ecosystems. A higher level of biodiversity ensures that a wide range of species is present, interacting with each other and the surrounding environment in complex ways that keep the ecosystem balanced and functional. This allows ecosystems to better withstand disturbances, such as natural disasters, climate change, or human activities, and recover more quickly from such events. As mentioned in the paragraph, Nicaragua is known for its rich biodiversity, with numerous species of birds, plants, and other organisms inhabiting its various ecosystems. In contrast, England has suffered from the effects of intensive farming, industrialization, and urbanization, which have significantly reduced its biodiversity. As a result, England's ecosystems are likely to be less stable and resilient compared to those in Nicaragua. In a less diverse and stable ecosystem, such as England's, the loss or decline of even a single species can have a more detrimental impact on the overall functionality and balance of the ecosystem. On the other hand, a highly biodiverse ecosystem like Nicaragua's may be more robust in the face of stressors because the numerous species present can fill in gaps and maintain ecological processes even if some species are lost or their populations decline."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

[4]. Summer.","completion":"In July, Australians experience winter. Therefore, the correct answer is option [3]. Winter. The seasons in Australia, just like any other location on Earth, are determined by the Earth's position relative to the sun. There are significant changes in both temperature and the environment during the various seasons. The southern hemisphere, where Australia is located, experiences opposite seasons compared to the northern hemisphere. During the winter season in Australia, which occurs between June and August, the country experiences cooler temperatures as the southern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. These cooler temperatures mean that the environment changes considerably during this season. In the coastal areas, there is more rain, whereas the snow falls on the higher altitude regions and mountain ranges. In addition to the temperature difference, there are also changes in the natural environment during the winter months. Animals and plants are affected by the cooler conditions. Some animals may go into hibernation to conserve energy, while others, like migratory birds, may move to warmer climates. Additionally, many plant species become dormant or slow down their growth during this time. Australia is a large and diverse country, and the winter season's impact on the environment varies between different regions. For example, the northern part of the country has tropical climate areas and experiences a dry season during this time, which means there is less rainfall and the environment is generally drier compared to the southern regions. In the southern parts of Australia, especially in Tasmania and Victoria, winter can be wet, cold, and sometimes snowy. In conclusion, during the month of July, Australians experience the winter season, which brings about various changes in the environment, such as cooler temperatures, increased precipitation in some areas, and adaptations in both plant and animal life to cope with the seasonal changes. While the specifics vary depending on the region in Australia, the overall environmental impact of winter can be observed throughout the country."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The delay can be well over 20 years with the right medicines. Today, individuals who acquire HIV after 50 years of age can expect to reach an average human life span. The police arrested two homeless people. James was 35 and had been HIV positive for 20 years, and Bill, who was 54 and was not HIV positive. They booked them and let them go. Which person didn't have a disease that causes death? A:","completion":"Both James and Bill have the potential to face health issues, but it's important to differentiate between HIV and AIDS. James has been HIV positive for 20 years. HIV, by itself, is not a direct cause of death but can lead to AIDS, which is a life-threatening condition. With proper medical treatment, an HIV-positive individual can delay the progression to AIDS indefinitely and live a relatively normal life. With advancements in modern medicine, individuals with HIV can now expect to reach an average human lifespan, assuming they receive and adhere to the appropriate care. Bill, on the other hand, is not HIV positive. However, being 54 years old and homeless can expose him to numerous health risks, although he does not have a specific disease like HIV. In summary, neither individual can be definitively said to be free from diseases or health issues that can lead to death. While James has a manageable chronic condition (HIV), Bill faces the potential for a range of health problems due to his age and living situation. It is essential to recognize the complexity of their health status and refrain from oversimplifying their situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. The film starts with a brief pre-title clip from presenter Greg Palast s aborted interview with Florida Director of Elections Clayton Roberts , who walks out . Palast introduces George W. Bush with particular reference to his popular image as a war hero cemented in the public mind by his landing on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln for the 2003 Mission Accomplished Speech . However Palast alleges that Bush used his father s influence to gain a draft-dodging placement with the Texas Air National Guard Which he subsequently failed to serve . Palast picks up the story with Bush s 2000 US Presidential Election campaign where he claims Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris used their influence to purge and discount the ballots of predominantly Gore-supporting black voters through the fake felons list compiled by private company DBT/ChoicePoint for US 4 million . Palast goes on to examine the corporate donors to Bush s election campaign , such as Enron CEO Ken Lay , who as members of Bush s pioneer network contributed huge sums through family and friends , and who he claims subsequently profited from the Bush presidency with senior government appointments , no-bid contracts , executive orders and deregulation . Palast outlines what he refers to as the Bush-cycle , where Bush family members use money to gain political office and then use the office to gain even more money , dating back to Senator Prescott Bush who funded the family s entry into the oil business , citing the example of Bush s Harken Energy winning a contract to drill in the Persian Gulf thanks he alleges to Bush Snr s presidency .

Palast's claims are focused on Bush's alleged use of his father's influence to gain a draft-dodging placement, Jeb Bush and Katherine Harris purging and discounting the ballots of predominantly Gore-supporting black voters, and the involvement of corporate donors like Ken Lay who contributed significant sums and subsequently profited from Bush's presidency. Extortion is not mentioned as a method used during the campaign."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? the film 's appeal","completion":"In order to determine the sentiment of this sentence – \\"the film 's appeal\\" – it is important to have a larger context as it lacks definitive clues about whether the sentiment is positive or negative. The statement does not convey any specific emotion or opinion towards the film's appeal without additional information surrounding it. However, I can provide a more insightful analysis of possible interpretations in different contexts: 1. If this phrase is part of a longer sentence or statement that describes the film's appeal in a positive manner, then the sentiment can be considered positive. For example, \\"The film's appeal lies in its fantastic storyline and brilliant acting performances from the whole cast.\\" In this case, the sentiment is positive as it highlights the appealing aspects of the film. 2. Alternatively, if the sentence or statement has a negative connotation, the sentiment would be considered negative. For example, \\"Despite the film's appeal, it failed to deliver on its promise due to a weak script and lackluster direction.\\" In this case, the sentiment is negative, as the mentioned appeal doesn't outweigh the shortcomings of the film. 3. The phrasing could also be used in a neutral context, with neither positive nor negative sentiment. For example, \\"The film's appeal varies depending on the viewer's personal taste and interests.\\" In this instance, the sentiment would be neutral because it presents the appeal as subjective and dependent on individual preferences. In summary, without further context, it's not possible to definitively determine the sentiment of the phrase \\"the film's appeal\\" as either positive or negative. It requires additional information to understand the speaker's emotions or opinions towards the subject matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

She wanted to go to Beijing to watch the 2008 Olympics. Only one month ago, Lamu still thought it would be difficult. In the past Tibet had no railroad . If Lamu took a bus, it would take her a long time to reach Beijing. And a plane ticket would cost lots of money. However, things changed for Lamu. She was able to buy a ticket to the world's highest railroad. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway had been completed! The 1,142-kilometer railroad runs on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau . Lamu could reach Beijing by train in 48 hours! About 550 kilometers of the railroad are constructed on the frozen earth . When the frozen earth warms in summer, it can move the track. But Chinese scientists have built a special structure to solve the problem. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway has been designed with the wild animals in the designers' minds. It also has special underpasses for animals like Tibetan antelopes to go through. \\"The new railroad greatly helps Tibet's tourism,\\"said Liu Yueqin, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences . As more tourists take trains to Tibet, there are more money for Tibetans. With the money, more kids can go to school. The railroad also makes things less expensive in Tibet. Now one can buy a TV set for about 1,500 yuan. It used to be much higher than that price. When there was no railroad, it had been difficult to send things in and out of Tibet. With the new railroad, shopping can be more convenient and faster. Question: Which of the following about the Qinghai-Tibet Railway is TRUE? Options: A: It is not the highest railroad in the world.

That you can order them online is great\\"","completion":"Title: Face it: Girl Scout cookies aren't good. That you can order them online is great Introduction There are no two ways about it: Girl Scout cookies have a special place in the hearts and homes of millions of Americans. Purchasing these cookies is often seen as a way to support charitable causes and give girls the opportunity to grow and develop essential life skills. However, as much as we may hate to admit it, Girl Scout cookies simply aren't as delicious or appealing as many other treats on the market. The idea to allow customers to order and purchase these cookies online is a blessing, and in this article, we'll explore why this is the case. A Nostalgic Disappointment The appreciation for Girl Scout cookies often stems from nostalgia, a throwback to a time when life was simpler, and friendships were forged through the sale of these not-so-gourmet treats. These cookies, however, fail to stand the test of time and live up to their hype in terms of quality and taste. In reality, many of these sugar-laden products fall short in comparison to other store-bought baked goods or homemade desserts. Their often dry, crumbly, and overly sweet nature makes it ever-more apparent that a customer's purchase decision is based largely on supporting a cause rather than pure enjoyment. Unhealthy Ingredients It's a well-known fact that Girl Scout cookies are not the healthiest of snacks, often loaded with high levels of sugar, unhealthy fats, and calories. Although the Girl Scouts of the USA have made efforts to update their recipes and use better quality ingredients, many of these cookies still contain controversial ingredients like palm oil and high-fructose corn syrup. These concerns about nutrition and sustainability have given customers pause when considering their cookie purchase. Considering today's health-conscious society and increased awareness of sustainable and ethical food choices, there's no doubt that modern consumers are seeking better options in terms of snacks and treats. Savoring the Online Experience In contrast to the quality of the cookies themselves, the introduction of online sales for Girl Scout cookies seems to be hitting the right notes. Although traditional door-to-door or booth sales are nostalgic and a part of the Girl Scout experience, allowing customers to order these cookies online provides convenience and accessibility to those who may not have a scout in their area. The online platform introduces opportunities to widen the customer base and increase Girl Scout cookie sales, even if the primary goal is to support a worthy cause. Online ordering also allows people to choose from a wider range of cookie flavors, taking away the limitations imposed by in-person sales, where scouts may run out of certain types of cookies quickly. This way, customers can simultaneously support their local scout troops and indulge in their \\"guilty pleasure\\" of choice. Supporting the Cause Although the notion that Girl Scout cookies aren't good in terms of taste or nutrition may be disappointing, we cannot forget the ultimate goal behind these sales: supporting the Girl Scouts of the USA and their mission to empower young girls. By purchasing these cookies, customers help fund activities, programs, and experiences that develop leadership skills and build confidence in young women. Conclusion While the quality and nutritional value of Girl Scout cookies may be lacking when compared to other tasty treats on the market, their continued popularity and ability to evoke nostalgic memories keep the sales going. In the end, utilizing an online sales platform to sell Girl Scout cookies is an undeniably smart move. Even if our taste buds no longer crave these cookies, we can still easily support the cause and help create a brighter future for young girls."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The author Meir Shalev was brought to this spot as a boy to look across at the Western Wall - which at the time could not be accessed by Israelis. He would gaze at the top few bricks of this holy Jewish site while his father told him: \\"You will grow up, you will become a soldier and you will fight over this city.\\" At the time Jerusalem was divided between Israeli and Jordanian control. It followed the 1949 armistice that divided the new Jewish state of Israel from other parts of what had been British Mandate Palestine. For Meir Shalev's father, a well-known Israeli poet, the exclusion of Jews from their holiest sites represented a tragedy for his people. The outbreak of war on 5 June 1967 would change many lives - and reshape that part of the Middle East. Israel launched a pre-emptive attack on Egypt and battled Jordanian and Syrian forces the same day. Mr Shalev was about to turn 19 - the age of his country at the time - and remembers a national mood of panic before the conflict. \\"People were talking about the possibility of Israel being destroyed and us being exiled or killed,\\" he says. \\"We were very eager to fight,\\" he remembers. \\"We thought: 'This is our chance'.\\" Mr Shalev found himself in action against Syrian troops on the Golan heights during a series of battles that would lead to Israel's capture of that territory. But it was the occupation of the West Bank that he believes consumed Israel's energy - something he says it has had to \\"deal with\\" ever since its victory in 1967. He recalls how after the war he told his father in a heated confrontation: \\"We took a bite we will suffocate on.\\" Other Israelis saw a divine purpose in the fighting to bring a return to their biblical Jewish lands. In Jerusalem, the conflict saw Israeli troops involved in close quarters fighting with Jordanians. Another young soldier, Yoel Ben Nun, was being transported to a checkpoint that separated control of the city. He speaks of surrounding the Old City at night, facing a battalion of the Jordanian Legion which rapidly retreated. \\"That was a miracle,\\" he says, recalling Israel's victory in six days. Yoel Ben Nun told his commander at the time that he felt like two millennia of history had passed. \\"The meaning was that for 2,000 years the people of Israel were in exile - persecuted, tortured, subjected to anti-Semitism. Those 2,000 years were over,\\" he says. \\"This is what I felt on the Temple Mount at the time,\\" referring to the revered hilltop also known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. Yoel Ben Nun later became a rabbi and joined the movement building Jewish settlements in the West Bank - the territory that Palestinians want for a future state. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. For Palestinians, the war represented the loss of land following what they saw as the catastrophe of the first Israeli-Arab conflict two decades earlier. Fatima Khadir was eight years old in 1967 when her family - whom she says were already displaced from their village in the previous war - fled Jerusalem's Old City. She points to the side of her left eye, explaining she was injured by shrapnel from the debris of Israeli bombing. \\"I was looking around me, everyone was grabbing whatever they could - mothers and fathers carrying their babies and children\\". She ended up with her parents in a refugee camp in the desert border area of Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Fifty years on, from her home in East Jerusalem, she speaks of her desire to return to her family's village of the 1940s. \\"I still feel the hurt, pain and intolerable struggle,\\" she says. \\"We were never able to go back. I'm still hurting. We are still suffering.\\" The outbreak of war had been accompanied by enthusiastic, but false, radio reports of Arab success in the fighting. Mahmoud Erdisat was training to be a fighter pilot - and would later become a major general in the Jordanian air force. \\"We were very excited that finally we would get the chance to fight the Israelis and get Palestine back,\\" he recalls. But he says it soon became apparent that Israel was overwhelming its opponents. The Israeli territorial increase, claims Mr Erdisat, made it harder to negotiate a \\"just solution\\" on the issue of Palestinian statehood. He believes the Arab defeat also had a profound impact on the way Israel's neighbours came to view themselves. \\"It was a blow to Arab nationalism,\\" he says. But its legacy further fuelled Palestinian national aspirations. Occupation became central to their calls to activism and militancy, placing it firmly on the international agenda for years to come. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"This story is about Meir Shalev, a Jewish boy in Israel, who was told by his father that one day he would fight for their city, Jerusalem, that at that time was split between Israeli and Jordanian control. In 1967, when the war broke out, Meir was 19 and eager to fight, thinking it was his chance to change things. During the war, Israel gained more territory but he believed this made things more complicated for them. Meir describes his disagreement with his father, saying that Israel might choke on the bite it took by becoming an occupier of other lands. Another soldier, Yoel Ben Nun, felt that the war was a miracle, ending 2000 years of Jewish suffering. He eventually became a rabbi and helped set up Jewish settlements in West Bank, although these settlements are considered illegal by international law. Meanwhile, for Fatima Khadir, a Palestinian girl, the war meant losing her home and becoming a refugee. She wished to go back to her old land. The war also made it harder for the Palestinians to negotiate their statehood. So, in short, the war of 1967 had big effects on Israel, the Palestinians, and this area of the world.

Wang Leehom (born May 17, 1976), sometimes credited as Leehom Wang, is a Taiwanese-American singer-songwriter, record producer, actor and film director. Formally trained at the Eastman School of Music, Williams College and Berklee College of Music, his musical style is known for fusing Chinese elements (such as Beijing opera, traditional styles of ethnic minorities, Chinese classical orchestra) with hip-hop and R&B. Wang debuted in 1995 and since then has released over 25 albums, with sales of over 50 million copies. He is also a four-time winner and 19-time nominee of Taiwan's Golden Melody Awards, the \\"Grammys\\" of Chinese music. Born in Rochester, New York, Wang is the second of three sons of immigrants from Taiwan of waishengren heritage. His father, a pediatrician, and his mother, moved to the United States to further their college studies in the early 1960s. Influenced by his older brother, Leo Wang, who had been taking violin lessons since he was seven, Wang began to develop a curious interest towards the violin and its musical counterparts when he was three. He begged his mother to put him in violin lessons with his brother but his mother was against it, reasoning that he was too young. When Wang turned six, his mother enrolled him in violin classes, performing along with his brother. As he became a teenager, he began taking piano lessons, also teaching himself the guitar. He also worked several jobs to earn money to buy a second hand drum kit. He attended Jefferson Road Elementary School, Pittsford Middle School, and Pittsford Sutherland High School in Pittsford, New York. He graduated from Pittsford Sutherland. Passionate for a career in music, he chose to attend Williams College double majoring in music and Asian studies. He joined an all-male a cappella group, The Springstreeters, and the group recorded several demo tracks. In the summer of 1995, while Wang was visiting his grandparents in Taiwan, he was offered a professional recording contract by Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG) after he participated in a talent competition hosted by the label. Not wanting to lose the opportunity, he immediately began preparing for his debut, and released his debut album Love Rival, Beethoven (Qing Di Bei Duo Fen ) that December. The record received little limelight, forcing him to leave the label. He signed with Decca Records the following year, a label then famous for producing \\"powerful singers\\" (Shi Li Pai Ge Shou ) in Taiwan. Wanting to also have control in the idol market, the label initially planned to market Wang as the mainstream \\"romantic idol\\", like with their previous artist Mavis Fan. However, after discovering Wang's talent in music-making, Decca began promoting him as Taiwan's \\"quality idol\\" (You Zhi Ou Xiang ) instead. Wang released his second album If You Heard My Song in 1996, which included some of his own compositions. He co-wrote the album's eponymous title song, which earned positive responses from the audience. The album drew moderately successful sales, and he became a rising star in the idol market, also finding similar successes with his third and fourth albums. During this time, Wang was asked to leave his college studies to pursue a full-time singing career, but he insisted on finishing school first.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he belong to a recording label?","completion":"Yes, Wang Leehom belonged to a recording label.

Summarize this article: Sir Tom Winsor said Police and Crime Commissioner Dr Alan Billings' decision was based on three \\"misunderstood\\" words in a press release. Mr Crompton was suspended after the Hillsborough inquest verdicts in April. He said the PCC's decision was wrong and he will be taking legal action. Mr Crompton - who was due to retire in November - was suspended the day after the Hillsborough inquests concluded police conduct contributed to or caused the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans in 1989. A statement he issued on 27 April, included the phrase \\"these [police] failures had to be put into the context of other contributory factors\\". Dr Billings said the words \\"other contributory factors\\" showed insensitivity to the victims of the disaster. Following the suspension, Dr Billings instigated dismissal proceedings against Mr Crompton under Section 38 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act, which required him to consult others on the proposal - among them, Sir Tom. Speaking to the Today programme Sir Tom said: \\"Dr Billings is firing the chief constable for nothing other than three words in a press release which could not fairly mean anything other than he was not blaming the fans.\\" He said the PCC's interpretation of the statement was \\"mistaken and the High Court will correct him\\". \\"The Police and Crime Commissioner cannot fire the chief because people have misunderstood what was said and, let's remember, the PCC was shown the statement before it was made an he did not say 'Do not issue that statement'.\\" In published documents relating to the dismissal proceedings Mr Crompton claims he took the statement to Dr Billings on the morning of 27 April but was told the PCC could not advise on it. According to Dr Billings, Mr Crompton was told it was \\"unwise\\" to make a comment seeking to justify the force's legal stance at the inquests. Summary:","completion":"Sir Tom Winsor, Chief Inspector of Constabulary, has criticised the decision to fire South Yorkshire Police Chief David Crompton over his response to the Hillsborough inquest verdicts. Winsor claims that Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Dr. Alan Billings' decision was based on three \\"misunderstood\\" words in a press release, and suggests that the High Court may correct the PCC's interpretation. Crompton plans to take legal action over his suspension, which occurred shortly before his planned retirement in November."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Inside Context: After succumbing to a drug addiction that cost him his job, almost all of his money, and his dignity, Miles Berrett (Luke Goss) is entering his new home: a tiny cell in an old, run-down prison. Determined to get his life back on track, Miles plans to serve his time and make things right with his wife and daughter. While asleep on his bunk during his first night locked up, Miles is ripped awake by a terrifying crash. A moment later, in the dark, guards rush past his cell.

Outside of his cell, through the darkness, Miles can hear other inmates talking, yellingâtrying to figure out what is happening. A voice over a PA system instructs all of the prisoners to remain calm and quiet. \\"There has been a situation. It has been contained.\\" But Miles and Anthony know that is a lie.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the full names of the lovers who have a secret romance? ? Tessibel Skinner is a young woman in a squatter village on the coast, where she lives with her father, a local fisherman. Towering above the village is the estate of Elias Graves, a wealthy man who hopes to use his influence to remove these squatters from his land. When his lawyer is unable to so directly, he instead enacts a ban on net fishing, removing the livelihoods of many people in the village, including Tess and her father. Despite the ban, some continue to fish illegally, though they are soon confronted by men sent by Graves. In this confrontation, one of Graves' men is shot and killed. Tess' father is wrongfully accused of the murder and arrested. Meanwhile, through these altercations Tess meets Frederick Graves, Elias' son, who is home on a break from his theological studies. Before long, the two begin a forbidden romance. Also on break with Frederick is Dan Jordan, a friend from his fraternity, who simultaneously falls in love with Frederick's sister, Teola. Soon after Dan and Frederick return to college, Teola learns that she is pregnant and struggles to decide if she should tell Dan. Her decision is made for her soon enough, as she receives a letter informing her that Dan has died heroically in a fire at the fraternity. Unable to confide in her very stern father, Teola is distraught and turns to Tess for support. Once the baby is born, Tess agrees to take the child and bear the social stigma of having a child out of wedlock. Upon his return, Frederick is forced to shun Tess for her sin despite his remaining love for her. Soon, however, Teola's baby falls ill and Tess decides to take him up to Elias' church to be baptized. Disgusted by Tess and the child, Elias refuses, shaming them publicly. Teola, having witnessed her father's anger, decides to step forward and admit the truth about her child. Tess is forgiven and it is decided that Teola will die with her son.

I was so-o-o excited,\\" the widow and former duplex dweller said of the purchase of her first home, a sagging frame structure on Snowden. \\"I was glad to get me a house.\\" When James realized she had been swindled she turned to Memphis Area Legal Services, which represented her in a lawsuit. Now, James's monthly house notes have dropped from 796 - more than twice her monthly income - to an affordable 247. Some of the people who took advantage of her through a questionable loan program were sent to jail. \\"I don't know what I would have done without Legal Services,\\" said James. \\"They solved a lot of my problems.\\" James is one of more than 3,000 clients served last year by MALS, which provides assistance for civil matters, such as domestic abuse and family-related problems, Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, veterans, housing and consumer fraud cases. Like James, most clients are elderly or female. Some are handicapped. Some need medical care or veteran's benefits. Some are trying to escape eviction or an abusive marriage. And 87 percent live at or below poverty level. Shelby County Mayor A C Wharton recently said Legal Services is important for those who, because of poverty or other struggles in life, think justice is an empty word. \\"They must be given reason to believe that the law is for them too,\\" said Wharton, a former executive director of MALS.

Context: The flaw in the Chinese plan was a lack of accurate intelligence about the UN forces. Even though the US X Corps was stretched thin over northeast Korea, the slow Marine advance allowed the bulk of the US 1st Marine Division, including the 5th Marine Regiment (United States), 7th Marine Regiment (United States) and 11th Marine Regiment (United States), to be concentrated at Yudami-ni. Furthermore, the strategically important Hagaru-ri, where a Douglas C-47 Skytrain-capable airfield was under construction and a supply dump, was not a priority for the Chinese despite being lightly defended by the 1st Marine Regiment (United States) and 7th Marines. Only Task Force Faith (RCT-31), an understrength and hastily formed regimental combat team of the US 7th Infantry Division, was thinly spread along the eastern bank of the reservoir. Those units would later take the brunt of the Chinese assaults. As for the UN forces, the 1st Marine Division had an effective strength of 25,473 men at the start of the battle, and it was further reinforced by the British 41 Commando and the equivalent of two regiments from the 3rd and 7th Army Infantry Divisions. The UN forces had a combined strength of about 30,000 men during the course of the battle. The UN forces at Chosin were also supported by one of the greatest concentrations of air power during the Korean War, since the 1st Marine Air Wing stationed at Yonpo Airfield and five aircraft carriers from the US Navys Task Force 77 (U.S. Navy) were able to launch 230 sorties daily to provide close air support during the battle, while the US Air Force Far East Combat Cargo Command in Japan reached the capacity of airdropping 250 tons of supplies per day to resupply the trapped UN forces.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense. Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.

After the North Bay Bridge collapse, Sam successfully persuades several people to leave the bridge, saving their lives. Despite Jim Block's skepticism about Sam's responsibility for the disaster, he promises to keep an eye on him, likely to ensure Sam's involvement in the collapse was not malicious and to monitor any further unusual incidents. As the story continues, the survivors of the bridge collapse start to die in mysterious circumstances. This pattern of deaths draws attention to the possibility of a supernatural force at play, specifically the phenomenon of Death seeking to claim the lives of those who cheated it on the bridge. This concept is further supported by the cryptic warnings given by coroner William Bludworth, who tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated.\\" Given this context, it becomes evident that Jim Block will be watching Sam Lawton in an attempt to unravel the reasons for the strange coincidences and determine whether Sam has any direct involvement or knowledge of these incidents.

Choose the next sentence.By Martha De Lacey PUBLISHED: 11:53 EST, 9 July 2013 | UPDATED: 12:35 EST, 9 July 2013 Fans of the women's surf-wear brand Roxy have expressed their outrage at a new teaser video they feel is demeaning to women, branding it as 'disrespectful' and 'disappointing', and some claiming they feel 'utterly disgusted'. Posted on the brand's YouTube channel and Facebook page, the short video features a faceless female surfer waking up in the morning and preparing to hit the waves... but the star of the show is her bottom. Moreover, since the video ends when she paddles out to sea, none of the video actually features any surfing, which fans have found unpalatable. Fans were angered that the OPTIONS: - Australian video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin - Facebook video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin - Martha De Lacey video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin - Roxy video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin - Roxy Pro Biarritz video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin - Stephanie Gilmore video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin - Video video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin - YouTube video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfin","completion":"Fans were angered that the Roxy video sexualised the pro-surfer, and then didn't feature a single shot of surfing. This issue sparked a significant backlash from the brand's target audience, who felt that the video's focus on the surfer's physical appearance rather than her athletic prowess went against the core values that Roxy is meant to represent. As a brand that aims to empower women in the world of surfing, this kind of content was viewed as a step in the wrong direction. The controversy surrounding the video can be attributed to a few key factors. First and foremost, the approach taken in the video was seen as objectifying the female surfer, reducing her to nothing more than a body being showcased for the male gaze – an unfortunate and pervasive problem in the portrayals of women in advertising. Additionally, the fact that the video did not feature any actual surfing further reinforced the perception that the brand was more interested in selling a sexualized image than promoting the sport and the skills of the surfer. In response to this backlash, Roxy should consider reassessing its marketing strategy and ensuring that future content reflects the brand's intended values and mission of empowering women in surf culture. One approach could be to shift the focus from the physical appearance of the athletes to their impressive athletic abilities and achievements. For example, showcasing women successfully riding powerful waves, taking part in competitions, and engaging in other aspects of the surfing community could help to emphasize the importance of women's place in the sport. Moreover, Roxy could work to engage with fans and foster a positive and inclusive dialogue about the representation of women in the world of surfing. Hosting events, creating social media campaigns, and partnering with organizations that advocate for women's equality in sports are just a few ways in which the brand could demonstrate its commitment to supporting female athletes and countering the objectification that often occurs in advertising. In conclusion, the Roxy video controversy highlights the importance of brands staying true to their core values and ensuring that the content they produce is consistent with the message they aim to convey. By refocusing on the athletic prowess of female surfers and prioritizing their empowerment in the sport, Roxy can work to regain the trust of fans and continue to be a symbol of female strength and skill in the surfing world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Our protagonist, Meera, is a young widow sent to live in the ashram by her in-laws after her husband suddenly passes away. Alongside her, there are several other widows, some older like Mala, who have spent most of their lives in the ashram, and newer ones like Preeti, who is also struggling to adapt to her unwanted new life. Step 2: Introduce conflict A local developer, Mr. Kapoor, wants to seize the ashram land to build a luxury hotel along the riverfront. This threatens the only home the widows have known and forces them to come together to protect their sanctuary. Step 3: Create subplots to add depth Meera develops a romantic interest in Rahul, a local journalist who takes an interest in the widows' plight and wants to expose Mr. Kapoor's plans. Meanwhile, Mala gets diagnosed with a terminal illness, which adds a sense of urgency to their fight to save the ashram. Step 4: Climax As the pressure rises from Mr. Kapoor to vacate the ashram, Meera, Preeti, and the other widows join together to host a large-scale public event celebrating the beauty and history of Varanasi. With the help of Rahul's expose, public opinion turns against Mr. Kapoor, and the government steps in to prevent the ashram's demolition. Step 5: Resolution In the end, the widows emerge triumphant, empowered by their unity and new sense of identity. With the ashram saved, Mala passes away peacefully, leaving her legacy to Meera and her newfound family. Meera and Rahul also explore their budding relationship, challenging societal norms that say widows must not remarry.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Reinhard Keiser was directly instrumental in securing their post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra? Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\".

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Pick from: * negative; * positive;Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? the performers are so spot on","completion":"The phrase \\"the performers are so spot on\\" can be classified as a positive statement. This is because the term \\"spot on\\" is often used to convey approval or admiration for something, or to express that a situation, object, or performance is accurate or well-executed. In the context of the phrase under consideration, it highlights the exceptional performance of the performers and implies that their delivery has impressed the observer. The observer likely believes that the performers have either met or surpassed their expectations, thereby resulting in an enjoyable experience. In a broader context, positive language often encompasses words or phrases that elicit a sense of satisfaction, appreciation, happiness, or excitement. In contrast, negative language includes statements that induce feelings of unease, disappointment, sadness, or anger. The phrase in question aligns with the general characteristics of positive language, as it implies that the performers have done a great job and have met or exceeded the expectations of the person making the observation. In summary, the phrase \\"the performers are so spot on\\" can be considered positive due to the use of \\"spot on,\\" which indicates the observer's admiration and appreciation for the performers and their presentation.

Question: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Two farms were selling on Seattle markets. Berry farm, which used organic methods, no fertilizers and pesticides, and Rose farm, which used conventional agricultural methods, including fertilizers and pesticides. Which farm contributes less to the carrying of chemicals to nearby rivers?

Step 2: Assess the environmental impact of each farm's methods: - Berry farm: - Without the use of fertilizers and pesticides, it is unlikely that chemicals from this farm would runoff into nearby rivers or lakes. - Therefore, the farm has a minimal impact on local water contamination. - Rose farm: - By using conventional agricultural methods, chemicals in the form of fertilizers and pesticides are applied to the fields. - These chemicals can be picked up by rainwater and runoff, resulting in the contamination of nearby rivers, lakes, and groundwater.

Summarize: The billionaire has shown in New Hampshire that he can turn publicity, controversy, even notoriety, into a winning margin of votes - indeed, a large winning margin. The Donald is not just hype. The Trump brand clearly works in the political arena. He is not just the ultimate clickbait candidate, a human headline who has blurred the lines between politics and entertainment, but a serious contender with a path to the Republican presidential nomination. How can he possibly win, the question asked last June when he first stepped from the golden doors of the elevators in Trump Tower to announce his long-shot bid for the presidency, has now changed. How can he possibly be stopped? As Donald Trump made the journey down from his executive suite that day he apparently harboured self-doubts, sharing with his wife, Melania, the fear that he might fall flat on his face. But ever the showman, there was no trace of that uncharacteristic lack of confidence when moments later he announced his bid. Rather, he projected supreme self-certainty, the personal magnetism, the winning aura that's so alluring to many of his followers. That day also demonstrated his skills at setting the agenda, and framing the contest. His attack on unauthorised Mexican immigrants, whom he decried as criminals and \\"rapists,\\" had an electrifying effect on his candidacy. Far from disqualifying him from the presidential nomination, they propelled him towards it. They also taught him an early lesson - and an ugly lesson, his critics would say. A hard-line stance on immigration, especially when coupled with fears about national security, is a big vote winner. Months later, when a poll suggested he had fallen behind his right-wing rival Ted Cruz in Iowa, Trump announced his plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering America. Again, his poll numbers soared. Noticeable from the exit polls last night was that two-thirds of Republicans in New Hampshire supported his temporary ban on Muslims. The criticism that he is a racist demagogue, and the acid shower of international criticism especially from Muslims and Hispanics, has done nothing to harm him. Quite the contrary. Early on in his candidacy, Trump also learnt he could defy the usual norms of political engagement. Pundits initially viewed his attack on John McCain, the former prisoner of war and presidential candidate, as suicidal. Picking a fight with Megyn Kelly, Fox News's most luminous star, also seemed like an act of self-harm. But those insults generated controversy and controversy generated high polls numbers. It's been the calculus of his campaign. Monopolising the media coverage had an added bonus - it starved rivals of the spotlight, and meant they were constantly having to react to him rather than setting the terms of the debate themselves. His outspoken attacks also reinforced another of his great selling points, his delight in railing against \\"political correctness\\". These Trump tirades especially resonate with his core support, lower income white males, who earn less than 50,000 a year. The billionaire has enormous blue-collar appeal. For all his boasts and for all his inflated claims, there's an authenticity about Trump which his supporters also find appealing. The Donald is The Donald, just as, incidentally, The Bern is The Bern. At a time when voters globally are rejecting career politicians, Trump is the classic anti-politician. Though at opposite ends of the political spectrum, Trump and Sanders are tapping into the same disenchantment with the elite political class. Paradoxically then, it turns out he's a highly skilled political operator. Transferring his skills as a reality television star to the campaign trail, he's good a revving up a crowd, working a rope-line and glad-handing voters. He's a natural when it comes to the stagecraft of campaigning. Having the Secret Service in tow offering personal protection also gives him something of a presidential aura, and an elongated motorcade to boot. It all helps him project power and success. His message \\"Make America Great Again!\\" is also infectious. As I wrote early in the campaign, he's benefited greatly from tapping into widespread feelings of fear and frustration among voters, but there's also a can-do optimism about his candidacy. His supporters believe he is a guy who makes things happen and gets things done. For Trump, New Hampshire was a double victory. First, he won by a big margin. Second, no rival from the establishment stable of candidates has emerged from New Hampshire as a clear challenger. If the first-in-the-nation primary had gone to script for party elders, Marco Rubio would have built on his strong third place showing in Iowa, where he trailed Trump by just 1% to come third, and come a strong second, or possibly even won. But \\"Marcomentum\\" came to a shuddering halt in the televised debate on Saturday, when, at the hands of Governor Chris Christie, he received a mauling. The young Floridian ended that night with blood in his spitbucket, and a reputation as a political bantamweight. Governor John Kasich of Ohio, who did well in New Hampshire by adopting a similar playbook to John McCain in 2000, is simply too moderate to prosper in the modern-day GOP. It is hard to see him remain viable as the contest moves south, especially in South Carolina which was designed by conservative Republicans to act as a firewall to block moderate candidates like the cheery Ohioan. South Carolina will surely do to Kasich what it did to McCain in 2000, which is to stop him in his tracks. Clues to Trump's success are to be found in his autobiography, The Art of Deal. \\"I play to people's fantasies,\\" he wrote, back in the late-80s. \\"I call it truthful hyperbole. It's an innocent form of exaggeration - and a very effective form of promotion.\\" Well currently his \\"truthful hyperbole\\" is propelling him towards the Republican presidential nomination. What many wrote off as fantasy politics is becoming real.","completion":"A billionaire named Donald Trump is trying to become the next President of the United States. He is famous and sometimes says things that make a lot of people talk about him. This has helped him become popular with some people. People used to think he couldn't win, but now they wonder if anyone can stop him. He wants to do things like stop people from certain countries coming to America, and this has made even more people like him.

Here is a goal: How do I chill the pureed bananas when making banana ice cream? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of chilling pureed bananas when making banana ice cream, we can follow these steps: 1. First, prepare your bananas: Peel ripe bananas, preferably ones that are showing some brown spots on the skin, as they will have a stronger and sweeter taste. Slice the bananas into smaller pieces for easier blending. 2. Blend the bananas: Place the sliced bananas into a blender or food processor, and blend until smooth and creamy. Stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the blender or food processor to ensure even blending. Now, we have two main chilling methods to consider: Method 1: Freeze banana slices before blending - This is the preferred and most popular method because it results in a creamier texture. - Start by laying the banana slices on a flat tray or plate lined with parchment paper. This will prevent the banana slices from sticking together. - Place the tray in the freezer and let the bananas freeze for at least 2-3 hours, or until they are solid. - After freezing, blend the banana slices in a food processor or a powerful blender to get the desired creamy consistency. Method 2: Chill the pureed bananas after blending - Place the pureed bananas in a container with an airtight lid. - Put the container in the freezer for approximately 2-3 hours. During this time, you should periodically check on the consistency of the pureed bananas, stirring from time to time to prevent it from becoming too solid and icy. This method may not yield the same creaminess as the first one, but it still works. Both of these methods are suitable for making banana ice cream, but for better texture and creaminess, I would recommend Method 1: Freeze banana slices before blending. Freezing the banana slices first will make the blending process easier and result in a smoother, creamier ice cream texture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

When Anne Fontaine, the director of the film, envisioned her biopic about the legendary designer, she believed that Audrey Tautou was the perfect fit for the role. Their strikingly similar appearances, coupled with Tautou's powerful performance, make her the ideal actress to bring Gabrielle \\"Coco\\" Chanel to life on the screen. Tautou flawlessly captures even the smallest details, from the way Coco holds her cigarette to her signature piercing gaze. Fontaine's faith in Tautou paid off, as the audience sees a determined, authoritative figure brought to life. However, like many biopics, \\"Coco Avant Chanel\\" is not without its historical inaccuracies. For instance, the blue-striped mariner's sweater that Tautou wears in one scene did not actually come into existence until the 1930s. This discrepancy is important because it signifies that the film is not a direct, faithful adaptation or representation of Coco Chanel's life. Another instance of inaccuracy is the quilted sewing pouch featured in the movie. This particular item is shown to prompt the idea for Chanel's world-famous bag, but in reality, it was not the true inspiration. Such inaccuracies can affect the viewer's perception of Coco Chanel's journey in the fashion world, as the film may not be an entirely accurate portrayal of her life and work. Despite these deviations from the truth, \\"Coco Avant Chanel\\" still manages to provide a captivating insight into the life of the legendary designer, giving viewers a glimpse of her fiery spirit and her trajectory in the world of haute couture. Audrey Tautou's captivating performance as Coco Chanel plays a crucial role in the film's success, demonstrating her remarkable abilities as an actress and her capacity to immerse herself in complex, historical roles. In conclusion, \\"Coco Avant Chanel\\" is an engaging biopic that, despite some historical inaccuracies, captures the essence of Coco Chanel's life and career. Audrey Tautou's brilliant portrayal of the iconic designer is instrumental in bringing her to life on the screen, showcasing not only her own talents as an actress but also the fascinating journey of one of the most influential figures in the world of fashion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Danny Oliver’s last shift ended with the veteran Sacramento sheriff’s deputy doing something he would have done countless times before in his career, walking toward a car to see what the occupants were doing on his beat. The 47-year-old father of two never made it to the driver’s window Friday. At about 10:30 a.m., a man armed with an AR-15 rifle aimed out of the car from the parking lot of a Motel 6 at Arden Way and Ethan Way and opened fire, killing Oliver with a shot to the forehead. Over the next six hours, authorities say, 34-year-old gunman Marcelo Marquez eluded hundreds of officers from Sacramento to Auburn in a crime spree that left Oliver and Placer County sheriff’s Detective Michael David Davis Jr. dead. A third Placer deputy, Jeff Davis, was wounded and later treated and released from a hospital. A motorist was in serious condition from a gunshot to the head. The carnage ended around 4 p.m., when Marquez meekly surrendered to deputies who converged on a home in Auburn where he had been hiding for hours as one of the largest manhunts in Sacramento history unfolded. Never miss a local story. Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access. SUBSCRIBE NOW Marquez, who public records indicate is from Salt Lake City, was expected to be transferred to the Sacramento County jail late Friday along with a woman who authorities say had accompanied him on part of his rampage. She was identified as Jannelle Monroy, 38, of Sacramento, although public records online suggest she is Marquez’s wife and that the couple are from West Valley City, Utah. Authorities say the couple were responsible for a drama that forced thousands of schoolchildren to spend the day either in lockdown or sheltering in place, left neighborhoods evacuated and forced sheriffs from Sacramento and Placer counties to step forward with somber announcements that they both had lost deputies. Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones said the incident was a “perfect storm” of violence by a gunman who had no regard for the public or law enforcement. “It’s incredibly dangerous,” Jones said. “If the suspect is willing to shoot an officer – unprovoked – then no one is safe.” Placer County Sheriff Ed Bonner appeared anguished as he later described the loss of Davis, a homicide investigator and 15-year veteran of the department who would have turned 43 on Wednesday. Davis’ father, Michael David Davis Sr., was a Riverside sheriff’s deputy killed in the line of duty 26 years earlier – to the day. “The suspect is in custody, as you know,” Bonner said quietly. “I think there’s those people who would say, ‘Well, you know what, I wish you’d killed him.’ “No, that’s not who we are, we are not him. We did our job. I’m incredibly proud of the men and women who go out there every day and put their life on the line, and today this organization, this family, has suffered a horrific loss.” Gov. Jerry Brown issued a statement Friday night about the fatal shootings: “The brutal murders of Sheriff’s Deputy Danny Oliver and Sheriff’s Detective Michael Davis are a tragic reminder of the sacrifices we demand of our peace officers and the incredible courage they display as they protect our communities. Anne and I extend our deepest sympathies to the families, friends and colleagues of these two brave public servants. We also are mindful of the officer and bystanders who were wounded or terrorized by today’s terrible events.” The ordeal began at the Motel 6 near Sacramento’s bustling Arden Fair mall and a popular movie theater complex. Oliver and his partner were approaching a car in the motel parking lot that had a man and woman inside when the gunman suddenly opened fire, Jones said. “As the officer approached the vehicle, the person inside the vehicle fired several rounds at Officer Danny Oliver,” the sheriff said in an afternoon press conference. “At least one of those rounds struck Deputy Oliver in the forehead, which caused his death.” Oliver didn’t have time to react, but his partner drew his weapon and opened fire as the suspects fled the parking lot. One witness, Tomorrow Jones, said she spent the night at the motel to celebrate her anniversary and that her family and baby were still in the second-floor room when she heard the barrage of gunfire. “If you snuck outside you could see him lying there,” she said. “I heard the shots, like nine of them. It was terrible.” She added that responding emergency crews performed chest compressions on the fallen officer before he was placed on a gurney and taken to a hospital. The suspects drove a short distance away, to the 700 block of Howe Avenue. There, they tried to carjack a vehicle driven by a man who apparently resisted and was shot in the head, then fell back into his vehicle. That victim was identified as Anthony Holmes, 38, who was listed in serious condition Friday night at the UC Davis Medical Center. The suspects fled that parking lot into a nearby neighborhood, where they carjacked yet another vehicle, this one a white Ford Mustang convertible, then raced a few blocks away to a home on Coronado Boulevard at Castec Drive, where they encountered Jose Cruz, a gardener working on a home. “I need a favor,” the man told Cruz as he pointed a pistol at him with his right hand and held his left arm wrapped in a bloody shirt. “What’s the favor?” Cruz asked. “I need your keys,” the gunman said. “Hurry up, because they’re chasing me. Hurry up. I don’t want to hurt you.” The suspect then helped Cruz unhitch a trailer full of gardening equipment from the truck, and he and the woman raced off to Fair Oaks Boulevard and, within minutes, a Carmichael neighborhood. There, a county park ranger spotted them changing clothes and alerted authorities, who raced to Van Alstine Avenue and cordoned off a neighborhood. But they were too late. By then, the pickup truck was racing up Interstate 80 and exited at Auburn, where the occupants pulled over to the side of the road and two Placer County deputies spotted it. The deputies approached but immediately were met with gunfire from an AR-15 rifle, authorities said, striking both of the officers. Both were taken to the Sutter Roseville Medical Center, where Michael David Davis Jr. later died. Steven Morris was at an Auburn city park when authorities began flooding the area after those shootings. He said he saw dozens of officers with assault rifles, guns drawn, standing on the beds of pickup trucks circling downtown Auburn. “I’ve only seen that in Mexico,” he said. “No one knew what was going on.” Monroy was arrested at that scene, and authorities said a pistol was found in her purse. However, they added that they believe Marquez did all the firing during Friday’s events. As Monroy was being arrested, Marquez fled into a residential area near Placer High School, forcing that school and others to lock down their campuses, authorities said. The gunman took refuge inside a home on Belmont Drive while a massive law enforcement response that included several helicopters converged on the area. “It’s terrifying to find that it’s happening on your street, it’s happening on my street in my quiet little neighborhood,” resident Donna Silva said later. Silva was at Skyridge Elementary School, where her 7-year-old twins attend school, when she learned that the campus and others in Auburn had been locked down. “It’s a scary feeling not to be able to get to your kids,” Silva said. “I look forward to giving them a big kiss.” The area around Belmont Drive bristled with heavily armed officers, armored vehicles and reinforcements from virtually every agency in the region. CHP officers carrying automatic rifles stood roadside. A SWAT team staged on Gum Street and at Pacific Street, and armed Roseville police checked the car trunks of passing motorists before allowing them to drive through. Authorities evacuated Placer High School after 3 p.m., with the first group of students slowly making their way onto school buses as Placer County sheriff’s deputies carrying automatic rifles stood guard. “It looks like a TV show around here,” Hazel Haase, who lives next door to the home where Marquez was hiding, said by telephone during the siege. Haase said heavily armed officers came into her yard a little after 1 p.m. with their guns drawn. For the next three hours, officers carefully tightened the noose around the neighborhood, focusing SWAT teams on the home and contacting the homeowner, who helped draw a floor plan of the home for deputies. At the same time, officers searched the rugged canyon areas near the home, fearful that Marquez might have been able to slip away. While they still were searching for the suspect, Sheriff Jones was holding a 3 p.m. news conference in downtown Sacramento to reveal that Oliver had died. Although sources had confirmed in the morning that the deputy had not survived, Jones held off because Oliver’s wife was out of town and had to be reached, then fly back to Sacramento. Jones called Oliver an “outstanding officer,” part of a tight-knit group of problem-oriented policing officers who try to improve citizens’ quality of life by taking a proactive approach to problems. Oliver spent 12 years in the POP unit, and three years in the jail before that. Former Sheriff John McGinness said Oliver was a “passionate, good soul” who loved being a deputy. In Auburn, meanwhile, scanner traffic that had been describing efforts to capture the suspect suddenly went silent. After about 45 minutes of minimal traffic, the scanner came back to life just before 4 p.m. with a simple announcement: “He’s cuffed,” a dispatcher said. Officers had entered the home and arrested Marquez, apparently without him putting up a struggle. He was taken away on a gurney and transported by ambulance for a checkup, then to jail. ||||| Sign up and get access to special features Connect to your Facebook or Twitter account and we'll fill in your registration information.

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report. Critics seized on...

Add spaces: Pistonpumpsystem,variableflow0-90liter/min.","completion":"The given text is \\"Pistonpumpsystem,variableflow0-90liter/min.\\" Let's add appropriate spaces to separate the words and make it more understandable. Here's the text with added spaces: \\"Piston pump system, variable flow 0-90 liter/min.\\" Now, let me provide a detailed explanation of each of the components of this text. 1. Piston pump system: A piston pump is a type of positive displacement pump that uses a piston mechanism to move fluids through a system. This type of pump can generate high pressures and is commonly used in applications involving water, oil, or other fluids with low compressibility. The primary components of a piston pump system include the piston, cylinder, suction valve, and discharge valve. When the piston moves up, the suction valve opens, allowing fluid to enter the cylinder. When the piston moves down, the discharge valve opens, forcing the fluid out of the cylinder and into the system. Piston pump systems are popular for their reliability, efficiency, and ability to handle high-pressure applications. 2. Variable flow: Variable flow refers to a system's ability to adjust the flow rate of a fluid within a particular range. This feature is important in applications where precise control of the fluid flow is necessary, such as in process control systems or when working with fluids of varying viscosities. In a piston pump system, the variable flow can be achieved through the use of a variable displacement piston pump or by altering the speed of the piston movement within the pump. This versatility allows the system to be more adaptable and suitable for a wide range of applications. 3. 0-90 liter/min: This numerical range represents the flow rate capacity of the piston pump system. In this case, the pump can handle a fluid flow rate between 0 to 90 liters per minute. This is a helpful piece of information for understanding the performance capabilities of the pump and determining if it is appropriate for a specific application. A higher flow rate means that the pump can move more fluid through the system, increasing its performance and efficiency. Conversely, a lower flow rate might be desirable when precision is more important than speed. In summary, the given text \\"Piston pump system, variable flow 0-90 liter/min.\\" describes a piston pump system capable of handling a variable flow rate between 0 and 90 liters per minute. This type of system offers versatility and adaptability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in industries that require the movement and control of fluids."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Meanwhile, Sherman has created an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person in a way that allows them to lose weight more easily. After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with Carla Purty, a chemistry graduate student who is a big fan of his work. After dinner with his obese, impolite family, Sherman asks Carla out on a date, which she accepts, much to Sherman's surprise. The date begins well with Carla showing admiration for Sherman's work, but the club's obnoxious comic Reggie Warrington publicly humiliates him about his weight. Sherman becomes depressed and has a nightmare in which he becomes a rampaging giant and wrecks the city with a single fart that is ignited to cause an explosion. He tests his serum on himself and loses 300 pounds in seconds. Overwhelmed by his thinness, he goes out and buys copious amounts of normal-sized clothing to celebrate, and a 47,000 Viper sports car on his faculty expense account. To conceal his true identity, Sherman adopts a fake name, \\"Buddy Love\\", and invites Carla out on a date at the same club again (while the serum begins to wear off).

While they may seem similar and both are mentioned to be purely defined by software, they are not entirely the same. 1. A \\"virtual instrument\\" is a type of software that imitates the function of an actual, physical instrument. It relates to the idea of using software to replicate the functionalities and interfaces of traditional hardware devices, such as synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, and other types of electronic musical instruments. Virtual instruments mainly use software-based processing engines to generate sounds and music. 2. A \\"synthetic instrument\\", on the other hand, is a type of software-simulated device that is designed to mimic the behavior of a physical system by using mathematical models and algorithms. They are mainly used in electronics testing and measurement, where the idea is to use software to mimic the behavior of a physical device or system under test. So, while both virtual and synthetic instruments are defined by software, the applications and principles behind these concepts are different. Virtual instruments primarily focus on the emulation of musical hardware for audio production and live performances. Synthetic instruments, however, are more about simulating the behavior of a physical system for testing and measurement purposes.

It was heralded as a fresh start after last season's torrid time under David Moyes, and nobody can deny Louis van Gaal's arrival at Manchester United has had its ups and downs. But after the 1-0 defeat in the Manchester derby on Sunday, United sat in 10th place in the Premier League, which they have won 13 times. They are undoubtedly struggling to adjust, and a depleted back line makes the outlook up to Christmas bleak. Records have been smashed, and not the type Sir Alex Ferguson used to break with pride. Here, Sportsmail brings you the worst... Manchester United players look dejected after Sergio Aguero struck City's winner in the second half United had five players sent off in","completion":"the first half of the season, a new club record that further highlighted the squad's lack of discipline and unity. Players like Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford felt the pressure of their newfound roles, but young stars like Mason Greenwood and Brandon Williams continued to show promise. As the season pressed on, United's injury crisis only worsened, leading to increased reliance on their academy players. Despite their resilience and occasional flashes of brilliance, they struggled to find consistency and put together a string of quality performances. Although Louis van Gaal's philosophy and tactics were initially met with excitement, fans and pundits alike began to question his defensive-minded approach. Desperate for change, van Gaal tried to implement more attacking formations, but the lack of firepower and creativity in the squad made it difficult to execute his vision. As the January transfer window approached, van Gaal knew he had to strengthen his squad. Manchester United brought in a few fresh faces, including an experienced centre-back and a creative midfielder. These signings injected some much-needed energy into the team, and performances started to improve. The Red Devils managed to claw their way back up the table, but their earlier setbacks made it near impossible to secure a top-four finish. However, United did manage to reach the final of the FA Cup, giving the team and their supporters a chance to end the season on a high note. In the FA Cup final, Manchester United faced off against a formidable opponent. The match was a thrilling, back-and-forth affair that showcased both teams' attacking prowess. In the dying moments of extra time, a piece of magic from one of United's new signings sealed a dramatic 2-1 victory and brought the trophy back to Old Trafford. Ultimately, the season was a rollercoaster ride for Manchester United. Although they failed to secure a Champions League spot, their FA Cup triumph provided a glimmer of hope for the future. Amidst the turmoil, Louis van Gaal's signings and belief in youth development laid the foundation for the team's gradual return to domestic and European dominance in the seasons to come. As the Red Devils lifted the FA Cup trophy, the United faithful knew that while it was far from perfect, the season marked the beginning of a new era and a step in the right direction. And so, the story of Manchester United's turbulent campaign under Louis van Gaal ended on an optimistic note, filled with promise and hope for a brighter tomorrow."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine the truth value of the second sentence when considering the first sentence being true, we need to analyze each sentence and understand their context: Sentence 1: \\"Consider a program of discounts for presortation.\\" This sentence asks us to think about or entertain the idea of a program that offers discounts for presortation (sorting in advance). Sentence 2: \\"Don't consider any programs.\\" This sentence instructs us not to think about or entertain the idea of any programs. Step by step analysis: 1. Assume that Sentence 1 is true.

Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart. Much to his dismay, immediately after he finally expresses his love to her she is \\"clubbed\\" by Thudnik (and all that follows in the tradition of caveman stereotypes), and eventually married to him. Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life. After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman. He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? no laughs","completion":"Based on the provided review, which states \\"no laughs,\\" it can be inferred that the opinion of the movie being reviewed is negative. The phrasing implies that the movie did not provide any comedic moments or humor, which might have been expected or desired by the reviewer. A more detailed explanation for the negative opinion is as follows: It is possible that the movie being reviewed is of a comedy genre or was marketed as a light-hearted film. If that is the case, then a movie that contains \\"no laughs\\" would not meet the intentions, investments, or expectations of both the intended audience and the reviewer. In this circumstance, viewers would likely go into the movie with hopes for an entertaining, amusing experience. If the movie fails to provide such comic relief, viewers would undoubtedly feel disappointed, which is evident in the reviewer's choice of stating \\"no laughs.\\" Furthermore, the term \\"no laughs\\" could speak to other components of the movie, such as the script, direction, or acting. When a movie fails to provide entertainment through laughter, it may signify that the film's dialogue lacks wit, that the timing fails to highlight comedic moments, or that the characters and/or situations are not funny or relatable. Additionally, the film's blending of humor might not be in line with the reviewer's taste. Such an issue may explain the negative opinion in the review. Moreover, the negative opinion stemming from \\"no laughs\\" might extend to the movie's general appeal across multiple genres. Even if the film is not categorized as solely comedic, humorous moments can elevate other genres -- like action, drama, romance, or thriller -- by providing lighter scenes and character interactions that allow viewers to emotionally connect with the story. Movies that fail to offer comic relief might come off as lackluster or monotonous, and as a result, the reviewer would hold a more negative opinion. This short review of \\"no laughs,\\" therefore, suggests a more significant dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of the movie: genre expectations, script or screenplay, direction, acting, or the overall entertainment value for the reviewer. These factors contribute to a negative opinion of the movie being reviewed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Croatia based its economy on tourism and fishing, while Italy based its economy on conventional agriculture. Both countries had thriving economies, but they both polluted the sea in different ways. Which country caused the formation of hypoxia? Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it is more likely that Italy caused the formation of hypoxia in the sea. While both Croatia and Italy polluted the sea in different ways, the primary cause of hypoxia is the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals which are often the result of agricultural activities. Croatia, with its economy based on tourism and fishing, would potentially be more focused on maintaining the cleanliness and aesthetic appeal of its waters to attract tourists. This could involve stricter regulations on waste disposal and lesser emissions of harmful chemicals into the sea. Nevertheless, it may still contribute to marine pollution through marine debris, such as floating waste from tourists and fishing activities. Italy, on the other hand, has its economy primarily based on conventional agriculture. Agricultural activities often involve the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and various other chemicals to maximize crop production. When these chemicals are washed into rivers and eventually into the ocean, they can lead to an excessive influx of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients then lead to algal blooms, which eventually decay and consume large amounts of oxygen. This process results in hypoxia, where oxygen levels in the water become critically low, creating dead zones that are unable to support most marine life. Moreover, Italy's agriculture also includes livestock farming, which can generate significant amounts of animal waste. When this waste reaches the rivers and the ocean, it contributes to further oxygen depletion due to the high levels of organic matter that also demand oxygen for decomposition. Additionally, human waste from Italy, if not properly managed, can contribute to marine pollution and exacerbate hypoxia conditions. In conclusion, it is more likely that Italy, with its conventional agriculture-based economy, caused the formation of hypoxia in the sea due to the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals from agriculture fertilizers, livestock, and human waste. While Croatia does contribute to marine pollution, the nature of its economy does not inherently lead to hypoxia to the same extent as Italy's agricultural practices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If \\"Two people outside in cold winter, with a scarf and hat on\\", does it logically follow that \\"Two people are cold while being outside\\"?","completion":"To determine if it logically follows that \\"Two people are cold while being outside\\", let's break down the provided statement and analyze it step-by-step: 1. The statement tells us that there are two people outside in cold winter. 2. It also mentions that they are wearing a scarf and a hat. The presence of a scarf and a hat indicates that the two people are taking precautions to protect themselves from the cold weather. However, the statement does not explicitly mention if they are still feeling cold despite wearing these items. Now let's determine if the conclusion \\"Two people are cold while being outside\\" logically follows: 1. We know that the two people are in a cold environment during winter, which could lead to the possibility of them feeling cold. 2. The scarf and hat are protective measures, but we lack information on the adequacy and effectiveness of these items in keeping the two people warm. 3.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What year was the last recording session of the man who attempted to curb his alcohol intake? On November 30, 1928, whilst on tour in Cleveland, Beiderbecke suffered what Lion terms \\"a severe nervous crisis\\" and Sudhalter and Evans suggest \\"was in all probability an acute attack of delirium tremens\\", presumably triggered by Beiderbecke's attempt to curb his alcohol intake. \\"He cracked up, that's all\\", trombonist Bill Rank said. \\"Just went to pieces; broke up a roomful of furniture in the hotel.\\"In February 1929, Beiderbecke returned home to Davenport to convalesce and was hailed by the local press as \\"the world's hottest cornetist\\". He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again. However, when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930, Beiderbecke did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly. On his last recording session, in New York, on September 15, 1930, Beiderbecke played on the original recording of Hoagy Carmichael's new song, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", with Carmichael doing the vocal, Eddie Lang on guitar, Joe Venuti on violin, Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto...

As the young generation in society, most of them are aged between 25 and 45. In the eyes of outsiders, they enjoy a comfortable life: they lead the fashion trend in the city and earn a high salary; they enjoy a flexible working schedule and a very good working environment; having a good education background, they don't have to worry that one day they will lose their jobs. However, only the white collars themselves know what others see as a good life is in fact a boring life. They often work extra hours, suffer from loss of creative ability and have little time to make friends. When they go off from work late at night, somethimes they might think of asking for a leave the next day and having a holiday somewhere. However, when a new day begins, they find everything back to normal and themselves pushed by new tasks. In fact, even if they don't work extra hours in the office, they have no place to go. Many of the young people are fresh from college, or have come to work in large cities from their hometowns. As newcomers, they haven't established a social network. They have few friends to go dating. Meanwhile, many of them face a great pressure for earning money to buy a house or a car.

Possible answers: buy lots of alcoholic drinks for Riley, leave the club with the new man, be concerned about the strange man","completion":"Based on the context provided, it is difficult to predict with certainty Robin's next actions, as they will depend largely on Robin's personality and the dynamics within their friendship with Riley. However, here are potential scenarios detailing possible reactions for each of the proposed answers: 1. Buy lots of alcoholic drinks for Riley: If Robin is a supportive and wingman-like friend, they might choose to buy drinks for Riley and the handsome man in order to help facilitate conversation and socializing between them. This could be especially true if Robin believes that their friend is a bit shy or could use a confidence boost in this situation. In this case, Robin's goal would be to create a friendly and comfortable atmosphere for Riley and the man to get to know each other better, while also enjoying the club environment. 2. Leave the club with the new man: This option suggests that Robin may be the type of friend who would prioritize their own enjoyment and interests over their friend's. In this scenario, Robin might see an opportunity to have fun with this handsome man or may be looking to have their own exciting adventure during their night at the club. This could also indicate that Robin trusts Riley to take care of themselves, and believes they don't need any further assistance or support in getting to know the man. 3. Be concerned about the strange man: In this scenario, Robin may be a more protective and cautious friend who is concerned about Riley's safety and well-being. Robin could be worried that the handsome man has ulterior motives or could potentially pose a threat to Riley. In this case, Robin's main priority would be ensuring that Riley remains safe and feels comfortable throughout the evening. This may involve Robin staying close to Riley, carefully observing the man's behavior, or even intervening if they sense any danger or uncomfortable vibes. Each of these options reflects different aspects of Robin's personality and their relationship with Riley, and their next action will ultimately depend on these factors.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: The first week of March in 1963 was busy for John Coltrane. He was in the midst of a two-week run at Birdland and was gearing up to record the famed John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman album, which he did on March 7. But there was a session the day before that was the stuff of legend, until now. On Wednesday, March 6, Coltrane and the quartet went to Van Gelder Studios in Englewood, NJ and cut a complete album's worth of material, including several original compositions that were never recorded elsewhere. They spent the day committing these to tape, taking time with some, rehearsing them two, three times, playing them in different ways and in different configurations. At the end of the day, Coltrane left Van Gelder Studios with a reference tape and brought it to the home in Queens that he shared with his wife, Naima. These tapes remained untouched for the next 54 years until Impulse! approached the family about finally releasing this lost album. Though the master tape was never found—Rudy Van Gelder wasn't one for clutter—the reference tape was discovered to be in excellent condition. As the legendary saxophonist Sonny Rollins so rightly put it, \\"This is like finding a new room in the Great Pyramid.\\" The musical implications of this album, the original compositions, the arrangements, the band, the year it was recorded, all amount to a rediscovery and re-contextualization of one of the most important musicians of our time. Danny Bennett, President and CEO of the Verve Label Group and home of Impulse! records, says, \\"Jazz is more relevant today than ever. It's becoming the alternative music of the 21st century, and no one embodies the boundary-breaking essence of jazz more than John Coltrane. He was a visionary who changed the course of music, and this lost album is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery. It gives us insight into his creative process and connects us to his artistry. This album is a cultural moment and the release coincides perfectly with our relaunch of the iconic Impulse! label.\\" On this album, there are two completely unknown and never-before-heard originals. \\"Untitled Original 11383\\" and \\"Untitled Original 11386,\\" both played on soprano sax. \\"11383\\" features an arco bass solo by Jimmy Garrison, a relative rarity, and \\"11386\\" marks a significant structural change for the quartet, in that they keep returning to the theme between solos, not typical in the quartet's repertoire. In addition to the two unheard originals, \\"One Up, One Down\\" – released previously only on a bootleg recording from Birdland – is heard here as a studio recording for the first and only time. It contains a fascinating exchange between Elvin Jones and Coltrane. \\"Impressions,\\" one of Coltrane's most famous and oft-recorded compositions, is played here in a piano-less trio. In fact, McCoy Tyner lays out a number of times during this recording session. It's one of the more interesting aspects of this session and reflects the harmonic possibilities that Coltrane was known to be discussing regularly with Ornette Coleman around this time. This studio session also yielded Coltrane's first recording of \\"Nature Boy,\\" which he would record again in 1965, and the two versions differ greatly. The one we know is exploratory, meandering. This version is tight, solo-less and clocking in at just over three minutes. The other non-original composition on the album is \\"Vilia,\\" from Franz Lehár's operetta \\"The Merry Widow\\". The soprano version on the Deluxe Edition is the only track from this session to have been previously released. This incredible, once-in-a-lifetime discovery reveals a number of creative balances at work, like developing original melodies while rethinking familiar standards. Trying out some tunes first on tenor saxophone, then on soprano. Using older techniques like the arpeggio runs of his \\"sheets of sound\\" while experimenting with false fingerings and other newer sounds. This session was pivotal, though to call it such overlooks the fact Coltrane was ever on pivot, always pushing the pedal down while still calling on older, tested ideas and devices. Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album is a major addition to the Coltrane catalogue and the most important jazz discovery in recent memory. This historic session resulted in 14 tracks in total. On the standard edition, there are 7 takes, chosen by Ravi Coltrane. The rest of the takes exist on the second disc of the deluxe set. There will be a standard CD and LP and a deluxe CD and LP available on June 29 on Impulse! The deluxe edition will exist on all digital streaming platforms as well. Impulse! Records Impulse!

This was a ground-shaking band, an almost physical being, bearing a promise that seemed to reach far beyond music. The quartet’s relationship to the studio, however, was something different. In the years leading up to “A Love Supreme,” his explosive 1965 magnum opus, Coltrane produced eight albums for Impulse! Records featuring the members of his so-called classic quartet — the bassist Jimmy Garrison, the drummer Elvin Jones and the pianist McCoy Tyner — but only two of those, “Coltrane” and “Crescent,” were earnest studio efforts aimed at distilling the band’s live ethic. But now that story needs a major footnote. On Friday, Impulse! will announce the June 29 release of “Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album,” a full set of material recorded by the quartet on a single day in March 1963, then eventually stashed away and lost. The family of Coltrane’s first wife, Juanita Naima Coltrane, recently discovered his personal copy of the recordings, which she had saved, and brought it to the label’s attention. ||||| A lost album of originals by John Coltrane, the American saxophonist who took jazz to new heights of freedom and expression, has been unearthed. The album, being released on 29 June as Both Directions at Once: the Lost Album, was recorded in a session on 6 March 1963, at the Van Gelder studios in New Jersey. Joining Coltrane in the quartet that also recorded classic albums such as A Love Supreme, Coltrane, and Ballads, are Jimmy Garrison on double bass, Elvin Jones on drums, and McCoy Tyner on piano. The master tape left in the studio was lost, and it’s likely it was destroyed in the early 70s when the label, Impulse!, was trying to reduce storage fees. But Coltrane gave his own reference tape of the recording to his wife Naima, despite their then disintegrating relationship – the pair divorced in 1966, and the tape has stayed in her family’s possession ever since. Sonny Rollins, a peer of Coltrane’s and also regarded as one of the greatest jazz saxophonists of all time, described the discovery as “like finding a new room in the Great Pyramid”. Among the seven tracks are two completely unheard original compositions, called Untitled Original 11383 and Untitled Original 11386, both of which are played on soprano saxophone. Another composition, One Up, One Down, has been heard only in a live bootleg from the Birdland jazz club, and never before in this studio version. Facebook Twitter Pinterest John Coltrane quartet … from left, John Coltrane, Elvin Jones, Jimmy Garrison, McCoy Tyner. Photograph: Jim Marshall Photography LLC The sessions capture Coltrane at a crucial juncture in his music. It was still two years before Ascension, where he opened up his quartet into an experimental, spiritually minded big band, but he was already heading towards its “free jazz” sound. Impressions (1963), recorded across the previous two years, features some unmoored and raw soloing quite different from the previous bebop era. Nevertheless, he was still in love with melody: Ballads, recorded during the same period and also released in 1963, features some of his most accessible material. The 11386 recording similarly sees the quartet play in a traditional style, revisiting a melodic chorus theme between solos, and the album also features Coltrane’s first, never before heard version of Nat King Cole’s Nature Boy – unlike the freer 1965 version, the Both Directions at Once version is a straight three-minute take without solos. Ben Ratliff, former New York Times jazz writer and author of Coltrane: the Story of a Sound, told the Guardian: “This is Coltrane’s quartet starting to move into the last stages of their stable and authoritative phase, when they were often playing the same handful of songs. There’s no concept or grand design here. But he’s trying some new tunes, and playing a strange blues, and fine-tuning Impressions – and that’s a lot.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cover artwork for John Coltrane’s Both Directions at Once: the Lost Album. Photograph: Impulse! Both Directions at Once was recorded at an intensely fertile time for Coltrane and his quartet – as well as Ballads and Impressions, he also released a collaboration with Duke Ellington in 1963. The lost session was recorded during a two-week run of shows at Birdland – Coltrane played the club straight after the session – and the following day, 7 March, he recorded the album John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman with the jazz singer (its tracklisting changed on the way to the studio, after the pair heard Nat King Cole singing Lush Life on the radio and decided to include their own version). Saxophonist Wayne Shorter, interviewed for the album’s liner notes, says the title Both Directions at Once came from a compositional tip Coltrane gave to him: “about starting a sentence in the middle, and then going to the beginning and the end of it at the same time.” The Guardian’s jazz critic John Fordham finds another meaning: “Coltrane was looking back at bebop – the virtuosity and melodic resources of which he had stretched to breaking point – and the song-based lyricism of jazz he had recently explored with Duke Ellington, and was about to with Johnny Hartman. But he was also looking forward to imagining the more intense, mantra-like, spiritually-driven music that produced A Love Supreme in 1964.” British jazz and improv saxophonist Evan Parker meanwhile told the Guardian: “This release is most welcome – the ‘classic quartet’ was where Coltrane did his best work.” He picked out Coltrane’s interplay with drummer Elvin Jones as being “the core of the music ... which reached astonishing levels of intuitive understanding.” Ratliff adds that “most of all, Both Directions at Once is a study in how seriously strong the band was, and how powerful his intent, or his concentration, had become.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A long-lost album by famous jazz saxophonist John Coltrane has been found and will be released on June 29.

The emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), has granted natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) have misgivings. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption.

Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella, Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha), shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted. In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth US75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor.

They are wrong, and the days of beautiful, handcrafted animation is fast flying out the window in favor of assembly-line CGI. This movie is all spectacle with no heart. At times the film comes close to being a good, worthwhile movie, but frustratingly misses the mark so many times by copping out of talking about something meaningful and instead choosing to go with the glitz. Another problem with the movie is the pacing. It starts confusingly and then begins to rocket along with a choppy story editing style that is not appreciated. The viewer is rushed out of the door along with Milo Thatch (voiced well by Michael J. Fox) and is left thinking \\"Gee there must be an awful lot of stuff that's going to happen once we get to Atlantis\\". Unfortunately, not much happens. The secret of Atlantis remains a secret with the story-tellers not really knowing how to explain the legendary island/continent. They are afraid to commit to saying where Atlantis is, even in a fictional story. Is it in the Atlantic? Is it in the Mediterranean Sea? Who knows? Nothing is hypothesized, even from a purely fantasy-based point of view. The viewer will leave the theatre asking themselves \\"Now what was that all about? What was the point of the movie? Why couldn't the surviving Atlantean's remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster to the \\"present\\" day? And WHY did Atlantis sink?\\" and then promptly begin to forget about what they saw. There is nothing left to think about or mill over... except the loss of money in their wallets. The characters and their motivations are equally unfathomable. From the eccentric zillionaire who founds the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in 1914, to the (spoiler) collective consciousness that enters Kida and VOLUNTARILY deserts its people!?! The crew are a collection of quirky, 2-dimensional people of anachronistically (for 1914) P.C. race and gender. The demolitions expert talks like he came right out of a Warner Brothers' Bugs Bunny short. Most of the jokes are gross one-liners that are largely missed by the audience for two reasons: They are delivered at lightning-speed pacing and usually mumbled. The way these supporting players do a moral turn-around near the end of the movie is hard to believe. While we applaud Disney for trying to create animated movies for adults - and this is the first Disney not to have cute, talking animals or objects - it fails to make the transition. Younger children will be frightened by some of the action scenes and be left in the dark by the large amount of subtitles (when the characters speak Atlantean). In the first five minutes of the expedition, approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought. Obviously Disney thinks that if you didn't know who those people were, then why should you care? Again, the movie has no feelings on any level. Mulan and Tarzan were the last animated movies produced by Disney that were done extremely well. Sadly, Atlantis harkens back to those failed attempts in the past such as the Black Cauldron and Hunchback of Notre Dame. Disney needs to get back to their roots. A sequel to Peter Pan is coming out shortly but one never knows what the results will be until you see it for yourself. And now that Disney has discovered Science Fiction one hopes that they will realize that that genre must have more than spectacle to it. We also hope that the upcoming \\"Treasure Planet\\", a sci-fi adaptation of Robert L. Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island\\", will have more heart to it than the unfathomable \\"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\\". Would you say this review is positive or negative?

After a few days of feeling terrible his brother comes by to check his temperature noting that it is 100.6°F. and a hint : White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. Please answer this question : Will being sick with a bacterial infection cause a person's body temperature to increase or decrease? A:","completion":"Being sick with a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, will cause a person's body temperature to increase. This is due to the immune system's response to fight the infection.

Please answer the following question: Information: - In biological classification, rank is the relative level of a group of organisms (a taxon) in a taxonomic hierarchy. Examples of taxonomic ranks are species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain, etc. - A twig is a small thin terminal branch of a woody plant. The buds on the twig are an important diagnostic characteristic, as are the abscission scars where the leaves have fallen away. The color, texture, and patterning of the twig bark are also important, in addition to the thickness and nature of any pith of the twig. - Seaweed refers to several species of macroscopic, multicellular, marine algae. - A zygote (from Greek \\"zygtos\\" \\"joined\\" or \\"yoked\\", from \\"zygoun\\" \\"to join\\" or \\"to yoke\\"), is a eukaryotic cell formed by a fertilization event between two gametes. The zygote's genome is a combination of the DNA in each gamete, and contains all of the genetic information necessary to form a new individual. In multicellular organisms, the zygote is the earliest developmental stage. In single-celled organisms, the zygote can divide asexually by mitosis to produce identical offspring. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - In biology, phylogenetics (Greek: , - \\"phylé\\", \\"phylon\\" = tribe, clan, race + - \\"genetikós\\" = origin, source, birth) is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e.g. species, or populations). These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits. The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree) a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. The tips of a phylogenetic tree can be living organisms or fossils, and represent the \\"end,\\" or the present, in an evolutionary lineage. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes. - Ecdysozoa is a group of protostome animals, including Arthropoda (insects, chelicerata, crustaceans, and myriapods), nematoda, and several smaller phyla. They were first defined by Aguinaldo \\"et al.\\" in 1997, based mainly on phylogenetic trees constructed using 18S ribosomal RNA genes. A large study in 2008 by Dunn \\"et al.\\" strongly supported the Ecdysozoa as a clade, that is, a group consisting of a common ancestor and all its descendants. - A lichen is a composite organism that arises from algae and/or cyanobacteria living among filaments of multiple fungi in a symbiotic relationship. The combined life form has properties that are very different from the properties of its component organisms. Lichens come in many colours, sizes, and forms. The properties are sometimes plant-like, but lichens are not plants. Lichens may have tiny, leafless branches (fruticose), flat leaf-like structures (foliose), flakes that lie on the surface like peeling paint (crustose), or other growth forms. A macrolichen is a lichen that is either bush-like or leafy; all other lichens are termed microlichens. Here, \\"macro\\" and \\"micro\\" do not refer to size, but to the growth form. Common names for lichens may contain the word \\"moss\\" (e.g., \\"Reindeer moss\\", \\"Iceland moss\\"), and lichens may superficially look like and grow with mosses, but lichens are not related to mosses or any plant. Lichens do not have roots that absorb water and nutrients as plants do but like plants they produce their own food by photosynthesis using solar energy, from carbon dioxide, water and minerals in their environment. When they grow on plants, they do not live as parasites but instead use the plants as a substrate. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts. - Sponges are the basalmost clade of animals of the phylum Porifera (meaning \\"pore bearer\\". They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched between two thin layers of cells. Sponges have unspecialized cells that can transform into other types and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges do not have nervous, digestive or circulatory systems. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes. Overview. Sponges are similar to other animals in that they are multicellular, heterotrophic, lack cell walls and produce sperm cells. Unlike other animals, they lack true tissues and organs, and have no body symmetry. The shapes of their bodies are adapted for maximal efficiency of water flow through the central cavity, where it deposits nutrients, and leaves through a hole called the osculum. Many sponges have internal skeletons of spongin and/or spicules of calcium carbonate or silicon dioxide. All sponges are sessile aquatic animals. Although there are freshwater species, the great majority are marine (salt water) species, ranging from tidal zones to depths exceeding . - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants. - Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, creating four haploid cells, each genetically distinct from the parent cell that gave rise to them. This process occurs in all sexually reproducing single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes, including animals, plants, and fungi. Errors in meiosis resulting in aneuploidy are the leading known cause of miscarriage and the most frequent genetic cause of developmental disabilities. - Members of the Monoblepharidomycetes have a filamentous thallus that is either extensive or simple and unbranched . They frequently have a holdfast at the base . In contrast to other taxa in their phylum , some reproduce using autospores , although many do so through zoospores . Oogamous sexual reproduction may also occur . In addition to the type genus , the order Monoblepharidales includes Harpochytrium and Oedogoniomyces . - Myxogastria/Myxogastrea (myxogastrids, ICZN) or Myxomycetes (ICBN), is a grouping of slime molds that contains 5 orders, 14 families, 62 genera and 888 species. They are colloquially known as the plasmodial or acellular slime moulds. - Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle. In eukaryotes, there are two distinct types of cell division: a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell (mitosis), and a reproductive cell division, whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce haploid gametes (meiosis). Meiosis results in twelve haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions: homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division, and sister chromatids are separated in the second division. Both of these cell division cycles are used in sexually reproducing organisms at some point in their life cycle, and both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Prokaryotes also undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission, where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cells. All cell divisions, regardless of organism, are preceded by a single round of DNA replication. - Thallus (plural: thalli), from Latinized Greek (\\"thallos\\"), meaning \\"a green shoot\\" or \\"twig,\\" is the undifferentiated vegetative tissue of some organisms in diverse groups such as algae, fungi, some liverworts, lichens, and the Myxogastria. Many of these organisms were previously known as the thallophytes, a polyphyletic group of distantly related organisms. An organism or structure resembling a thallus is called thalloid, thallodal, thalliform, thalline, or thallose. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Organisms of many species are specialized into male and female varieties, each known as a sex, with some falling in between being intersex. Sexual reproduction involves the combining and mixing of genetic traits: specialized cells known as gametes combine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent. Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogamy), but in many cases an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as anisogamy). - Crinoids are marine animals that make up the class Crinoidea of the echinoderms (phylum Echinodermata). The name comes from the Greek word \\"krinon\\", \\"a lily\\", and \\"eidos\\", \\"form\\". They live in both shallow water and in depths as great as . Those crinoids which, in their adult form, are attached to the sea bottom by a stalk are commonly called sea lilies. The unstalked forms are called feather stars or comatulids. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - Sperm is the male reproductive cell and is derived from the Greek word () \\"sperma\\" (meaning \\"seed\\"). In the types of sexual reproduction known as anisogamy and its subtype oogamy, there is a marked difference in the size of the gametes with the smaller one being termed the \\"male\\" or sperm cell. A uniflagellar sperm cell that is motile is referred to as a spermatozoon, whereas a non-motile sperm cell is referred to as a spermatium. Sperm cells cannot divide and have a limited life span, but after fusion with egg cells during fertilization, a new organism begins developing, starting as a totipotent zygote. The human sperm cell is haploid, so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell. In mammals, sperm develops in the testicles and is released from the penis. It is also possible to extract sperm through TESE. Some sperm banks hold up to of sperm. - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011. - A holdfast is a root-like structure that anchors aquatic sessile organisms, such as seaweed, other sessile algae, stalked crinoids, benthic cnidarians, and sponges, to the substrate. - The thallophytes (Thallophyta or Thallobionta) are a polyphyletic group of non-mobile organisms traditionally described as \\"thalloid plants\\", \\"relatively simple plants\\" or \\"lower plants\\". They were a defunct division of kingdom Plantae that included fungus, lichens and algae and occasionally bryophytes, bacteria and the Myxomycota. Thallophytes have a hidden reproductive system and hence they are also called Cryptogamae (together with ferns), as opposed to Phanerogamae. The thallophytes are defined as having undifferentiated bodies (thalli), as opposed to cormophytes (Cormophyta) with roots and stems. - A gamete (from Ancient Greek \\"gamete\\" from gamein \\"to marry\\") is a cell that fuses with another cell during fertilization (conception) in organisms that sexually reproduce. In species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes, and in which each individual produces only one type, a female is any individual that produces the larger type of gametecalled an ovum (or egg)and a male produces the smaller tadpole-like typecalled a sperm. This is an example of anisogamy or heterogamy, the condition in which females and males produce gametes of different sizes (this is the case in humans; the human ovum has approximately 100,000 times the volume of a single human sperm cell). In contrast, isogamy is the state of gametes from both sexes being the same size and shape, and given arbitrary designators for mating type. The name gamete was introduced by the Austrian biologist Gregor Mendel. Gametes carry half the genetic information of an individual, one ploidy of each type, and are created through meiosis. - The plural (abbreviated ), in many languages, is one of the values of the grammatical category of number. Plural of nouns typically denote a quantity other than the default quantity represented by a noun, which is generally one (the form that represents this default quantity is said to be of \\"singular\\" number). Most commonly, therefore, plurals are used to denote two or more of something, although they may also denote more than fractional, zero or negative amounts. An example of a plural is the English word \\"cats\\", which corresponds to the singular \\"cat\\". Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'taxon rank' with 'class'.

At age 16, he played bass in a blues band called Frankie Starr and the Chill Factor, which disbanded by 1995. Initially, Arthur sought to become a noted bass guitarist, stating: \\"I never started singing until I was in my early 20s. I remember thinking, 'OK - I am not a singer, I am a musician.' I wanted to be this like heroic bass player so I listened to people like Jaco Pastorius, to Bitches Brew over and over again.

News article: Major Ottawa roads affected by construction starting Sunday Some of the ways to get in and out of Ottawa's core will be different starting Sunday thanks to light rail-related construction. The Transitway is closing from Laurier Avenue to Lees station, including the Campus station at the University of Ottawa, so the bus-only road can be converted to light rail lines. Buses will then move to Nicholas Street, meaning a bus-only lane is being set up heading north along with a lane for the rest of traffic. Southbound Nicholas Street heading towards Highway 417 will be two lanes shared between buses and vehicle traffic. Earlier this week, city councillor and transportation committee chair Keith Egli said people should avoid Nicholas Street if they can. Queen Street is also changing Sunday from a two-way street to a one-way eastbound street heading toward downtown from Bay Street to Metcalfe Street. Queen Street will become a one-way eastbound street from Bay Street to Metcalfe Street. (Andrew Foote/CBC) Crews will be overhauling the street to improve it for the extra foot traffic expected when Lyon and Parliament light rail stations open on Queen Street in 2018. Westbound vehicles will be directed one street south to Albert Street while this construction work is happening.

Question 1: Should I jailbreak my iPhone again? Question 2: Should I jailbreak my iPhone 4? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the core concern in both questions. Both questions revolve around whether or not to jailbreak an iPhone. Step 2: Evaluate the variables in each question. Question 1 merely asks about jailbreaking an iPhone in general, whereas Question 2 specifies an iPhone 4. Step 3: Consider the advantages and disadvantages of jailbreaking. Advantages: - Increased customization options - Access to additional apps not available in the App Store - Potential removal of default apps Disadvantages: - Voiding the warranty - Increased security risks - Possible instability in the system Step 4: Consider the context of the specified iPhone model in Question 2. The iPhone 4 is an older model, which may already be out of warranty and may not receive regular software updates from Apple. Therefore, the main disadvantages of jailbreaking might not be as significant in this case. Step 5: Compare both questions considering their variables and context. While the core concern is the same in both questions, the variables and context differ. Question 1 doesn't specify an iPhone model, and the general advice may not apply to all iPhones. In the case of Question 2, the answer may lean more towards jailbreaking because the disadvantages might be less significant, given that it's an older iPhone model. Conclusion: The answer to these two questions would not be the same due to the different context and variables involved. For Question 1, the answer would depend on various factors such as the specific iPhone model, warranty, and user preferences. For Question 2, given that it's an iPhone 4, jailbreaking may be a more justifiable option, but ultimately depends on your personal preferences and willingness to accept the risks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - A red giant burns mass - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains - This inner core is known as a white dwarf. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more items thrown away that can be reused happens, how will it affect the inner core is smaller. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"In the context of a red giant transforming into a white dwarf and the perturbation hypothesis, the hypothesis proposes that additional elements thrown away or not reused might affect the inner core's size. However, it is crucial to understand the stages of a red giant's transformation into a white dwarf to determine if this perturbation would affect the process directly or indirectly. The process of a red giant becoming a white dwarf can be summarized into following steps: 1. The red giant's core fuses hydrogen and helium, creating high temperatures and massive amounts of energy. 2. As the hydrogen and helium decrease, the core temperature continues to rise, causing the star to expand. 3. The core eventually becomes comprised mostly of carbon and oxygen. At this point, the temperature is insufficient to initiate carbon fusion. 4. The outer layers of the red giant are released into space due to gravitational forces no longer retaining these layers. 5. Once the outer layers have been ejected, the remaining core, known as a white dwarf, is left behind. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if more elements/materials are ejected from the red giant than what is mentioned in the process, it could influence the size of the inner core. Nonetheless, there might not be any direct effect on the transition stages outlined above, since the core temperature and fusion processes determine the evolution of the star. However, there might be indirect effects in the sense that having a slightly smaller core could influence the overall lifespan and properties of the resulting white dwarf. For instance, the cooling rate of the white dwarf or the time it will take to eventually transform into a black dwarf might change. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis might not have a direct effect on the transformation process of a red giant into a white dwarf, but it could indirectly influence some properties and the lifecycle of the resulting white dwarf."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The question proposes a scenario in which muscles are moved in an expanding motion. To analyze the effects of such a perturbation, let's break down the process step-by-step: 1. Electrical signals in the brain still travel through nerves to muscles - no effect on the process of the brain sending signals. 2. Two types of proteins still exist in filaments in the muscles - no effect on the existence of these proteins in filaments. 3. The filaments move when the brain instructs them to - a possible effect due to the proposed expanding motion instead of the regular contraction motion. The manner in which the filaments move might change or be less efficient in this scenario. 4. The motion of the filaments causes the muscle to shorten and contract - an effect on this step, as expanding motion opposes the normal contraction motion. The muscle might not be able to contract as efficiently or at all in the expanding motion scenario. 5. Opposing pairs of muscles exist to provide the necessary range of motion - less effect, considering the expanding motion may alter the way these opposing muscle pairs work together, but they would still theoretically have some range of motion.

Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies.

However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey.

Most significantly, though, Gerrard revealed he would have committed his future to Liverpool had they offered to extend his terms when he retired from England. He intended to commit to Liverpool for the next ‘two or three years’ but an offer did not arrive until November. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steven Gerrard break his silence on his Anfield exit. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has revealed he would have signed a new contract during the summer. Gerrard runs away in celebration after giving Premier League outfit Liverpool the lead against Wimbledon. Steven Gerrard hits the town for his team-mate Martin Skrtel's 30th birthday on Tuesday. ‘If a contract had been put in front of me in pre-season I’d have signed it,’ Gerrard told the Liverpool Echo. ‘I’d just retired from England to concentrate on Liverpool. I didn't want my club games to be tailored. 'My injury record had been fantastic for the past two-and-a-half years and I had a great season from a personal point of view last season. 'It's all ifs, buts and hindsight now. That period between the summer and the end of November gave me thinking time. 'There's no blame and I'm not angry about it.

Rodgers spoke to Gerrard, who is expected to sign a deal with MLS side LA Galaxy in the near future, in late November and it came as something of a surprise to the player, but once the writing was on the wall the former England captain knew his days at Anfield were numbered. 'I've got to be honest, that chat with Brendan came earlier than I was expecting,' he added. 'It was about a month before that he first mentioned to me about managing my game time. 'We had another chat on the subject recently - 10 days to two weeks ago. It was tough but I understood. It's been very amicable. Everyone knows how much I rate Brendan. Our relationship is very good. 'There hasn't been a cross word between us. Brendan has been fantastic for me. My only regret is that I didn't get to work with him at a younger age. Gerrard looks on as his fine free-kick goes over the wall on its way to securing Liverpool a 2-1 victory.

England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Firth of Tay (Scottish Gaelic: Linne Tatha) is a firth in Scotland between the council areas of Fife, Perth and Kinross, the City of Dundee and Angus, into which Scotland's largest river in terms of flow, the River Tay empties. The firth has a maximum width of at Invergowrie. - The Northern Isles is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas.

Check if the paint is deteriorating. Article:","completion":"Title: How to Figure Out if Your Home's Paint is from 1970 or Earlier Hello, kids! Today, we're going to learn about how to find out if the paint on a house is an old one, particularly from 1970 or earlier. This is important because older paint can sometimes be dangerous if it starts falling apart or isn't taken care of properly. First, let's understand why it's important to know about the age of the paint. Paints that were made before 1978 often had a harmful ingredient called \\"lead.\\" This can be bad for our health if we accidentally eat paint chips or breathe in dust from the paint. So, it's very important to find out if the paint on a house is old. Here are some steps you can follow to learn more about the paint: 1. Talk to the owner of the home: The first thing you can do is chat with the person who owns the home. They might know when the house was painted last. If they don't know, they might have some clues, like old pictures or documents that show the house during different years. These can give you an idea about the age of the paint. 2. Ask the previous owners or neighbors: If the current owner doesn't know, don't worry! You can also try talking to the people who lived in the house before them, or even the neighbors. They might remember what the house looked like when it was painted. 3. Check if the paint is deteriorating: Older paint has a higher chance of coming off or crumbling. You can gently poke at the paint with a wooden stick or your finger to see if it flakes off easily. If it does, once you have checked the age of the paint, you should be extra careful to keep everyone safe. 4. Look for clues in the home: You may find some clues in the paint itself. Older paint may have a chalky or rough texture. If you see any paint that looks bubbled, cracked, or uneven, it might be from before 1970. Remember to always be careful when dealing with older paint! If you find out that your house has paint from before 1970, it's a good idea to talk to an adult or a professional painter. They can help you figure out the right steps to keep everyone safe and sound! Now, you know how to figure out if your home's paint is from 1970 or earlier.

Information: - Shanghai Baby is a semi-autobiographical novel written by Chinese author Wei Hui. It was originally published in China in 1999. The English translation was published in 2001. - Early life and teen years. Born only three years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, as the son of a school teacher, Jia Yanchun (), Jia had an early role model for his later decision to become a writer. Due to a shortage of qualified teachers in Shaanxi at the time, however, Jia's father was often away from home and so he spent much of his early childhood with his mother, Zhou Xiao'e (). With the advent of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Jia Yanchun was accused of being a counter-revolutionary and he spent the next ten years in a labor camp. Three years later, with the closing of all schools in China following the excesses of the Red Guards, Jia was dispatched with his classmates to build reservoirs in the countryside. - Chinese culture is one of the world's oldest cultures, tracing back to thousands of years ago. The area in which the culture is dominant covers a large geographical region in eastern Asia with customs and traditions varying greatly between provinces, cities, and even towns as well.

Her novel \\"Shanghai Baby\\" () (1999) was banned in the People's Republic of China as \\"decadent\\". Her latest novel \\"Marrying Buddha\\" () (2005) was censored, modified and published in China under a modified title. She is often associated with Mian Mian, another slightly older member of the \\"New Generation\\". - The Cultural Revolution, formally the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was a sociopolitical movement that took place in China from 1966 until 1976. Set into motion by Mao Zedong, then Chairman of the Communist Party of China, its stated goal was to preserve 'true' Communist ideology in the country by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society, and to re-impose Maoist thought as the dominant ideology within the Party. The Revolution marked the return of Mao Zedong to a position of power after the Great Leap Forward. The movement paralyzed China politically and negatively affected the country's economy and society to a significant degree. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Shaanxi, formerly romanized as Shensi, is a province of the People's Republic of China.

Question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill! Here’s the Garden City location, where I worked. Why are the young girls screaming? - The waitress passed out and hit her head. - not enough information - They saw the waitress smoking. - They were waiting on the waitress to take their order.

This positive outcome would undoubtedly instill a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction within Bailey, knowing that his efforts and hard work have paid off. Feeling like a winner implies that Bailey not only achieved success in this specific contest but also experienced a boost in self-confidence and motivation, acknowledging that his abilities and determination led him to victory. Shortly after receiving this news, Bailey's excitement would manifest in various ways, such as sharing the accomplishment with friends and family, planning a celebration to commemorate this achievement, or already thinking about new challenges he could undertake with this newfound confidence. The excitement following a victory often serves as a catalyst for the individual, inspiring them to strive for further successes and personal growth in different areas of their life. Throughout this entire experience, Bailey would not feel like a loser, as the context clearly indicates that he emerged as the victor in the contest. In fact, his winning status would contribute to the myriad of positive emotions he likely experienced. This accomplishment would encourage Bailey to reflect on the challenges and setbacks he overcame during the contest and view them as integral components that contributed to his eventual triumph.

Context: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore. Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size. \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\" While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores. The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added. For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \\"return to great power rivalries.\\" The Indian prime minister also insisted that \\"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\\" India is the world's largest democracy. It has the world's seventh-largest economy. Within a decade, it is expected to pass China to become the world's most populous country.

Step 2: Isolate the variable v To isolate v, we need to get rid of the constant 1386 on the right side of the equation. Subtract 1386 from both sides: 0 - 1386 = 66*v + 1386 - 1386, which simplifies to -1386 = 66*v. Step 3: Solve for v Now we need to get v by itself. Since it's being multiplied by 66, we need to divide by 66 on both sides: -1386 ÷ 66 = 66*v ÷ 66. This simplifies to: -21 = v.

Gerald Clamson is a bank examiner who loves fishing on his annual two-week holiday. Unfortunately, one day at the ocean he reels in Syd Valentine (also played by Lewis), an injured gangster in a scuba diving suit. Syd tells Gerald about diamonds he has stolen from the other gangsters and hands him a map. Gerald escapes as frogmen from a yacht machine-gun the beach. They swim ashore, locate Syd and gun him down. Their leader Thor ensures Syd's demise by firing a torpedo from his yacht that goes ashore, blowing a crater into the beach. As the police ignore Gerald's story, Gerald heads to the Hilton Inn in San Diego where Syd claimed the diamonds were hidden. There he meets Suzie Cartwright, an airline stewardess. While searching for the diamonds, he needs to avoid the hotel staff after inadvertently hurting the manager. Gerald disguises himself as a character noticeably similar to Professor Julius Kelp from The Nutty Professor, while trying to stay one step ahead of the other gangsters who are on his tail, as well as the hotel detectives led by the manager—all the while courting Suzie.

Yeast cells sense stress through diverse signaling pathways that converge on the transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4, which respond by initiating rapid, idiosyncratic cycles into and out of the nucleus. To understand the role of Msn2/4 nuclear localization dynamics, we combined time-lapse studies of Msn2-GFP localization in living cells with computational modeling of stress-sensing signaling networks. We find that several signaling pathways, including Ras/protein kinase A, AMP-activated kinase, the high-osmolarity response mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and protein phosphatase 1, regulate activation of Msn2 in distinct ways in response to different stresses. Moreover, we find that bursts of nuclear localization elicit a more robust transcriptional response than does sustained nuclear localization. Using stochastic modeling, we reproduce in silico the responses of Msn2 to different stresses, and demonstrate that bursts of localization arise from noise in the signaling pathways amplified by the small number of Msn2 molecules in the cell. This noise imparts diverse behaviors to genetically identical cells, allowing cell populations to \\"hedge their bets\\" in responding to an uncertain future, and to balance growth and survival in an unpredictable environment.

Please answer the following question: Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. What is likely the job of the people who conducted the study at Deakin University? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - They are most likely researchers at the university. - not enough information - They are probably the owners of a facility that makes macaroni and cheese. - They are most likely world famous chefs.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation of new rules requiring smaller engine bodies, resulting in less power being generated by the engine, can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. To elaborate, the steps involved in the process of power generation in an engine are as follows: 1. Fuel mixes with air: The air-fuel mixture is essential for the combustion process. The engine requires an optimal air-fuel ratio for efficient combustion. Reducing the size of the engine body could result in less space for fuel and air to mix properly, which could negatively impact the efficiency of the combustion process. 2. Mix gets inducted into cylinder: The air-fuel mixture is drawn into the engine cylinders during the intake stroke. A smaller engine body could lead to smaller cylinder volumes, limiting the amount of air-fuel mixture that can be inducted into the cylinder, thus impacting overall engine power. 3. Piston compresses the mix: As the piston moves upwards, it compresses the air-fuel mixture, preparing it for combustion. A smaller engine could potentially have smaller pistons or reduced piston movement range, which can affect the compression ratio and impact the engine's power output. 4. Spark plug emits a spark that ignites it causing combustion: The spark plug initiates the combustion process. A smaller engine body could indirectly affect the combustion process due to the reduced amount of air-fuel mixture or a change in cylinder dimensions, which may lead to incomplete combustion and power loss. 5. Combustion gases expand: The expanding combustion gases apply pressure on the piston, forcing it downward during the power stroke. Reduced combustion efficiency in a smaller engine will have a direct impact on the expansion and force applied to the piston, leading to lower power output. 6. Pushes piston during power stroke: As a result of reduced combustion efficiency, the force acting on the piston during the power stroke may be diminished, indirectly affecting the amount of power generated by the engine. 7. Exhaust valve opens to vent exhaust out tailpipe: The exhaust valve releases the spent combustion gases. While this step is not directly affected by the smaller engine body, the less efficient combustion process and reduced power output could lead to incomplete expulsion of exhaust gases, affecting overall engine performance and efficiency. In conclusion, the introduction of new rules requiring smaller engine bodies will indirectly impact several steps of the engine's power-generation process, leading to less power being generated by the engine. This perturbation does not directly impact any one specific step but rather indirectly affects multiple steps within the process, leading to reduced overall performance and power output."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Lost natural wonder in New Zealand may be found, say researchers The eighth natural wonder of the world may have been rediscovered, 131 years after it was buried by a volcanic eruption, New Zealand researchers believe. In the mid-1800s, the pink and white terraces of Lake Rotomahana in the North Island attracted tourists from around the globe. The terraces – dramatic cascading pools descending into the lake’s temperate waters – were lost in an eruption of Mount Tarawera in 1886. Two researchers think they have pinpointed the location where the terraces may lie preserved 10-15 metres (32-49ft) below the surface, under layers of mud and ash, and said a full archaeological survey was needed to excavate the site. “They [the terraces] became the greatest tourist attraction in the southern hemisphere and the British empire, and shiploads of tourists made the dangerous visit down from the UK, Europe and America to see them,” said Rex Bunn, one of the researchers. “But they were never surveyed by the government of the time, so there was no record of their latitude or longitude.” Bunn and Dr Sascha Nolden believe the terraces were not destroyed or pushed to the bottom of the lake, as earlier research suggested, but were buried on the foreshore of the lake. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lake Rotomahana in the North Island of New Zealand. Photograph: Jon Lovette/Getty Images They used the field diaries of the German-Austrian geologist Ferdinand von Hochstetter, which contain a detailed description of the terraces’ location before the 1886 eruption, to establish their likely resting place. “Our research relied on the only survey ever made of that part of New Zealand and therefore we are confident the cartography is sound,” Bunn said. “Hochstetter was a very competent cartographer.” Since the pair’s research paper was published this month in the Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand, Bunn said he had received daily offers of help to conduct a survey and was in the process of assembling a “team of the willing” to begin exploring the site, once the first funding goal of NZ70,000 (£40,000) was met. “We want to undertake this work in the public interest. And I have been closely liaising with the ancestral owners of the land, the Tuhourangi Tribal Authority, and they are supportive and delighted with the work,” he said. Bunn said he believed the terraces may be in reasonable condition, potentially with minimal damage, and could be restored to their former glory once excavated. This is not the first time researchers have claimed to have discovered the lost terraces. In 2011, scientists using an unmanned submarine said they had found remnants of them on the floor of the lake, buried by silt and debris. Last year, GNS Science New Zealand said that after five years of research, a team of New Zealand and international scientists had come to the “inescapable conclusion” that most of the terraces had been destroyed by the eruption. Bunn said he was in discussions with GNS and believed its conclusions were based on 130 years of inaccurate cartographical information. ||||| This story is part of BBC Earth's \\"Best of 2016\\" list, our greatest hits of the year. Browse the full list. In the early hours of 10 June 1886, Mount Tarawera, a volcano on the North Island of New Zealand, erupted with astonishing force. The explosions may have been heard as far afield as Christchurch, more than 400 miles (640km) to the south-west. The eruption killed 120 people, most of them Maoris – native New Zealanders – living in small villages in the surrounding countryside. But it is not just because of its high death toll that the Tarawera eruption is firmly lodged in the collective memory of New Zealanders. Most people also remember the eruption because it robbed the island nation of a treasured natural wonder: the Pink and White Terraces of Lake Rotomahana. The terraces were the two largest formations of silica sinter – a fine-grained version of quartz – ever known to have existed on Earth. They were located on opposite shores of Lake Rotomahana, situated six miles (10km) to the south-west of Mount Tarawera. And they were extraordinarily beautiful. The terraces are sometimes even described as the eighth wonder of the world. One was a brilliant white colour, while the other, due to an unknown chemical impurity, was tinged a light shade of pink. Either would easily have constituted a geological marvel on its own merits. But to have two such wonders within sight of each other, and in complementary colours, made the Pink and White Terraces greater than the sum of their parts. Watercolour paintings from the 19th Century – particularly those of Charles Blomfield – offer a sense of their magnificence. By the time the eruption died down, sometime around dawn, Lake Rotomahana had vanished \\"It's hard to describe to non-New Zealanders what the terraces mean to us,\\" says Cornel de Ronde, a geologist at GNS Science, a state research institute in New Zealand. Which explains why the events on that cool June morning have become so infamous. Shortly after 3am, about an hour after Mount Tarawera rumbled to life, the eruption spread to Lake Rotomahana, and a cluster of volcanic craters opened up on the lake floor. In 1886 Lake Rotomahana was not visible from any of the surrounding villages, meaning most of the locals could only hear the eruption. But by chance, one person, who happened to be spending the night in the countryside seven miles (11km) to the east, had an unobstructed view of Lake Rotomahana. The Pink and White Terraces had been destroyed, or at best permanently entombed Two days later the man, Henry Burt, told a journalist that during the eruption the lake had resembled \\"a huge boiling cauldron, bubbling [over] in all directions\\". By the time the eruption died down, sometime around dawn, Lake Rotomahana had vanished. The water had literally been blasted into the air, combining with the erupted volcanic ash to form a muddy sludge that buried the surrounding countryside up to 46ft (14m) deep. The newly-formed volcanic craters that had blown apart the floor of Lake Rotomahana were still belching out mud and rocks two days later, when the first expedition party arrived to survey the damage. Not only was the lake gone, but so too it seemed were the Pink and White Terraces. They were nowhere to be seen; the area where they had once stood was caked in volcanic mud. And the white chunks of sinter which some people found mixed in with the volcanic debris did not inspire hope. The shocking state of Lake Rotomahana and its surroundings after the 1886 eruption led New Zealanders to believe that the Pink and White Terraces had been destroyed, or at best permanently entombed. Secretly, some of the researchers were hoping to resolve the mystery that had surrounded the terraces In the months after the eruption, Lake Rotomahana grew back. Water from surrounding streams began to flow into in the volcanic craters which had blown apart the old lake, gradually forming a new lake four times deeper and covering an area approximately five times the size of the original. By the end of 1886, the area where the Pink and White Terraces had once stood was under tens of metres of lake water. It seemed like they had been lost for good. It would be 128 years before the world learned their true fate. Between 2011 and 2014, scientists from GNS Science led a series of expeditions to map and study the floor of Lake Rotomahana. The expedition was not related to the Pink and White Terraces directly. The team's goal was to discover how the 1886 eruption had affected the geothermal system that had formed the terraces. But secretly, some of the researchers were hoping to resolve the mystery that had surrounded the terraces since that dark day in 1886. In their more optimistic moments, some of the scientists may even have hoped to find physical remains. \\"I did quietly wonder what we might find in the areas where the terraces had once sat,\\" says de Ronde, who led some of the lake expeditions. But that was dreaming. In the meantime there was important science to be done. The team was able to build up the sharpest image of the floor of Lake Rotomahana ever made One of the researchers' many aims whilst at Lake Rotomahana was to construct high-resolution images of the lake floor, a task which was carried out by de Ronde and his colleagues from New Zealand and the United States. They hoped that by mapping the lake floor in unprecedented detail, they would somehow be able to discover the fate of the lake's geothermal system. The team obtained the images using, amongst other gadgets, two high-resolution ‘side-scan' sonar instruments. They strapped these onto a pair of torpedo-shaped AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles), which they then remotely manoeuvred through the lake, travelling 31ft (10m) above its floor, mapping the lake floor as they went. The team performed the sonar survey in February 2011. In order to cover the almost 3.5 square miles (9 sq km) of lake floor, the researchers directed the AUVs along a series of parallel, linear paths – each of which imaged a long but narrow strip of the lake floor, almost as if mowing a lawn. By combining many such scans – which totalled approximately 186 miles (300km) of scan lines – the team was able to build up the sharpest image of the floor of Lake Rotomahana ever made. The sonar images are not what you would see with your eyes down there (which, thanks to the gloom and sediment, would not be much anyway). Instead, the images were in black and white – the dark areas represented sediment, while the brighter parts generally represented rocky material or gases. The picture of the lake floor that emerged on the sonar scans was dominated by sediment, as the team had expected. But there were plenty of interesting features on the sonar images too. The team saw what appeared to be a long, thin rocky outcrop Some showed what looked like cracks – geological faults – crossing sections of the lake floor. de Ronde thinks these were probably formed during the 1886 eruption. Elsewhere on the sonar map of the lake floor, the team saw ghostly-looking clouds of bubbles rising from small craters on the lake floor, proof that volcanic gases are still emanating from the floor of Lake Rotomahana today. De Ronde was used to seeing features like these on sonar scans. He had carried out similar analyses of volcanoes on the seafloor. But on one of the sonar images, taken in the north-western corner of Lake Rotomahana, de Ronde and his team saw something they had never seen before, on a sonar image or on any kind of image. Jutting above the lake floor, the team saw what appeared to be a long, thin rocky outcrop, stretching for a horizontal distance of around 197ft (60m). The scientists did not know what they had found. The feature clearly was not a fault: faults are sharply delineated, whereas the mystery outcrop had a misshapen, lumpy appearance. But it was the location of this strange feature that really grabbed the team's attention. They were in the area of the lake floor where the Pink Terraces had once stood. With the eye of faith they even looked a little pinkish The researchers knew that the lumpy outcrop they had discovered could not possibly be the whole of the Pink Terraces; it was only a fraction of their size. But could it be a fragment? This thought alone was enough to get the scientists' pulses racing. The team wanted a photograph right away. Sonar was one thing, but to determine whether the feature might actually be a section of the Pink Terraces, they needed to examine it visually. They had to wait three years. When the researchers first spotted the possible terrace remains in 2011, they had been too caught up with completing the rest of their surveys to deploy their deep-water camera. But when the team returned to Lake Rotomahana for their next round of surveys, in February 2014, they positioned their boat above the possible terrace remains and dropped down the camera. Most of the photographs the team took showed sediment and not much else. But to be safe, they took thousands. And on two of those photographs, de Ronde and his colleagues found something that definitely was not sediment. It also made them smile. The photos showed a rounded, rocky-looking outcrop, sloping gently to one side. And the parts that were not draped in sediment had a bright, pale appearance. With the eye of faith they even looked a little pinkish. This photographic evidence, coupled with the fitting location of the rocks on the lake floor, was enough to confirm it: de Ronde and his colleagues were looking at a section of the Pink Terraces. They had suddenly resurrected a natural wonder. But the best was still to come. Buoyed by their re-discovery of the Pink Terraces, the team re-deployed the aquatic camera approximately 0.6 miles (1km) to the north-east: the relative location, in the pre-1886 landscape, of the White Terraces. Amazingly, these photographs showed much the same thing. In the location where the White Terraces had stood before the 1886 eruption, the camera showed a large lump of pale rock. If anything, this second outcrop looked even more terrace-like than the first. The whitish rock seemed to have the same vertical, columnar texture that is apparent in pre-eruption photographs of the White Terraces. De Ronde likens its texture to candle wax. The team had chalked up another discovery, and Lake Rotomahana had suddenly regained pieces of both of its famous terraces. They had been amputated, drowned and buried by over a century of sediment, but somehow, incredibly, they had partially survived the eruption of 1886. The photographs and sonar images showing the terrace remnants are published in the Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research. They certainly were just fragments of the terraces – only 10% of the Pink Terraces seem to have survived, and even less of the White Terraces – but that fact almost added to the rarity of the discovery for the researchers. Technically speaking, the terraces had always been a sidebar to the group's mission – a romantic distraction, but nothing of scientific substance. But in other ways, the terraces meant a great deal to the scientists – and to New Zealanders more generally. Burt would probably have been amazed that anything at all could have survived \\"I suppose it's a bit like Americans finding evidence for a long-lost Grand Canyon,\\" says de Ronde. At the end of their 2014 expedition, the researchers left Lake Rotomahana for the last time. The group had achieved their scientific goals: they had established that the geothermal system at the lake was still active, and they had produced a bathymetric map of the lake floor that was 400 times sharper than any other. But they had also helped shed new light on the events of 10 June 1886. From his viewpoint seven miles away, Henry Burt – the only eyewitness – probably saw relatively little. The volumes of ash already coming from Mount Tarawera, and the volcanic mud that was about to issue from Lake Rotomahana itself, would soon have blocked his view. But the new discoveries made at Lake Rotomahana provide a second witness to what happened that night. The fact that only fragments of the Pink and White terraces remain today strongly suggests that the majority of these old wonders were indeed destroyed by the eruption, probably soon after it began. But Burt would probably have been amazed that anything at all could have survived the catastrophe he witnessed. Follow BBC Earth on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
