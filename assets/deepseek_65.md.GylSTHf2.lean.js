Trefor Lloyd Hughes said moving it could benefit tourism in the town. Landowner Stena Line said it would be \\"open\\" to the idea of moving the arch but stressed that heritage body CADW would have the final say. The Grade II-listed monument, which is also known as the Triumphal or George IV's Arch, was completed in 1824 - three years before its more famous counterpart in London. Mr Lloyd Hughes said: \\"It's part of our history, no doubt about that, but 80% of the people on Anglesey don't even know its there. \\"It was built in the early 1800s with marble from across the island in Benllech Bay. To move those stones to Holyhead at that time, that must have taken some time and some effort. \\"It's a shame that a monument like that is in a place where no-one can go and see it. \\"When you go across to Ireland on a boat, you can go close to it but otherwise you're not allowed to go there.\\" The A5 road stretches 255 miles (410km) from London to Anglesey, and was built by Thomas Telford. It was finally completed in 1826, when the Menai suspension bridge was opened. A spokesman for CADW said: \\"Listing does not prohibit the relocation of this structure. \\"The proposers of the scheme need to liaise with the owner, and Anglesey County Council who would be responsible for deciding whether listed building consent should be approved.\\" A spokesman for Anglesey council said: \\"Planning officers would be happy to provide Cllr Hughes with guidance if he wishes to make a formal listed building consent application. \\"Any proposal to move Admiralty Arch would need the support of its owner and a strong supporting justification as the presumption is that the monument is best preserved in its present location.\\" \\"If a building consent application is received, we would deal with it in the appropriate manner and CADW would be a consulted as part of the process.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"So, there's this really old and pretty special thing called Admiralty Arch, which is hiding on an island near Holyhead port.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. With material of infinite strength--and an infinite supply of it--and with infinite time and patience, it might have been worth considering. Does it follow that \\"It might be worth thinking about if there was a an infinite supply of infinitely strong material. \\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"It might be worth thinking about if there was an infinite supply of infinitely strong material\\" is a valid interpretation of the original statement, which suggests that the value of considering such a hypothetical scenario increases under the specified conditions of material abundance and strength. By specifying the presence of an infinite supply of infinitely strong material, the feasibility and potential benefits of various projects and scientific breakthroughs could be explored without the usual constraints. In reality, materials come with specific properties and limitations that often dictate the nature of the design, construction, and application of various technologies and structures. For example, the construction of megastructures could be reimagined without the need to worry about weight distribution, structural integrity, or material degradation over time. If there were an infinite supply of infinitely strong material, space exploration could be transformed as well, as the construction of a space elevator could become possible, paving the way for more accessible space travel at a reduced cost. Moreover, the reliability and lifespan of critical infrastructure could be significantly improved, reducing maintenance costs and risks associated with failure. However, it is important to note that even with an infinite supply of infinitely strong material, there are other factors to consider. A myriad of logistical, economic, social, and environmental factors influence the overall feasibility and desirability of projects and technologies. Additionally, there are still energy and resource constraints to contend with, as well as engineering and scientific challenges that may not be fully addressed by an infinitely strong material. Keeping the infinite time and patience requirement in mind, we can explore the ramifications of such a scenario further. With unlimited time, significant advancements in scientific knowledge, engineering capabilities, and technological innovations could be achieved. Ideas and projects once deemed impossible or impractical may eventually become attainable. Furthermore, the longer timescale could allow for the thoughtful and deliberate exploration of ethical, social, and environmental implications arising from the use of an infinitely strong material. Despite these intriguing possibilities, it is valuable to acknowledge that the concept of an infinitely strong material and unlimited time remains the realm of imagination and thought experiment. By indulging in such hypothetical scenarios, we broaden our horizons and stimulate creative thinking. This can be a beneficial exercise in imagining the limits of materials science and engineering, inspiring new ideas and approaches to address challenges across various fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a new situation: There are two exact copies of planets, Necrulon and Krankor, including the animals and plants on each planet. Recently though, people on Krankor have been wanting to have more space for new buildings. In order to accommodate these new buildings, they have started to cut forests and clear land. The people on Necrulon, however, decided to keep their forests and land rather than further industrialize. But I can use this background: Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs. What is an answer for this question: Does Krankor have more or less autotrophic organisms than Necrulon? The answer is:","completion":"Krankor has less autotrophic organisms than Necrulon. Step-by-step justification: 1. The background information states that cutting forests and clearing land reduces the number of autotrophic organisms. This is because these organisms, such as plants, use carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and are an essential part of the ecosystem. 2. The situation given shows that Krankor is cutting forests and clearing land for new buildings. This type of activity directly leads to a reduction in the number of autotrophic organisms on Krankor. 3. On the other hand, Necrulon has decided to preserve its forests and lands, which means they are not reducing the number of autotrophic organisms and their ecosystem remains more intact. 4. Comparing the two planets, it is evident that Krankor's actions (cutting forests and clearing land) have resulted in a decreased number of autotrophic organisms when compared to the preserved ecosystem on Necrulon. Hence, Krankor has less autotrophic organisms than Necrulon."},{"prompt":"Title: Hard rock/metal without all the nonsense.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who sprints toward his parents who are endangered by a falling boulder? from the following article ? The story begins just after the birth of Robert Rabbit. As his parents and friends welcome him into the world, a mysterious old rabbit who walks with a cane greets young Rob and disappears. The old rabbit shows up a few more times throughout Rob's childhood, always disappearing after making comments or inquiries about his talents and attitude. One day, when Rob's parents become endangered by a falling boulder, he sprints toward them and changes into a striped and star-spangled superhero on golden rollerskates. The old rabbit reappears and tells Rob that he is the American Rabbit, capable of changing into superhero form when he sprints and changing back to normal when he says his own name. Rob decides to try to keep his superpowers a secret and moves to the city. He finds a job as a piano player at the Panda Monium, a nightclub run by a panda named Teddy and a female rabbit named Bunny O'Hare. The club is harassed by a gang of jackals who run a Mafia-style protection racket. When Teddy refuses to buy insurance from them, they return on their motorcycles during a White Brothers show and wreck the club. Bunny and Teddy organize a march and rally the next day, and Walt, the Jackals' well-dressed boss, orders them to ride their motorcycles in the march. They cause a distraction while Walt's buzzard destroys the cables that support a bridge the marchers are crossing, but the American Rabbit stops the bridge from collapsing. Teddy then announces his plans to do a cross-country tour with the White Brothers, which will allow him to raise enough money to rebuild the Panda Monium. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The full name of the person who sprints toward his parents when they are endangered by a falling boulder is Robert Rabbit. This is shown in the early part of the article, where it lays out the premise of the story. After introducing a brief context about the birth of Robert Rabbit, the story quickly moves to a scenario where Robert's parents are endangered by a falling boulder. The text then clearly states, \\"he sprints toward them and changes into a striped and star-spangled superhero on golden rollerskates.\\" Thus, we can conclude that Robert Rabbit is the character referred to in the provided question. Note that he transforms into 'the American Rabbit' when in superhero form, but his original name is Robert Rabbit."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Some of it carries bad things, but the main problem with spam is that it is unpleasant because it fills your mail box with pointless messages. Most email programs have built-in filters that will discover unwanted messages and put them into a junk folder . You can make the filter learn what you consider to be spam or block certain senders. Avoid letting your email address appear on websites--spammers search the Internet for email addresses. Be careful who you give your email address to, and if you need to send out several copies of an email, use blind copy instead to cover the other people's addresses. Delete spam emails without opening them. Signs of possible spam are bad spelling in email headers, strange sender addresses, or emails sent at unusual hours. If you do open a spam mail, never reply to it or click on any pictures it may have. If you receive an unexpected email pretending to come from your bank, credit card company or other suppliers, be very careful. If the email asks you to reply, don't do it! Instead, call up these places or visit their websites. Consider setting up a second email address and keep one address for your personal use and another for your online communication.

The tweet's author is expressing a sense of bewilderment with the current situation, which is that they find themselves awake at a time when they would typically expect to be asleep. This confusion implies that the individual is likely dealing with some sort of disruption in their normal sleep patterns or may be facing difficulties in falling asleep. Furthermore, the tweet's content suggests that the author is self-reflecting upon the reasons behind their current state of wakefulness. This contemplation indicates that the individual possesses a degree of self-awareness and is trying to rationalize their situation. They may be pondering potential factors that have led to their current state, such as stress, changes in routine, or even underlying health issues. The phrasing \\"idk\\" (short for \\"I don't know\\") further demonstrates this introspective nature, as the individual acknowledges their lack of understanding regarding the cause of their situation. However, the use of informal internet slang also adds a casual tone to the tweet, simultaneously reducing the severity of their concern and possibly even injecting a bit of humor into their self-examination. Finally, there is an undertone of mild frustration permeating this tweet, as the individual clearly desires to be asleep and is bothered by their inability to do so. This sentiment is evident in the fact that the individual chose to share their plight on social media, seeking to express their feelings and potentially commiserate with others who have experienced similar situations. In conclusion, this tweet embodies a combination of confusion, contemplation, and subtle frustration regarding an unexpected bout of wakefulness. The author's introspective approach, usage of casual language, and decision to share their experience on social media all contribute to painting a picture of a person grappling with an unanticipated disruption to their ordinary sleep routine and seeking understanding or support from their online community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Located along California's San Andreas Fault, the city of San Francisco is likely to take precautions(,) in the event of the next big earthquake. According to aNew York Timesreport, emergency planners in San Francisco are not only thinking of human evacuation(,) plans in the event of an earthquake, but also of how to care for pets during a natural disaster. Ideally, the planners will be able to train pet-disaster responders who work to evacuate dogs, cats and other household pets from the disaster site to one of the 125 temporary animal shelters that will be set up or, if the pet is injured, it will be brought to an emergency animal medical unit where there will be people on hand to tend to the pet's injury. The city's \\"no-pets-left-behind\\" policy results from the great number of pet deaths during the destruction of Hurricane Katrina. As emergency responders arrived to rescue people isolated in their homes during Katrina, hurricane victims were told that they could not take their pets along with them when evacuating; thus, many pet owners were forced to make the heart-breaking decision to save themselves while leaving their pets behind to perhaps meet their deaths. Since then, the U.S. has passed the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006, allocating federal funds for animal disaster planning projects. Yet, not all counties are as progressive as San Francisco has been in the effort to protect pets in the event of a natural disaster. Pets are after all, a large part of San Francisco's population -- overnumbering the number of school age children in the city. Over the last three years, San Francisco has received 350,000 in federal funds _ to animal disaster preparedness efforts in order to protect animals in the case of a disaster such as an earthquake. The city is still working on obtaining 300,000 to pay for an emergency animal unit.

A:","completion":"The Peace Tower, an iconic symbol of Canada, is located in the heart of the country's capital city, Ottawa, Ontario. Specifically, it stands at the central axis of the Canadian Parliament Hill complex, nestled between the House of Commons and Senate chambers in the Centre Block of the Parliament Buildings. The prominent structure is more than just an architectural gem; it serves as a national icon and symbolizes Canada's commitment to peace and parliamentary democracy. The Parliament Hill complex resides along the southern banks of the Ottawa River, offering a picturesque backdrop for the Peace Tower and surrounding buildings. The official street address of where the Peace Tower is located is: 111 Wellington Street, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1A 0A9 Designed by architect John Andrew Pearson, the Peace Tower was constructed to replace the Victoria Tower, which was destroyed in the devastating fire of 1916. The selection of the name \\"Peace Tower\\" was intended to honor the sacrifices made by Canadian men and women during World War I. The cornerstone of the tower was laid by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) on July 1, 1919. It took several years to complete the construction, and the official unveiling and dedication ceremony took place on July 1, 1927, in celebration of Canada's Diamond Jubilee. Stretching 92.2 meters (302 feet) skywards, the Peace Tower offers an extensive view of downtown Ottawa, its impressive skyline, and the surrounding areas of the Ottawa River and Gatineau Hills. Among its many features, the Peace Tower boasts a Memorial Chamber that commemorates Canada's fallen soldiers and serves as a shrine to those who have sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. The tower is also home to a 53-bell carillon that plays a vital role in the ceremonial functions held on Parliament Hill. For visitors interested in experiencing the Peace Tower, guided tours are available for gaining insight into the history, architecture, and symbolism surrounding the structure. The tours also provide access to an observation deck, offering an incredible panoramic view of the city and surrounding areas. As the Peace Tower remains an integral part of the Canadian Parliament Buildings and national identity, it continues to stand tall and proud, reflecting the Canadian spirit of unity, democracy, and peace."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: Who is a former drug addict?

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Hold your guitar up at eye level and gaze down the neck. Look for signs of warpage or other issues that could be affecting your guitar's intonation. When you look down the neck of your guitar, it should be perfectly straight. If you see any cracks or separation at the neck joint, or notice any warping along the width of the neck, take your guitar to an experienced luthier. This repair requires work beyond simple adjustments. Your guitar's \\"neck relief\\" is the amount it curves along its length. Too much neck relief can cause problems with intonation because it means that your strings are further away from the neck at some frets than at others. You can make minor adjustments to correct neck relief by tightening or loosening the truss rod. This is something that you can do at home, but if you feel at all uncomfortable doing it, go ahead and take it to a luthier. If your neck is curved to the point of being bowed, you risk breaking it if you adjust the truss rod. Take it to an experienced luthier for an assessment. Your guitar has a truss rod, accessible either through the sound hole of your guitar or behind a panel just above the nut. The rod can be adjusted either with a regular Allen wrench or a socket wrench. Turn the rod to the left to loosen it, or to the right to tighten it. Go extremely slowly, and only turn it a maximum of a quarter-inch (about 6 millimeters) at a time. Never turn it more than a complete turn. Loosening will add relief (greater distance between the string and the neck), while tightening the truss rod takes away relief. The action is the space between the strings and the frets. A lot of action will make the strings more difficult to press down, and can affect your guitar's intonation. Not enough action and the strings will buzz, damaging your sound quality. Hold the neck of your guitar at eye level. One at a time, press down each string between the second and third frets and look at the clearance of the string over the first fret. If you can see just a sliver of light between the string and the first fret, that tells you that the strings are sitting correctly in the nut. If there's too much space, the intonation will be off. You can fix this by filing down the string slots just a little so that the string sits lower. If there's no space between the first fret and the string, this is going to cause the string to buzz against the first fret when you strum the open string, which can also affect the sound of your guitar. You can fix this by raising the nut so the string sits higher. If you noticed that you had too much action at the nut, you can file the string slots yourself if you have the right tools. You'll need a nut file to get the slot in the right shape. Otherwise, take your guitar to a luthier. On the other hand, you also can raise the nut yourself if there isn't enough action. Simply glue a piece of material similar to the nut to the bottom of the nut to increase its thickness. When raising your nut, start with the smallest sliver – if you raise your nut too high you could adversely affect the tone of your instrument. Keep the same thing in mind when filing the string slots – once the nut is filed away, you can't put it back. Swapping out your old nut with a prefabricated nut that will correct the action may be the easiest thing for you to do. Prefabricated nuts aren't too expensive, and you don't run the risk of ruining the original nut. You can find prefabricated compensated nuts at your local guitar shop, or you can order one online. Make sure the nut you choose is designed to fit on your guitar. If you have trouble installing it yourself or find you don't have the right tools to do it correctly, take your guitar to a luthier. Installing a prefabricated compensated nut also may remedy intonation problems that were caused either by the shape of your nut, or the shapes of the string slots.","completion":"The article provides detailed guidance on identifying and correcting intonation issues in a guitar, focusing on inspecting and adjusting the neck, truss rod, and nut, along with the option of using prefabricated compensated nuts for improved performance, with the recommendation of consulting a luthier for complex repairs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:I read this background article the other day: Shad are also valued as a sport fish that exhibit complex and little-understood feeding behavior while spawning. Unlike salmon, shad retain the ability to digest and assimilate food during the anadromous migration. Like other fish, their feeding instinct can be triggered by a variety of factors such as turbidity and water temperature. Anglers use both spinning and fly fishing tackle to pursue shad. Spin fisherman use a shad dartjig or a flutter spoon. Some anglers use a downrigger to place the artificial lure at the desired depth and location. This is usually in the channel, or deepest part of the river. Migrating shad tend to occupy the lower portion of the water column which makes this the typical depth of choice for fishing. In the North, April through June is when shad spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries once water temperatures have reached 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C). Fishing conditions typically improve as water temperatures warm and flow decreases. I am facing a new situation today: Jeff loves to go shad fishing. He prefers using fly fishing tackle and is planning a fishing trip up North with his buddies. They decided to take their trip in May when everyone can get off work over the Memorial Day holiday. Sam enjoys shad fishing as well, but the only time he and his buddies are able to take off work is during their slow season in March. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who will have worse fishing conditions and likely catch less shad on their fishing trip, Jeff or Sam? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the given situation, Sam will likely have worse fishing conditions and catch less shad on his fishing trip compared to Jeff. This is because Sam and his buddies are going on their trip in March, which is earlier than the optimal shad spawning season in the North. According to the article, shad spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries from April through June when water temperatures have reached 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C). Fishing conditions improve as water temperatures warm and flow decreases. On the other hand, Jeff and his buddies are planning their trip over the Memorial Day holiday in May, which falls within the optimal shad fishing season. Therefore, it is more likely that they will experience better fishing conditions during their trip, leading to a higher chance of catching more shad than Sam and his group."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

It's hard to escape the conclusion that all the originality and excitement have been drained from the series. 5.

Not only could it kill the Superman series, it might also leave filmgoers feeling weak. 7. Fortunately, the regular Superman performers all do their jobs well. 8. Of course, Superman saves the world, but the real news is that there's still some life in the series. 9. The overall effect is of a story atomized and dying before our eyes, collapsing into smashed pulp, ground down into big-budget Kryptonite ash. 10. The impoverishment here is not merely of means, but of spirit. What is the consensus?","completion":"The consensus on \\"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\\" appears to be overwhelmingly negative. Several factors contribute to the film's lackluster reception: 1. The film's plot and conclusion are particularly disappointing, given the high standards set by the earlier films in the series. The disgraceful manner in which \\"Superman\\" left the eighties marks a downturn in its trajectory. 2. At 91 minutes, the film's abrupt and truncated nature suggests that it might have been better served with a longer runtime to properly explore its storyline and character development. 3. The underwhelming showdown between Superman and Nuclear Man, a Lex Luthor creation with a static electricity problem, makes it hard for audiences to feel any sense of wonder or excitement. 4. The originality and excitement that propelled the earlier films in the series seem to have been drained, leaving \\"Superman IV\\" feeling stale and uninspired. 5. Director Sidney J. Furie receives criticism for his lackluster direction, and the film's subpar special effects are unable to adequately mask these issues. 6. The movie has been described as \\"cinematic kryptonite,\\" with the potential to not only kill the Superman series but also negatively affect the audience's overall moviegoing experience. 7. On a slightly more positive note, the regular Superman performers manage to deliver commendable performances in spite of the film's glaring weaknesses. 8. The fact that Superman saves the world and there is still \\"some life\\" left in the series offers a glimmer of hope. 9. However, the film ultimately fails to captivate the audience, breaking down into a messy and unappealing form, described as \\"big-budget Kryptonite ash.\\" 10. Most importantly, the consensus highlights a troubling impoverishment of spirit within the film, diminishing its overall potential and leaving it a mere shadow of the earlier installments in the series. In summary, \\"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\\" is widely regarded as a disappointing and poorly-executed film that fails to capture the excitement, originality, and energy that made its predecessors so successful. The movie's numerous issues, including its weak storyline, inadequate special effects, and uninspired direction, have contributed to its overwhelmingly unfavorable reception, leading to concerns about the potential lasting impact on the Superman series."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested.

Premise: \\"Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the Ritz, agreed Tommy with a grin.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Tommy frowned, refused and instead said he would stroll round to the Ritz\\" true?","completion":"To determine if the hypothesis is true, I'll have to compare it with the given premise. Step 1: Evaluate the Premise The premise states, \\"Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the Ritz, agreed Tommy with a grin.\\" From this, we can deduce that Tommy agrees to the idea of strolling around the Ritz, and his response to the suggestion is smiling or grinning. Step 2: Evaluate the Hypothesis The hypothesis states, \\"Tommy frowned, refused and instead said he would stroll round to the Ritz.\\" Here, Tommy is indicated as frowning and refusing something. However, he then proposes to stroll around to the Ritz. Step 3: Compare the Hypothesis and the Premise Upon comparison, we can see that in both statements, Tommy agrees to the action of strolling around the Ritz. However, the emotional response and initial reaction of Tommy differ in both cases. In the premise, Tommy agrees with a grin, seeming happy or delighted about the suggestion. However, in the hypothesis, it's mentioned that Tommy frowned and refused before saying he would go to the Ritz, which suggests he is unhappy or disagrees before proposing the same action. Conclusion: Based on these comparisons, the hypothesis does not exactly align with the premise. The hypothesis is therefore not entirely true. Tommy's proposal to stroll around the Ritz rang true in both premises and hypothesis, but his emotional response and initial reaction differ, making the hypothesis only partially accurate."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys.

Context: One of the first incidents of the book being challenged was in Hanover, Virginia, in 1966: a parent protested that the use of rape as a plot device was immoral. Johnson cites examples of letters to local newspapers, which ranged from amusement to fury; those letters expressing the most outrage, however, complained about Mayella Ewell's attraction to Tom Robinson over the depictions of rape.

Write an article based on this summary: – Supporters waved \\"Tax the Rich\\" signs Monday as Seattle's city council voted unanimously to do exactly that. By a vote of 9-0, the council approved an income tax that only applies to wealthy residents, with the 2.25% tax starting at income above 250,000 for individuals and above 500,000 for married couples filing joint returns, the Seattle Times reports. The city estimates that the tax will raise around 140 million a year from Seattle's 20,000 or so wealthiest residents. Washington state doesn't have a personal income tax and a 1984 law bans cities and counties in the state from taxing net income, meaning Seattle's move is certain to face legal challenges, the AP reports. Opponents vowed to fight the measure, with Washington State Republican Party Chair Susan Hutchison urging citizens to \\"forcefully resist\\" the tax and not pay a penny. Seattle Mayor Ed Murray says he'll sign the measure into law Friday—and he will welcome legal challenges. The goal is to replace the current \\"regressive\\" tax system with a fairer one, \\"while ensuring Seattle stands up to President Trump's austere budget that cuts transportation, affordable housing, health care, and social services,\\" the mayor tells Reuters.

Output:","completion":"Task explanation: In this task, we are given a goal, which is to make dough less dry and crumbly. We need to come up with a process that involves physical actions to achieve this outcome, such as moving, arranging, mixing, or shaking objects. Solution: 1. Identify the problem: The dough is too dry and crumbly, so we need to adjust its consistency by adding moisture. 2. Gather necessary ingredients and tools: You will need a liquid, such as water or milk, to add to the dough. You will also need a mixing tool, such as a wooden spoon, to incorporate the liquid into the dough. 3. Introduce the liquid: Gradually add small amounts of the liquid to the dough, mixing well after each addition. You may use the wooden spoon or your hands to mix, depending on the consistency and your preference. 4. Test the dough's consistency: After adding the liquid and mixing, test the dough's consistency by performing a pinch test. Take a small amount of dough in your hands and try to form a ball. If the dough maintains its shape without cracking or falling apart, it has reached the desired consistency. If it is still too dry and crumbly, continue to add more liquid in small increments until the dough becomes less dry. 5. Knead the dough: Once the desired consistency is reached, knead the dough for a few minutes to ensure all the ingredients are evenly distributed and the dough is smooth. 6. Rest the dough (optional): Allowing the dough to rest for a short time (usually around 30 minutes, depending on the recipe) can improve its texture and make it easier to handle.

La consideración de la Didaché durante el siglo XX ha oscilado como un péndulo entre dos extremos de aceptación, siendo el polo actual más parecido a la posición adoptada por los eruditos a finales del siglo XIX que a la que estuvo vigente durante los años 1930, antes de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Las dudas en torno a la Didaché tardaron treinta años en concretarse y otros treinta en resolverse, y solo lo hicieron porque el descubrimiento en 1948 de los Manuscritos del Mar Muerto modificó radicalmente la percepción que se tenía de la obra. La posición crítica respecto a su autenticidad, sostenida por Joseph Armitage Robinson y un grupo de eruditos anglosajones, fue superada cuando Jean Paul Audet examinó en profundidad el material acumulado hasta esos momentos, lo que sentó a grandes rasgos las directrices que sigue la investigación actual.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What is the cause of delays to limit antibiotic use?\\" is in \\"The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003. Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed. These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"The cause of delays to limit antibiotic use can be attributed to multiple factors, such as resistance against regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, the time required for research to test causal links between antibiotic use and resistance, and challenges in passing legislative actions. 1. Resistance against regulation by industries: Industries that benefit from the use or sale of antibiotics may resist the implementation of regulations that restrict antibiotic use. This resistance can stem from concerns about potential financial losses or reduced productivity, thereby leading to lobbying efforts against the amendment of regulations. 2. Time required for research: Establishing a causal link between antibiotic use and the emergence of antibiotic resistance requires extensive research, data, and evidence. This process can be time-consuming, as researchers need to conduct studies, analyze results, and publish their findings in order to build a strong case for regulations. As a result, regulatory bodies and decision-makers may encounter delays when trying to limit antibiotic use based on scientific evidence. 3. Legislative challenges: Limiting antibiotic use often requires changes to legislation and regulatory frameworks. In some cases, bills that aim to restrict antibiotic use may be proposed but not passed. The process of passing such legislation is subject to a variety of challenges, such as political factors, opposition from stakeholders, or lack of public awareness regarding the issue. An example of this can be observed in the two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562), which were aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals, but have not been passed despite endorsement from public health and medical organizations. In summary, delays in limiting antibiotic use are influenced by industry resistance, research processes, and legislative challenges.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Each year, about 10,000 to 100,000 animal species die off. They join the countless species that have gone extinct over the course of Earth's history - and extinction means forever. At least it used to. Scientists are now closing in on the ability to bring back extinct species. No, this doesn't mean the plot of Jurassic Park is going to become a reality. Researchers need DNA to bring back a species. DNA is the chemical that carries the structure for a living thing. Dinosaurs have been gone too long for any of their DNA to remain in fossils. But there's a very real chance that we will be able to bring back more recently extinct species. This could even include Ice Age animals like the woolly mammoth. In 2003, a team of Spanish and French scientists re-created the Pyrenean ibex, which had gone extinct three years earlier. The new animal didn't survive long, but scientific advances should improve the success rate. In January, Australian scientists announced that they were on their way to bringing back the gastric brooding frog. That we can bring species back doesn't mean that we should. There may be benefits to reviving a species. But there's no way to know how it will turn out. For example, would a passenger pigeon fit into its old habitat? Or might it crowd out existing species? Environmentalists worry that our ability to bring species back might cut down support for the hard work of traditional conservation. Why worry about preserving a wildlife habitat or fighting poachers if we know we can just make up for our mistakes? But those extinctions are our mistakes to correct, which may give us an obligation to do so. As businessman and environmentalist Stewart Brand recently said, \\"Humans have made a huge hole in nature. We have the ability now to repair some of that damage.\\" We would do well to remember the lesson of Jurassic Park: Proceed with caution. Question: What makes environmentalists worried according to the passage? Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Environmentalists are worried that the ability to bring back extinct species might reduce the support for traditional conservation efforts. They fear that people may become less concerned about preserving wildlife habitats or fighting poachers if they believe they can simply rely on reviving species in the future.

According to market research firm First Research, there are about 5,000 art dealers and galleries in the U.S. with combined annual revenue of about 6 billion, and Art Market Monitor estimates the size of the overall global art market to be around 15 billion annually. There are also more than 200,000 fine artists working in the U.S., according to recent research by the National Endowment for the Arts. But while fine art is big business, there is often a wide chasm between the creative process that makes a great artist or a sophisticated gallery owner, and the marketing process that drives branding and sales. “For the majority of artists, success will ultimately come down to their effectiveness in marketing,” says Darius Himes, Assistant Director of fine art photography gallery Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco. “Artists need to embrace the fact that both their work, and they themselves as artists, are brands that must be marketed.” So whether you’re an aspiring artist who wants to build an initial following, or a veteran art dealer looking to expand awareness of your brand, it pays to get savvy to new social marketing techniques to help you achieve your objectives. The following are seven strategies for more effective social marketing. A website is now a cost of doing business, and it’s essential for artists to have at least a minimal web presence. But even established artists and galleries with robust websites should consider a refresh, particularly to ensure that the site is optimized for search and mobile. Himes notes that Fraenkel Gallery recently undertook a full overhaul of its website to incorporate more social, search and web marketing best practices. “In addition to making a number of aesthetic and navigational enhancements, we also eliminated all of the Flash-based elements that weren’t searchable and that reduced the mobile functionality,” says Himes. “We also made sure that the new website was scalable to any mobile device, and that all pages had unique web addresses which would be easy to feed into social media.” Blogging is one of the best ways to get your art or gallery found by the search engines and provides excellent content to fuel your other social marketing activities. “Blogging is close to necessary at this point when it comes to both SEO and the building of a fan base,” says Greg Heller-LaBelle of web marketing firm DAY Vision Marketing. “The main thing we try to instill in clients is to start thinking of themselves as creators and syndicators of content.” In addition to posting new work or promoting new shows or openings, your blog can also be a place to offer a behind-the-scenes look at your creative process, share pictures from relevant art events or chronicle your time at a prestigious art auction. “As an artist myself and owner of a creative company, I’d say my number one tip is to pull back the curtain and show the behind-the-scenes work that takes place,” says Mark Ley, Managing Director at Copper Blue Creative. “Showing how a piece is made, or the location you are shooting photography, all help the fan to feel as if they are a part of the creation.” Having a Facebook business page for your artist brand or gallery should be a no-brainer: it’s free, it’s simple to use and it gives you access to more than 1 billion people. To use Facebook as a vehicle for promotion and awareness-building, first set up your Facebook business page and invite your friends and colleagues to “like” the page and share with their network … then start posting! Many of the same content strategies for your blog also apply to your Facebook page, but make sure to also spend a little bit of time each day engaging with your fans. “The main reason why artists fail with social media is that they are not providing a value to their connections with any helpful, interesting and relevant content in their comments and posts,” writes John R. Math of Light Space & Time Online Art Gallery. “As artist participants we need to be active, engaged and consistently provide some kind of value.” Twitter is a great tool for building a following and promoting your art or gallery. The best way to get started is by looking for relevant people or businesses to follow; try digging around a site like Listorious to search for other people’s lists by topic. For example, a gallery owner could use Listorious to search on “art” to find lists of prominent tweeters in the art world. Then start tweeting — at a minimum, tweet out all the content that appears on your blog and other relevant news about your art or events. Don’t forget to use hashtags with your tweets to boost the searchability of your content. You can also follow keywords and hashtags to easily find relevant content to share and people to follow. Set up a running search or column in your social media tool (TweetDeck and HootSuite are great options) on particular terms and hashtags so you can quickly scan for interesting content to retweet and people to engage with. Use of the visually oriented social site Pinterest has exploded over the past year, and many artists are using Pinterest to share their work beyond Facebook and Twitter. To get started on Pinterest, first set up a profile that includes keywords and your website address, then start pinning. When you pin your art, don’t forget to add a watermark to protect the image, as well as keywords: Pinterest is searchable, so make sure you describe your pin clearly. You should also customize the link to point back to your website or whatever other page you’re promoting. You can also get more exposure for your images by including a price for the item into your description. This simple trick will add your pin to the “Gifts” section on Pinterest and will display the price across the front of the image throughout the site. Many artists and galleries are also using Facebook Ads as a low-cost way to promote upcoming shows and events. Artlog, a social platform allowing people to connect with the international art scene, uses Facebook Ads to promote events and sell tickets to art events like exhibitions, tours and discussions. For example, 10 days before its Chelsea Art Crawl & Party last summer, Artlog began running Facebook Ads to promote the event and direct people to Artlog’s website in order to purchase tickets. For every 75 Artlog spent on Facebook, it saw 200 in ticket sales. Facebook also allows you to target different campaigns or events to different people. “There are specific galleries and museums that we will use in our Likes and Interests targeting because we know that if people are engaging with those galleries, they are more likely to be the right audience,” says Manish Vora, co-founder of Artlog. While galleries typically develop and share press releases about upcoming shows with relevant media, they often neglect to distribute their release over the wire, and thus miss out on one of the best low-cost ways to propagate their brand across the internet and drive search results. You can use a low-cost service such as PRWeb to distribute your release for under 100. To optimize your press release for search, start by making a list of the keywords and phrases that are most relevant to your company, and then cross-check these terms using Google’s keyword tool to assess monthly search volume. Once you have your list of keywords, use them in the headline and subhead of your release as well as throughout the body of the announcement. Avoid repetition by using secondary and tertiary keywords. For example, if you’re a San Francisco fine art gallery looking to boost your search results on the phrases “fine art photography” and “San Francisco art galleries” — as well as around a particular photographer’s work — you might include the phrase “fine art photography” in the headline, subhead and first paragraph of the release, along with the artist’s name, while including the term “San Francisco art gallery” elsewhere in the release. Make sure that you attach any hyperlinks back to your website or blog to these keyword phrases rather than your name or generic terms like “art opening.” You should also consider adding images or video to your press releases: Releases that include an image or a video get shared three times more than text-only releases — and viewers spend up to thirty seconds more with this content.

Question: You are given a new situation: Most surfers used Wide beach because of the areas of shallow water, but some surfers were happy with Sandy beach, although the water was much deeper at the shore there. and a hint : When waves travel into areas of shallow water, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. The free orbital motion of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position. As the water becomes shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. After the wave breaks, it becomes a wave of translation and erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies. Please answer this question : Which beach had better and larger waves? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given situation and hint, the Wide beach would have better and larger waves. This is because, as waves travel into shallow water, like at Wide beach, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. Subsequently, this disrupts the free orbital motion of the water. The water particles in this orbital motion do not return to their original position. As a result, as the water becomes shallower, the swell gets larger, higher, and steeper, ultimately forming the sharp-crested wave shape that surfers typically prefer. In contrast, at Sandy beach, the water is much deeper at the shore, which doesn't promote the same disruption in water's orbital motion. Therefore, the wave formation is different, potentially resulting in smaller waves. However, it's important to note that this doesn't necessarily mean the waves at Sandy beach are worse, they are just different and may be preferred by some surfers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There should be no streaks of hot sauce running through the mayo. Instead, the color should be completely uniform. Drizzle the lemon juice into the spicy mayo and whisk well to combine. Lemon juice is not necessary, but if you sample the spicy mayo and decide that it is too hot for your preference, adding a little lemon juice can help cut down on some of the heat.

The character of Corky Romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst. The gags are predictable but that isn't what makes it bad. They are the lame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say. Corky Romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy. His quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the FBI to destroy any trace of the family's crime history. However, it isn't that easy for Corky because the FBI believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on his very own family. Mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really doesn't feel like any comic hijixn are there. Corky ends up in love with his beautiful FBI partner and has to set the record straight with both the FBI and his family if he is to settle down to the quiet life again. I think what makes this film irritating is both the lead actor and the supposed jokes. Chris Kattan reveals his alarming limitations as and actor here as his one note slapstick routine falls flat about 10 minutes into the film. It is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb, slap stick humor. Will Ferrel, Kattan's SNL partner, seems to have made a full career out of it. The only difference between Kattan and Ferrel is that Ferrel knows when to tone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke. There is absolutely no diversity in Kattan's routine. It's hard to hear the same joke twice, but for a whole movie that is just pure torture. The other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and FUNNY jokes. The gay mafia brother, the awkward guy sch-tick, and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it. It seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it. Even with a cast that has some comedic talent (Chris Penn, Peter Falk) the jokes that commence are tired. There is no chemistry too. This film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the actors.

Who will be the winner of the next lottery?. (b). What football team will win the next game?. (c). What is the amount of light needed to grow tomatoes?. (d). Which four types of bird feathers have the prettiest colors?.","completion":"The question that can most likely be determined through a scientific investigation is (c). What is the amount of light needed to grow tomatoes? A scientific investigation involves the use of the scientific method to explore questions, collect data, analyze the results, and draw conclusions based on evidence and logical reasoning. Out of the four given options, only option (c) falls within the realm of a scientific investigation as it focuses on a quantifiable parameter – the amount of light – which can be controlled and measured during the course of an experiment. To conduct a scientific investigation on this topic, one could follow the steps below: 1. Hypothesis: Develop a hypothesis to explain the relationship between the amount of light and tomato plant growth. The hypothesis could be that \\"tomato plants require a specific amount of light exposure to achieve optimal growth and yield.\\" 2. Research: Review existing scientific literature on tomato plant growth and light requirements. This could involve examining previous studies, understanding the preferred light spectrum for tomato plants, and analyzing the effects of different light conditions on their growth and yield. 3. Experimentation: Design an experiment to test the hypothesis. This might involve growing tomato plants in a controlled environment with varying amounts of light exposure or different light spectra. The variables that should be controlled include temperature, humidity, watering frequency, and soil conditions to ensure that the effect being measured is solely due to the differences in light exposure. 4. Data Collection: Measure the growth and yield of tomato plants under each light condition. Collect data on plant height, number of leaves, flower production, fruit yield, and any other relevant parameters that can help determine the impact of light. 5. Data Analysis: Analyze the collected data to identify any patterns or trends. Statistical analysis can be used to determine the significance of the observed changes in growth and yield in response to different light conditions. 6. Conclusion: Draw conclusions based on the data analysis. If the results show a significant difference in growth and yield between the various light conditions, this would support the hypothesis that a specific amount of light is necessary for optimal tomato plant growth. This scientific investigation can help determine the optimal light requirements for growing tomatoes, which could then be applied to horticulture and farming practices. In contrast, the other questions – (a) the winner of the next lottery, (b) which football team will win the next game, and (d) which four types of bird feathers have the prettiest colors – cannot be scientifically investigated in the same way. These questions rely on unpredictable factors (such as chance, individual performance, and subjective perception) and are not suited for accurate scientific investigation that demands measurable, controllable, and replicable parameters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that is re-making the garden that was seen as a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners? is inside the article: John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person that is re-making the garden that was seen as a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners is Troy Scott Smith. Troy Scott Smith, previously the head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed as the head gardener at Sissinghurst in 2014. He became the first male head gardener since the 1950s at the site. One of his key goals has been to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst, which previously only spanned until the autumn period, into the winter months. This allowed the garden to be open to visitors year-round. Additionally, Smith also planned on reinstating every species of rose known to have been grown by Vita Sackville-West, a significant figure in Sissinghurst's history. This restoration effort can be seen as part of his larger vision to maintain the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". Troy Scott Smith's renovations have elicited reactions from the gardening community, with gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson describing his work on the garden as inspiring extremes of emotion and suggesting that Sissinghurst might be not just Britain's leading garden, but possibly the world's. Indeed, Sissinghurst continues to attract gardeners from around the world as a place of pilgrimage and has influenced many other gardens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - snowfall - hail - fog - sleet A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"sleet Freezing rain that falls from the sky is also called sleet. To provide a detailed explanation, let us explore the different weather phenomena referred to in the answer choices. 1. Snowfall: Snowfall is a form of precipitation consisting of ice crystals that form directly from the freezing of water vapor in the atmosphere. Snowflakes are formed when water vapor in the air condenses directly into ice crystals at subfreezing temperatures. These ice crystals can aggregate with other crystals to form larger snowflakes. When the atmospheric temperature is below freezing, these snowflakes can accumulate on the ground. Snowfall is a common occurrence in cold regions during the winter season. 2. Hail: Hail is a type of solid precipitation that forms in severe thunderstorms. They are formed when powerful updrafts within the storm lift raindrops upwards into the freezing upper levels of the atmosphere. As these frozen raindrops are lifted higher, they continue to collide with supercooled water droplets and grow in size by accumulating more layers of ice. Once the hailstones become too heavy for the storm's updraft to support, they fall to the ground as hail. 3. Fog: Fog is not a form of precipitation, but rather a cloud that forms near the ground. It occurs when the air is cooled to its dew point (the temperature at which air becomes saturated with water vapor), and tiny water droplets condense in the atmosphere. Fog can reduce visibility significantly, creating hazardous conditions for drivers, boaters, and pilots. The primary distinction between fog and clouds is their proximity to the ground. 4. Sleet: Sleet is the term for freezing rain that falls from the sky. Sleet forms when raindrops fall through a layer of freezing air near the ground, causing the raindrops to freeze into ice pellets before reaching the surface. These ice pellets fall to the ground, where they can accumulate and create slippery conditions for transportation and walking. Sleet often occurs during the transition between rain and snow events or in winter storms when the atmosphere's temperature profile is complex. In conclusion, freezing rain that falls from the sky is referred to as sleet. This weather phenomenon occurs when raindrops freeze into ice pellets before reaching the ground, which can create hazardous conditions due to the icy and slippery surfaces it forms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It takes some time to really get into his \\"mojo\\", but once you see the clear message and the ability to tell the story that is close to his heart, Lee is a genius. Unlike The 25th Hour or Bamboozled (two of my favorite films of his), there was no clear story in this film. I was able to understand the struggle between Washington and the choice to play well or be influenced by others, but for some odd reason Lee was never able to get the true feeling out. Washington did a decent job with what was handed to him, but you could tell that this was not Lee's favorite film. Not only did Lee direct this film, but he also wrote it. You could tell. The camera work was horrid and the writing only contributed to the decay of the film. This film was coming full circle and it wasn't going to be pretty. Lee was not 100% behind this film as he was with Do the Right Thing. Of all the films I have seen Lee direct, this was the brightest and more modest of his films. It was almost as if he created a Hollywood movie instead of one that was all his own. I don't know if he saw the money from Do the Right Thing and ran with it, or what  but this film did not demonstrate his true talent. For anyone out there that has seen this film, and perhaps stopped watching anything directed by Spike Lee afterwards due to this film, I suggest you give him a second chance. Don't get me wrong, I see exactly where you are coming from with this film and why you would want to put this behind you, but Lee does grow up. His work becomes more of his own, and you can see the transformation from a desire to make money to just wanting to make good films. It took me awhile to watch The 25th Hour, but when I did, it was sheer brilliance. Perhaps it was the actors, perhaps the story, but Lee crafted an amazing film out of one man's journey into the unknown. I guess that is what I was hoping Mo' Better Blues would turn out to be. This really dark journey into the life of a man that really never grew up, but instead all I got was Denzel being Denzel. He really is one of the most versatile actors of this generation, and I do consider him the Sydney Poitier of cinema, but this was not the film to showcase his talent. Another issue that I had with this film was the use of Spike's sister playing one of the love interests. I don't know about you, and your family, but I do not think that I could have filmed a sex scene with my sister. I don't care who the actor is or how much money I am getting paid, I would never do it. It is just something that I never wish to see, but apparently that is different for Spike. He went ahead and showed the full nude image of his sister without any remorse. It was sad and it even made me blush. Also, I need somebody to answer me this. What was Flavor Flav doing introducing this film? So, I am sitting there on my couch, ready to start the film, when suddenly there is a voice from the past spelling out the studio that made this film, then he acknowledges himself. That did not build for a strong remaining of the story. Again, I felt that Lee was going for money on this film instead of actual talent. Perhaps that is how he could afford both Denzel and Wesley in the same movie without any explosions. There were two great scenes in this film that made it worth watching through to the end. Don't get me wrong, this was a very bad movie, but there is always a diamond in every alleyway. The scene when Bleek accidentally forgets which woman he is with was mesmerizing. He continually went back and forth, weaving truth to confusion in a way that proved that Lee was actually behind the camera. It was a visionary scene that was probably lost in the shuffle due to the remaining poor scenes. The other scene that was worth watching was the way that Lee introduced and ended the film. By keeping the same pacing and direction, he was able to bring this tragic character around full circle and give him the chance to change his life. Other than these two moments, the rest of the film was pure rubbish, not worth viewing unless you are about to go blind.

Harry Reid Turns His Back on Weiner, Urges Resignation Amidst Rising Political Pressure\\" In a shocking turn of events, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D) has publicly denounced embattled New York Congressman Anthony Weiner (D). Reid has urged Weiner to resign from his post, stating, \\"I wish there was some way I could defend him, but I can't.\\" This comes in the wake of a string of salacious revelations surrounding Weiner's inappropriate online behavior and the subsequent fallout for the Democratic Party. A sign posted outside of Weiner's office encapsulates the sentiment of many in Washington and across the country: \\"Resign, Pervert Weiner.\\" This plea for resignation extends far beyond the confines of the Capitol, with many citizens expressing their disgust and disappointment in the once-budding political star. While Weiner's fate remains uncertain, one thing is for sure: his career and reputation are in tatters. Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has called for a shift in focus from the salacious scandal to the pressing issues facing the nation. \\"It's time to focus on the country's problems, not this,\\" Bloomberg stated, highlighting the need for the nation's leaders to refocus on a more substantive political discourse. The Weiner scandal, he argues, has become a distraction that detracts from the urgent work that must be done to address pressing problems such as unemployment and the growing federal deficit. To make matters worse for Weiner and the Democratic Party, Republicans have begun targeting lawmakers who've accepted donations from the disgraced Congressman. This line of attack demonstrates the far-reaching implications of Weiner's improprieties and the potential impact they may have on congressional races across the nation. If the pressure from the GOP continues to mount, more Democratic lawmakers may choose to distance themselves from Weiner, further isolating the embattled Congressman and making it much more difficult for him to remain in office. The tables have clearly turned on Anthony Weiner. Once a rising star in the Democratic Party, known for his passionate speeches and fierce advocacy for progressive values, Weiner now finds himself scorned by colleagues and constituents alike. Renowned politicians like Sen. Harry Reid have abandoned him in a bid to distance themselves from the fallout of Weiner's disgraceful actions. As more and more of his colleagues join the chorus calling for resignation, it becomes increasingly difficult for Weiner to hold onto any shred of political power. As Weiner's career hangs in the balance, the American public and politicians alike must ask themselves whether political discourse can return to focusing on the nation's most pressing issues. With Mayor Bloomberg's call to refocus on substantive matters, it is crucial that this scandal does not derail the progress and cooperation needed to address the challenges facing our country. In the end, Weiner's fate may serve as a cautionary tale for politicians who engage in questionable behavior, and a reminder for everyone that in an increasingly interconnected world, one's actions can have far-reaching consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. One of the weaker Carry On adventures sees Sid James as the head of a crime gang stealing contraceptive pills. The fourth of the series to be hospital-based, it's possibly the least of the genre. There's a curiously flat feel throughout, with all seemingly squandered on below-par material. This is far from the late-70s nadir, but Williams, James, Bresslaw, Maynard et al. are all class performers yet not given the backing of a script equal to their ability. Most of the gags are onrunning, rather than episodic as Carry Ons usually are. So that instead of the traditional hit and miss ratio, if you don't find the joke funny in the first place you're stuck with it for most of the film. These continuous plot strands include Williams  for no good reason  worrying that he's changing sex, and Kenneth Cope in drag. Like the stagy physical pratt falls, the whole thing feels more contrived than in other movies, and lacking in cast interest. Continuing this theme, Matron lacks the customary pun and innuendo format, largely opting for characterisation and consequence to provide the humour. In fact, the somewhat puerile series of laboured misunderstandings and forced circumstance reminds one more of Terry and June ... so it's appropriate that Terry Scott is present, mugging futilely throughout. Some dialogue exchanges have a bit of the old magic, such as this between Scott and Cope: \\"What about a little drink?\\" \\"Oh, no, no, I never touch it.\\" \\"Oh. Cigarette then?\\" \\"No, I never touch them.\\" \\"That leaves only one thing to offer you.\\" \\"I never touch that either.\\" That said, while a funny man in his own right (livening up the duller episodes of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) no end), you do feel that Cope isn't quite tapped in to the self-parodying Carry On idealology and that Bernard Bresslaw dressed as a nurse would be far funnier. This does actually happen, in part, though only for the last fifteen minutes. Williams attempting to seduce Hattie Jacques while Charles Hawtrey is hiding in a cupboard is pure drawer room farce, but lacks the irony to carry it off. That said, Williams's description of premarital relations is priceless: \\"You don't just go into the shop and buy enough for the whole room, you tear yourself off a little strip and try it first!\\" \\"That may be so,\\" counters Jacques, \\"but you're not going to stick me up against a wall.\\" Williams really comes to life in his scenes with Hattie, and you can never get bored of hearing a tin whistle whenever someone accidentally flashes their knickers.

They avoided the elite, and focused not on political events but on social forces and attitudes. They rejected both Marxism and modernization theory as alien and confining. They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously.

A:","completion":"Before Versailles, the French kings primarily resided in various royal residences depending on their personal preferences, political needs, and the locations of the royal estates at different time periods. Some of the most prominent palaces and castles that the French kings called home before Versailles include: 1. Palais de la Cité (Paris): The Palais de la Cité is a medieval fortress located on the Île de la Cité in Paris. It served as the primary residence of the French monarchy from the 10th to the 14th centuries. Originally a Roman fort, the royal estate was expanded and transformed into a Gothic-style palace by King Philippe IV in the 14th century. Some of its notable structures include the Sainte Chapelle and the Conciergerie, which were used for royal functions and events. 2. Château de Vincennes (Vincennes): Just outside Paris, the Château de Vincennes was a popular residence for the French kings in the 14th and 15th centuries. The castle was first built by King Philippe II in the 12th century, and it was significantly expanded by King Charles V in the 14th century to create an enormous fortress with a keep, moats, and defensive walls. Château de Vincennes provided a strategic location for the kings to maintain control of Paris, especially during periods of unrest. 3. Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Saint-Germain-en-Laye): Located approximately 20 kilometers west of Paris, the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye was a favorite residence for the French kings during the 16th and 17th centuries. It was first built by King François I in the 16th century and later expanded by King Henri II and King Henri IV. The castle had a vast park, extensive gardens, and the famous Royal Hunting Grounds, where the kings enjoyed hunting and other leisurely activities. 4. Château de Fontainebleau (Fontainebleau): Another popular residence of the French kings during the 16th and 17th centuries was the Château de Fontainebleau, located about 55 kilometers southeast of Paris. Originally a medieval hunting lodge, the castle was transformed by successive kings, including François I and Henri IV, into a grand palace featuring Renaissance and Baroque architecture. Notably, Fontainebleau was a favorite of King Louis XIV before he decided to move his court to Versailles. 5. Louvre Palace (Paris): While it is now the world-famous Louvre Museum, Louvre Palace served as a royal residence from the 14th to the end of the 17th century. King Charles V extensively rebuilt in the 14th century to create a luxurious palace. Later, in the 16th and 17th centuries, Kings François I and Louis XIV continued the expansion and made significant architectural updates, adding new wings and courtyards. In conclusion, before Versailles, the French kings lived in various royal residences such as the Palais de la Cité, Château de Vincennes, Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Château de Fontainebleau, and the Louvre Palace. The choice of residence would depend on factors such as proximity to Paris, strategic importance, and personal preferences related to architecture, gardens, and leisure activities. Versailles became the main royal residence in 1682 when King Louis XIV moved his court to this newly built palace, which remained the epicenter of French political power until the French Revolution in 1789."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Waking Life Movie plot: Waking Life is about an unnamed[3] young man living an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and that eventually progresses toward an existential crisis. For most of the film he observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other charactersâranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant-goers and friendsâabout such issues as metaphysics, free will, social philosophy, and the meaning of life. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence, but rather, focus on a random isolated person, group of people, or couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film touches also upon existentialism, situationist politics, posthumanity, the film theory of AndrÃ© Bazin, and lucid dreaming, and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name. Gradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional false awakenings. So far he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterwards, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream. The protagonist's final talk is with a character who looks somewhat similar to the protagonist himself and whom he briefly encountered previously, earlier in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's understanding that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become one with the universe; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only to... My question: what is a dream? Answer:","completion":"A dream is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that occurs during sleep, particularly during the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) stage. It is an intricate combination of emotions, visual and auditory images, sensations, and sometimes abstract or illogical thoughts that manifest in the form of a narrative or storyline. Dreams can range from vivid and lifelike experiences to fragmented and surreal imaginings, often drawing from an individual's memories, fears, desires, and personal experiences. The study of dreams, known as oneirology, aims to understand the process, purpose, and significance of dreams in the context of human psychological, physiological, and neurological functioning. While various theories exist regarding the purpose and meaning of dreams, there is no universally accepted explanation. One of the most recognized theories is Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic perspective, which posits that dreams serve as windows into an individual's unconscious mind, specifically revealing repressed desires, fears, and conflicts. According to Freud, dream content often contains symbols and disguised representations of these latent thoughts and emotions. Another theory, the activation-synthesis hypothesis proposed by J. Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley, suggests that dreams result from the brain's attempt to make sense of random neural activity during REM sleep. The brain generates a narrative to connect and interpret these neural signals, which can explain the sometimes strange and disjointed nature of dreams. Cognitive theories, on the other hand, view dreaming as a natural extension of the mind's information-processing and problem-solving capabilities. In this view, dreams serve as a platform for the consolidation of memories, cognitive rehearsal, and the exploration of alternative solutions to real-life problems and situations. This theory is supported by the observation that dreams often involve elements from an individual's recent experiences or concerns. In the context of the movie plot, the protagonist's dreams serve as a gateway to philosophical and existential exploration, blurring the line between reality and the dream world. The dreams in this narrative delve into thought-provoking discussions and concepts, highlighting the infinite nature of reality and the individual's ability to interact with and perceive the world around them. In summary, a dream can be described as a complex and often mysterious experience that occurs during sleep, reflecting a myriad of cognitive, emotional, and neurological processes. Though our understanding of dreams and their purpose continues to evolve, these fascinating experiences remain a rich source of insight into the human mind, as demonstrated by the film's engaging exploration of philosophical and existential themes."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task your given a passage and a question in Catalan, you must answer the question based on the passage.

I heard that Kendall broke into their neighbor's barn and mounted Aubrey's horse in the middle of the night. And I was wondering How would you describe Kendall? Pick from: a). immoral. b). a jockey. c). an angel. Answer:","completion":"Kendall can be described as (a) immoral. To elaborate, Kendall's actions of breaking into their neighbor's barn and mounting Aubrey's horse in the middle of the night demonstrate a lack of respect for others' property and privacy. Engaging in such activities indicates a disregard for ethical and moral standards, which are fundamental to maintaining a harmonious society. By choosing to break into the barn, Kendall has violated the trust that is expected between neighbors and potentially put the safety and wellbeing of Aubrey's horse at risk. Riding someone else's horse without permission also shows a lack of concern for the potential consequences of their actions, particularly if the horse were to react negatively or become injured in the process. This could also result in legal repercussions for Kendall. Though Kendall may have a passion for horse riding, their decision to engage in such a deceptive and morally questionable act ultimately makes it difficult to justify describing them as (b) a jockey. Similarly, given their willingness to act unethically, labeling Kendall as (c) an angel would not accurately reflect their behavior in this situation. In conclusion, based on Kendall's actions, describing them as immoral is the most accurate and fitting label for their behavior. Society places a high value on respecting others' property, boundaries, and trust, and individuals like Kendall who choose to defy these values are typically seen as morally compromised."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In both sentences, there are mentions of Ali Adil Shah II, Afzal Khan, Bijapur Sultanate, and the concept of a leading figure. Step 2: Compare the structure of both sentences. Sentence 1 is structured as: - Ali Adil Shah II was a leading court figure - during the reign of Afzal Khan - of the Bijapur Sultanate Sentence 2 is structured as: - Ali Adil Shah II was a leading hoffigur (possibly a typo for \\"court figure\\") - during the reign - of the Bijapur Sultanate of Afzal Khan Step 3: Analyze differences.

Here is a premise: Weighing the volume in his hand, the Kentuckian straightened up. Here is a hypothesis: The Kentuckian decided to buy the volume. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"No, it is not possible to conclusively establish that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise and the hypothesis in this scenario are two separate statements and one does not necessarily lead to the other. The premise states, \\"Weighing the volume in his hand, the Kentuckian straightened up.\\" This provides information about a situation where an individual, who is a Kentuckian, is holding something (possibly a book, given the term \\"volume\\" often refers to a physical book) and examining its heft or weight. He then straightens up, suggesting perhaps he has completed his evaluation of the item or has made some sort of decision. However, the premise does not provide information on what that decision is or what the individual intends to do next. The hypothesis postulates, \\"The Kentuckian decided to buy the volume.\\" The hypothesis suggests an action made by the Kentuckian after evaluating the weight of the volume in his hand, specifically the decision to purchase it. But this hypothesis is not directly supported by the premise. The Kentuckian could have decided to not buy the volume, to borrow it, to steal it, to recommend it to someone else, or have made an entirely different decision unrelated to the volume. In conclusion, the premise - the Kentuckian's brief moment of consideration - does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis - the Kentuckian's decision to buy the volume. Further information would be needed to conclusively connect these two actions. Thus, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so also is the hypothesis. It may be possible; the Kentuckian might well decide to buy the volume after weighing it in his hand, but based purely on the elements presented in the premise, we cannot ascertain this with certainty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From this brief information, I ascertain that I must create a detailed description of the food item and its distribution in these two geographical locations. Step 2: Generating a detailed description The provided data pertains to Beef kway teow, which suggests that it is an edible dish. The name itself is derived from 'Beef', a form of meat obtained from cows, and 'kway teow', a type of flat, broad rice noodle that is popular in Southeast Asian cuisine. The dish can therefore be described as a meal that mainly consists of beef, prepared in various forms, and kway teow noodles. Depending on local recipes and variations, the dish could also feature a blend of different ingredients like eggs, vegetables, and a variety of seasonings. Given the wide variety of beef preparations and the adaptability of noodles to different styles of cuisine, Beef kway teow likely presents a rich and diverse flavor profile that can cater to a multitude of tastes. The data also states that Beef kway teow is available \\"Nationwide in Singapore and Indonesia\\".

In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. Two students read about reproduction for biology class. Vic read more about reptile reproduction, while Fox read more about fish reproduction. Which student learned more about male fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water? The answer is:","completion":"Fox learned more about male fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water. This is because the question specifically mentions that Fox read more about fish reproduction, while Vic focused on reptile reproduction. Fish reproduction, particularly in the context of the provided information, pertains directly to the process of male fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water for external fertilization. As such, it is reasonable to infer that Fox's reading material covered this topic in greater detail. In contrast, reptile reproduction generally involves internal fertilization, in which sperm from a male reptile is transferred directly to the female's reproductive tract and fertilizes the eggs inside her body. Reptile eggs are typically laid with a protective leathery or hard shell, and do not involve the release of gametes into the surrounding water like in most fish species. Therefore, Vic's studies would not likely have focused on the specific process of male fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water. In conclusion, Fox, who read more about fish reproduction, learned more about the topic of male fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water compared to Vic, who studied reptile reproduction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Amyntas III was also nearly overthrown by the forces of the Chalcidian city of Olynthos, but with the aid of Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379 BC.Alexander II (r. 370 – 368 BC), son of Eurydice I and Amyntas III, succeeded his father and immediately invaded Thessaly to wage war against the tagus (supreme Thessalian military leader) Alexander of Pherae, capturing the city of Larissa. The Thessalians, desiring to remove both Alexander II and Alexander of Pherae as their overlords, appealed to Pelopidas of Thebes for aid; he succeeded in recapturing Larissa and, in the peace agreement arranged with Macedonia, received aristocratic hostages including Alexander II's brother and future king Philip II (r. 359–336 BC– ). When Alexander was assassinated by his brother-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros, the latter acted as an overbearing regent for Perdiccas III (r. 368 – 359 BC), younger brother of Alexander II, who eventually had Ptolemy executed when reaching the age of majority in 365 BC.

Article:Major Peake stepped outside the International Space Station's Quest airlock just after 13:00 GMT. He and Nasa astronaut Tim Kopra are scheduled to spend six-and-a-half hours on the exterior of the outpost. The astronauts have completed the primary goal of the spacewalk: replacing a faulty component on the station's exterior. Live: Tim Peake walks in space Its failure in November last year compromised a power channel on the outpost. The failed electrical box regulates power from the solar panels. \\"I think a spacewalk is absolutely the pinnacle of an astronaut's career,\\" Major Peake told BBC Stargazing Live this week. The European Space Agency (Esa) astronaut added: \\"We've put a huge amount of effort into this spacewalk. It's hugely exciting and we're ready to go.\\" Tim Peake on historic spacewalk Note: This tracker uses the time set on the device you are using to predict where the space station is. If your pc, tablet or mobile has the wrong time set then the graphic will not show the correct position. During the EVA - the technical term for a spacewalk - the two Tims ventured to the very edge of the space station. They had to travel half its length, a distance of roughly 50m - which is equivalent to an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Peake and Kopra moved along the exterior using their arms, but are attached to the space station's external structure via steel cords, or tethers. Colonel Kopra exited the Quest airlock first, followed by his British colleague a few minutes later. Kopra then proceeded to the worksite with a toolbox, where he anchored a foot restraint as an additional safety measure. The US astronaut then gave a \\"Go\\" signal for Major Peake to follow the Nasa astronaut, carrying the replacement electrical box. While he was waiting for Col Kopra's signal, Tim Peake was able to get accustomed to being outside for the first time, including looking down on planet Earth. Luca Parmitano, an Italian Esa astronaut who conducted two spacewalks in 2013, told BBC Five Live: \\"It is unimaginable... there are no words to describe the feeling of seeing our planet from above through a visor - that's all that separates us from the view, a thin visor of plexiglass.\\" \\"When language evolved, it described what we saw around us. Being on the space station, doing an EVA, walking outside is not something we have experienced [as a species].\\" Both astronauts have trained in a large indoor water tank called the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at Houston's Johnson Space Center. Nasa astronaut Michael LÃ³pez-AlegrÃ­a, who holds the US record for cumulative spacewalking time, said the two Tims were well prepared, but added there were key differences between underwater training and a real EVA. \\"One is that translation [moving from one point to another] is quite a bit different without the viscosity of the water,\\" he told BBC News. \\"This is especially true when [Major Peake] will be transporting relatively large masses (like the SSU) relatively long distances. This fact will change his centre of gravity and will affect the results of the inputs he makes with his hands and arms during translation.\\" But he explained: \\"This kind of thing is 'all in a day's work' for a spacewalker. I'm very confident that the two Tims will complete their tasks with great skill, efficiently and, most importantly, safely.\\" The failed electrical component - known as a Sequential Shunt Unit (SSU) - was relatively straightforward to swap out: it involved undoing just one bolt. But the ISS takes 90 minutes to orbit the Earth, so the astronauts experience 45 minutes of daylight followed by 45 minutes of total darkness. Peake and Kopra could only work on the SSU in darkness, because in daylight, there may be a current running through the box. Tim Peake in space: Want to know more?

They were given a safe window of 31 minutes to work on changing the SSU, but only needed 19, finishing the task at 14:56 GMT. Speaking before the spacewalk, Mr Peake said both astronauts would have to be very careful while working on the electrical box because there was nothing to protect them from the high voltages generated by the solar panel. At one stage, Col Kopra's suit was showing abnormal CO2 readings, but mission control decided it was down to a sensor problem. The astronauts next split up to work on separate tasks. Tim Peake is deploying cables along one side of the station's Destiny lab; they are to be used by new docking ports. The task requires Major Peake to manoeuvre through some tight spaces, so he will have to be careful not to snag his tether on any components. Tim Kopra has several activities in the meantime; he has completed the installation of a valve that had to be removed for relocation of the station's Leonardo module last year. Michael Foale, who was born in Louth, Lincolnshire, became the first Briton to make a spacewalk on 9 February 1995, during a US space shuttle mission. Born to a British father and American mother, Mr Foale has dual British and US citizenship. He was selected under Nasa's astronaut programme and therefore \\"flew\\" as an American. Traditionally, the British government has not funded human spaceflight, leading a generation of budding astronauts to look to the US space agency as their only route to orbit. But the UK changed its policy after Mr Peake was selected in 2009 as a European Space Agency astronaut. Thus, Mr Peake is the first person since Helen Sharman in 1991 to wear the Union flag in space.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body. Now, I have a new situation: Two groups of students made some experiments for school. Group A used brewer's yeast on flower and tried to make bread. and Group B brewed beer with brewer's yeast, then baked bread with baker's yeast. Answer this question please: Which group caused the bread to rise more? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided background information, Group B would cause the bread to rise more. The reason for this is because Group B used baker's yeast for baking the bread, which is the appropriate yeast strain for bread-making (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Baker's yeast serves as a leavening agent that enables the dough to rise by converting fermentable sugars into carbon dioxide and ethanol, resulting in lighter and softer bread. On the other hand, Group A used brewer's yeast on flour to try to make bread. Although brewer's yeast is also of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it is a different strain and is specifically used for alcoholic fermentation. Therefore, Group A's bread would not be expected to rise as much as Group B's bread given the yeast strain difference and its primary function for brewing rather than bread-making."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table.

Answer the following question: The toothbrush was given to the man for free, where did the man get it? A. dentist office B. bedroom C. supermarket D. drug store E. grocery store The best answer is Answer:","completion":"A. dentist office The most plausible location for the man to receive a free toothbrush is the dentist office. Dentists and dental hygienists often provide complimentary toothbrushes to their patients as part of their routine checkups or cleaning appointments. These toothbrushes usually come with other oral hygiene supplies like toothpaste and floss. This practice is a part of the dentist's preventive care measures, encouraging patients to maintain proper oral health between visits. Dentists emphasize the importance of regular brushing and proper dental care to minimize the risk of cavities, gum disease, and other oral health issues. Providing a free toothbrush reinforces this message and encourages patients to replace their toothbrushes more often, as recommended by dental professionals. Although it's not impossible to receive a free toothbrush in other locations/settings such as supermarkets, drug stores, or grocery stores, it is less likely, as the complimentary distribution of toothbrushes usually happens during events or promotions. On the other hand, toothbrushes are regularly sold in these locations. The bedroom is not a typical place to receive a free toothbrush, as it is a private, non-commercial space. Therefore, the best answer to the question of where the man got the toothbrush for free is the dentist office."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a city nearby can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of acid rain causing damage. 1. Direct effects: - Higher pollution: A city contributes to increased air pollution, which can lead to a higher concentration of chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere. These pollutants are the primary cause of acid rain. - Urban heat island effect: Cities are known to have a higher temperature than surrounding rural areas, due to the concentration of human activities and industrial processes. The urban heat island effect can facilitate the formation of acid rain through increased evaporation and condensation. 2. Indirect effects: - Decreased vegetation mitigation: Urban development reduces the amount of vegetation that can act as a buffer to absorb and mitigate the effects of acid rain. Reduced vegetation cover can exacerbate the effects of acid rain on soil and surface water. - Increased runoff and erosion: Urban surfaces, such as roads, sidewalks, and parking lots, are impermeable, which can lead to increased acid rain runoff and erosion. This can cause more damage to the surrounding environment and alter local water systems. - Reinforcing emission sources: Cities typically have higher populations and concentrations of industry, so there may be more emission sources contributing to acid rain production in and around the city. This can further damage the urban environment and impact nearby ecosystems as well.

It involves tracking and shooting ducks, usually for sport or food. Whether you are a seasoned hunter or a beginner, it's crucial to have the right gear, knowledge, and skills to ensure a successful and enjoyable hunting experience. In this article, we will discuss the essentials of duck hunting including camouflage, decoys, duck calls, and the proper equipment to help you have a fruitful and safe hunt. 1. Blend in with your surroundings: the importance of camouflage The first critical aspect of a successful duck hunt is your ability to blend in with your surroundings. Camouflage clothing and gear allow you to hide from ducks, who have excellent eyesight and are easily spooked. Invest in high-quality camouflage garments that match the colors and patterns of the environment you will be hunting in. Additionally, make sure that your face and hands are concealed with gloves and a face mask or face paint. 2. Fool the ducks: utilizing duck decoys Duck decoys can enhance your chances of attracting and luring ducks closer to your area. Purchase realistic duck decoys that mimic the species you plan to hunt. Position them strategically in the water to simulate the natural behavior of ducks. As birds fly overhead, they will see the decoys, which will make them feel safer and more likely to land nearby. This will give you the perfect opportunity to take your shot. 3. Speak their language: mastering the duck call A duck call is a valuable tool that can greatly improve your chances of success in the field. By accurately reproducing the sounds of the species you plan to hunt, you can communicate with the ducks and draw them in closer. Invest in a quality duck call and practice your calling skills ahead of the hunt to ensure you can mimic the sounds convincingly. 4. Choose the right firearm: the versatility of a 12-gauge shotgun When it comes to selecting the ideal firearm for duck hunting, a 12-gauge shotgun is a versatile and efficient option. These guns offer a good combination of power, range, and accuracy, making them suitable for both novice and experienced hunters. Familiarize yourself with your chosen shotgun and practice your shooting skills at a range before venturing out into the field. 5. Make the switch: using non-toxic ammunition In recent years, there has been a shift towards using non-toxic shotgun shells in place of traditional lead shot. Non-toxic ammunition is made from materials like steel, bismuth, or tungsten, and is less harmful to the environment and wildlife. Ensure that you have enough non-toxic ammunition to last your hunting trip and abide by local regulations. 6. Protect your firearm: investing in a gun sleeve A gun sleeve is an essential accessory to protect your shotgun from the elements and potential damage during your hunt. Waterproof and designed to keep your gun secure, a gun sleeve can prevent corrosion from moisture and dirt, ensuring that your firearm remains in top condition. 7. Stay dry and mobile: high boots and waders Lastly, a successful duck hunt often requires walking through wet or swampy terrain. With waterproof high boots and waders, you can comfortably and confidently navigate through such environments, making it easier to retrieve your ducks once they've been shot. Conclusion Duck hunting can be a thrilling and rewarding experience, but it requires preparation, practice, and the right gear. By following the tips outlined above, you will be well-equipped to have a successful and enjoyable duck hunting adventure. As always, remember to observe safety precautions and follow local regulations to ensure a responsible and sustainable hunting experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In an already tense region, the increasing number of fatalities has raised grave concerns for the safety and stability of the country. The victims, a mix of civilians and security personnel, were caught in the crossfire during a series of violent altercations that took place in various locations across the nation. The reasons for the surge in violence remain unclear, but preliminary investigations suggest that a combination of political turmoil, socio-economic issues, and extremist elements could be fueling the tension. Authorities have been working around the clock, trying to piece together patterns in the widespread aggression, in hopes of apprehending those responsible and preventing further loss of life. Although the details of the incidents differ, one common thread that connects them is the senseless nature of the attacks, targeting innocent bystanders as well as those in the line of duty. International partners have expressed their condolences and urged for stability to be restored, offering assistance where necessary. The government of Algeria is undoubtedly under immense pressure to contain the situation and bring the culprits to justice swiftly, to demonstrate the nation's commitment to protecting its citizens and ensuring their well-being. The events have left the nation and the international community in a state of mourning for the ten lives lost in the senseless acts of violence. The resounding message that remains is the need for unity and solidarity among the Algerian people.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: 73 people were killed in bombings where? , can you please find it? The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town – the first planned industrial estate in the world – had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared. Tangerine Dream was the last band to perform at the Hardrock, on 19 October 1975. In more recent years, Lancashire...

If \\"A older Asian man ironing a white shirt.\\", does this mean that \\"A human ironing\\"?","completion":"Yes, the phrase \\"An older Asian man ironing a white shirt\\" does imply that a human is ironing. In this context, the human being described is an older Asian man who is performing the action of ironing a white shirt. Ironing is a common household chore typically done by people to remove wrinkles and creases from clothes, resulting in a neat and polished appearance. The process involves using a heated appliance, known as an iron, and a flat, padded surface called an ironing board. The heat and pressure applied to the fabric allow the fibers to be manipulated and the wrinkles to be smoothed out. \\"A human ironing\\" can be understood as a statement describing any person engaging in the act of ironing, regardless of their age, gender, or ethnicity. In this specific case, the human in question happens to be an older Asian man. The act of ironing is a universal task performed by individuals from various cultural backgrounds, as it is an essential part of maintaining one's clothing and personal appearance. Additionally, ironing transcends generations and has been practiced for centuries as new innovations in technology have continually evolved and improved the process. People iron various types of garments, including shirts, pants, dresses, and more. In this instance, the man is ironing a white shirt, which has become a classic wardrobe staple for both men and women around the world. White shirts can be made of various fabrics such as cotton, linen, or polyester blends, each with different care and ironing methods. Some fabrics may require a lower temperature setting on the iron, while others may call for a higher heat or the use of a pressing cloth to provide a barrier between the iron and the fabric, preventing any potential damage. In conclusion, the phrase \\"An older Asian man ironing a white shirt\\" means that a human, specifically an older Asian man, is engaging in the act of ironing a white shirt. Ironing is a universal chore performed by individuals regardless of demographics, and it is a necessary task to maintain a neat and polished appearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Oxygen plays an essential role in the process of cellular respiration, by which cells produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), using glucose and other nutrients from food. If more oxygen were available, it could potentially improve cellular respiration efficiency in some tissues. However, the digestive processes you mentioned (chewing, the action of saliva, stomach acid, enzyme secretion, and food transit through the gut) would likely not be directly impacted by the presence of more oxygen. That said, there may be indirect effects of increased oxygen on the digestive system. For example, enhanced cellular respiration could improve the general health and functioning of tissues involved in digestion, including the muscular contractions that guide food through the gastrointestinal tract (peristalsis). However, it is unlikely that these indirect effects would significantly change the amount of food expelled from the body. Overall, the presence of more oxygen in the body may have some positive impact on the functioning of the digestive system, but it is unlikely to directly alter the process or lead to more food being expelled from the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Those scoring very high on both anxiety and pessimism scales had a 40 percent higher risk,the study showed. \\"There appears to be a doseresponse pattern.That is,the higher the scores,the higher the risk of dementia,\\"Dr Yonas Geda,a neuropsychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,Minnesota who led the study,said in a statement. Geda and his colleagues looked at the medical records of 3,500 men and women who lived near the clinic between 1962 and 1965. They all took the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory,a standard personality and life experience test,Geda's team told a meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in Miami. In 2004,the team interviewed the participants or family members. Those who scored higher for anxiety and pessimism on the test were more likely,as a group,to have developed dementia by 2004,including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. This did not mean a person who is pessimistic could assume he or she has a higher risk of developing dementia. \\"One has to be cautious in interpreting a study like this,\\"Geda said. \\"One cannot make a leap from group level data to the individual.Certainly the last thing you want to do is to say,'Well,I am a pessimist;thus,I am doomed to develop dementia 20 or 30 years later,'because this may end up becoming a selffulfilling prophecy .\\" And there is NOT any specific way to prevent dementia,although many studies have shown that a healthy diet,exercise,keeping active in other ways,doing puzzles and other activities lower the risk.

(Funny interjection, my mom was caught on the wrong side of the station so she ran across the rails and was pulled up by my dad a couple minutes before the train came.) It was a night train, so we had our own room where my brother and I claimed the top as our territory. (Look at my younger self’s squinty eyes… They are staring into your soul) Anyways, it was morning by the time we arrived at where I would spend my birthday. Vienna, Austria. I quickly got off the train in excitement taking in the view of the station like it was first time I had seen anything. We exited the station and took the trolley to get to our hotel. For breakfast, we had delicious, regional delicacies (among other things). They looked similar to crepes, but all I know is that it had a German name that I can’t remember. After we got situated in our hotel, we immediately headed off for the Mozart Plaza/Park. My family and I also visited other monuments that day: By the end of the day, our legs were worn out. We had rode so many trolleys and walked so much that I’m pretty sure that any longer and we would’ve collapsed on the spot. The bed never felt so good.

This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Two new studies suggest that modern running shoes could increase the risk of injuries to runners. One study involved sixty-eight healthy young women and men who ran at least twenty-four kilometers a week. The runners were observed on a treadmill machine . Sometimes they wore running shoes. Other times they ran barefoot . Researchers from the JKM Technologies company in Virginia, the University of Virginia and the University of Colorado did the study. They found that running shoes create more stress that could damage knees, hips and ankle joints than running barefoot. They observed that the effect was even greater than the effect reported earlier for walking in high heels. The study appeared in the official scientific journal of The American Academy of Physical Medicine. The other study appeared in the journal Nature. It compared runners in the United States and Kenya. The researchers were from Harvard University in Massachusetts, Moi University in Kenya and the University of Glasgow in Scotland. They divided the runners into three groups. One group had always run shoeless. Another group had always run with shoes. And the third group had changed to shoeless running. Runners who wear shoes usually come down heel first. That puts great force on the back of the foot. But the study found that barefoot runners generally land on the front or middle of their foot. That way they ease into their landing and avoid striking their heel. Harvard's Daniel Lieberman led the study. He says the way most running shoes are designed may explain why those who wear them land on their heels. The heel of the shoe is bigger and heavier than other parts of the shoe, so it would seem more likely to come down first. Also, the heel generally has thick material under it to soften landings. But the researchers do not suggest that runners immediately start running barefoot. They say it takes some training. And there can be risks, like running when your feet are too cold to feel if you get injured. The study was partly supported by Vibram,... Question: What's the main idea of the passage? Options: A: Walking in high heels could cause less serious effects than running barefoot. B: Two new discoveries encourage people to run in high heels. C: Running in shoes is partly good to runners.

Sarries' strength in depth told as Chris Ashton and Chris Wyles crossed the whitewash, and Courtney Lawes' late converted try was mere consolation. The hosts were the only side to progress to the knockout stages unbeaten and it is now 904 days since the Londoners last lost at home in the competition. But Saints - without England captain Dylan Hartley, Lions wing George North, scrum-half Lee Dickson, prop Kieran Brookes, flanker Tom Wood and number eight Sam Dickinson - pushed the favourites before running out of steam in the final 20 minutes. On 23 April, the Premiership leaders will meet Wasps, a side who reached the last four in extraordinary circumstances, with a last-second Jimmy Gopperth conversion securing a 25-24 win over Exeter. Saracens, who had claimed a try-scoring bonus point in all but one of their group games, were expected to romp into the last four, but Northampton but up a brave resistance. The visitors will rue letting 11 points go astray in an impressive start which had Saracens flanker Will Fraser sin-binned for a late tackle on Ben Foden. Stephen Myler missed two simple penalties, while wing Jamie Elliott failed to touch down after crossing the try line. The Saints eventually did score, the impressive Teimana Harrison breaking loose and feeding Pisi for the opening try which Myler converted, but it was their missed opportunities which will be the talking point. Saracens, a team which had six of England's Grand Slam winners in its line-up, kept within touching distance thanks to Farrell's boot, the England centre ending with a 100% record. After the break, the hosts were much improved and momentum was with them when, in the 69th minute, Ashton celebrated with a swan dive after good work by Alex Goode and Farrell. Shortly afterwards Wyles made sure of Sarries' progress, picking up a loose ball from 10 metres out and finishing. Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall: \\"This was a complex match for us. In the first half we didn't play anywhere near to the level that we can. \\"We just needed to find a way to turn the energy of the game around.

Question 2: Why do so many people ask soppy questions on Quora, which can easily be Googled? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1 and Question 2 are indeed related, as both questions are inquiring about people's use of Quora as opposed to Google. However, they are not entirely the same, as Question 1 wonders about the general motivation or reasoning behind using Quora, while Question 2 specifically addresses the prevalence of \\"soppy\\" or seemingly trivial questions on Quora. Here, I will discuss the reasons why people use Quora and then address the issue of seeking simple answers on the platform. Reasons why people use Quora instead of Google: 1. Personalized answers: One of the primary reasons people turn to Quora is to receive tailor-made responses. Google serves as an excellent search engine that provides answers by displaying related web pages, but it often retrieves generic or broad solutions. By asking a question on Quora, users can obtain personalized insight or clarification according to their specific context and circumstances. 2. Expert opinions: Quora is known for hosting a community of experts and professionals from various fields who can offer their expertise and valuable perspectives. Google searches can lead to answers from experts, but Quora provides a more direct and assured way of accessing that expert knowledge. 3. Diverse perspectives: When posing a question on Quora, individuals have the opportunity to receive multiple answers from different users, each potentially coming from a distinct standpoint. This variety of responses enriches the discussion and allows the question-asker to evaluate diverse viewpoints. 4. Subjective questions: Quora is particularly useful for subjective, opinion-based inquiries. Google searches may point users toward subjective discussions, but the Quora platform fosters conversation and the exchange of personal experiences and thoughts. 5. Engaging discussions: Beyond merely being a Q&A platform, Quora serves as a space for discourse and thought-provoking engagement. Users engage in conversations, deliberate on ideas, and even debate on certain topics. It offers a communication platform that cannot be obtained through a Google search. As for the second question, addressing the prevalent \\"soppy\\" or simple questions on Quora, there could be several reasons: 1. Lack of knowledge: Some users may not have the necessary search skills or knowledge to effectively find answers on Google. They might feel more comfortable asking a question on Quora and receiving direct responses. 2. Human touch: Even for simple questions, users might prefer receiving answers from real people instead of search engine algorithms. The interaction with other individuals could sometimes make the process more enjoyable and trustworthy. 3. Validation: By asking a question on Quora, users may seek agreement, validation, or confirmation from others. They might want to check whether their understanding of a concept is correct or simply need assurance from someone with experience or authority on the matter. 4. Growing their network and reputation: Sometimes users ask simple or trivial questions to engage with the community and expand their network. By doing so, they can increase their visibility, make connections, and potentially boost their reputation on the platform. In conclusion, both questions address the use of Quora by individuals seeking answers that could be obtained from Google searches. However, the first question pertains to a broader scope of motivations, while the second zeroes in on the specific case of simple or \\"soppy\\" questions. Using Quora can offer numerous benefits such as personalized answers, expert opinions, diverse perspectives, and engaging conversations. Moreover, asking straightforward questions on Quora can arise from reasons such as lack of knowledge, seeking human interaction, desiring validation, or attempting to expand one's network and reputation."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Dayr al-Shaykh (Arabic: دير الشيخ‎) was a Palestinian Arab village in the Jerusalem Subdistrict also known as the Jerusalem corridor.

In addition to this revolutionary approach to leather, the firm is also exploring the fascinating world of lab-grown meat. By utilizing advanced cellular agriculture technologies, they are aiming to develop cultured meat that would transform the way we consume food and lessen the environmental impact of livestock farming. With a growing global population and increased demand for protein, these innovative solutions also contribute to addressing pressing food security issues. The firm's vision is bold and progressive, and it has garnered the attention of some powerful investors. Leading this charge is Mr. Li Ka-Shing, the wealthiest man in Asia, whose belief in sustainability and business acumen has played a significant role in the 10 million funding secured. Li's involvement in this project emphasizes his dedication to supporting innovative and sustainable solutions that can benefit the environment and reshape the world. As the funding propels this pioneering venture, the firm strides confidently towards a brighter future, one where fashionable choices are not dictated by the suffering of animals and where our meals no longer leave a heavy burden on the environment. This startup is taking the lead to revolutionize both the fashion and food industries, moving us closer to the dream of a sustainably balanced and ethical world. In conclusion, the innovative firm's ambitious and committed pursuit of developing animal-free leather and lab-grown meat showcases their dedication to sustainability and ethics.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The New York Times “We’ve got people here who can’t live without it,” said Tommy Hellstrom, 75, who lives in an assisted-living home down the boulevard and counts himself among that group. “Better than sitting at home with those senile people.” He, like others on Monday, had no business to conduct in the parlor — the corporation stopped taking bets a week ago, and kept open this branch and two others merely to pay outstanding winning tickets and cash out account holders. The cash flow was strictly one-way. The televisions were dark. Most of them, anyway. As if to add insult to the day, one monitor was showing “All My Children.” The 20-something group dissipated, and other regulars trickled in. “I can’t look at horses anymore — there’s no fun,” said Michael Partridge, 69. He regularly added money to his account, but never withdrew. “I got the pleasure of it,” he said. “To handicap horses every night.” Henry, another regular, turns 82 on Wednesday and declined to give his last name. “The service was excellent,” he said of the parlor. What was he going to do now? “I just lost my wife,” he said, his wet eyes getting a little more so. “It seems like yesterday, but it was four years ago. Don’t believe time’s the big healer.” OTB has helped him, he said: “Just getting out of the house.” In lieu of anything resembling action, there were rumors. A woman who used to paint signs for a living said, “I heard it’s going to reopen in February.” Nobody paid much attention, and this would be news to the State Legislature. Someone said, “I hope something works out.” Villains abounded: Inept management. Thieves. “Corruption.” “Bums.” When you hear someone say “Good luck” at a betting window, it tends to come from the inside out, but on Monday, it was the now former bettors wishing their best for the clerks. One clerk, a 30-year veteran, had no idea how he was going to spend his first day out of work. Another, Clark Sygurdsson, 63, with 39 years on the job — men with seniority were picked for Monday’s work — shrugged. “I’m heading to the golf course,” Mr. Sygurdsson said. He counts himself among the lucky ones, with enough time on to draw a decent pension. His wife wants him to cook more. “There you go,” he said. “I’ll be busy.” George O’Neill, the owner of the betting parlor and bar O’Neill’s in Maspeth, Queens, stopped by to close his account. He recalled the sudden word of the parlor closings last week. “One guy, two babies,” Mr. O’Neill said. “He was crying. I’ll never get over that one.” Joe Fazz, 53, a court officer who works across the street, cleaned out a mound of betting tickets in his Forest Hills home — “shorties,” he called them, or small winners — and brought them to the parlor on Monday. He chatted while the clerk tallied dozens of tickets. “It’s all old money,” Mr. Fazz said. “You should never play with money you need.” A sign overhead, now moot, read, “Bet With Your Head, Not Over It.” The shorties came to 326 and change. Mr. Fazz peeled off a 10 bill and handed it back through the glass as a tip. “You’re a gentleman,” the clerk said. “Good luck,” Mr. Fazz replied.

Tolkien's fictional legendarium, Beleriand was a region in northwestern Middle-earth during the First Age. Events in Beleriand are described chiefly in his work \\"The Silmarillion\\", which tells the story of the early ages of Middle-earth in a style similar to the epic hero tales of Nordic literature. Beleriand also appears in the works \\"The Book of Lost Tales\\", \\"The Children of Húrin\\", and in the epic poems of \\"The Lays of Beleriand\\". - The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a children's fantasy novel by English author J. R. R. Tolkien. It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the \\"New York Herald Tribune\\" for best juvenile fiction. The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children's literature. - In the fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Edain were men (humans) who made their way into Beleriand in the First Age, and were friendly to the Elves. - Haleth is a fictional character from J.R.R. Tolkien 's Middle - earth legendarium . She was a leader of the Second House of the Edain , called the Folk of Haleth after her . At the time of her birth , the Second House of Men had settled in Thargelion , in East Beleriand , living in separate homesteads and having no lords of their own . But in Y.S. 375 of the First Age Morgoth sent out an Orc - raid against them . The Men were caught off - guard , and a great part of their people was wiped out . The remnant was gathered under one Haldad and his twin children , daughter Haleth and son Haldar ; and they held out for days in a stockade until the Noldor rescued them , by which time both Haldad and Haldar were slain . Caranthir offered to Men his lands to live in protected , but Haleth refused , for now she was chosen a Chieftain , being of great heart and no less in valour than her kinsmen . Next year she led her people to Estolad ; and after a time again urged them to move further westward . They passed through the horrors of Nan Dungortheb only by the strength of Haleth 's will , and at last came to the woods of Talath Dirnen . Later many removed the forest of Brethil , which was a part of Doriath outside the Girdle of Melian , but now was granted to them by Thingol . Haleth ruled the Folk of Brethil until she died . She was buried in a green mound in the heights of the Forest , which was called therefore the Ladybarrow ( Haudh - en - Arwen in Sindarin and Tûr Haretha in their own tongue ) . The next Chieftain of Brethil was her nephew Haldan . - Norse mythology is the body of mythology of the North Germanic people stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition. - Middle-earth is the setting of much of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The term is equivalent to the term \\"Midgard\\" of Norse mythology, describing the human-inhabited world, i.e. the central continent of the Earth in Tolkien's imagined mythological past. Tolkien's most widely read works, \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", take place entirely in Middle-earth, and \\"Middle-earth\\" has also become a short-hand to refer to the legendarium or its \\"fictional universe\\". - In the fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien, the First Age, or First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar is the heroic period in which most of Tolkien's early legends are set.

R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel \\"The Hobbit\\", but eventually developed into a much larger work.

In this case, let's move the 44*m term to the right-hand side by subtracting 44*m from both sides: 44*m - 44*m = 99*m - 44*m This simplifies to: 0 = 55*m Now, in order to isolate m, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 55: 0 / 55 = 55*m / 55 0 = m Thus, m = 0."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Margaret is a sophomore in high school who just started her Spring break. With a week off from school, her family is spending some time driving out of state to visit her grandma, Kathy, who has a cabin up in the snowy mountains. Margaret always enjoys spending time with her grandma because she has interesting stories and makes some of the best pie around. Also, they always go skiing when visiting the cabin so Margaret is excited for that. Who would be more likely to get lost on the mountain? Answer:","completion":"While both Margaret and her grandma Kathy may be familiar with the area around the cabin, it is more likely that Kathy, being in the late adulthood stage, would be at a higher risk of getting lost on the mountain. This conclusion can be drawn based on several factors affecting individuals in late adulthood that may impact their ability to navigate the mountainous terrain. 1. Decline in sensory abilities: As people age, their senses, such as vision, hearing, and proprioception (the sense of body position and movement), may decline. Poor vision may make it difficult for Kathy to identify landmarks or read trail signs, while compromised hearing could prevent her from hearing calls from Margaret or other skiers who may be trying to guide her back on track. 2. Cognitive decline: Late adulthood often brings about cognitive decline, which can negatively impact memory, attention, and spatial awareness - all crucial factors in navigation. If Kathy is experiencing any cognitive decline, she may struggle to remember the layout of the mountain or find her way back to the cabin even if she has been there multiple times before. 3. Decreased physical strength and stamina: Due to age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, Kathy might tire more quickly and have a harder time traversing mountain terrain. As fatigue sets in, her decision-making abilities may be impaired, increasing the likelihood of her getting lost. 4. Slower reflexes and reaction times: Older individuals tend to have slower reflexes, which could hinder Kathy from reacting appropriately to sudden changes in terrain or weather conditions, making her susceptible to getting lost. 5. Potential health conditions: Since late adulthood brings an increased risk of diseases like arthritis and Alzheimer's disease, if Kathy has either of these conditions or any other health-related issues, her ability to navigate and keep up with Margaret could be significantly impacted. On the other hand, Margaret, being a high school sophomore, is likely to be at the stage where her cognitive, physical, and sensory abilities are still thriving. As a result, her memory, attention, and spatial awareness are likely more reliable, enabling her to navigate the mountain more effectively. Furthermore, her youthful energy and strength would allow her to cover more ground and maintain her focus for a longer time. In conclusion, considering the factors that influence the abilities of individuals in late adulthood, Kathy would be more likely to get lost on the mountain compared to her granddaughter Margaret, whose youthful vigor and cognitive capabilities provide her with an advantage in such situations. However, it's essential for both of them to take necessary precautions and communicate effectively to ensure that they have a safe and enjoyable time skiing in the mountains."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I quickly got off the train in excitement taking in the view of the station like it was first time I had seen anything. We exited the station and took the trolley to get to our hotel. For breakfast, we had delicious, regional delicacies (among other things). They looked similar to crepes, but all I know is that it had a German name that I can’t remember. After we got situated in our hotel, we immediately headed off for the Mozart Plaza/Park. My family and I also visited other monuments that day: By the end of the day, our legs were worn out. We had rode so many trolleys and walked so much that I’m pretty sure that any longer and we would’ve collapsed on the spot. The bed never felt so good.

Your marriage, whether you have a wedding or elope, is a moment you and your spouse will want to look back on. Ask a professional to document your vow ceremony or the ring exchange. If you really want to keep the wedding intimate, ask a friend or family member to take photos. You can wear the traditional wedding dress or tux, or you could wear something fun that expresses your personality (like a button-down with suspenders, a frilly knee-length dress, or an outfit with personal meaning). Eloping doesn't have to mean jeans and a t-shirt at the city clerk's office. If you've chosen to elope, you might not be up for the usual reception party. Instead, treat a few friends to a party after the ceremony. You can make a small registry, or you can ask guests to just bring themselves. Order a wedding cake, pop open a few bottles of champagne, and relax at your own mini-reception. Alternatively, go to dinner with your loved ones at a fancy restaurant after the ceremony. After the ceremony and after-party, go on a romantic getaway with your new husband or wife.

The name originates from the 1848 tract \\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. According to Leninist theory, a Communist party is the vanguard party of the working class (proletariat), whether ruling or non-ruling, but when such a party is in power in a specific country, the party is said to be the highest authority of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vladimir Lenin's theories on the role of a Communist party were developed as the early 20th-century Russian social democracy divided into Bolshevik (meaning \\"\\"of the majority\\"\\") and Menshevik (meaning \\"of the minority\\") factions. Lenin, leader of the Bolsheviks, argued that a revolutionary party should be a small vanguard party with a centralized political command and a strict cadre policy; the Menshevik faction, however, argued that the party should be a broad-based mass movement. The Bolshevik party, which eventually became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, took power in Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. With the creation of the Communist International, the Leninist concept of party building was copied by emerging Communist parties worldwide. - Azad Jammu and Kashmir (\\"zd Jamm o Kamr\\"), abbreviated as AJK and commonly known as Azad Kashmir, is a self-governing administrative division of Pakistan.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Politics being showbusiness for ugly people, Joan Collins has no interest in getting involved in it. As we learn in her new book, a manifesto entitled The World According to Joan, at 18 she was voted “Most Beautiful Girl in England” (page 46), while at the age of 21 she was signed up to a film in which she had to play “the most beautiful girl in New York” (page 49). Dear Joanie tells me that she did once get involved with UKIP, “but I wasn’t sure it was the kind of thing I wanted to do. I’m not Glenda Jackson.” No, heaven forbid. So where does La Collins fall on the political spectrum? “I’d say I was Conservative party, 1940s.” She laughs huskily; it’s ever so naughty. “And I was a very big supporter of Thatcher.” What does she think of David Cameron? “I like David, but I think he’s hog-tied by what’s-his-name.” Nick Clegg? “Yes. I’m not a big fan.” And what does she think of Ed Miliband. “Not a lot,” she says simply. Even though La Collins insists that a life in Westminster holds no thrall for her – she is, after all, 78, and goodness knows what the electorate would make of her second and third homes in Los Angeles and St Tropez – she doesn’t hesitate when I ask her what she would do if, in a parallel universe, Joan Collins were Prime Minister. “First, education. I think it is shocking that 15- and 16-year-olds leave school unable to add up and with the reading ability of a four-year-old. When I was at school, I was terrible at algebra and arithmetic, but I was always the best at English and literature. And acting, of course.” She does a self-mocking “Of course I was” shrug of her shoulders, which are currently minus Dynasty-style pads. “I always did the best essays. I edited the fourth-form school magazine because, while I always wanted to be an actress, at the back of my mind I also wanted to be a dress designer and a writer, and funnily enough I have actually ended up doing all three.” But enough about her talents. She settles herself in to a huge sofa in the Dorchester, the cushions almost swallowing her little frame, before launching back in to the Joan Collins plan to fix Britain. “Second, immigration. Because the reason we don’t have any housing is that we have 400,000 extra people coming in here every year and doing jobs that our young people could do.” “And that’s just the ones we know about,” adds her publicist. “Yes!” says Joan, throwing her dainty little jewel-encrusted and manicured hands in to the air. “Exactly! In Birmingham last Christmas, I said to my driver, ‘Why are there no decorations?’ I had just come back from New York where every street is festooned with decorations. And he said, ‘Well, we have a lot of people here whom it offends on religious grounds.’ But I’m not saying any more than that. I don’t want petrol bombs being thrown through my window.” She is weary of being seen as an old reactionary, but then she hasn’t much time for being politically correct. And it would be easy to dismiss her views as irrelevant, that of an out-of-touch septuagenarian millionairess who splits her time between two continents. And yet, the more I listen to her, the more I think she makes some quite salient points, that she simply says what she sees. Even the assertions in her book about her great beauty cease to seem arrogant – more of a statement of fact. She is a diamond-encrusted battleaxe. What else does she want to talk about? The riots, of course. “These kids are so ignorant and stupid. I don’t think they have much of a moral compass now because they spend their life doing – what are those games they do? The ones where they kill and they shoot? And they watch a lot of violent stuff on television.” She sighs. “And, of course, porn is readily available.” Joan, the star of such films as The Bitch and The Stud can’t “stand watching porn”, even tried getting it taken off her Sky system, “but, unfortunately, it’s part of the package”. It would never have been like that in her day. “I hear that it is far more disgusting than it was 20 or 30 years ago, and kids of 11 can watch it on their phones at school. So they are desensitised. I don’t think they have much judgment. They think that, when they kick a pensioner to death – which seems to happen on a regular basis in this country – they’re not actually kicking a real person. Violence has become normalised in this country, and I think it’s quite tragic.” La Collins is sipping on a Bloody Mary and eating a club sandwich – or at least parts of it, removing layers of bread as she goes. Last night was her book launch, attended by the likes of Frederick Forsyth, Barbara Taylor Bradford, Christopher Biggins, Nicky Haslam “and lots of my friends who are not ‘above-the-title’ names”. At this she lets out another throaty laugh. The book puts down reality television stars, declining standards in dress (“It’s no one’s fault to be born ugly, but, honestly, must it be worn as a symbol of pride?”) and a lack of chivalry in men (“Gone are the days when a gentleman lightly took your hand in his and brushed his lips across it, or tipped his hat to acknowledge you as he chivalrously stepped aside to let you pass”). Men are turning gay because women are unfeminine. Women over a size 10 should not wear slip dresses, and nobody should show bare legs in winter. Ankle-strap shoes are “seriously unattractive”, and she advises against wearing jeans. “Rarely glamorous” is her damning indictment of them. Joan, whose fifth husband Percy is 32 years younger than her, sits in front of me in a cream beret and a zebra-print dress. She is dripping in gold jewellery. Her publicist tells me: “I rarely wear any make-up, but, at the end of a day with Joan, I am caked in it.” La Collins looks incredible and you can tell this is actually because she has had no work done and stayed natural (she thinks sex is better than Botox). How, I ask, does she look so glamorous the whole time? “You think I’m glamorous today? This is all just thrown together. What I find extraordinary is that all these girls today go out in the coldest weather, wearing the shortest skirts with crop tops, no stockings and no coats.” She shivers at the thought. “But I guess they can’t take the coats in because they will just get stolen.” I wonder what she makes of modern-day celebrities. She once said that the only person she could think of with true star quality was Angelina Jolie, so I decide to throw some names at her. What does she think of Gwyneth Paltrow? “Is she the one who called her grandmother a rude word on air?” she asks, dismissively. “I thought that was pretty shocking.” Kiera Knightley? “Well, she’s thin,” is all Joan will say. Carey Mulligan? “I don’t want to comment on Carey Mulligan,” she remarks sadly, before proceeding to do just that. “I can’t believe she’s playing Eliza Doolittle in a new movie.” I move on and show her a picture of Kate Winslet taken a few days earlier at the Venice Film Festival. She lets out a huge sigh. “Oh, that’s a dreadful dress. The worst dress. And ghastly shoes and an awful hairstyle. I’m sorry.” She shakes her head. I move away from actresses. Adele? “She’s a very good singer, very, very talented, but she has a terrible hairpiece.” Joan, a self-confessed wig wearer, knows a lot about hairpieces. Kate Moss is “OK, but she’s not Linda Evangelista in my mind”. I clutch desperately at straws. There must be one modern-day female she admires. Victoria Beckham? “Oh I love Victoria Beckham. You’ve finally found someone I like.” And that’s the other reason Joan Collins could never be a politician: she tells it like it is. ‘The World According to Joan’ by Joan Collins is available exclusively from Sainsbury’s at a special introductory price of £5 (RRP: £12.99) ||||| Joan Collins has apparently never heard the the old adage, \\"If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.\\" The 78-year-old British actress is acting just as catty as the \\"Dynasty\\" character, Alexis Carrington, she's best known for playing. With her new book, \\"The World According To Joan,\\" Collins calls it as she sees it, and doesn't hold anything back. The book puts down reality TV stars, modern fashion, and makes the assertion that men are \\"turning gay because women are unfeminine\\", reports The Telegraph who asked her for thoughts on some of today's A-list stars. Upon seeing a photo of actress Kate Winslet at the Venice Film Festival, the paper reports Collins let out a sigh and said, \\"Oh, that's a dreadful dress. The worst dress. And ghastly shoes and an awful hair style.\\" Collins takes fashion very seriously. After all this is the same woman who after feeling faint was rushed from this year's Vanity Fair Oscar party in an ambulance -- all because the dress she wore was too tight. Collins also said she didn't want to comment on actress Carey Mulligan, but then told The Telegraph, \\"I can't believe she's playing Eliza Doolittle in a new movie.\\" All Collins would say about Kiera Knightley is that she's thin, and that while singer Adele is talented, she wears terrible hair pieces. Wondering Collin's thought's on Kate Moss? She says Moss is \\"OK, but she's not Linda Evangelista.\\" Collins has never been shy with her opinions about celebrities, and in 2010 told the UK's Hello! magazine that she didn't think there were many good looking actresses around today, with the exception of Angelina Jolie. \\"Jennifer Aniston is cute, but I wouldn't call her beautiful. I think that's why Cheryl Cole is so popular, because she is just so pretty and public are starved of gorgeous people,\\" she declared. |||||","completion":"Joan Collins, the British actress known for her role as Alexis Carrington in the show \\"Dynasty,\\" has published a book entitled \\"The World According to Joan.\\" In her book, Collins discusses her views on topics such as immigration, reality TV stars, and modern fashion. She also gives her opinion on current A-list celebrities and is quite outspoken and blunt in her criticisms. Collins does not express interest in politics, but when asked about her political stance, she describes herself as a supporter of the Conservative party in the 1940s and a big fan of Margaret Thatcher. Regarding education, Collins believes that the current system is failing young people, with many 15- and 16-year-olds leaving school without basic skills. She believes that immigration is a key factor in the UK's housing shortage, as the influx of people is taking up available housing and jobs. Collins also shares her thoughts on the negative influence of violent video games and the widespread availability of porn on young people. Despite her age (78) and often controversial opinions, Collins's book raises several relevant points and shows that she is unafraid to speak her mind. Ultimately, \\"The World According to Joan\\" reflects Collins's views on the current state of the world as well as her experiences in the entertainment industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the full name of the existing monument Horace Albright drafted a proposal to enlarge?, using the article: Zion National Park is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (c. 300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, Zion being a term used by the Mormons.

Context: Once again, I've analysed my year of travel to see if I'm any closer to reducing it year on year. It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).

Lohikäärmeet ovat vaikuttaneet monien eurooppalaisten maiden mytologiassa ja satuperinteessä. Kansantarinat kertovat lohikäärmeistä, jotka asuvat luolistoissa, vuoristoissa ja muissa kaukaisissa paikoissa.

Answer:","completion":"The TV show that finds out what happens when people stop being polite, and start being real is MTV's pioneering reality series, \\"The Real World.\\" \\"The Real World\\" premiered on May 21, 1992, and is considered one of the ground-breaking reality television shows that set the stage for the genre's expansive growth in the following years. Created by Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray, \\"The Real World\\" is a series where a group of young adults, usually aged between 18 and 25, are brought together to live in a house or apartment, often located in a significant city. The participants (called \\"housemates\\" or \\"roommates\\") hail from diverse backgrounds, ensuring varied perspectives, interests, and experiences. Their interactions and personal dynamics are filmed over several months, with the footage later edited into multiple episodes portraying their relationships, conflicts, and personal growth. \\"The Real World\\" initially sought to explore how individuals from different walks of life would interact when pushed out of their comfort zones, leading to a more authentic portrayal of the participants' personalities. This concept aligns with the show's famous tagline: \\"This is the true story… of seven strangers… picked to live in a house… and have their lives taped… to find out what happens… when people stop being polite… and start getting real… The Real World.\\" Over the years, the show has evolved to include various themes, location changes, and challenges for the housemates, such as operating a business or participating in volunteer work. The series also tackled significant social and personal issues faced by the participants, ranging from mental health, addiction, and sexuality to racism, politics, and religion. By addressing these issues, \\"The Real World\\" has played a crucial role in advancing public awareness and understanding of the various challenges and experiences that people may encounter across diverse backgrounds. In total, \\"The Real World\\" had 33 seasons, with its most recent season airing in 2019 on Facebook Watch. The series paved the way for many other successful reality shows, including MTV's \\"Road Rules\\" and \\"The Challenge,\\" both of which feature contestants from \\"The Real World\\" as well as original competitors. Overall, its influence on the reality TV genre, genuine depiction of social issues, and lasting impact on pop culture have made \\"The Real World\\" an enduring and significant show that showcased the consequences of people shedding their polite veneers and embracing their authentic selves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Information: - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale). - Ethane (or ) is an organic chemical compound with chemical formula CH. At standard temperature and pressure, ethane is a colorless, odorless gas. Like many hydrocarbons, ethane is isolated on an industrial scale from natural gas and as a petrochemical byproduct of petroleum refining. Its chief use is as feedstock for ethylene production. - Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas. - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - Intermolecular forces (IMFs) are the forces which mediate interaction between molecules. They also include forces of attraction or repulsion which act between molecules and other types of neighboring particles (e.g., atoms or ions). They are weak compared to the intramolecular forces the forces which keep a molecule together. For example, the covalent bond, involving the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, is much stronger than the forces present between neighboring molecules. Both sets of forces are essential parts of force fields frequently used in molecular mechanics. - In physics, heat is that amount of energy flowing from one body to another spontaneously due to their temperature difference, or by any means other than through work or the transfer of matter. The transfer can be by contact between the source and the destination body, as in conduction; or by radiation between remote bodies; or by conduction and radiation through a thick solid wall; or by way of an intermediate fluid body, as in convective circulation; or by a combination of these. - In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F. - An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization. - Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions, separating chemical compounds by their boiling point by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the compound will vaporize. It uses distillation to fractionate. Generally the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25 °C from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere. If the difference in boiling points is greater than 25 °C, a simple distillation is typically used. - Petrochemistry is a branch of chemistry that studies the transformation of crude oil ( petroleum ) and natural gas into useful products or raw materials . These petrochemicals have become an essential part of the chemical industry today . - Methane (or ) is a chemical compound with the chemical formula (one atom of carbon and four atoms of hydrogen). It is a group 14 hydride and the simplest alkane, and is the main constituent of natural gas. The relative abundance of methane on Earth makes it an attractive fuel, though capturing and storing it poses challenges due to its gaseous state under normal conditions for temperature and pressure. - Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements. - In organic chemistry, a hydrocarbon is an organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon, and thus are group 14 hydrides. Hydrocarbons from which one hydrogen atom has been removed are functional groups, called hydrocarbyls. Aromatic hydrocarbons (arenes), alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes and alkyne-based compounds are different types of hydrocarbons. - A chemical compound (or just compound if used in the context of chemistry) is an entity consisting of two or more atoms, at least two from different elements, which associate via chemical bonds. There are four types of compounds, depending on how the constituent atoms are held together: molecules held together by covalent bonds, ionic compounds held together by ionic bonds, intermetallic compounds held together by metallic bonds, and certain complexes held together by coordinate covalent bonds. Many chemical compounds have a unique numerical identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS): its CAS number. - A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another. Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes may occur. - Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO) is a colorless and odorless gas that is vital to life on Earth. This naturally occurring chemical compound is made up of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. Carbon dioxide exists in Earth's atmosphere as a trace gas at a concentration of about 0.04 percent (400 ppm) by volume. Natural sources include volcanoes, hot springs and geysers, and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids. Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in groundwater, rivers and lakes, in ice caps and glaciers and also in seawater. It is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas. - Structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or system, or the object or system so organized. Material structures include man-made objects such as buildings and machines and natural objects such as biological organisms, minerals and chemicals. Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form. Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space. - Distillation is a process of separating the component or substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture. In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of the mixture's components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction. - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). - Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam. - A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed \\"protium\\" (name rarely used, symbol H), has one proton and no neutrons. - Petroleum (from : \\"rock\\" + \\"oleum\\": \\"oil\\". ) is a naturally occurring, yellow-to-black liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface, which is commonly refined into various types of fuels. Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation. - Hydrogen sulfide is the chemical compound with the formula . It is a colorless gas with the characteristic foul odor of rotten eggs. It is very poisonous, corrosive, and flammable. - A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms that enables the formation of chemical compounds. The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between atoms with opposite charges, or through the sharing of electrons as in the covalent bonds. The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably; there are \\"strong bonds\\" or \\"primary bond\\" such as metallic, covalent or ionic bonds and \\"weak bonds\\" or \\"secondary bond\\" such as Dipole-dipole interaction, the London dispersion force and hydrogen bonding. - In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest). - Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name \\"nitrogen\\" was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots \\"nitre\\" and - \\"to form\\". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name \\"azote\\", from the Greek \\"no life\\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.

As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Outsiders Movie plot: The story begins with Ponyboy Curtis (Howell) writing a school report about his recent experiences growing up in 1965 Tulsa, Oklahoma. His friends, the Greasers, are a gang of tough, low-income middle-class teens. The gang includes 14-year-old Ponyboy and his two older brothers, Sodapop (Lowe) and Darrell \\"Darry\\" (Swayze), as well as Johnny (Macchio), Dallas \\"Dally\\" Winston (Dillon), Two-Bit Matthews (Estevez), and Steve Randle (Cruise). Their long-term rivalry is with the Socs, a gang of wealthier kids from the other side of town. Two Socs, Bob Sheldon (Garrett) and Randy Anderson (Dalton), confront Johnny, Ponyboy, and Two-Bit, who are strolling with and talking to the Socs' girlfriends, Cherry (Lane) and Marcia (Meyrink), after watching a movie at a drive-in theater. The girls defuse the situation by going back with the Socs. Ponyboy and Johnny fall asleep in the parking lot where Ponyboy dreams of his deceased parents. Awakened by Johnny, he worriedly heads home fearing Darrel's frustration. As he fears, Darrel is angry with him for coming home late. Sodapop draws himself into the argument, resulting in Darrel hitting Ponyboy. Emotionally hurt by Darrel's assault, Ponyboy flees his home and finds Johnny. The two boys head to the park. Ponyboy and Johnny are soon attacked in the park by Bob, Randy, and three other Socs. They kick Johnny to the ground and grab Ponyboy and attempt to drown him by dunking him in the park fountain, making him temporarily unconscious. When they attempt to drown Ponyboy, Johnny pulls out his switchblade and stabs Bob to death, while the other Socs quickly flee to the police. After regaining consciousness and learning what has happened, Ponyboy goes with Johnny in search of Dally's help. On Dally's advice, and the fact that murderers in Oklahoma will be executed on the electric chair, Ponyboy and Johnny flee on a cargo train, and hide out in an abandoned church on Jay Mountain in Windrixville.

The word \\"screen\\" is a neutral object and doesn't have any sentiment value in itself. Step 2: Determine the context In this case, we don't have enough context to understand the specific situation in which the term \\"best screen\\" is being used, making it challenging to derive the exact sentiment. However, we can assume that it is likely a positive statement because the word \\"best\\" is being used. Without further context, we cannot be sure. Step 3: Combine the sentiment values Given the positive sentiment of \\"best\\" and the neutral sentiment of \\"screen,\\" the overall sentiment of the sentence \\"best screen\\" can be perceived as positive, albeit slightly vague due to the lack of context. Thus, the sentiment of the sentence \\"best screen\\" would be perceived as positive."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 1: Identify the spice 'Mace' Mace is a spice derived from the outer covering of the nutmeg seed found in a fruit. Step 2: Identify the tree that produces the fruit containing nutmeg seeds The tree that produces the fruit containing nutmeg seeds (and thus mace) is called Myristica fragrans. Step 3: Justify the answer Myristica fragrans is an evergreen tree indigenous to the Spice Islands (now part of Indonesia) and has been cultivated in several other tropical regions like the Caribbean and India. Mace is obtained from the reddish, lace-like aril that covers the nutmeg seed, which is harvested and then dried, becoming a yellowish-orange spice with a warm, sweet, and somewhat pungent flavor, used for culinary and medicinal purposes.

Review: 'Mojo' is a story of fifties London, a world of budding rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. 'Mojo' uses a technique for shooting the 1950s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion (owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period); I have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies, but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language. It's as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems, in consequence, a very distant country indeed; and therefore stresses the particular, rather than the universal, in the story. 'Mojo' features a strong performance from Ian Hart and annoying ones from Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, the latter still struggling to build a post-'Trainspotting' career; but feels like a period piece, a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom.

In his first leading role Ben Mendelsohn plays Danny Clark, a bumbling eighteen-year-old guy. He knows what it takes to be cool and have some style, it is just that he seems to struggle to get there. Danny has enthusiasm and passion and only wants two things more than anything in the world. A Jaguar XJ6 and a date with the gorgeous Joanna Johnson (an early role for then 17-year-old Claudia Karvan). Get these and his life will be complete. Unfortunately for Danny, when he finally gets the courage up to ask Joanna out, he somehow manages to promise her a ride in his new Jaguar. She is not particularly impressed by cars, but still agrees to his invitation. The problem is, Danny does not own a Jaguar. His form of transport is his recently received birthday present - and it most certainly is not a Jaguar. His eccentric parents have decided to pass on their pride and joy to Danny for his use. Their 1963 Nissan Cedric has been in the family for years and is immaculate but extremely uncool. Danny is aghast at the thought of driving around in a car as dorky as a Cedric and, with the promise of a date with Joanna and the need for a Jaguar in a hurry, decides to trade in the old Nissan.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If was the one, perfect and sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the world., can we conclude that \\"The one was enough sacrifice for the sins of the world.\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the premise that the one, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the world exists, we can conclude that \\"The one was enough sacrifice for the sins of the world.\\" Let's explore this concept in more detail by examining its theological roots and implications for various religious beliefs. The idea of a single, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the entire world is primarily rooted in Christian theology. In Christianity, Jesus Christ is believed to be that perfect and sufficient sacrifice. According to the New Testament, Jesus was crucified and subsequently resurrected to atone for the sins of humanity. This sacrificial act is considered to be a manifestation of God's love, grace, and mercy towards a sinful world. As the Apostle Paul wrote in the book of Romans: \\"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\\" (Romans 5:8) The belief that Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient to atone for the sins of the world has several significant implications for Christian theology and practice. 1. The sufficiency of Jesus' sacrifice implies that no additional sacrifices or acts of penance are necessary for humans to receive forgiveness and reconciliation with God. Jesus' atoning work on the cross is believed to cover all sins – past, present, and future – for those who put their faith in him. Therefore, the concept of the \\"one and sufficient sacrifice\\" emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus rather than religious rituals or human efforts to earn salvation. 2. The uniqueness of Jesus' sacrifice also means that he holds a central and exclusive role in the process of human redemption. In the New Testament, Jesus himself is recorded as saying, \\"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\\" (John 14:6). Consequently, Christianity teaches that faith in Jesus Christ is the only way to receive forgiveness and eternal life. 3. The belief in a single, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the world also underscores the magnitude of God's grace. Since Jesus' sacrificial death is seen as a divine act of love, mercy, and self-sacrifice, it inspires a sense of awe and gratitude among Christians. It often motivates them to share the message of Jesus and his saving work with others, as well as to live a life of compassion, love, and self-sacrifice. It's important to note that the concept of the \\"one and sufficient sacrifice\\" for the sins of the world is specific to Christian theology and may not align with the beliefs of other world religions. For instance, in Judaism, the idea of a single, universal atonement is not present; instead, atonement is achieved through individual repentance, prayer, and acts of charity. In Islam, the concept of sacrificial atonement is even further removed, and salvation is based on the individual's submission to Allah and good deeds. In conclusion, according to Christian theology, we can affirm that \\"The one\\" – Jesus Christ – \\"was enough sacrifice for the sins of the world.\\" This belief has profound implications for understanding the nature of salvation, the role of Jesus in the redemption process, and the importance of faith in the Christian life. However, it's important to bear in mind that this concept may not hold the same significance or interpretation in other religious traditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Process: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. Question: suppose bronchial tubes are damaged happens, how will it affect it results in a healthier body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"Less effect. Step-by-step justification: 1. A person breathes in oxygen – This is the initial inhaling of oxygen by the person. The oxygen will enter the body through the nose and mouth before traveling to the bronchial tubes. 2. The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs – Here, the bronchial tubes play a crucial role in transporting the oxygen to the lungs. 3. Given that the bronchial tubes are damaged, the oxygen transport to the lungs will be hindered or reduced. This can cause inadequate oxygen supply to the lungs, which subsequently affects the efficiency of the entire breathing process. 4. The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream – If there is less oxygen reaching the lungs due to damaged bronchial tubes, the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed into the bloodstream will also be reduced. 5. Circulates through the body – The reduced amount of oxygen in the bloodstream will lead to a less effective circulation of oxygen throughout the body. 6. The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide – Due to less oxygen being available, the cells will become less effective in exchanging oxygen for carbon dioxide. 7. The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs – With less efficient cellular exchange, there might be a build-up of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, which is carried back to the lungs. 8. The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth – The lungs will continue to expel carbon dioxide, but the overall respiratory process will be less effective due to the damaged bronchial tubes. In conclusion, damaged bronchial tubes negatively affect the entire respiratory process, resulting in less efficient oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. This leads to a less healthy body. The supposed perturbation, which is the damaged bronchial tubes, will have a less effect on the second effect mentioned (oxygen moving into the bloodstream)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Understand the question: The task wants you to find out how many loads Wendy would have to do in order to wash 39 shirts and 33 sweaters in a washing machine that can only wash 8 pieces of clothing at once. 2. Use the given information: We know that Wendy's washing machine can wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. We're also given the total number of shirts (39) and sweaters (33) Wendy needs to wash. 3. Apply mathematical operations as follows: a) First, find the total number of clothing items Wendy has to wash. This can be done by adding the number of shirts and sweaters. Total clothing items = Number of shirts + Number of sweaters Total clothing items = 39 + 33 b) Calculate the sum from step 3a. Total clothing items = 72 c) Now, divide the total number of clothing items by the number of clothes that can be washed in one load. This will give us the number of loads needed to wash all the clothes. Number of loads = Total clothing items / Washing machine capacity Number of loads = 72 / 8 d) As the washing machine can only wash whole loads (not a fraction of a load), if there's a remainder, we'll need to round up the result to the nearest whole number to account for the remaining clothes. Number of loads = 9 (rounded up) 4. Report the final numerical answer: Wendy would have to do 9 loads to wash all 39 shirts and 33 sweaters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The perturbation suggested, that is, \\"more coal is loaded into a truck,\\" is an event unrelated to the formation of stars or their natures. It is an Earth-based action, concerning the loading of fossil fuels into a vehicle, which doesn't have any effect on astronomical phenomena. Therefore, more coal in a truck would have no effect on the high core temperatures in the white dwarf star, being the second effect mentioned.

The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\". - Harald Berntsen ( born 25 January 1945 in Eidanger ) is a national historian and is active in the radical left in Norway . - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). - Eidanger is a rural parish and former municipality of Porsgrunn, in Telemark County, Norway. - The municipality of Porsgrunn was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).

Plot title: Bad Girls From Valley High Movie plot: Danielle (Julie Benz), Tiffany (Nicole Bilderback) and Brooke (Monica Keena) are the three most popular and most nasty girls in their high school. While the leader Danielle is used to getting what she wants, she is unable to attract lonesome ex-jock Drew (Jonathan Brandis) due to his mourning over the death of his girlfriend Charity Chase. Although Charity was believed to have committed suicide, this wasn't the case as Danielle, Tiffany and Brooke lured Charity to a cliff, hoping to terrorize her into breaking up with Drew, but ended up killing her by accident. A year to the day of Charity's death, Romanian foreign exchange student Katarina (Suzanna Urszuly) arrives during the class of clumsy Media Arts Professor Mr. Chauncey (Christopher Lloyd). Katarina and Drew immediately become friends. Jealous from this, Danielle tries to do everything in her power to stop this friendship developing into love. In an attempt to get close to Drew, Danielle works at the elderly home where Drew is also working. While there, she is assigned to look after an old lady (Janet Leigh) whom she believes is in a coma. Danielle, Tiffany and Brooke use this opportunity to raid the old lady's cupboard and eat her box of chocolates. In the following two weeks, the three girls begin to notice that something strange is happening to them, they are receiving back pains and their hair is turning gray - to their horror they discover that they are aging at a rapid speed. They believe this has something to do with Katarina whom they now think is in fact Charity's ghost coming back to seek revenge. The three decide the only way to regain their youth is to kill Drew and let his spirit be with Charity. On the night of Danielle's 18th birthday party, the three lure Drew to the same gorge where Charity died and attempt to shoot him. Katarina shows up and says she is not Charity's ghost.

Sentence 2 asserts that the legislature was keen to stop any sort of Jewish ritual because they were antisemitic. This sentence clearly states the motive behind their actions as being antisemitic. While both sentences discuss the legislature's actions against Jewish rituals, the first sentence does not explicitly state that the reason for their concern was due to antisemitism. Sentence 1 only indicates that they had concerns about the possible uses of the unspecified object or activity.

Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career.

Asians are immigrating to Canada and the United States in larger numbers than ever believe that they can give their children a better education in the west. In Asia, especially in China, Japan, and Korea, it is difficult to go to university. Students must first pass the strict national examination. However, in Canada and the United States, it is easy to go to university, and anyone who wants to go can go. As a result, Asian parents decide to leave their countries so that their children can go to university. The problem is that when Asians arrive, they discover that finding a job and making money are more difficult in the West than in the East. Also, they find that they are very lonely, and that they miss their homes. Because of these two reasons, most Asian parents decide to go back to work while their children study in the West.

The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house.

Background: Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (; 15 October 1881 - 14 February 1975) was an English author and one of the most widely read humorists of the 20th century. Born in Guildford, the son of a British magistrate based in Hong Kong, Wodehouse spent happy teenage years at Dulwich College, to which he remained devoted all his life. After leaving school, he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time. Context: A third milestone in Wodehouse's life came towards the end of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, Very Good Eddie, running at the Princess Theatre in New York. The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was Miss Springtime (1916), which ran for 227 performances--a good run by the standards of the day. The team produced several more successes, including Leave It to Jane (1917), Oh, Boy! (1917-18) and Oh, Lady! Lady!! (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a few more shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse's lyrics won high praise from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as Ira Gershwin. Unlike his original model, Gilbert, Wodehouse preferred the music to be written first, fitting his words into the melodies. Donaldson suggests that this is the reason why his lyrics have largely been overlooked in recent years: they fit the music perfectly, but do not stand on their own in verse form as Gilbert's do. Nonetheless, Donaldson adds, the book and lyrics for the Princess Theatre shows made the collaborators an enormous fortune and played an important part in the development of the American musical. In the Grove Dictionary of American Music Larry Stempel writes, \\"By presenting naturalistic stories and characters and attempting to integrate the songs and lyrics into the action of the libretto, these works brought a new level of intimacy, cohesion, and sophistication to American musical comedy.\\" The theatre writer Gerald Bordman calls Wodehouse \\"the most observant, literate, and witty lyricist of his day\\". The composer Richard Rodgers wrote, \\"Before Larry Hart, only P.G. Wodehouse had made any real assault on the intelligence of the song-listening public.\\" In the years after the war, Wodehouse steadily increased his sales, polished his existing characters and introduced new ones. Bertie and Jeeves, Lord Emsworth and his circle, and Ukridge appeared in novels and short stories; Psmith made his fourth and last appearance; two new characters were the Oldest Member, narrating his series of golfing stories, and Mr Mulliner, telling his particularly tall tales to fellow patrons of the bar at the Angler's Rest. Various other young men-about-town appeared in short stories about members of the Drones Club. The Wodehouses returned to England, where they had a house in London for some years, but Wodehouse continued to cross the Atlantic frequently, spending substantial periods in New York. He continued to work in the theatre. During the 1920s he collaborated on nine musical comedies produced on Broadway or in the West End, including the long-running Sally (1920, New York), The Cabaret Girl (1922, London) and Rosalie (1928, New York). He also wrote non-musical plays, including The Play's the Thing (1926), adapted from Ferenc Molnar, and A Damsel in Distress (1928), a dramatisation of his 1919 novel. Though never a naturally gregarious man, Wodehouse was more sociable in the 1920s than at other periods. Donaldson lists among those with whom he was on friendly terms writers including A.A. Milne, Ian Hay, Frederick Lonsdale and E. Phillips Oppenheim, and stage performers including George Grossmith, Jr., Heather Thatcher and Dorothy Dickson. Question: What prompted him to go to Broadway?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse was prompted to go to Broadway after his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton in 1915. At the time, Bolton and Kern had a musical called \\"Very Good Eddie\\" running at the Princess Theatre in New York. Although the show was successful, they believed the song lyrics were weak and invited Wodehouse to join them for its successor titled \\"Miss Springtime\\" (1916). This collaboration led Wodehouse to work on Broadway, as the musical ran for 227 performances, which was considered a good run by the standards of the day.

Pastor Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using the church as a place of worship. Pomeroy, who lost his own 14-year-old daughter in the massacre, proposed turning the site into a memorial and building another church on a different site. The final decision on the fate of the building will be made by the denomination's top leaders, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support. But a national Southern Baptist spokesman said the pastor's wishes will be taken into consideration. Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere. A one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The original site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby. Also Thursday, the father of the Texas gunman broke his silence to say his family is in mourning. Michael Kelley spoke to ABC News on Wednesday from his home in New Braunfels, about 55 kilometers north of Sutherland Springs. He refused to comment further, saying he does not want the \\"media circus'' surrounding the attack by Devin Patrick Kelley to destroy \\"our lives, our grandchildren's lives.''

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to fix a chair that has become wobbly.","completion":"To fix a chair that has become wobbly, it is essential to first understand the root cause of the problem. Various factors could lead to a wobbly chair, including loose joints, worn-out parts, and uneven legs. Once you determine the exact cause, you can choose the most suitable solution. Here are two potential solutions to fixing the wobbly chair and an evaluation of which is better: Solution 1: Tighten the Joints and Screws Wobbly chairs often result from loose joints or screws. In this case, the solution is to tighten all the connections to ensure the chair is sturdy again. 1. Inspect the chair for any loose joints or screws. 2. Use the appropriate tools (such as a screwdriver or wrench) to tighten any loose connectors. 3. Ensure that all the screws are tightened firmly but be cautious not to overtighten or strip the screws. 4. Check the chair for any signs of wobbling after tightening the connections. Solution 2: Reinforcing or Regluing Loose Joints If the chair's joints are loose, they might not be easily tightened by simply using a screwdriver or wrench. In this scenario, reinforcing or regluing the joints can help fix the wobbly chair. 1. Remove the old glue or any debris from the loose joints. 2. Apply a suitable wood glue to the joints and reassemble the chair. 3. Clamp the joints together with bar clamps or other suitable clamping devices and let the glue dry for the recommended time – typically 24 hours. 4. Remove the clamps and ensure that the glue has fully bonded the joints together. 5. Test the chair for stability and wobbling. Evaluation: It's essential to choose a solution after identifying the root cause of the wobbly chair. If the issue is merely loose screws, then Solution 1 (tightening the joints and screws) is the simplest, quickest, and most appropriate solution. On the other hand, if the chair's problem lies in loose joints that cannot be tightened effectively, then Solution 2 (reinforcing or regluing the joints) is your best bet. This method may take longer, but it ensures that the chair is sturdy and secure. In conclusion, the better solution for fixing a wobbly chair depends on the root cause of the problem. It is vital to first inspect the chair for loose connections or worn-out joints to determine which solution is best suited for your specific situation. If you're unsure about how to proceed or lack the necessary skills, it is always advisable to consult a professional or someone more experienced in woodworking or furniture repair."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: There is no question that fewer teenagers are on the roads in the US. In 1978, 50% of 16-year-olds had got their first driving licence. In 2008, according to the US Transportation Department, it was just 30%. The number of those aged 19 and under with driving licences has also been _ since 1978, when 11, 989, 000 had licence. In 2010, it was 9, 932, 441, or 4.1% of American drivers. In the UK, 683, 273 teenagers have driving licences- just 1.85% of total licence holders, according to Department of Transport figures from September 2010. But the decline in the US may have more to do with tougher tests and the introduction of the new rule in many states, which force drivers aged under 16 to be with licensed drivers of 21 years and older when driving. In recent years, the annual number of journeys being made by American drivers of all ages has declined clearly for the first time ever. Car use began falling in 2007, when average petrol prices almost doubled to 4.12 a gallon, and the economy became worse. But there are signs that it is getting back to normal and American remains a country on wheels. It has a higher number of cars per head of population than any other country in the world. \\"Cars will always be a popular means of transportation in America. You have to take into consideration some places don't have access to public transportation. Cars are the only way some people can get around,\\" says Kristin Nevels. This makes driving necessary in some rural states, where about twice as many teenagers are on the road than in big cities. Question: What can be inferred from the text? Options: A: The UK has more teenager drivers than the US. B: A 15-year-old boy cannot drive alone in the US. C: The US has very developed bus transportation system. D: Big cities have more teenager drivers than rural areas in the US.","completion":"The correct answer is B: A 15-year-old boy cannot drive alone in the US.

Brought my partner in due to having some concerns with a painful flare-up in the heart area. He had some heart trouble a few months back and spent a week in the hospital, so rather than waiting to see if it got worse, we decided it was best to get it checked out right away. Huge mistake coming to this urgent care! The entire staff was rude, seemed very unconcerned and kept us waiting (just to see the doctor on-duty) for 2 hours. It wasn't busy and very few people were in the waiting area. I'm writing this review because I was truly astounded by the lack of care, professionalism and concern the doctor had, once we were finally able to see her. As soon as she entered the room, she began asking questions and interrupting half way through my partner's answers to her. It was as if she didn't believe we were here out of true concern for his health; it seemed like she felt as if we were wasting her time or she had better things to be doing. Every question she asked was VERY condescending and her attitude was extremely unprofessional to the point where I just about had to leave the room to prevent myself from losing my 'cool' and patience.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Canaan (Northwest Semitic: \\"\\"; Phoenician: ; Biblical Hebrew/ Masoretic: [\\"; nan]\\") was a Semitic-speaking region in the Ancient Near East during the late 2nd millennium BC. In the Bible it corresponds to the Levant, in particular to the areas of the Southern Levant that provide the main setting of the narrative of the Hebrew Bible, i.e., the area of Israel, Philistia, Phoenicia, and other nations. - Tell Ashtara ( Arabic : ) also Aštartu , was a site south of Damascus mentioned in the Amarna letters correspondence of 1350 BC. In the Amarna letters the city is named Aštartu , and is usually identified with the Biblical ' Ashteroth Karnaim ' . Aštartu is only referenced in two letters of the 382 letter corpus , in letters EA 256 , and EA 197 : ( titled : \`\` Biryawaza 's plight '' ) , - ( EA is for ' el Amarna ' ) . Biryawaza was the mayor of Damascus - called Dimasqu . EA 256 is a story concerning Mutbaal , the son of Labaya , and the Habiru , and concerns the whereabouts of Ayyab , who may be in Pihilu , modern day Pella , Jordan , and is a letter of intrigue , titled : \`\` Oaths and denials '' , and lists 7 cities located in the Golan area . Ayyab is the king of Aštartu and does author one letter to the Egyptian pharaoh , letter EA 364 . - Ashteroth Karnaim was a city in the land of Bashan, east of the Jordan River, mentioned in and (where it is rendered simply as \\"Ashteroth\\"). The name translates literally to 'Ashteroth of the Horns', with 'Ashteroth' being a Canaanite fertility goddess, and 'horns' being symbolic of mountain peaks. It is possibly the same as Carnaim in First Maccabees and Carnion in Second Maccabees. - Upper Egypt (', shortened to ' ) is the strip of land on both sides of the Nile that extends between Nubia and downriver (northwards) to Lower Egypt. - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\". - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - Damascus (' ) is the capital and likely the largest city of Syria, following the decline in population of Aleppo due to the ongoing battle for the city. It is commonly known in Syria as \\"ash-Sham\\" (') and nicknamed as the \\"City of Jasmine\\" (\\"\\"). In addition to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Damascus is a major cultural and religious centre of the Levant. The city has an estimated population of 1,711,000 . - Aleppo (/ ALA-LC: \\"\\") is a city in Syria, serving as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous Syrian governorate. With an official population of 2,132,100 (2004 census), Aleppo was the largest Syrian city before the Syrian Civil War; however, now Aleppo is likely the second-largest city in Syria after the capital Damascus. - Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150) until the Macedonian conquest in 305 BC, although the actual term \\"Pharaoh\\" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until circa 1200 BCE. - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation. - The Jordan River (also River Jordan; \\"Nahar ha-Yarden\\"; \\"Nahr al-Urdun\\", Ancient Greek: , \\"Iordànes\\") is a -long river in the Middle East that flows roughly north to south through the Sea of Galilee and on to the Dead Sea. Israel and the West Bank border the river to the west, while the Golan Heights and Jordan lie to its east. Both Jordan and the West Bank take their names from the river. - The Amarna letters (sometimes referred to as the Amarna correspondence or Amarna tablets) are an archive, written on clay tablets, primarily consisting of diplomatic correspondence between the Egyptian administration and its representatives in Canaan and Amurru during the New Kingdom. The letters were found in Upper Egypt at Amarna, the modern name for the ancient Egyptian capital of \\"Akhetaten\\" (el-Amarna), founded by pharaoh Akhenaten (1350s 1330s BC) during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt. The Amarna letters are unusual in Egyptological research, because they are mostly written in Akkadian cuneiform, the writing system of ancient Mesopotamia, rather than that of ancient Egypt. The known tablets total 382: 24 tablets had been recovered since the Norwegian Assyriologist Jørgen Alexander Knudtzon's landmark edition of the Amarna letters, \\"Die El-Amarna-Tafel\\", published in two volumes (1907 and 1915). The written correspondence spans a period of at most thirty years. - Bashan (\\"ha-Bashan\\"; or Basanitis) is a biblical place first mentioned in , where it is said that King Chedorlaomer and his confederates \\"smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth\\", where Og the king of Bashan had his residence. At the time of the Israelites entrance into the Promised Land, Og came out against them, but was utterly routed. Bashan extended from Gilead in the south to Hermon in the north, and from the Jordan river on the west to Salcah on the east. Along with the half of Gilead it was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh. Golan, one of its cities, became a Levitical city and a city of refuge. - Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\\"\\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus. - Amarna is an extensive Egyptian archaeological site that represents the remains of the capital city newly established and built by the Pharaoh Akhenaten of the late Eighteenth Dynasty, and abandoned shortly after his death (1332 BC). The name for the city employed by the ancient Egyptians is written as Akhetaten (or Akhetatontransliterations vary) in English transliteration. Akhetaten means \\"Horizon of the Aten\\". - Aten (also Aton, Egyptian \\"jtn\\") is the disk of the sun in ancient Egyptian mythology, and originally an aspect of the god Ra. The deified Aten is the focus of the religion of Atenism established by Amenhotep IV, who later took the name Akhenaten (died ca. 1335 BCE) in worship and recognition of Aten. In his poem \\"Great Hymn to the Aten\\", Akhenaten praises Aten as the creator, giver of life, and nurturing spirit of the world. Aten does not have a Creation Myth or family, but is mentioned in the Book of the Dead. The worship of Aten was eradicated by Horemheb.

While on one hand the Heian period was an unusually long period of peace, it can also be argued that the period weakened Japan economically and led to poverty for all but a tiny few of its inhabitants. The control of rice fields provided a key source of income for families such as the Fujiwara and were a fundamental base for their power. The aristocratic beneficiaries of Heian culture, the Ryōmin (良民 \\"Good People\\") numbered about five thousand in a land of perhaps five million. One reason the samurai were able to take power was that the ruling nobility proved incompetent at managing Japan and its provinces. By the year 1000 the government no longer knew how to issue currency and money was gradually disappearing. Instead of a fully realised system of money circulation, rice was the primary unit of exchange. The lack of a solid medium of economic exchange is implicitly illustrated in novels of the time.

This could imply that a recipe was in place, with which she hoped to replicate a successful result. The fact that she compared her soup to Robi's hints that there might have been a common reference point (i.e., a recipe) that both individuals were using in their soup-making process. Secondly, the comparison between her soup and Robi's indicates a disparity in the outcome. Her soup not being as clear as Robi's implies that something went wrong in her preparation, which led to a different visual appearance. This observation supports the hypothesis that the soup she cooked did not turn out like the recipe - at least, not to the extent of Robi's success. Lastly, the statement \\"it was inedible\\" makes it clear that her soup not only looked different but also was not fit for consumption. The key criterion for evaluating a recipe's successful replication is whether the final product fulfills its intended purpose, i.e., to be palatable. Since her soup was inedible, it indicates a failure in her attempt to achieve the desired outcome from the recipe. This further reinforces the hypothesis that her soup did not turn out like the recipe. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"The soup she cooked did not turn out like the recipe\\" is indeed supported by the premise given. The comparison to Robi's soup, the unexpected lack of clarity in her soup, and the inedible end product collectively point towards a deviation from the recipe or a mistake during the preparation process. While more information could make this conclusion even stronger, the available evidence does support the notion that the individual in question was unsuccessful in replicating the recipe as intended."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Born Asa Yoelson in 1886, Jolson was a Lithuanian-American singer, comedian, and actor. He was well-known for his dynamic performances and became a popular star in both Broadway and the movies. Known as \\"The World's Greatest Entertainer,\\" his career in show business spanned over 40 years. \\"The Jazz Singer\\" tells the story of Jakie Rabinowitz, who changes his name to Jack Robin, as he embarks on a journey to become a jazz singer. He must deal with the conflict between his dreams and his Jewish heritage, particularly his relationship with his cantor father. Produced by Warner Bros., it was the first feature-length film to incorporate synchronized speech, singing, and instrumental music on the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system, which made the film an essential part of the history of motion pictures. The film showcased Jolson's singing abilities and featured six songs, the most famous being the opening song \\"My Mammy\\" and \\"Blue Skies.\\" As Jack Robin, Jolson debuted \\"My Mammy\\" while wearing blackface, which was a controversial and now widely denigrated theatrical makeup technique, instituted to have white performers \\"appear\\" Black. Unfortunately, this racist tradition was common in that era, and Jolson, along with many other performers, partook in it. Today, it is essential to acknowledge this offensive aspect of the film while discussing its historical significance in the development of talking motion pictures. Overall, \\"The Jazz Singer\\" demonstrated the potential of synchronized sound in movies and paved the way for talkies, which led to the decline of silent films. Due to the film's massive success and the memorable lead role played by Al Jolson as Jack Robin, the movie cemented Jolson's place in entertainment history, and he became synonymous with the arrival of talking pictures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This has led to consistent calls and demands from both national and international communities for the prosecution of those responsible. In a bid to respond to the need for a fair and effective legal system, an increasing number of Sudanese lawyers are ardently studying and preparing to handle cases associated with war crimes trials. This development marks a pivotal moment in Sudan's journey towards justice, healing, and reconciliation after years of conflict and turmoil. The Importance of War Crimes Trials War crimes trials hold significant importance for societies emerging from violent conflicts such as Sudan. These trials represent an essential component of the broader transitional justice process that aims to address and remedy past human rights abuses, facilitate accountability, and initiate reconciliation amongst diverse communities. Importantly, war crimes trials can serve as a deterrent to potential future human rights violations and provide the basis for long-term peace and stability. In this context, the efforts of Sudanese lawyers ensure that the nation is equipped to tackle the sensitive and intricate legal challenges that such trials present. The Role of Sudanese Lawyers As Sudan transitions from its volatile past towards a path of healing, the role of Sudanese lawyers in the war crimes trials is multifaceted and encompassing. These lawyers, deeply committed to justice, focus on: 1. Legal Education: Acquiring a profound understanding of national and international laws surrounding war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide is a crucial step. Many Sudanese lawyers are embarking on advanced legal studies either in Sudan or abroad to better prepare themselves for these complex cases. 2. Capacity Building: Lawyers are working to strengthen their skills in areas such as evidence collection, witness protection, and advocacy. These efforts are aimed both at improving their individual abilities as legal professionals and ensuring that they contribute to the development of a capable and competent judicial system in Sudan. 3. Collaborating with International Experts: Sudanese lawyers are actively collaborating with international legal experts, organizations, and courts, such as the International Criminal Court (ICC), to learn from their experience in handling war crimes trials. This exchange of knowledge and assistance will bridge gaps in legal expertise and ensure that future trials adhere to international legal standards. 4. Engagement with Victims and Communities: Sudanese lawyers are engaging with victims and local communities to facilitate trust and support. By creating a secure platform where victims feel comfortable coming forward with their testimonies, lawyers are increasing the likelihood of successful trials that ultimately deliver justice to those affected. 5. Legal Reform and Advocacy: Given the complex nature of war crimes trials, Sudanese lawyers are advocating for legal reforms that would streamline the process and ensure a fair and efficient judicial system. These reforms, if effectively implemented, could pave the way for a more robust and independent judiciary. Challenges and the Way Forward Despite the dedicated efforts of Sudanese lawyers, multiple challenges remain. Limited resources, insufficient infrastructure, and a lack of political will can hinder the pursuit of justice. To overcome these obstacles, it is vital for the international community, national governments, and civil society organizations to come together in support of Sudan's journey towards reconciliation and justice. Financial and technical assistance, capacity building initiatives, and continued political pressure will be crucial in ensuring that Sudan can move past its painful history and establish enduring peace, stability, and prosperity. Conclusion The preparation of Sudanese lawyers for war crimes trials is a significant and promising step forward in addressing the nation's challenging past. Their dedication and pursuit of justice demonstrate a growing commitment to accountability and human rights. With the support of the international community and the unwavering efforts of Sudanese legal professionals, the country can chart a course towards a more just and peaceful future."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on.

Second question: Can I use coconut oil to brush my teeth? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: Can coconut oil be used as a substitute for olive oil? Coconut oil and olive oil are both extracted from their respective sources; coconut oil is derived from the meaty part of the coconut, while olive oil is obtained from pressing whole olives. Both oils have a unique set of benefits and uses. As a substitute for olive oil, the performance of coconut oil depends on the specific application. When considering their use in cooking, there are a few factors to take into account: 1. Smoke point: Coconut oil has a lower smoke point than olive oil. Virgin coconut oil's smoke point is around 350°F (177°C), whereas extra virgin olive oil’s smoke point ranges from 375°F (191°C) to around 410°F (210°C). As a result, coconut oil may not be ideal for high-temperature cooking methods like deep frying or stir-frying, as it could lead to unpleasant flavors or the degradation of the oil. However, for low to moderate temperature cooking and baking, coconut oil can be a suitable substitute. 2. Taste: Coconut oil, especially virgin coconut oil, has a distinct coconut flavor, which may not always be an ideal choice when substituting for the mild or buttery taste of olive oil. For dishes where this distinct flavor may impact the overall taste, using refined coconut oil (which has a more neutral flavor) or another oil like vegetable or sunflower oil might be preferred. 3. Nutritional differences: Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, which can contribute to raising levels of LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol), while olive oil contains more monounsaturated fats that can help lower LDL cholesterol and raise HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol). Consider your specific health and dietary needs when substituting one oil for another. Second question: Can I use coconut oil to brush my teeth? Yes, coconut oil can be used as an alternative option for brushing teeth. This practice is called \\"oil pulling\\" and is an ancient Ayurvedic technique. Typically, oil pulling involves swishing a spoonful of oil (often coconut, sesame, or sunflower oil) around in your mouth for an extended period – usually around 20 minutes – and then spitting it out. Coconut oil is a popular choice due to its antimicrobial properties from its high lauric acid content, which can help to reduce plaque-causing bacteria. Additionally, some people claim that oil pulling may help to whiten teeth, reduce bad breath, and improve overall gum health. It is important to note that while oil pulling may provide some dental health benefits, it should not completely replace traditional brushing and flossing methods. Furthermore, it's essential to consult with a dentist before incorporating oil pulling into your dental hygiene routine, as they can provide personalized recommendations for maintaining optimal oral health. Regarding your final question, although both questions are related to the use of coconut oil, they address different applications. The first question pertains to substituting coconut oil for olive oil in culinary contexts, while the second question explores the use of coconut oil for oral hygiene. The two questions are not asking the same thing, but instead illustrate the various roles that coconut oil can play in our daily lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - Acanthostega (meaning \\"spiny roof\\") is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapod, among the first vertebrate animals to have recognizable limbs. It appeared in the late Devonian period (Famennian age) about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land. - The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name \\"Carboniferous\\" means \\"coal-bearing\\" and derives from the Latin words \\"carb\\" (\\"coal\\") and \\"fer\\" (\\"I bear, I carry\\"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian. - Eogyrinus attheyi ( from Greek eos , meaning \`\` dawn '' , and gyrinos , meaning \`\` tadpole '' ) was one of the largest Carboniferous tetrapods , and perhaps one of the largest of its family , Eogyrinidae , at 4.6 metres ( 15 ft ) in length . Eogyrinus appears to have been a powerful swimmer that moved quickly through the water by swishing its long tail from side to side . It may have been a predator , lying in wait for prey in much the same way as a modern crocodile . It was a lightly built animal , weighing around 560 kilograms ( 1,230 lb ) . Although probably better at hunting in the water , Eogyrinus could probably have also made a grab for prey passing close by on land . Fossils of Eogyrinus are known from northern England . Recent studies by Jennifer A. Clack suggest that the amphibian Pholiderpeton described by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869 is the same animal as Eogyrinus . If this is so , then Pholiderpeton 's name takes priority . - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - Eogyrinidae is an extinct family of large, long-bodied tetrapods that lived in the rivers of the Late Carboniferous period.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there has been more rain than usual happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER weathering occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more rain than usual can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of weathering, leading to more or faster weathering occurring. Direct effects: 1. Increased water seepage: With more rain, there will be more water seeping into rocks, which can further exacerbate the freeze-thaw cycle when the water freezes and expands. This can lead to wider and deeper cracks forming in the rocks. 2. Greater chemical weathering: More rainwater can enhance chemical weathering processes, as water acts as a solvent for many minerals. This can accelerate the breakdown of rocks when combined with physical weathering processes. Indirect effects: 1. Increased erosion: More rain can lead to increased runoff and erosion, which helps to transport broken-down rock material away from the weathering site. This can expose fresh rock surfaces that are more susceptible to weathering processes. 2. Vegetation growth: More rain can lead to greater vegetation growth, which can indirectly contribute to weathering through the action of plant roots expanding and breaking apart rocks. Overall, the perturbation of more rain than usual will likely accelerate the weathering process by increasing water seepage and enhancing both physical and chemical weathering, as well as indirectly by promoting erosion and vegetation growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sarah found the sound of the sax peaceful but Maria found it grating.","completion":"The sentence ends with a clear contrast between Sarah and Maria's opinions on the sound of the saxophone. The full sentence is: \\"Sarah found the sound of the sax peaceful, but Maria found it grating.\\" This sentence showcases the difference in how individuals perceive the effect of a particular stimulus, in this case, the sound of the saxophone. For Sarah, the saxophone provides a sense of tranquility, inducing feelings of serenity and calmness. The word \\"peaceful\\" indicates a possible appreciation for the melody and the smoothness that the saxophone brings to the music it is played in. On the other hand, Maria has an entirely opposite reaction to the same sound. The word \\"grating\\" implies that Maria finds the saxophone sound to be irritating, perhaps to the point of being unbearable. This could be because she perceives the sound as harsh, discordant, or even as an annoyance that disrupts her focus or enjoyment in the moment. The contrast between these two reactions is intriguing, as it highlights the varying ways people experience and interpret sensory information in their environment. In this particular case, it emphasizes the subjectivity involved in an individual's preference towards sounds and music. It is also worth noting that the contrast allows the reader to contemplate the possible reasons behind the differing opinions. For example, one's musical background, genre preference, familiarity with the instrument, or even their emotional state at the time of listening might play a significant role in how they react to the sound of the saxophone. In conclusion, the sentence emphasizes the wide range of reactions and emotions that can be evoked by a single stimulus. It's a reminder of the diversity in human experiences and the fact that individuals may have different preferences, even when they are exposed to the same stimulus."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The review contains three main components to consider in terms of rating its favorability: 1. Positive feedback: The reviewer appreciates the quality of Google Play Service and considers it \\"too good,\\" hinting at its high standard of service. 2. Improvement suggestion: The reviewer provides a specific way in which they believe the service could be improved, which is to reduce the size of the mobile application to 27 megabytes (MB). 3. Clarity: The review does not provide comprehensive information on the specific aspects that make Google Play Service good, nor does it elaborate on why reducing the size to 27 MB is important. Taking these points into consideration, I would rate the review a 3.5 out of 5. The following reasoning supports this decision: - The review provides valuable feedback by acknowledging that Google Play Service is of high quality, which is necessary information for developers and users. - The reviewer offers an improvement area by suggesting that the file size should be reduced, demonstrating their concern about the service's memory usage and potential impact on users. - However, the review doesn't necessarily provide a strong case for its argument, nor does it give a comprehensive account of the various features or aspects of Google Play Service. - The review is also brief and lacks adequate explanation or evidence for its claims.

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. (1996 Almanac, p. 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs Question: \\"Which political party cut the LSC's budget?\\" Response: \\"Republican\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The supposed perturbation of hotter and dryer weather preventing rain can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. To better understand this, let's break down the process and understand how the perturbation affects it: 1. Some of the rock in the ground is made of limestone: The perturbation does not impact this step, as the composition of the ground remains unchanged regardless of weather conditions. 2. Over long periods of time, rain can hit the limestone: The perturbation does impact this step, as hotter and dryer weather would prevent rain or reduce the frequency and intensity of rainfall. This leads to less water interacting with the limestone, which is essential for the acidic reaction to occur. 3. And cause an acidic reaction: Since the amount of rain hitting the limestone is reduced, the acidic reaction will also be impacted. Although the potential for an acidic reaction still exists, it will likely occur at a slower rate due to the changes in weather conditions. 4. The limestone will slowly disintegrate: As the acidic reaction decreases due to the reduced rainfall, the disintegration of limestone will also be affected, but not directly. The process is still occurring, albeit at a slower pace. 5. A large gap will be where the limestone was: The formation of the gap relies on the disintegration of limestone. Since the disintegration of limestone is affected indirectly by the perturbation, the formation of a gap will also be indirectly impacted. 6. Result in the cave: Ultimately, cave formation would still occur but potentially at a slower rate or with smaller spaces forming, as the overall process is influenced by the changes in weather conditions that indirectly impact the process. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of hotter and dryer weather preventing rain can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process, with consequences that reverberate throughout the entire process of cave formation due to the reduction of rainwater's interaction with limestone and the resulting acidic reaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. Q: x = 9, equation weights = [8, 2, 6] A:","completion":"This task is asking you to evaluate a polynomial equation by substituting a given value of x. The polynomial equation is represented by a list of weights (coefficients), and you need to use these weights along with the given value of x to calculate the result. Here are the simple steps to perform this task: 1. Understand the polynomial equation: Look at the list of equation weights. These weights represent the coefficients of the variable x in the polynomial equation. Starting with x raised to the power of 0 (which is 1), increase the power of x by 1 for each weight in the list. For example, in this case, the equation weights are [8, 2, 6]. This represents the polynomial equation: 8x^0 + 2x^1 + 6x^2, which simplifies to: 8 + 2x + 6x^2. 2. Substitute the given value of x: Now, you are given the value of x (in this case, x = 9). Replace the variable x in the polynomial equation with this value. So, the equation becomes: 8 + 2(9) + 6(9^2). 3. Calculate the result: Perform the mathematical operations in the equation to get the result. In this case, the calculation should be: 8 + 2(9) + 6(81) = 8 + 18 + 486 = 512. So, for x = 9, equation weights = [8, 2, 6], the result of the polynomial expression is 512."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy","completion":"The phrase \\"too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy\\" can be considered a negative statement about a piece of media, such as a film, play, or television show. This critique implies that the work in question does not perform well in either drama or comedy, making it challenging for the audience to enjoy or appreciate its intended purpose. When referring to a work as \\"too campy,\\" it means that the piece is overly theatrical, exaggerated, or kitschy, potentially detracting from the seriousness or believability of the drama. Campiness can be intentional, often used to create a fun, entertaining, or tongue-in-cheek experience. However, when a work is intended to be a straight drama, the presence of campy elements may disrupt the suspension of disbelief, preventing the audience from fully immersing themselves in the story. The critique then goes on to mention that the work is \\"too violent and sordid to function as comedy,\\" implying that it also fails to be an effective comedy. Violence and sordidness, when used in a comedy, should be carefully balanced, as excessive use of these elements can make it difficult for viewers to find humor or laugh. Comedy often relies on the ability to find amusement or lightness amid absurd or unfortunate circumstances. Therefore, when a work is overly violent or sordid, it may overshadow the comedic moments, rendering the work less successful as a comedy. In conclusion, the phrase \\"too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy\\" can be considered negative when evaluating a piece of media. It implies the work's elements clash with one another, and it is unable to effectively fulfill the intended genre, whether it is drama or comedy, making it challenging for the audience members to enjoy or appreciate the work as a whole."},{"prompt":"Process: - Items that can be reused are placed into recycling containers - Recycling trucks pick up the items that are able to be reused - The recyclable items travel to a recycling plant - The items are sorted by what they are made of - The items are broken down into small parts - The small parts are melted to make new raw parts - The raw parts are sold to manufactures to make new items.

Top freestyle skier remains critical after surgery SALT LAKE CITY (AP) – Canadian freestyle skier Sarah Burke remained in critical condition Thursday after a successful operation to repair a tear to an artery that caused bleeding into her brain. In this 2009 file photo, Sarah Burke competed at the Winter X Games in Aspen, Colo. Burke was hospitalized Tuesday following a crash on the halfpipe in Park City, Utah. In this 2009 file photo, Sarah Burke competed at the Winter X Games in Aspen, Colo. Burke was hospitalized Tuesday following a crash on the halfpipe in Park City, Utah. Burke was placed into an induced coma to relieve stress on her brain after her accident Tuesday and had surgery the next day. \\"With injuries of this type, we need to observe the course of her brain function before making definitive pronouncements about Sarah's prognosis for recovery,\\" said William Couldwell, the neurosurgeon who performed the operation, in a statement released by Burke's publicist. \\"Our neuro critical care team will be monitoring her condition and response continuously over the coming hours and days.\\" Burke, a four-time Winter X Games champion in halfpipe skiing and one of the leading pioneers of her sport, injured herself while practicing on the halfpipe in Park City. She tore a vertebral artery, which are located in the neck and supply blood to the brainstem — the back part of the brain which controls consciousness. Tears can cause bleeding that disrupts blood flow to the brain, which in serious cases can lead to brain damage or death, said Dr. Andrew Naidech, medical director of the neuro-spine intensive care unit at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He said those tears can be caused by severe twisting motions or impact causing sudden up-and-down movement of the head. Outcomes depend on how badly the damage interrupted blood flow to the brain or caused extensive bleeding. Peter Judge, CEO of the Canadian freestyle team, said those who were near the superpipe when Burke fell told him it didn't look like a major accident at the time. Burke tried many of the toughest tricks in her sport and was the first woman to land a 1080 — three full revolutions — in competition. It was not known what move she was performing when the accident happened. Copyright 2012 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907. He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52). In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later. Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death.

Summarize this article: It follows a YouGov poll for the Times putting left-winger Mr Corbyn ahead in the race and Ms Kendall fourth. Senior Labour figures, including ex-PM Tony Blair and Lord Mandelson, have warned against a victory for Mr Corbyn. But Ms Kendall aides said suggestions she should back Andy Burnham or Yvette Cooper were \\"not going to happen.\\" Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor, said \\"pressure has been mounting\\" on Ms Kendall to withdraw from the race. But our correspondent said aides to the Leicester West MP dismissed the calls, accusing Mr Burnham's and Ms Cooper's camps of \\"fuelling\\" the idea. One source said: \\"Both Andy and Yvette have seen their numbers fall this week following the flip flop over welfare and that's what is making these campaigns try and make Liz somehow the problem to distract from their own issues.\\" The source said that under the preference voting system it would not make any difference, even if Ms Kendall pulled out. The Labour leadership race has been the subject of widespread debate after a YouGov poll this week suggested that in the final round of voting Mr Corbyn could finish six points ahead of bookmakers' favourite Mr Burnham. The poll suggested Mr Corbyn could receive 43% of first preference votes, ahead of Mr Burnham on 26%, Ms Cooper on 20% and Ms Kendall on 11%. Taking second preferences into account, the poll - of 1,054 people eligible to vote in the contest and carried out between Friday and Tuesday - pointed to a 6% victory for Mr Corbyn. Speaking to the Times, Lord Mandelson warned the Labour Party's existence as \\"an electoral force\\" was at stake. \\"Those of us who stayed and fought to save the Labour party in the 1980s will be experiencing a growing sense of deja vu,\\" he told the Times. \\"The last five years have left us with a terrible legacy to overcome with the existence of the Labour Party as an effective electoral force now at stake.\\" On Tuesday, former prime minister Mr Blair warned Labour would not win again from a \\"traditional leftist platform\\". Mr Blair said Labour the leadership contest was being presented as a choice \\"between heart and head\\", but added that people who said their heart was with Mr Corbyn should \\"get a transplant\\". And former adviser to Mr Blair, John McTernan, told BBC Newsnight two of the candidates should withdraw in favour of an \\"anyone but Corbyn\\" candidate. Labour is due to announce its new leader at a special conference on 12 September.","completion":"In the UK, the Labour Party leadership race is becoming increasingly divisive as front-runner Jeremy Corbyn's support seems to continue to grow despite warnings from senior party members, such as Tony Blair and Lord Mandelson, against Corbyn's left leaning politics.

Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose animal has a weak immune system happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you provided states that an animal has a weak immune system and is wondering if it will affect more sugar and oxygen being produced in plants. While both animals and plants are interrelated in the broader ecosystem, the direct effect of an animal's weak immune system on a plant's photosynthesis process (production of sugar and oxygen) is minimal or non-existent. Regardless, it's essential to understand the interconnected nature of ecosystems to see if any indirect effects may occur. An animal with a weak immune system may affect other animals, plants, and microorganisms in the ecosystem, causing a change in population dynamics. For example, if the weakened immune system leads to the animal's death, its decomposition could provide nutrients to the soil, promoting plant growth and indirectly influencing the production of sugar and oxygen through photosynthesis. Alternatively, a weakened immune system may make the animal less efficient in its role as a pollinator or seed disperser. This could indirectly affect plant populations and the overall health of the ecosystem. In turn, this might influence the total sugar production of plants in a particular area, although the perturbation would not directly impact individual plant cells involved in photosynthesis. Moreover, animals with weakened immune systems may have altered foraging or reproductive behaviors, which could have consequences for plant species and the ecosystem as a whole. For instance, if a large number of animals lose the ability to reproduce, the population could decline, affecting the plants that depend on these animals for pollination, seed dispersal, or as a food source for their predators. Another indirect effect could be observed if an animal with a weak immune system is more susceptible to infections or parasites, which can potentially spread to other animals or plants. This could indirectly affect plant health, potentially leading to a decrease in overall plant vigor and sugar production. In summary, the direct effect of an animal's weak immune system on the production of sugar and oxygen in plants is negligible. However, there could be indirect effects resulting from changes in the population dynamics of the ecosystem, such as alterations in animal behavior, population, and the spreading of infections or parasites. These indirect effects may influence plant health and overall sugar and oxygen production, although it is crucial to consider the complex nature of ecosystems when analyzing these potential impacts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London in 1934? Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL. In 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at Lydney Park and Verulamium and the Iron Age hill fort of Maiden Castle.

Please answer this question: the best-case behavior of insertion sort is ____?","completion":"The best-case behavior of insertion sort is O(n). Insertion sort is an elementary sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is suitable for small and mostly sorted data sets. In the best-case scenario, the input array (or list) is already sorted in either ascending or descending order. Let's delve further into why the best-case behavior of insertion sort is O(n). When an array is already sorted, the insertion sort algorithm does not need to make any significant movement or adjustments to sort the array. Instead, it evaluates and compares adjacent elements in the array only once. As a result, the algorithm can complete its sorting process relatively quickly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the best-case behavior of insertion sort: 1. Begin with the second element in the sorted section of the array. 2. Compare the current element with the element(s) to its left in the sorted section. 3. In the best-case scenario, the current element is already in the correct position. Therefore, it is not necessary to move or swap any elements. 4. Move on to the next element and repeat the process of comparing and determining its correct position in the sorted section of the array. 5. Continue this process for all elements in the array. Since there are n elements in the array, the algorithm performs n - 1 comparisons. 6. As the best-case scenario requires no swapping or additional processing beyond these comparisons, the algorithm's complexity is determined to be O(n), making it linear. In summary, the best-case behavior of insertion sort is O(n) because the input array is already sorted, which minimizes the required comparisons and avoids any additional operations such as swapping elements. Note that this best-case scenario is uncommon in practice, but it highlights the efficiency of insertion sort when applied to already sorted or nearly sorted data sets."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After four years at the University of Kansas residing at Stephenson Scholarship hall, James joined the Army in 1971. He was the last person in Kansas to be sent to fight in the Vietnam War, although he never saw action there. In his Baseball Book 1990, James heavily criticized the methodology of the Dowd Report, which was an investigation (commissioned by baseball commissioner Bart Giamatti) on the gambling activities of Pete Rose. James reproached commissioner Giamatti and his successor, Fay Vincent, for their acceptance of the Dowd Report as the final word on Rose's gambling. (James' attitude on the matter surprised many fans, especially after the writer had been deeply critical of Rose in the past, especially what James considered to be Rose's selfish pursuit of Ty Cobb's all-time record for base hits.)

James wrote \\"I would characterize the evidence that Rose bet on baseball as...well, not quite non-existent. It is extremely weak.\\" This countered the popular opinion that the case against Rose was a slam dunk, and several critics claimed that James misstated some of the evidence in his defense of Rose. Derek Zumsteg of Baseball Prospectus wrote an exhaustive review of the case James made and concluded: \\"James' defense of Rose is filled with oversights, errors in judgment, failures in research, and is a great disservice to the many people who have looked to him for a balanced and fair take on this complicated and important issue.\\" In 2004, Rose admitted publicly that he had bet on baseball and confirmed the Dowd Report was correct. James remained steadfast, continuing to insist that the evidence available to Dowd at the time was insufficient to reach the conclusion that it did.","completion":"This text is about James, who is also known as Bill James, a baseball writer and statistician.

Read this article and answer this question Looking to bounce back from a heartbreaking loss the previous week, the Patriots played a wild back-and-forth game against the rival Jets in what would be their only overtime contest of the season. The Patriots marched deep into their own territory on the opening drive of the game, but were forced to punt. The Jets responded with an 11 play, 75-yard drive, aided by a defensive holding penalty on Ras-I Dowling giving the Jets a first down, and scoring on a Shonn Greene 1-yard touchdown run. Devin McCourty returned the ensuing kickoff 104 yards for a touchdown. After a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots raced 58 yards in 7 plays, scoring on Brady's 17-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, taking a 14-7 lead. Two possessions later, Mark Sanchez fumbled the snap and kicked the ball out of the end zone for a safety, increasing the Patriots lead to 16-7 early in the second quarter. After a Patriots punt, the Jets drove to the Patriots 36, but Sanchez was intercepted by Dennard at the Patriots 2 for no gain. The Patriots drove to the Jets 45, but punted, as well. Starting at their own 5, the Jets raced to the Patriots 36, and Nick Folk nailed a 54-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 16-10 at halftime. Joe McKnight returned the kickoff 37 yards to the Jets 32. With the decent starting field position, the Jets drove 66 yards to the Patriots 3, but the Patriots defense stiffened and forced the Jets to settle for Folk's 21-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to just 16-13. The Patriots countered on their next drive, putting together a 15 play, 67-yard drive in just under six minutes, converting three third-downs, and scoring on a two-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Gronkowski, extending the lead to 23-13. Two possessions later, the Jets engineered a 14 play, 91-yard drive, converting three third-downs, scoring on a 7-yard touchdown pass from Sanchez to Dustin Keller, trimming the deficit to 23-20. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets marched to the Patriots 25 and Folk tied the game with his 43-yard field goal. The situation turned to disaster for the Patriots when Lex Hilliard forced McCourty to fumble and Asher Allen recovered at the Patriots 18. Hightower sacked Sanchez for a 10-yard loss on third down and Folk kicked a 43-yard field goal, giving the Jets a 26-23 lead. Starting at their own 21, the Patriots marched 54 yards to the Jets 25 and Gostkowski tied the game on his 43-yard field goal as time expired. The Patriots received their opening kickoff of overtime, marching 54 yards to the Jets 30 and Gostkowski gave the Patriots the 29-26 lead on a 48-yard field goal. The Jets reached their own 40, but on 2nd-and-10, Sanchez was sacked by Ninkovich and Jermaine Cunningham with Ninkovich recovering and sealing the win. With the win, the Patriots improved to 4-3.

Generate a question that has the following answer: Scaly for the following movie plot: Dragon Tiger Gate is an academy established by two powerful martial artists. The academy aims to train students in martial arts in order to uphold justice and combat the threat of the triads. The academy is also a haven for children who had been orphaned by triads. The story begins with the two sons of Wong, one of the founders of the academy, who were each born to different mothers. The older is named Dragon and the younger is named Tiger. When the boys were young, Dragon's mother left the academy and gave Dragon half of a Jade amulet pendant and told him that his half-brother, Tiger, has the other half. When Dragon's mother was killed in a fire, Dragon was taken into the care of triad boss, Ma Kun, and he grew up to become his bodyguard. Ma Kun's gang is a subject of the evil Luocha Cult. Several years later, Tiger and his friends are dining in a restaurant and encounter Ma Kun and his men, who are receiving the Luocha Plaque. The plaque is a symbol of authority within the Luocha Cult and indicates that the holder is second only to the cult's leader, Shibumi. Ma Kun and the leader of the White Lions Gang were arguing over the plaque when Tiger accidentally interrupts the meeting. One of Tiger's friends makes off with the plaque while Tiger starts a fight with the gangsters. Just then, Dragon appears and fights Tiger, whom he does not recognize to be his half-brother. Ma Kun calls for Dragon to pull back. Later that night, Dragon confronts Tiger and his friends at a Japanese restaurant to take back the plaque. Tiger and his friends have been drugged by Scaly, another of Ma Kun's lackeys, who also wanted to seize back the plaque to prove to his boss that he is the better man. Scaly and his followers fight Dragon over possession of the plaque. Turbo Shek, another diner at the restaurant, is aroused by the commotion and he joins the fight on Dragon's side.

Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method — that of the problem of induction. Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past.

Different places have specific rules and restrictions, and it's important to adhere to them. Step 2: Choose an appropriate container Select a suitable, sealable container, preferably one that is specifically designed to store gasoline. Metal or thick HDPE (high-density polyethylene) plastic containers that are both fuel-approved and labeled appropriately are recommended. Never use containers that have previously held chemicals, food, or drinks. Step 3: Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) Before handling gasoline, put on suitable personal protective equipment including gloves, safety goggles, and a long-sleeve shirt to protect your skin and eyes from any accidental splashes. Step 4: Transfer the gasoline to the container Carefully pour the gasoline into the approved container, using a funnel if necessary to avoid spills. Fill the container only to about 95% capacity, as gasoline may expand and contract due to temperature changes. Step 5: Secure the container Once the gasoline has been transferred, close the container with a tight-fitting cap to prevent leaks or spills. Never carry gasoline in an open or unsecured container. Step 6: Store the container temporarily Store the gasoline container in a well-ventilated area, away from sources of heat, ignition, or direct sunlight. Do not store it in a vehicle or living space. Step 7: Transport the gasoline to the disposal site Take the sealed container in an appropriate vehicle to your local hazardous waste disposal site. Avoid transporting it in a car with passengers, and ensure the car is well-ventilated to minimize risk. Step 8: Safely dispose of the gasoline Upon reaching the disposal site, follow their guidelines and instructions carefully for proper gasoline disposal.

From a glance, they may seem to convey a similar message because both cover the progressive fall of The 'Cobblers' in two consecutive seasons, but the details within depict two different scenarios. In the first sentence, it says \\"The 'Cobblers' fell to 16th in 1991-92, before they dropped to 20th place in 1992--93 under Phil Chard.\\" This sentence tells us that in the 1991-92 season, The 'Cobblers' were in the 16th position, which is generally a higher ranking or better performance in most league systems. However, the following season, 1992-93, under Phil Chard, the team's performance worsened and they fell to the 20th position. On the other hand, the second sentence states \\"The 'Cobblers' dropped to 20th in 1991 -- 92, before plummeting to 16th place in 1992 -- 93 under Phil Chard.\\" Here, the initial standing of The 'Cobblers' in the 1991-92 season is lower than in the first sentence, at the 20th spot. The following season, 1992-93, they actually improved their ranking to the 16th position under Phil Chard.

Article: Do not put a lot of lights in your haunted house, or people will be too relaxed. They will also be able to tell where your spooky friends are hiding. If it's dark, they will be tense and have a better time. Just make sure your guests have enough light to get through the house safely. Here are some ways to use the lighting to create a haunted effect: Consider putting your guests in a very dark room and giving them flashlights to try to find the way out. Replace your lamps with dim, green bulbs around the house. Drape traditional lamps with cobwebs and tape rubber bats to the insides. Light a spotlight under a spider web or fake creepy insect to create a spooky shadow. Try mirrors, black lights, and smoke to confuse the visitors. The special effects will make your visitors feel more shocked and spooked at every turn. Fog machines and strobe lights are also classics when it comes to haunted house special effects. You can find fog machines for around 30 at a party or Halloween store. Put strobe lights in a room to create a dramatic effect. The sounds in the haunted house will scare your visitors and keep them on their toes. The trick to having spooky noises is to time them perfectly and not use them too often, or your guests won't be surprised. Here are some tricks to creating some scary sounds: Have a recording of a different spooky sound in every room. One room can have the sound of a chainsaw, while another can have the sound of a woman screaming. Your volunteers can scamper from one side of an empty room to another to create a scary sound. Put on a soundtrack made up of soft, creepy music. Use silence to your advantage. Pick some key moments to keep the house silent so your guests will be even more startled by the next sound. A maze is a great way to guide your guests through your haunted house, whether it is located in a house, apartment, or even a garage. You could stack boxes and cover them with a black cloth so they look like walls. Plan your maze out with a sketch first and then start building it at least a week before the haunted house. Decorate your maze with scary props, lights, and characters. Make sure the way out of the maze is clear to guests. If you are going for a fun, child-friendly theme, avoid gore and try to keep the decorations fun or only mildly scary. For example, use bats, friendly looking ghosts, or cartoonish looking monsters. Use decorations such as fake blood, skulls, hazmat suits, heads in a jar, or gory “bodies” if you want a more adult, scary theme. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article would be: To create an effective haunted house, it is important to use the right lighting, sounds, and decorations to maintain a spooky atmosphere and scare visitors. Keep the rooms dark with dim or colored lights, provide flashlights if necessary, and use special effects like fog machines and strobe lights.

Design a maze with scary props, lights, and characters to guide guests, and decorate according to the desired theme, whether it's child-friendly or adult-oriented with gore and intense scares."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: \\"History teaches us that men behave wisely . . . once they've exhausted all other alternatives. For most rock bands, the pursuit of wisdom's a low priority compared to fame, fortune and fornication.

When Keith died of a drug overdose, he was replaced on vocals by Ray Simms (Bill Nighy).

The already-contentious band members decided it was a sign and immediately broke up forever (all this in the first five minutes of the film).

Everest it would mean they are,\\" in relation to the provided options, implies you're discussing elevation or altitude. Here, getting 'high' at Mt. Everest means reaching a significant altitude on the mountain, or even climbing to the very top. Therefore, among the given options, the expression would most closely correspond with the option \\"[+] at the apex.\\" The term 'apex', in a geographical or topographical context, refers to the highest point or summit of a physical feature such as a mountain. Thus, when you're talking about getting 'high' on Mt. Everest, the world's highest peak with an altitude of about 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 feet) above sea level, you're referring to reaching substantial altitudes that would put climbers close to or at the top of it. So, if a person 'gets high' on Mount Everest, it implies that they have ascended to a great altitude or potentially even reached the apex, the topmost point of Mt. Everest. This is a considerable accomplishment considering the physically and mentally demanding nature of such climbs. This feat requires excellent physical fitness, mountaineering skills, acclimatization to high altitude conditions, and careful planning and preparation. The given options \\"[+] arriving at airport,\\" \\"[+] waiting for cabs,\\" and \\"[+] at the bottom,\\" don't fit in this context because they have little or no relation to someone getting 'high' regarding altitude on Mount Everest. The airport and cab options involve travel logistics and are not relevant to the physical act of ascending the mountain.

Q: what was the name of clarks african american helper? A:","completion":"A: The African American helper that accompanied Clark during the Lewis and Clark expedition was named York. He was not only a helper but also a crucial member of the Corps of Discovery, which was the group that set out to explore and map the newly acquired western portion of the United States after the Louisiana Purchase. York was born into slavery around 1770, and he was owned by William Clark's father, John Clark. York later became the personal servant to William Clark. When President Thomas Jefferson tasked Meriwether Lewis and William Clark with embarking on their expedition, Clark brought York along as a valuable team member. He was known to be physically strong and had excellent hunting, tracking, and survival skills. This made him an important asset to the group. During their journey, York played a significant role in interactions with the various Native American tribes they encountered. Many of the tribes, never having seen an African American person, were fascinated by York's appearance and color. This curiosity fostered goodwill and diplomatic relationships and helped smooth over some potential conflicts and disputes. In addition to his responsibilities as a hunter, York carried out other important tasks, such as helping with navigation, scouting, and assisting in setting up camps. He also participated in decision-making, which was something that other enslaved individuals of the time were not typically allowed to do. This unusual level of participation indicates the respect and value the other members of the expedition held for York. Despite his significant contributions to the Lewis and Clark expedition, York's life after the journey remains unclear. There are conflicting accounts of his status following the expedition. Some reports state that he was granted his freedom but had difficulty adjusting to life as a free man. Other accounts suggest that he was not granted his freedom until years later and faced considerable hardship. Nonetheless, York's story is an essential part of the history of the Lewis and Clark expedition and the role of African Americans in the exploration and development of the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Information: - Louis XIV (5 September 16381 September 1715), known as Louis the Great (') or the Sun King ('), was a monarch of the House of Bourbon who ruled as King of France from 1643 until his death in 1715. His reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest of any monarch of a major country in European history. In this age of absolutism in Europe, Louis XIV's France was a leader in the growing centralization of power. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world.

The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - Prince of Orange is a title originally associated with the sovereign Principality of Orange, in what is now southern France. Under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, Frederick William I of Prussia ceded the Principality of Orange to King Louis XIV of France (while retaining the title as part of his dynastic titulature). After William III of England died without children, a dispute arose between Johan Willem Friso and Frederick I of Prussia, which was settled in the Treaty of Partition (1732); consequently, Friso's son, William IV had to share use of the title \\"Prince of Orange\\" (which had accumulated prestige in the Netherlands and throughout the Protestant world) with Frederick William I of Prussia. The title is traditionally borne by the heir apparent of the Dutch monarch. The title descends via absolute primogeniture since 1983, meaning that its holder can be either Prince or Princess of Orange. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Treaty of Utrecht, which established the Peace of Utrecht, is a series of individual peace treaties, rather than a single document, signed by the belligerents in the War of the Spanish Succession, in the Dutch city of Utrecht in March and April 1713. The treaties between several European states, including Spain, Great Britain, France, Portugal, Savoy and the Dutch Republic, helped end the war. - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947. - Frederick William I (14 August 1688 31 May 1740), known as the 'Soldier King,' was the King in Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg from 1713 until his death, as well as the father of Frederick the Great.

While his birthdate is unknown , Guerini worked in The Hague for the Prince of Orange from 1740 until 1760 , at which time he moved to London , where he was active until 1770 . Most of Guerini 's published compositions were sonatas for one or two violins and continuo , but he also wrote keyboard works as well as Six Sonates / A deux Flûtes , ou deux Violons ... Ouevre III ( with no continuo ) , Paris , ca . 1750 , or Six Solos for a Violoncello with a Thorough Bass for the Harpsichord , Opus 9 , first published in London in 1765 . - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union.

The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan. - William III (4 November 1650 8 March 1702; also widely known as William of Orange) was sovereign Prince of Orange from birth, Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from 1672, and King of England, Ireland, and Scotland from 1689 until his death. It is a coincidence that his regnal number (III) was the same for both Orange and England. As King of Scotland, he is known as William II. He is informally known by sections of the population in Northern Ireland and Scotland as \\"King Billy\\". - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965.

EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Frederick I (11 July 1657 25 February 1713), of the Hohenzollern dynasty, was (as Frederick III) Elector of Brandenburg (16881713) and Duke of Prussia in personal union (Brandenburg-Prussia). The latter function he upgraded to royalty, becoming the first King in Prussia (17011713). From 1707 he was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel. He was also the paternal grandfather of Frederick the Great. - The Principality of Orange (in French \\"la Principauté d'Orange\\") was, from 1163 to 1713, a feudal state in Provence, in the south of modern-day France, on the left bank of the river Rhone north of the city of Avignon. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.

The problem is: 38 * q = 67 * q - 34 * q - 45. Now, let's simplify and solve it! First, we have two operations with q (67*q - 34*q). We can combine them, by subtracting 34 from 67, we get 33. So, it becomes: 38 * q = 33 * q - 45 Now, we want to get all the operations with q on one side of the equation and the number on the other side. To do this, we will subtract 33*q from both sides. 38*q - 33*q = 33*q - 45 - 33*q Now, 38*q - 33*q on the left side becomes 5*q and 33*q - 33*q on the right side becomes 0. So, the equation looks like: 5 * q = -45 Now we want to find the value of q. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5. (5 * q) / 5 = -45 / 5 5/5 equals 1, so we have: q = -45 / 5 Now, let's divide -45 by 5, which equals -9. So, q = -9 And that's our final answer! Q is equal to -9."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on.

To start, all you need is a teaspoon of raw seeds in your pot. Boil the water as you normally do. Whether you use a kettle or have to microwave a cup of water is up to you, but water never gets in the way of tea. When you’ve got the water piping hot, pour it into the teapot. Time flies and after all that hard work you did, it’s time for a well-deserved break. After about three minutes, the water will have already begun taking on the flavor of the seeds. However, let the seeds continue to steep for five to ten minutes. The tea you’ll get will be similar to black tea with a nutty flavor, which is way better than drinking fenugreek soaking water. The tea can be altered however you wish. Some tea-drinkers like adding milk or honey. Others like brewing tea with both seeds and tea leaves. It may be obvious, but don’t swallow the nuts while you’re trying to sip your tea. Hold a mesh strainer over your teacup and filter the water through it. These tea strainers shouldn’t be hard to find, so look wherever kitchen or tea supplies are sold. Maybe you like the tea so much you crave a second cup. Maybe you swallow it for the health benefits.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which age group was more in poverty, those under the age 18 or aged 65 or over?","completion":"Title: Comparative Analysis of Poverty Rates: Age Groups Under 18 and 65 or Over Introduction The prevalence of poverty in the world is a concerning issue that affects various age groups. This article seeks to provide an in-depth analysis of poverty rates between two distinct age clusters: population under the age of 18 and individuals aged 65 or over. By examining available data and research, we will determine which age group experiences higher poverty rates and discuss possible reasons behind these disparities. Overview: Age and Poverty in Perspective The World Bank defines poverty as a condition where individuals lack essential means to fulfill basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. The subject of age and its relation to poverty becomes crucial as different age groups present unique challenges and vulnerabilities. Younger populations often face limited employment opportunities and inadequate access to education, while the elderly may struggle with deteriorating health, limited income sources, and diminished social support. As such, determining which age group experiences a higher poverty rate can inform policymakers and help them create targeted interventions to mitigate poverty. Children Under 18 in Poverty In many countries, children represent a significant portion of impoverished citizens. Studies suggest that children are particularly susceptible to poverty due to various factors, such as their reliance on parental income and unstable family situations. Data from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) suggests that worldwide, around 385 million children are living in extreme poverty. Factors contributing to child poverty include low parental education, inadequate job opportunities for parents, single-parent families, and limited access to quality education and healthcare. These factors often create a vicious cycle of poverty, where lower-skilled parents are unable to provide the necessary support, leading their children to face similar challenges in their future. Furthermore, child poverty is not solely a concern for developing countries. In high-income countries, such as the United States, around 17% of children under 18 were living in poverty in 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Research has shown that child poverty in these countries can have detrimental long-term effects on education, health, and overall life quality. Elderly Population Aged 65 or Over in Poverty In contrast, the elderly population (aged 65 or over) also faces significant challenges contributing to poverty. As people age, their access to stable income sources often decreases, with few employment opportunities or inadequate retirement savings. Additionally, elderly individuals face increased healthcare costs due to age-related medical complications and chronic diseases. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the poverty rate among elderly individuals in member countries was around 13.5% in 2019. In some countries, the elderly poverty rate is even higher; for instance, South Korea reported a staggering 43.8% poverty rate for people aged 65 or over, primarily due to an underdeveloped public pension system. Although social security and pension systems are implemented in many countries to address the income-related concerns of senior citizens, these programs are not universal and can vary greatly in effectiveness. As a result, a substantial proportion of the elderly population continues to struggle with poverty. Which Age Group is More Impoverished? While comparing the poverty rates for both age groups, it is evident that children under 18 are disproportionately affected by poverty in many countries. According to global data from UNICEF and OECD, the poverty rate for children is consistently higher than the rate for elderly individuals in both developing and developed countries. Multiple reasons contribute to the higher poverty rates amongst children, including reliance on parental income, an increased likelihood of living in single-parent households, and limited access to basic amenities and education. Meanwhile, while the elderly also experience significant challenges, social security nets such as pension systems help alleviate the burden of poverty for many senior citizens. Conclusion In conclusion, children under the age of 18 are generally more exposed to poverty than individuals aged 65 or over. Addressing child poverty remains a pressing issue worldwide, as it has lasting consequences on their education, health, and overall well-being. Policymakers must focus on implementing long-term interventions aimed at improving access to quality education, healthcare, and well-functioning family environments to help break the cycle of poverty for future generations. Simultaneously, efforts should continue to strengthen social security nets for the elderly population to ensure they can live comfortably in their twilight years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No. Ageratum is a genus containing around 40 to 60 species of tropical and warm temperate flowering annuals and perennials. Most of these species come from Central America and Mexico, while only four of them are native to the United States. The information given does not suggest that Ageratum is native to over 150 countries. In fact, it highlights just a few regions where these plants can be found. Therefore, the correct answer is no, we cannot infer that Ageratum is native to over 150 countries based on the given information. It is essential to note that native range and distribution patterns can vary among species within a genus. Some species might have a broader distribution, while others might have a more restricted one.

Article: In some jurisdictions, copyright or the right to enforce it can be contractually assigned to a third party which did not have a role in producing the work. When this outsourced litigator appears to have no intention of taking any copyright infringement cases to trial, but rather only takes them just far enough through the legal system to identify and exact settlements from suspected infringers, critics commonly refer to the party as a \\"copyright troll.\\" Such practices have had mixed results in the U.S. Question: What do these lawsuits have in the U.S.?","completion":"In the United States, these lawsuits initiated by \\"copyright trolls\\" have had a significant impact on various aspects of the American legal landscape, intellectual property rights, and the creative industries. Below is a detailed analysis of how these litigation strategies have affected different areas. 1. Impact on legal landscape: Fear of Litigation: Many individuals and businesses, particularly in the creative industry, are living in fear of being targeted by copyright trolls. These lawsuit threats lead to apprehensions and can stifle creativity or result in excessive caution when developing and distributing new content. Settlement Pressure: The main goal of copyright trolls is to achieve monetary settlements from alleged infringers without genuine intention of ultimately taking the case to trial. Consequently, the legal landscape has witnessed a surge in pre-litigation settlement demands from aggressive litigants, often accompanied by threatening letters and scare tactics. This pressure induces numerous people to settle just to avoid the costly, time-consuming, and stress-inducing trial process. Chilling Effect: The tactics employed by copyright trolls create a chilling effect on free speech and creative expression, as creators may self-censor to avoid potential legal trouble. This can hinder innovation and progress in the creative industry, as individuals and entities become wary of sharing their own work or collaborating with others due to the fear of litigation. 2. Impact on intellectual property rights: Dilution of Copyright Protection: Copyright serves as a critical legal protection for creators' works, ensuring that they may fairly profit from their investment in time, energy, and creativity. However, the excessive use of litigation by copyright trolls to intimidate suspected infringers can reduce public regard for this protective mechanism and lead to a dilution of the underlying values and goals of copyright law. Misuse of Copyright: Copyright trolls exploit the legal system to enforce copyrights selectively, often against unsuspecting defendants, thereby undermining the core objectives of promoting creative expression and providing individual artists with a means to protect their work. This manipulative use of copyright law exacerbates public skepticism regarding the just enforcement of intellectual property rights. 3. Impact on creative industries: Loss of Resources: Entities, particularly smaller ones with fewer resources, may suffer financial and operational setbacks after being targeted by copyright trolls. Legal fees, settlement payments, or the expense of rebranding or redeveloping content can cut into budget allocations for business growth and innovation. Stifled Innovation: A toxic environment, where creators continuously worry about potential legal threats, threatens to stifle innovation. Setbacks in the creative industries can have broader economic implications as the market loses out on potentially groundbreaking work due to the fear of litigation. 4. Impact on U.S. courts: Court Congestion: The exponential growth in the number of lawsuits filed by copyright trolls adds to the burden on U.S. courts. Judges and court personnel are forced to devote substantial time and effort to these cases, which are often brought without the genuine intent to prosecute. This congestion slows down the judicial system and delays the resolution of other non-related matters. In summary, the lawsuits initiated by copyright trolls in the United States have had mixed results on both a legal level and within the creative and intellectual property spheres. These litigation tactics have generated fear, uncertainty, and skepticism among creators, disrupted the creative industry, and infringed upon the core objectives of copyright protection. Moreover, these lawsuits have severely impacted the efficiency and reputation of the U.S. legal system. In recent years, efforts to counteract these harms have emerged, such as revisions to copyright legislation and judicial responses that discourage exploitative litigation practices or award penalties to copyright trolls."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This element of the tweet may suggest that the user is in a light-hearted, casual mood, actively engaging with popular entertainment choices. This can be considered as neutral sentiment with a hint of playfulness. However, the user adds a warning that playing the XBOX 360 may lead to Chronic Insomnia, which brings a slight negative undertone to the tweet. The tone seems to be humorous here, making a playful observation about the potentially addictive nature of playing video games and its potential impact on sleep patterns. The user is not seriously expressing a deep concern or negative sentiment about the XBOX 360, but rather making a playful, self-aware comment.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 2010 Pulitzer Prizes for Letters, Drama and Music Paul Harding won the fiction prize for his novel “Tinkers,” while the drama award went to the musical “Next to Normal,” with music by Tom Kitt and book and lyrics by Brian Yorkey. Liaquat Ahamed won the history award for “Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World,” the biography prize went to T. J. Stiles for “The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt” and the general nonfiction prize went to David E. Hoffman for “The Dead Hand: The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy.” Jennifer Higdon won the music prize for her Violin Concerto while the poetry award went to Rae Armantrout for “Versed.” The complete list of winners in Letters, Drama and Music is below. FICTION: “Tinkers,” by Paul Harding “Tinkers,” a debut novel, is about the memories of a dying man, George Washington Crosby, who remembers being abandoned by his father, an epileptic. Mr. Harding, 42, teaches creative writing at the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop and said the seed of the novel came from his grandfather’s spare reminisces of his own father. “I could never get him to elaborate on it,” Mr. Harding said. “So of course it became irresistible to me.” Finalists: “Love in Infant Monkeys,” by Lydia Millet; “In Other Rooms, Other Wonders,” by Daniyal Mueenuddin. DRAMA: “Next to Normal,” music by Tom Kitt; book and lyrics by Brian Yorkey. “Next to Normal,” about a family shattered by mental illness, is the eighth musical to win in the 92 years of the category. The Pulitzer Board commended the work for expanding “the scope of subject matter for musicals.” Mr. Kitt, 36, and Mr. Yorkey, 39, writing partners since 1994, said they had been inspired by the last two musicals to win the Pulitzer, “Rent” (1996) and “Sunday in the Park With George” (1985). “They broke ground the way we wanted to,” Mr. Yorkey said. Finalists: “The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity,” by Kristoffer Diaz; “Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo,” by Rajiv Joseph; “In the Next Room (or the vibrator play),” by Sarah Ruhl. HISTORY: “Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World,” by Liaquat Ahamed Long before the banking system buckled in 2008, Mr. Ahamed, a 57-year-old economist born in Kenya, was already examining the 1930s to see what lessons could be gleaned for our own era. His book, begun in 2004 and the first he has written, is, the award citation says, “a compelling account” of how four powerful central bankers “played crucial roles in triggering the Great Depression” with mistaken policies. Finalists: “Fordlandia: The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford’s Forgotten Jungle City,” by Greg Grandin; “Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789-1815,” by Gordon S. Wood. BIOGRAPHY: “The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt,” by T.J. Stiles Vanderbilt is one of those names that Americans instantly recognize, but Mr. Stiles, 45, said he was drawn to the founder of the dynasty because he was “one of the most misunderstood of the major figures in American history.” Writing about “the Commodore” was a challenge, Mr. Stiles said, because he did not keep a diary or leave behind letters or documents. But scouring 19th-century public records and the papers of Vanderbilt’s various railway corporations helped Mr. Stiles produce what the award citation called “a penetrating portrait of a complex, self-made titan.” Finalists: “Woodrow Wilson: A Biography,” by John Milton Cooper Jr.; “Cheever: A Life,” by Blake Bailey. POETRY: “Versed,” by Rae Armantrout In her ninth volume of poetry, Ms. Armantrout, 62, explored themes of war and illness, driven by the war in Iraq and her own diagnosis of adrenal cortical cancer. “You could say there are things happening in your body that you can’t control and you don’t want them to be happening,” said Ms. Armantrout, “and there are things in your society that you can’t control and you don’t want them to be happening.” Finalists: “Tryst,” by Angie Estes; “Inseminating the Elephant,” by Lucia Perillo. GENERAL NONFICTION: “The Dead Hand: The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy,” by David E. Hoffman Mr. Hoffman, 56, a contributing editor and former Moscow bureau chief for The Washington Post, relied heavily on never-before-seen documents from the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. “I hope to open people’s eyes that secrecy, mistrust and suspicion are as dangerous as weapons of mass destruction,” Mr. Hoffman said Monday. The Pulitzer Board called the book “a well-documented narrative that examines the terrifying doomsday competition between two superpowers.” Finalists: “How Markets Fail: The Logic of Economic Calamities,” by John Cassidy; “The Evolution of God,” by Robert Wright. MUSIC: “Violin Concerto,” by Jennifer Higdon, premiered Feb. 6, 2009, in Indianapolis Ms. Higdon, 47, won for the concerto she composed for the young soloist Hilary Hahn, which was first heard in a performance by Ms. Hahn and the Indianapolis Symphony on Feb. 6, 2009. Ms. Higdon, born in Brooklyn, took up composition when she was 21. She writes in an accessible, melodic style. Finalists: “String Quartet No. 3,” by Fred Lerdahl, premiered on Dec. 8, 2009, in Cleveland; “Steel Hammer,” by Julia Wolfe, premiered on Nov. 13, 2009, in Gainesville, Fla.","completion":"The 2010 Pulitzer Prizes for Letters, Drama, and Music were awarded to various acclaimed works.

The lad preferred shooting with a rifle instead of a shotgun because the","completion":"precision and skill required appealed to him more. He had always been fascinated by the intricacies of marksmanship, and the challenge of hitting a target from a distance enthralled him. His fascination with rifles began when he was just a young boy, growing up on his family's farm. The vast acres of land provided the perfect playground for him to explore and nurture his love for the outdoors. Unlike most kids his age, he didn't spend his days playing video games. Instead, he spent countless hours outside, trekking through the woods, climbing trees, and observing the wildlife that inhabited the property. His father, a former Marine sharpshooter, had passed on his knowledge and interest in firearms to his son. From the first time the lad held a rifle, he felt an overwhelming sense of power and responsibility, a connection to a legacy that had been passed down from generation to generation. As the years went by, the lad honed his skills and became quite the marksman himself. His confidence in his abilities grew exponentially, and he began challenging himself by setting targets at varying distances and attempting to hit them with accuracy and precision. He spent hours researching and studying the many technical aspects of rifle shooting, such as windage, elevation, and bullet trajectory. He applied those principles during his practice sessions, further perfecting his technique. The lad even went the extra mile of polishing and maintaining his rifle after each use, treating it with reverence and respect. Despite his love for rifles, the lad never felt comfortable with shotguns. He found the weapon too crude and unsophisticated, lacking the precision and elegance of a rifle. The kickback from a shotgun bruised his shoulder, and the spread of the shot pellets seemed uncontrollable and inefficient. He felt it lacked the finesse that came with rifle shooting. One day, while out practicing in the woods, the lad stumbled upon a hidden glen that appeared to be untouched by time. The dense forest opened up to reveal a clearing surrounded by ancient, towering oaks, and a small pond glittered in the sunlight, creating a magical atmosphere. The lad decided that this would be the perfect location to hone his skill and become one with nature. He set up a series of targets around the clearing, ranging from simple paper bullseyes to life-size silhouettes of game animals. With each practice session, he became more in tune with his rifle, his breath, and his surroundings. The voices of doubt and worry in his mind were silenced, and his shots found their mark every time. His dedication and passion for rifle shooting did not go unnoticed by the local hunting community. As he matured, the lad participated in numerous shooting competitions, earning top honors and garnering the respect of fellow marksmen. He became a role model for younger generations, as his father had been for him. The lad's prowess with a rifle opened doors to opportunities most could only dream of. He was invited to join elite hunting expeditions across the globe, and his marksmanship skills were sought out by law enforcement and military organizations alike for specialized training. Despite his growing renown, the lad never lost sight of the roots that not only instilled his love for rifle shooting but his deep connection to nature as well. In time, the lad chose to return home and take over his family's land, with a clear vision of preserving the natural landscape that had shaped him. The lad turned the property into a sanctuary for wildlife, dedicated to conservation and education. He developed programs that taught future generations about the importance of responsible hunting and the art of marksmanship, passing on his knowledge just as his father had done for him, ensuring the continuation of a cherished family legacy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question When there is a potential difference across the conductors (e.g., when a capacitor is attached across a battery), an electric field develops across the dielectric, causing positive charge +Q to collect on one plate and negative charge −Q to collect on the other plate. If a battery has been attached to a capacitor for a sufficient amount of time, no current can flow through the capacitor. However, if a time-varying voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor, a displacement current can flow. How do charges accumulate on each plate of a capacitor after an electric field has developed across the dielectric?","completion":"When a capacitor is connected to a voltage source such as a battery, charges accumulate on each plate of the capacitor due to the electric field developed across the dielectric. The process can be elaborated in the following steps: 1. Connecting the capacitor to the voltage source: When a capacitor is connected to a battery or any voltage source, a potential difference is created between its two plates, driving the electric field across the dielectric material. 2. Charge separation: In response to the potential difference, free electrons present on the negatively charged plate of the capacitor (connected to the negative terminal of the voltage source) will be repelled and start to move towards the positively charged plate (connected to the positive terminal of the voltage source). 3. Charge accumulation and polarization: As electrons begin to accumulate on the positively charged plate, it builds up a negative charge (-Q). Concurrently, the original positive charges on that plate get neutralized, and the plate loses electrons, which effectively leaves a positive charge (+Q) on the other plate. The dielectric material between the plates becomes polarized, creating dipoles, which align themselves in the direction of the electric field. The buildup of these charge layers on the plates creates what is known as \\"capacitance.\\" 4. Steady-state: Once the voltage across the capacitor equals the voltage provided by the battery, the movement of electrons comes to a halt, and no more current flows through the circuit. The capacitor is now fully charged, and the accumulated charges remain on the plates until the capacitor is disconnected from the voltage source. 5. Displacement current: When a time-varying voltage is applied across the capacitor, charges will continuously flow on and off the plates, creating a displacement current. This type of current does not require the movement of physical charge carriers, such as electrons, throughout the dielectric material but instead relies on the variation in electric field and polarization of the dielectric. In summary, after an electric field has developed across the dielectric, charges accumulate on each plate of a capacitor, following the process of charge separation, polarization, and establishing steady-state. The potential difference between the plates drives the movement of free electrons, resulting in charge accumulation and the buildup of a polarized dielectric layer, which ultimately determines the capacitor's ability to store energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Everything that goes in the HTML body displays on the web page. This is the tag to add a heading to your HTML document. A Heading is large bold text that typically goes at the top of your HTML document. This can be the title of your page or a greeting. This tag closes your heading. Add additional headings as you go. There are six different headings that you can create by using the <h1></h1> through <h6></h6> tags. These create headings of different sizes. For example, to create three different-sized headings in succession, you might write the following: <h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1> <h2>My name is Bob.</h2> <h3>I hope you like it here.</h3> The headings shows the priority or importance of the text. But its not necessary to use a higher heading if you want to use any lower heading. One can directly use H3, even if there is no H1 in your post. This is the tag to open a paragraph. Paragraph text is used to display normal sized text. This can be a description for your web page or any other information you wish to share. This the tag to close your paragraph text. The following is an example of paragraph text in HTML: <p>This is my paragraph.</p> You can add multiple paragraph lines in a row in order to create a series of paragraphs under one heading. You can change the color of any text by framing the text with the <font color=\\"color\\"> and </font> tags. Make sure to type your preferred color into the \\"color\\" section (you'll keep the quotes). You can turn any text (e.g., headers) into a different color with this set of tags. For example, to turn a paragraph's text blue, you would write the following code: <p><font color=\\"blue\\">Whales are majestic creatures.</font></p> You can add bolds, italics and other text formats using HTML. The following are examples of how you can format text using HTML tags: <b>Bold text</b> <i>Italic text</i> <u>Underlined text</u> <sub>Subscript text</sub> <sup>Superscript text</sup> If you use bold and italic text for emphasis, not just for styling, use the <strong> and <em> elements instead of <b> and <i>. This makes your web page easier to understand when using technologies like a screen reader or the reader mode provided in some browsers.","completion":"The given text primarily focuses on the basics of HTML tags, explaining their functions, and providing examples. The \`<body>\` tag is the main container that houses all the visible contents of an HTML document. Headings are crucial elements within a webpage, as they not only stylize the text but also semantically structure the information, aiding in accessibility. The \`<h1>\` through \`<h6>\` tags facilitate the creation of headings in six different sizes, with \`<h1>\` being the largest and \`<h6>\` being the smallest. For instance, the example provided demonstrates three headings using \`<h1>\`, \`<h2>\`, and \`<h3>\`. Even though the heading hierarchy establishes the precedence of text, one can directly use \`<h3>\` without necessarily including an \`<h1>\` tag first. In addition, the text describes how to use paragraph tags (\`<p>\` and \`</p>\`) to display normal-sized text, such as descriptions or other pieces of information. It's possible to create multiple paragraphs under one heading by inserting multiple paragraph lines consecutively. Moreover, HTML allows you to modify various text attributes such as color, boldness, and italics. To apply a color, use the \`<font>\` tag with the \\"color\\" attribute. Formatting can also be achieved using tags like \`<b>\`, \`<i>\`, and \`<u>\`. For emphasis, however, it's recommended to use semantic tags like \`<strong>\` and \`<em>\` instead of \`<b>\` and \`<i>\`, as these are more comprehensible for screen readers and reader mode functionalities in browsers.

Write an article based on this summary: Follow any heavy lifting policies your job has put in place. Use a moving dolly if you need to move large appliances. Lift heavy objects with a shoulder dolly if you’re with a partner. Use a forklift or hand jack if you’re lifting pallets. Article:","completion":"Title: Safe and Efficient Heavy Lifting Practices in the Workplace Introduction In a wide range of industries, tasks that involve heavy lifting make up a significant part of the daily work routine. From warehouses and construction sites to office moves and residential relocations, handling heavy objects properly is crucial for minimizing the risk of injury and ensuring that tasks are completed quickly and safely. In this article, we will discuss the importance of adhering to the heavy lifting policies implemented by your employer and guide you through various lifting techniques and tools, such as moving dollies, shoulder dollies, forklifts, and hand jacks, to help you perform your job efficiently and effectively. 1. Importance of Following Heavy Lifting Policies Employers establish and implement heavy lifting policies to maintain workplace safety, prevent accidents, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards and guidelines. Policies may encompass factors such as proper lifting techniques, tools and equipment, and weight limits, as well as training and supervision. Ignoring or neglecting these policies could result in accidents, equipment damage, or workplace injuries, with negative repercussions for the company, your career, and most importantly, your well-being. 2. Using a Moving Dolly for Large Appliances When it comes to moving large appliances, such as refrigerators and washing machines, using a moving dolly is the most effective and safe method. A moving dolly is a wheeled platform that securely holds and transports heavy objects with minimal effort while maintaining balance. This tool not only helps avoid injuries, such as back strains and muscle pulls, but also protects the appliance from damage during the move. When using a moving dolly, follow these basic steps: - Ensure the dolly is in proper working condition and can withstand the weight of the appliance - Secure the appliance to the dolly with straps or bungee cords, ensuring that the load remains stable during transport - Plan your path and clear any obstacles or obstructions from the way - Push the dolly carefully and steadily along the planned route, using your legs and core strength, while maintaining a proper posture to avoid back injuries 3. Lifting Heavy Objects with a Shoulder Dolly A shoulder dolly is a type of two-person lifting strap system that effectively distributes the weight of the heavy object between the users. This method requires a partner, but it is ideal for handling large items such as desks, tables, or couches while navigating through tight spaces. To use a shoulder dolly, follow these steps: - Properly position the shoulder straps on both users, adjusting them for comfort and stability - Shift the heavy object onto the lifting straps so that the weight is evenly distributed between you and your partner - Maintain clear communication with your partner and coordinate your movements to ensure that you are working together effectively - Bend and lift with your legs to avoid back strain, and keep your back straight throughout the entire process 4. Lifting Pallets with Forklifts or Hand Jacks In warehouse environments, lifting pallets loaded with heavy items is a common task. In this scenario, using a forklift or hand jack is essential for efficient and safe transport. Forklifts are powerful machines capable of lifting and transporting heavy loads over extended distances, while hand jacks are manually operated devices designed for lifting and moving pallets within a limited area. When using a forklift or hand jack, adhere to the following guidelines: - Ensure you are certified and trained in the operation of the specific lifting equipment - Regularly inspect and maintain the equipment to guarantee optimal performance and safety - Never exceed the weight capacity of the equipment - Always wear proper safety gear and use caution while operating the equipment - Be aware of your surroundings and other workers in the area to avoid accidents Conclusion Performing heavy lifting tasks safely and effectively is vital for your well-being and success in the workplace. By adhering to employer-established policies and making use of essential lifting techniques and tools, such as moving dollies, shoulder dollies, forklifts, and hand jacks, you can minimize the risk of injury and ensure efficient completion of your tasks. Prioritizing safety and efficiency in your heavy lifting operations benefits not just your health and career, but is also an essential factor in maintaining a secure and productive work environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What racist organization do we see on the rise in the second half of the film? Ku Klux Klan Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question - Racist organization: Ku Klux Klan (KKK) - Second half of the film - Movie plot Step 2: Develop a general idea for the movie plot General Plot Idea: The movie will follow the journey of a group of individuals who must band together to dismantle the resurging Ku Klux Klan in their town, while also addressing the underlying issues that have led to the group's resurgence. Step 3: Divide the movie plot into two halves First Half: Introduction of characters, setting, and initial conflict Second Half: Increase in KKK activities, focus on dismantling the organization Step 4: Flesh out the first half of the movie plot In a small Southern town, the residents are shocked to discover that the once-defeated Ku Klux Klan has reemerged. The first half of the film focuses on the impact of this news on the community, as well as the introduction of the main characters, who are all from different backgrounds and have differing opinions on how to confront this issue. We see the formation of a diverse group of individuals that come together to share their love for the arts and theater. Among them is James, a talented African-American playwright who wants to bring light to this issue through his stories, Sarah, a courageous social activist, and Thomas, a former member of the town council who knows some dark secrets about the Klan's past. Step 5: Flesh out the second half of the movie plot In the second half of the film, the KKK begins to escalate its hateful activities, causing fear and unrest among the townspeople. This forces our group of protagonists to put aside their differences and work closely to uncover the Klan's plans. As they dig deeper, they learn that the KKK's resurgence is a result of certain prominent figures in town, who have been secretly supporting the organization. Together, they must gather evidence against these individuals and bring them to justice, all while dealing with the personal costs that come with fighting against such a formidable enemy. Step 6: Create the resolution of the story Ultimately, the group succeeds in dismantling the KKK's presence in their town, but not without loss. Some choose to leave the town, while others decide to stay and continue working towards building a more inclusive and accepting community. The story ends on a hopeful note, with the characters looking forward to a future in which such organizations no longer have a place. Final Answer: In this movie plot, the second half of the film focuses on the emergence of the Ku Klux Klan as a reformed racist organization, which disrupts the lives of the townspeople and protagonists. The main characters must work together to dismantle the organization, reveal the hidden supporters behind it, and fight for a more inclusive town. Throughout their struggle, they confront their personal challenges and losses but ultimately succeed in stopping the KKK and making their community a better place to live."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Then she went into the kitchen and grabbed what she needed before going back up to her room quietly. She switched on the TV and started eating...and eating...for hours, until it was all gone. What Emily didn't know at the time was that she was suffering from an illness called binge-eating disorder(BED) . For years, Emily didn't tell anyone what she was doing. She felt ashamed, alone, and out of control. Why don't famous people confess to BED, as they do to _ ? It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \\"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California. \\"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \\"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper. Like most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own. Besides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help. And it might even make things worse, like it did for Carla, who's 15 now and is recovering from BED. \\"My parents would always tease me about my weight, so when I was 14, I went on a very restrictive diet,\\" she says. When you can't have something, you only want it more, so every time Carla would have a bite of something that wasn't allowed on her strict diet. She would quickly lose control and binge . Question: What can we learn from Carla's story? Options: A: BED is an incurable disease. B: BED has something to do with genes. C: Going on a diet won't help BED patients. D: BED patients should pay attention to their food. The answer to this question is:","completion":"C: Going on a diet won't help BED patients."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - Coal is put in a coal-fired steam station - Water is put in pipes in the coal-fired steam station - The coal is crushed - The coal is moved into a boiler along with hot air - The water is moving through pipes in the boiler - The steam from the water is blown against a turning mechanism - The force of the steam makes the mechanism turn - The mechanism generates electricity. Question: suppose less satellites packed into a capsule happens, how will it affect LESS electricity being produced. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The process described is for the generation of electricity through a coal-fired steam station. The scenario presented supposes that there are fewer satellites packed into a capsule, and the question asks how this will affect the production of less electricity and the perturbation's influence on the second mentioned effect. There is no direct relationship between the number of satellites packed into a capsule and the electricity produced by a coal-fired steam station. Satellites are used for various purposes, such as communication, weather monitoring, and navigation. They do not play a direct role in the production of electricity through coal-fired steam stations. With fewer satellites packed into a capsule, the only potential impact on the coal-fired steam station could be in terms of data transmission and monitoring. Utilities use communication and monitoring systems to operate their power plants, which may require satellite communications. However, this would not significantly impact the amount of electricity produced by the coal-fired steam station. In summary, fewer satellites packed into a capsule would likely have no effect on the amount of electricity produced by a coal-fired steam station. The perturbation in this scenario does not have a direct influence on the second effect mentioned, i.e., the force of the steam making the mechanism turn and generating electricity. The coal-fired steam station would continue to produce electricity as long as it has access to coal and water as input resources, and the operational mechanisms remain efficient and functional."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Ask Annie - Are Moms Less Likely to Be Hired? - FORTUNE Dear Annie: I am a 35-year-old woman CPA with extensive experience in finance and accounting. Now that the job market in my field seems to have picked up, I've been looking around for a better job, and I'm noticing something that keeps happening over and over again. In job interviews, everything will be going along fine until I happen to mention that I have two children (ages eight and six). At that point, the interviewer seems to lose interest, or his or her interest turns from avid to merely polite. My friends tell me I'm just imagining it, but I don't think so. Your opinion, please? Proud but Puzzled Mom Dear Puzzled: You wouldn't believe (or then again, maybe you would) how many women have written to me with this same observation over the past few years. Just last month, for instance, an unemployed marketing manager wrote: \\"As soon as I let slip that I have little kids, it's as if I had the plague. Job interviewers don't run screaming from the room, but they do find an excuse to wrap up the interview fast.\\" Of course, no employer is going to admit to preferring job applicants who are childless, and human-resources people who I've asked about this pooh-poohed the whole idea. Executive coaches could offer only the odd anecdote to support the notion that women with children have a harder time getting hired. Now, however, comes evidence that what you're experiencing may be a widespread phenomenon. At an American Sociological Society meeting in Philadelphia in August, two Cornell University sociologists, Shelley J. Correll and Stephen Benard, presented a paper called \\"Getting a Job: Is There a Motherhood Penalty?\\" It's based on research showing that not only are moms less likely to get hired than men (with or without kids) or childless women, but also that they're likely to be paid less. Correll, an associate professor of sociology, and Benard, a graduate student, conducted an experiment wherein 84 men and 108 women Cornell undergraduates were asked to evaluate several female candidates for the same mid-level management position. All of the hypothetical applicants were equally qualified, with strong success in their previous jobs. The only difference: Some candidates' profiles noted in passing that they had children and were active in parent-teacher associations, while the other candidates' profiles said nothing about children. The result: The student evaluators said they would hire 84% of the women without children, but only 47% of the mothers. (In case you're wondering, the female evaluators were no more kindly disposed toward the moms than were their male peers.) What's more, the gap in starting pay between mothers and childless women averaged 11,000. \\"In fact, the more children a mother was described as having, the lower the salary that the test subjects said they would offer,\\" notes Correll. \\"Other studies have shown that the reverse is true for men. The more children they have, the higher the salary offers they receive.\\" What's going on here? \\"We're not saying that employers discriminate against mothers because they don't like them,\\" Correll says. \\"Motherhood is a role held in very high esteem in our society. However, whether we realize it, consciously or not, our cultural ideal of motherhood is that of a mother who will devote herself first and foremost to her kids, 24/7 if necessary. So, to many people, motherhood and a careerespecially in a company that also demands 24/7 of its employeesare seen as just not compatible. Fatherhood, on the other hand, presents no such dilemma, since traditionally fathers have been less involved with raising kids and more expected to be primary breadwinners.\\" Ah. In light of the fact that, according to the Census Bureau, 72% of American women have children, these lingering biases against hiring mothers and paying them equally could go a long way toward explaining the persistent wage gap between men and women overall. That's particularly so since, other Census Bureau figures show, the gap is narrowest when women are in their 20s, that is, when many have not yet had kids. In 2004, for example, college-educated women in their 40s who were working full time earned, on average, 38% less than their male counterparts. Between men and women in their 20s, the gap was much less, at an average of 25%. What, if anything, can moms do about this? \\"Not mentioning that you have children, or trying to hide the fact, is obviously a limited strategy,\\" notes Correll. \\"We're doing another study now to try and determine whether companies with 'family-friendly' and 'work-life balance' policies are less likely to discriminate against mothers than employers that don't have such policies. But in the meantime, what I hear is the advice that mothers give each other.\\" Such as? \\"Well, one I've heard over and over again is, if you have to take a day off to care for a sick child, don't tell anyone the child is sick. When you call in to the office, say that you are the one who's sick.\\" She adds: \\"Either way, you're missing a day of work, so why does it matter? But it does.\\" Folks, I don't know about you, but I find this appalling. I'm bracing myself for a barrage of comments on this subject, from all conceivable points of view, so...bring 'em on! Summary:","completion":"A 35-year-old woman CPA with extensive experience in finance and accounting has noticed a pattern in job interviews where interviewers lose interest upon discovering she has children. She is not alone in this observation, as many women have faced similar experiences in the job market. Research conducted by Cornell University sociologists Shelley J. Correll and Stephen Benard found that mothers were less likely to be hired than fathers or childless individuals and would be offered lower salaries. The study hypothesized that this could be due to cultural expectations that mothers prioritize their children over work, while fathers are seen as the primary breadwinners with less involvement in childcare. This bias against hiring mothers and paying them equally may contribute to the persistent wage gap between men and women."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: About 97% of the world's water is salty and is found in our oceans and seas. But, as we can't drink seawater, how can it be important? Every part of our seas and oceans contains an amazing number of animals and fish that live at different ocean depths. Most of the different species of animals and fish depend on simple plants for their food. These simple plants called algae drift near the surface of the ocean and use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into food and oxygen. In fact, algae produce over half of the oxygen people breathe. How important seawater is! Each plant or animal in our seas and oceans is an important link in a food chain. The algae are eaten in large amounts by microscopic animals, which are in turn consumed by larger animals. These food chains are delicately balanced. The bad news about the food chains in the oceans is that they are under threat because of man. People once thought that the oceans were so big that it didn't matter if we dumped rubbish into them or caught huge quantities of fish and whales for food. But we now know this is not true and fish stocks in the oceans have started to drop. Thankfully, the world is taking steps to protect the future of our oceans by introducing international agreements to protect marine habitats. Most countries have introduced fishing restrictions to protect fish stocks in the oceans and new techniques are being pioneered to cope with pollution. Finally, the importance of protecting oceans is being made known to more people. This is just the beginning of a long process to protect the oceans for our future. We depend on the oceans for fish which are an important part of the human diet. How important seawater is!

Step 3: The discovery Just before the performance, Sarah Miller discovers a mysterious letter addressed to the orchestra. It states that a bomb has been hidden within the Walt Disney Concert Hall, set to detonate at the exact moment of the concluding performance - the last note of Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy.\\" Panicked, she brings the letter to the attention of the authorities. Step 4: Introduction of Jake Thompson Jake Thompson is called in to lead the bomb squad in locating and defusing the bomb in time. He meets Sarah, who insists on helping him with the investigation due to her knowledge of the building and strong belief in the power of music, which she thinks the bomber is perverting. Step 5: The investigation begins As the concert approaches, Jake and Sarah begin methodically searching and piecing together clues to the bomb's location. Meanwhile, they begin to grow closer, and we learn more about Jake's past: the tragedy of losing his wife to a bombing incident, leaving him with emotional scars that make dives into the world of bomb defusal and riskier decisions.

Answer the following question: Two women have just undergone different types of mutations without them being aware of it. Kim has just had a mutation in the DNA of her sex cells. Holly has had a mutation in her body cells. Both mutations would be able to be discovered if they happen to go to a doctor, and the doctor knows to look for it, but that is unlikely since the women are unaware these changes happened. Which person's mutation can be passed on to their offspring? Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Write a summary based on this article: MUMBAI | MUMBAI (Reuters) - Aspiring Bollywood actor Suraj Pancholi left prison on bail on Monday three weeks after being arrested over a possible role in the suicide of his actress girlfriend Jiah Khan. Pancholi, 22, the son of Bollywood acting couple Aditya Pancholi and Zarina Wahab, was released after a Mumbai court set bail at 50,000 rupees (around 845). \\"He has been let out on bail today. He had to pay 50,000 rupees,\\" Pancholi's lawyer Zamir Khan told Reuters by telephone. Investigators had requested the court for more time to question him about Jiah Khan's death on June 3. Her last call was to Pancholi. Pancholi was arrested on June 10 after Khan's mother Rabia went public with a letter apparently written by the 25-year-old actress before she hanged herself in her Mumbai apartment. In the letter widely published in the media, Khan spoke of being physically and emotionally abused and of having an abortion against her will although she did not mention any names. Police have yet to file any charges against Pancholi. Suicide is a crime in India and abetting suicide is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Khan, whose real name was Nafisa Khan, made her Bollywood debut in 2007 with Ram Gopal Varma's \\"Nishabd\\", playing the 18-year-old female lead opposite Amitabh Bachchan. \\"Nishabd\\" received mixed reviews and did not do well at the Bollywood box office but Khan went on to play supporting roles in two more films, the psychological thriller \\"Ghajini\\" in 2008 and the comedy \\"Housefull\\" in 2010. (Editing by Tony Tharakan and Paul Casciato) ||||| NEW DELHI – Bollywood starlet Jiah Khan's death on June 3 led to the arrest of her boyfriend, Suraj Pancholi, under suspicion that he abetted her suicide. The 22-year-old aspiring actor -- the son of veteran actors Aditya Pancholi and Zarina Wahab -- was reportedly named in a suicide note believed to be written by the 25-year-old Khan. But the Bombay High Court granted Pancholi bail Monday, observing in its verdict: “No doubt that it was an unfortunate incident that a young girl has committed suicide. She [Khan] must have been impulsive and he [Pancholi] cannot be held solely responsible for it.” PHOTOS: Indian Talent Going Global Pancholi -- who filed his bail application on June 26 -- was granted bail on a 862 (50,000-rupee) bond and instructed to surrender his passport. He was told to report to the police every alternate day. The court also observed that a letter purportedly written by the actress and recovered from her house could not be taken as a suicide note, as it was not addressed to anyone and was not dated. “The question is if the script recovered from the deceased's house is addressed to the applicant [Pancholi], or is it just extracts from her diary? Whether it can be called a suicide note at all? When there is no date on it can it be linked to the day she committed suicide?...Therefore it cannot be said that the emotions expressed in the letter ever reached the applicant,” said the judgement. The letter in question was found in Khan's bedroom by her mother and sister a few days after she hung herself from a ceiling fan on June 3. In the letter, Khan mentioned how she was “mentally harassed” by Pancholi and how she had also undergone an abortion. In his bail plea, Pancholi stated that he and Khan were in a “consensual relationship” and that the letter was being misused by her mother, Rabia Khan. STORY: Bollywood Actress Jiah Khan Dies at 25 Observing that Pancholi never nurtured an intent to push the girl to commit suicide, the court stated, “She was in the relationship on her own volition. It all depends on the pscyhe of the person. It cannot be ignored that Jiah had suicidal tendencies. Earlier also she had attempted suicide, and it was the applicant [Pancholi] who took care of her.” The court added that the deceased's mother was not aware of this incident. “It also appears that on the day of the incident there was some misunderstanding between the deceased and applicant due to which [Khan] was in a rage of fury,” the court stated further. Khan was born in New York but moved back to India to pursue a career as an actress. She made her Bollywood debut in 2007, starring opposite Amitabh Bachchan in the film Nishabd, which was loosely based on Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita and generated controversy at the time. She also appeared in Ghajini with Aamir Khan. Her last role was in Housefull (2010) opposite Akshay Kumar. |||||","completion":"Aspiring Bollywood actor Suraj Pancholi was released on bail after being arrested for his possible involvement in the suicide of his girlfriend, actress Jiah Khan.

Who developed the live attenuated polio vaccine which has led to hopes of global eradication of the virus?","completion":"The live attenuated polio vaccine, also known as the oral polio vaccine (OPV), was developed by Dr. Albert Bruce Sabin, an American medical researcher, virologist, and physician. His efforts and discoveries concerning the polio vaccine played a significant role in moving the world closer to global eradication of the poliovirus. Dr. Albert Sabin was born in Bialystok, Poland, on August 26, 1906, and later immigrated to the United States with his family when he was a child. He pursued a medical degree and graduated from New York University College of Medicine in 1931. His interest in infectious diseases led him to focus on poliovirus research, which was a considerable public health concern in his time. Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. It primarily affects children and can lead to paralysis and even death. During the first half of the 20th century, polio outbreaks caused widespread panic in the United States and numerous other countries. In response, the scientific community directed significant resources towards developing a vaccine to combat the disease. Two major polio vaccines have contributed to the global decline of polio cases. The first one was developed by Dr. Jonas Salk, who introduced the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in 1955. This vaccine uses a 'killed' version of the virus and is injected into the patient, providing immunity without causing disease. However, the vaccine by Dr. Salk had limitations, as it required multiple injections and boosters to maintain long-term immunity. Dr. Albert Sabin addressed these limitations with the development of the oral polio vaccine. Introduced in the early 1960s, this live attenuated vaccine contains weakened (non-pathogenic) forms of the virus. When administered orally, the vaccine mimics a natural infection, offering individuals long-lasting immunity without the risk of severe side effects. Moreover, the vaccine can be easily administered, and its affordability made it ideal for widespread immunization campaigns. The implementation of worldwide vaccination campaigns using the oral polio vaccine has contributed significantly to the dramatic decrease in polio cases. According to the World Health Organization, the number of cases has declined by more than 99 percent since 1988. Today, while the global eradication remains an ongoing effort, the progress achieved is largely attributed to the groundbreaking work of researchers like Dr. Albert Sabin and his live attenuated polio vaccine."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this \\"Pakistan's Supreme Court has lifted a travel ban on former President Pervez Musharraf who is awaiting trial for treason and other charges.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Pakistan's Supreme Court Lifts Travel Ban on Ex-President Pervez Musharraf Amid Treason Trial In a groundbreaking decision, Pakistan's Supreme Court has lifted the travel ban imposed on its former President, General Pervez Musharraf, Monday. This decision has been long-awaited, as Musharraf faces multiple trials, including one for high treason and several others for charges like murder and abductions. His lawyers argue that this decision will facilitate medicinal treatments for the ailing former president, whose health has deteriorated over recent years. Pervez Musharraf, who was the country's president from 2001 to 2008, has faced various criminal cases based on charges such as his imposition of an unconstitutional emergency rule in 2007, assassinating in December 2007 former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who Musharraf is accused of failing to protect, and the 'Lal Masjid Mosque' operation against Islamic militants, which resulted in over 100 deaths of suspected insurgents, in addition to innocent civilians in 2006. The former president left Pakistan in March 2016, following a travel ban removal granted on medical grounds, but considering the present circumstances and the status of his health, the possibility of return seemed extremely uncertain. The recent Supreme Court ruling has stirred controversy amongst Pakistanis and raised questions regarding its political implications. As the country prepares for parliamentary elections scheduled later this year, the decision's timing has proven worrisome for some, who suspect the possibility of a coordinated political move designed to influence the upcoming elections. However, others see this as a sign of the judiciary's independence and transparency, maintaining that the decision is a clear vindication of the allegations against the former president. Moreover, this verdict has also sparked debates amongst legal experts and political analysts about its potential impact on Musharraf's ongoing trials. Some argue that the Supreme Court's decision might not guarantee his return to Pakistan. Given his health situation, it is unclear whether Musharraf will come back to face the numerous charges leveled against him. In contrast, others think it could translate into a revival of Musharraf's political career. Laying the groundwork for his return could enable the former military ruler to actively participate in the upcoming general elections and use his connections, experience, and influence to garner support in a bid to re-enter the political landscape. Nonetheless, to some, it seems that the case involving the former President of Pakistan is emblematic of the broader issues that the country faces with regard to the intersection of politics, law, and military power. Observers predict that the ultimate trajectory of Musharraf's trials will serve as a litmus test for the judiciary's efficacy, independence, and integrity in a nation where political and security issues are frequently intertwined. In conclusion, the lifting of the travel ban on former President Pervez Musharraf by Pakistan's Supreme Court will not just govern his personal decisions and future but also significantly influence the political climate of the country. As unforeseen circumstances continue to unfold, a balance between maintaining the judiciary's independence and ensuring its accountability has become essential to solidifying Pakistan's democratic foundations. Whether someone views this recent development as an opportunity for the nation to demonstrate commitment to the rule of law or an attempt to meddle in the upcoming elections, it undoubtedly has repercussions that extend far beyond the former president's situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: get drunk, meet new people, drinking beer, enjoy yourself, having sex Why is \\"having sex\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"\\"Having sex\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because attending parties is frequently associated with socializing, building connections, and engaging in various types of interactions with others, including romantic and sexual encounters. While it is not guaranteed that going to a party with the opposite sex will lead to a sexual experience, it is a possibility that some people might consider, making it a plausible answer from a human perspective. Parties offer an environment where individuals can feel more at ease in expressing themselves and initiating conversations with people they find attractive, including members of the opposite sex. Alcohol consumption, often a part of such gatherings, can further lower people's inhibitions and increase the likelihood of flirtatious or intimate behavior.

Context: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff. But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said. Warner’s committee is also investigating possible... Question: Generally, how long does individual testimony before a congressional committee usually last? Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Individual testimony before a congressional committee can vary significantly in length depending on the nature of the hearing, the topic being discussed, the number of witnesses providing testimony, and the complexity of the issues being addressed. In some cases, testimonies can be relatively brief, lasting only a few hours, whereas in other cases, they can extend over several days or even weeks. Several factors can influence the duration of individual testimony, including: 1. The nature of the hearing: Hearings can be categorized as legislative, oversight, and investigative hearings. Legislative hearings are held for discussing proposed legislation and typically involve testimonies from experts, stakeholders, and interest groups. Oversight hearings review the effectiveness of existing laws and government programs. Investigative hearings are focused on gathering information regarding specific incidents or possible wrongdoings. Depending on the complexity of the subject matter, testimonies in these hearings can vary in length. 2. The topic being discussed: Some hearings deal with simple issues that can be addressed within a few hours, while others are more complex and require extensive testimonies and questioning. The length of testimony depends on how much information is needed to effectively address the topic at hand. 3. The number of witnesses providing testimony: If a hearing involves multiple witnesses, individual testimonies might be shorter to accommodate everyone's testimony within the designated time frame. Conversely, when there are fewer witnesses, individual testimonies might be more in-depth and longer. 4. The complexity of the issues being addressed: Some hearings deal with highly controversial or intricate topics that require witnesses to provide detailed explanations and extensive evidence. In such cases, individual testimonies may last several hours or even days. 5. The extent of questioning: The duration of individual testimony largely depends on how long it takes committee members to ask their questions and for the witness to provide satisfactory answers. If the questioning process is thorough and intense, testimonies may take longer than when questions are simple and straightforward. Overall, the length of individual testimony before a congressional committee can vary greatly, with factors such as the nature of the hearing, the topic, the number of witnesses, the complexity of the issues, and the rigor of questioning all contributing to the overall duration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question The sky is usually clear above the desert and the sunshine duration is extremely high everywhere in the Sahara. Most of the desert enjoys more than 3,600 h of bright sunshine annually or over 82% of the time and a wide area in the eastern part experiences in excess of 4,000 h of bright sunshine a year or over 91% of the time, and the highest values are very close to the theoretical maximum value. A value of 4,300 h or 98% of the time would be recorded in Upper Egypt (Aswan, Luxor) and in the Nubian Desert (Wadi Halfa). The annual average direct solar irradiation is around 2,800 kWh/(m2 year) in the Great Desert. The Sahara has a huge potential for solar energy production. The constantly high position of the sun, the extremely low relative humidity, the lack of vegetation and rainfall make the Great Desert the hottest continuously large area worldwide and certainly the hottest place on Earth during summertime in some spots. The average high temperature exceeds 38 °C (100.4 °F) - 40 °C (104 °F) during the hottest month nearly everywhere in the desert except at very high mountainous areas. The highest officially recorded average high temperature was 47 °C (116.6 °F) in a remote desert town in the Algerian Desert called Bou Bernous with an elevation of 378 meters above sea level. It's the world's highest recorded average high temperature and only Death Valley, California rivals it. Other hot spots in Algeria such as Adrar, Timimoun, In Salah, Ouallene, Aoulef, Reggane with an elevation between 200 and 400 meters above sea level get slightly lower summer average highs around 46 °C (114.8 °F) during the hottest months of the year. Salah, well known in Algeria for its extreme heat, has an average high temperature of 43.8 °C (110.8 °F), 46.4 °C (115.5 °F), 45.5 (113.9 °F). Furthermore, 41.9 °C (107.4 °F) in June, July, August and September. In fact, there are even hotter spots in the Sahara, but they are located in extremely remote areas, especially in the Azalai, lying in northern Mali. The major part of the desert experiences around 3 – 5 months when the average high strictly exceeds 40 °C (104 °F). The southern central part of the desert experiences up to 6 – 7 months when the average high temperature strictly exceeds 40 °C (104 °F) which shows the constancy and the length of the really hot season in the Sahara. Some examples of this are Bilma, Niger and Faya-Largeau, Chad. The annual average daily temperature exceeds 20 °C (68 °F) everywhere and can approach 30 °C (86 °F) in the hottest regions year-round. However, most of the desert has a value in excess of 25 °C (77 °F). The sand and ground temperatures are even more extreme. During daytime, the sand temperature is extremely high as it can easily reach 80 °C (176 °F) or more. A sand temperature of 83.5 °C (182.3 °F) has been recorded in Port Sudan. Ground temperatures of 72 °C (161.6 °F) have been recorded in the Adrar of Mauritania and a value of 75 °C (167 °F) has been measured in Borkou, northern Chad. Due to lack of cloud cover and very low humidity, the desert usually features high diurnal temperature variations between days and nights. However, it's a myth that the nights are cold after extremely hot days in the Sahara. The average diurnal temperature range is typically between 13 °C (55.4 °F) and 20 °C (68 °F). The lowest values are found along the coastal regions due to high humidity and are often even lower than 10 °C (50 °F), while the highest values are found in inland desert areas where the humidity is the lowest, mainly in the southern Sahara. Still, it's true that winter nights can be cold as it can drop to the freezing point and even below, especially in high-elevation areas. What is the annual average direct solar irradiation?","completion":"The annual average direct solar irradiation in the Sahara desert is around 2,800 kWh/(m2 year), according to the text. To come to this conclusion, scanning the text for the specific phrase \\"annual average direct solar irradiation\\" led me straight to the answer without having to infer from other data or statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it true that is a heat engine and heat pump the same thing based on the following text? A domestic refrigerator is an example of a heat pump: a heat engine in reverse. Work is used to create a heat differential. Many cycles can run in reverse to move heat from the cold side to the hot side, making the cold side cooler and the hot side hotter. Internal combustion engine versions of these cycles are, by their nature, not reversible.","completion":"To determine if a heat engine and a heat pump are the same thing based on the provided text, let's analyze the information in the text step-by-step. 1. The text offers a domestic refrigerator as an example of a heat pump. 2. The text states that a heat pump is a \\"heat engine in reverse.\\" 3. It explains that work is used to create a heat differential in a heat pump. 4. Many cycles can run in reverse to move heat from the cold side to the hot side, making the cold side cooler and the hot side hotter. 5. Internal combustion engine versions of these cycles are not reversible, which implies that not all heat engines can function as heat pumps. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that a heat engine and a heat pump are not the same thing. A heat pump can be considered as a heat engine in reverse, meaning that while they both involve heat transfer processes, the direction of heat flow is opposite in each case. A heat engine converts heat energy into work, while a heat pump uses work to transfer heat from a lower temperature reservoir to a higher temperature reservoir. Additionally, not all heat engines are reversible, which means they cannot function as heat pumps."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis.

Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \\"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \\"Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted.\\" Question: \\"Who was critical of Malaysia's response?\\" Answer: \\"Malaysian military officials\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer to the question \\"Who was critical of Malaysia's response?\\" is incorrect.

Answer based on context: Following the death of General Advisor in Foreign Affairs Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns in 1902, Phya Suriyanuwat, the Siamese Minister in Paris, was instructed to find a replacement. Phya Suriya was unable to find a suitable candidate in Europe, and notified Phya Akaraj Varathon, the Siamese Minister in Washington, that under the circumstances, he had decided to engage an American. In 1903, former US diplomat Edward Henry Strobel took a leave of absence from his position as the Bemis Professor of International Law at Harvard School of Law to represent the Kingdom of Siam in The Hague at the International Peace Court—which Rolin-Jaequemyns had been instrumental in founding. In 1906, Strobel moved to Bangkok to take the position of general advisor, where he died January 15, 1908. Among his successors were Jens Westengard, 1909-14, Wolcott Pitkin, 1915-17, Eldon James, and Francis B. Sayre—all but for Pitkin former Harvard law professors. \\"The Siamese government trusted the American Adviser in Foreign Affairs to act in the best interests of Siam. Authority and responsibility were delegated to him. He was permitted a considerable degree of freedom in his work. It was in his capacity as a lawyer, a jurist, an advocate, and a policy counselor that the American adviser contributed significantly to the successful conclusion of the treaty negotiations with the West.\\" An agreement on relations between the two countries was signed in Washington D.C. on December 16, 1920. What happened first: Strobel moved to Bangkok or an agreement between America and Siam?","completion":"Okay, little buddy! Imagine a timeline of events, like steps in a fun story. First, Mr. Strobel moved to Bangkok (that's a big city in a place called Siam). That happened in 1906. Then, after some time, America and Siam became friends and signed an agreement. This happened on December 16, 1920. So, Mr. Strobel moved to Bangkok before the agreement between America and Siam."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what typically travels long distances?\\" is \\"humans\\", given that birds typically travel long distances? Available choices: A. Yes. B. No. A:","completion":"B. No. While it is true that humans do travel long distances, the prompt specifically mentions that birds typically travel long distances as well. In this context, it is essential to assess the question based on the information provided, which makes a clear association with another species known for long-distance traveling: birds. Birds are known to travel extensive distances, particularly during migration periods. For certain species, this behavior is essential to their survival as they move in search of better environmental conditions, food, and opportunities for reproduction. This process enables birds to adapt to the changing climate and seasonal patterns. Some birds, known for their extraordinary migrating abilities, include the Arctic tern, bar-tailed godwit, and the sooty shearwater. In particular, Arctic terns are known to cover about 25,000 miles on their annual migratory journey from the Arctic to Antarctica and then back again. Humans, on the other hand, also travel long distances for various reasons, such as trade, exploration, work, leisure, and personal relationships. With the advent of technological advancements and globalization, travel among human beings has become relatively easier and more accessible. Nevertheless, our evolutionary and historical reasons for traveling cannot be directly compared to the seasonal migration patterns of birds that cover vast distances primarily as a response to environmental and survival needs. In light of this information, it is clear that within the context of the question, the more accurate answer would not be \\"humans\\" but rather would be an acknowledgment of the long-distance traveling nature of birds."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I hope Ken Mehlman doesn’t eat mine.” See, because Mehlman’s gay. Unlike Maron, who is not gay. You know he’s not gay, right? Not that it would be bad if he was gay, but he’s not gay. Whereas Mehlman is totally gay. Congratulations to Marc Maron for being very funny! And not gay! ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The article is about a comedian named Marc Maron who made fun of a man named Ken Mehlman on an airplane.

Title: Great Album, Similar Import Available Review: I don't know why this album has not been mass-released on CD. I have it on an old LP and listen to it and enjoy it frequently, as Hazlewood's music is catchy and the way he and Sinatra's voices work together is magic. Recently, while surfing on eBay, I came across an import CD release which has 9 of the 11 songs from 'Nancy & Lee\\" plus another 11 that Nancy did solo, and even one with Frank \\"Something Stupid\\". This CD ran about 6.95 and is digitally remastered and plays great. It's listed simply as Nancy Sinatra Greatest Hits or something close to that. I agree that paying over 100 for a CD is crazy when you can get an import for 6.95 or download the songs off itunes for a buck apiece. So why doesn't whoever owns Reprise Records realize they are losing some serious money by not re-releasing this great record. In the meantime, eBay's cheaper import, though not quite the same (check the song list), or itunes, are great backups. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","completion":"The product review conveys a primarily positive sentiment. The reviewer appreciates the album and enjoys listening to it frequently, describing Hazlewood's music as catchy and the combination of voices as magical. They also provide some alternative options for fans to consider, like the import CD release for a lower cost or downloading the songs from iTunes, which they find as great backups. However, there is a slight negative sentiment expressed by the reviewer towards the lack of mass-release, the high price of the original CD, and the fact that Reprise Records is missing out on potential profits. Overall, the positive sentiment dominates the review, highlighting the album's value and offering practical alternatives for obtaining the music."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts.

Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying. Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment. To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment. In which case the Bt toxin does not need to be digested by the insects, case A or case B? Answer:","completion":"In Case A, where transgenic crops have been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, the toxin does not need to be digested by the insects.

Here is an article: Motivated by love and loneliness, Annia Hatch knew she had to find a way to keep in touch with the handsome American coach she had met at the 1996 gymnastics world championships. Back then, she lived in her native Cuba and communication with the outside world was a challenge. She had no phone. So Hatch, who was Annia Portuondo then, trudged to her neighbor's house and smiled her sweet, delicate smile, persuading her to let her receive phone calls from her newfound friend. When Alan Hatch called, the neighbor fetched Annia, and Cuba's best gymnast came running. ''It was very hard because it took a lot of effort to keep the relationship going,'' said Annia Hatch, who competed in the preliminaries of the United States Olympic trials Friday. ''Yes, it was inconvenient, but we made it work. It was worth it.'' Hatch, a seven-time Cuban national champion and this year's United States vault champion, has been married to her former phone friend for nearly seven years, showing that her persistence paid off. Finding ways to overcome obstacles, small or large, has been a lifelong theme for Hatch. Most recently, Hatch has persevered through a potentially career-ending injury, working her way back into competition only 10 months after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus in her left knee. Hatch, America's best female vaulter, is competing in the trials in Anaheim, where she injured her knee while practicing a vault a day before the world championships. Hatch finished Friday's preliminaries with the top score in the vault, a 9.7. ''It has been her dream to compete for her adopted country and she wasn't going to miss that for anything,'' said Alan Hatch, 42, who was born in Manhattan and now lives in West Haven, Conn., where he coaches his wife and owns Stars Academy gymnastics center. Doctors said it would take Annia Hatch four to six months to begin training again, but after two months, she was walking and doing simple jumps. After four months, she was on the balance beam and tumbling. ''I want to prove to people that nothing can stop me from doing what I want to do,'' she said. At 26, Hatch is the oldest woman competing at the trials. Most of her competitors, like the national co-champion Carly Patterson, are a decade younger. While many of the women trying to make the Olympic team have missed out on the regular events of teenage life, like proms and parties, Hatch was deprived of much more. From ages 8 to 17, she saw her parents only on weekends because she trained with the national team in Havana. In 1996, she won a bronze medal in the vault at the world championships, Cuba's first international gymnastics medal, but she said the Cuban government ''lost her paperwork'' for the Olympics, so she could not compete in the 1996 Atlanta Games. She retired the next year. Soon after, she married, moved to Connecticut, learned English and began coaching with her husband. Five years later, a stop on the Internet rekindled her passion for competition. It was 2001, the year she became an American citizen. One night, when Alan Hatch was surfing the Internet, he saw a story about one of Annia's former Cuban teammates making a comeback at 22 after having a child. The next day, she was in the gym, training. Problems arose after a quick rise to the elite level. The Cuban government would not release her to compete for the United States, saying she had not fulfilled the contract she signed when she was 12. So, according to international gymnastics rules, Hatch had to wait a year to compete for her adopted country. After going through that diplomatic distress, Hatch says she is afraid to visit her family in Cuba, fearing that the government will not let her leave. But she still keeps in touch with family members through weekly phone calls. ''It's easier than it was before,'' she said, smiling. ''They have a phone now.'' Courtney Kupets, who shared the national all-around title with Carly Patterson, was in the lead after Friday's preliminaries. Courtney McCool was second. The finals are Sunday.

Article: Walking down a path through some woods in Georgia, I saw a small pool of water ahead on the path. I angled my direction to go around it on the part of the path that wasn't covered by water or mud. As I reached the pool, I was suddenly attacked! Yet I did nothing for the attack. It was so unpredictable and from somewhere totally unexpected. I was surprised as well as unhurt though I had been struck four or five times. I backed up a foot and my attacker stopped attacking me. Had I been hurt I wouldn't have found it amusing. And I was laughing. After all, I was being attacked by a butterfly! Having stopped, laughing, I took a step forward. My attacker rushed me again. He charged towards me at full speed, attempting to hurt me but in vain. For a second time, I took a step backwards while my attacker paused. I wasn't sure what to do. After all, it's just not everyday that one is attacked by a butterfly. I stepped back to look the situation over. My attacker moved back to land on the ground. That's when I discovered why my attacker was charging me only moments earlier. He had a mate and she was dying. Sitting close beside her, he opened and closed his wings as if to fan her. I could only admire the love and courage of that butterfly in his concern for his mate. He had taken it up on himself to attack me for his mate's sake , even though she was clearly dying and I was so large. He did so just to give her those extra few precious moments of life, should I have been careless enough to step on her. His courage in attacking something thousands of times larger and heavier than himself just for his mate's safety seemed admirable. I couldn't do anything other than reward him by walking on the more difficult side of the pool. He had truly earned those moments to be with her, undisturbed. Since then, I've always tried to remember the courage of that butterfly whenever I see huge barriers facing me. Question: Which of the following words can best describe the butterfly? Options: A: Careless. B: Amusing. C: Courageous. D: Aggressive. Answer:","completion":"C: Courageous. The article recounts the fascinating behavior of a butterfly that fiercely defended its dying mate from the approaching author.

This unusual behavior showcases the butterfly's courage in putting its own safety aside to protect its mate. While the event initially appeared amusing to the author due to the sheer disparity in size and power between them, the butterfly's intentions became clearer once they realized the dying mate's presence. The butterfly's relentless and brave actions in the face of overwhelming odds make \\"courageous\\" the most fitting description among the given options. \\"Careless\\" is an inappropriate description, as the butterfly was, in fact, being very vigilant in guarding its mate. \\"Amusing\\" could describe the author's initial perception but does not accurately characterize the butterfly's behavior as a whole. \\"Aggressive\\" may seem to capture the butterfly's determination in attacking the author, but it does not do justice to the nobler motivation behind the butterfly's actions, which was ultimately rooted in love and bravery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"A thick agony tore into their skulls.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The agony of defeat tore into their skulls.\\" is true?","completion":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"The agony of defeat tore into their skulls.\\" is true, based on the premise \\"A thick agony tore into their skulls.\\", we need to evaluate and compare the information contained within both statements. Let's break down the two statements and analyze their components. Premise: \\"A thick agony tore into their skulls.\\" In this statement, we are given the following information: 1. There is a sensation of agony being experienced. 2. The agony is described as \\"thick,\\" which might imply it is severe, intense, or overwhelming. 3. The agony is affecting their skulls, possibly suggesting a physical, tangible impact or a metaphorical one related to mental anguish. Hypothesis: \\"The agony of defeat tore into their skulls.\\" In this statement, we have the following information: 1. The agony is specifically described as being caused by defeat. 2. Similar to the premise, the agony is tearing into their skulls, likely causing a severe impact or sensation. Now, let's compare these two statements to see if we can conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise. 1. Agony: Both statements highlight the experience of agony, a point of similarity. 2. Impact on the skull: Both statements suggest a strong feeling that seems to physically or mentally tear into their skulls. This is another similarity between the two statements. 3. Cause of agony: The premise expresses a general sense of agony without identifying the cause, while the hypothesis specifies that the agony is caused by defeat. This is a point of difference between the two statements. Given the analysis above, it is not possible to conclusively determine that the hypothesis \\"The agony of defeat tore into their skulls.\\" is true based solely on the premise \\"A thick agony tore into their skulls.\\" While there are similarities between the two statements regarding the experience of agony and its impact, the premise does not provide enough information about the cause of the agony to infer that it is specifically due to defeat, as stated in the hypothesis. To definitively prove the hypothesis, more information or context would be needed to establish a clear link between the agony mentioned in the premise and the cause mentioned in the hypothesis (i.e., defeat). Without this link being explicitly made, we cannot confirm the truth of the hypothesis based solely on the premise provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

On Wednesday, the Swedish firm’s spokeswoman Johanna Iritz said the firm takes the matter seriously, adding: “we can’t guarantee safety”. The trend reportedly started when two teenagers spent the night in an Ikea store in Belgium in August this year, then posted a video of their exploits online. Ikea's sleepy customers - in pictures Read more According to the Associated Press, Iritz said Ikea has recorded about 10 such incidents in the past year in the United States, Canada, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Australia and Poland. The agency said it was unclear whether anyone had been prosecuted. Facebook Twitter Pinterest In Chinese stores, sleepers are actually encouraged to try out Ikea furniture. Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images In August, Florian Van Hecke and Bram Geirnaert hid in wardrobes in an Ikea store in Belgium – coming out once it had closed. They filmed themselves using the display furniture overnight and finally left the store without being caught. Their video on YouTube was subsequently viewed more than 1.7m times. The latest incident involved two 14-year-old girls trying to stay over in an Ikea branch in Jönköping, Sweden, last weekend. According to local media, the firm did not report the incident because of the girls’ age. “Instead, we have spoken with their parents … to resolve the situation. We hope that this trend will slow. We do not see what it is fun about it,” an Ikea spokesman told Aftonbladet. Speaking on Wednesday, Iritz reiterated that the fun associated with sleeping over in an Ikea store after closing time was “overrated”. Her statement comes two years after Ikea invited people to stay over in one of its Australian stores as part of a joint publicity stunt with Airbnb. Ikea listed one of its Sydney stores on the homesharing website. At that time, the firm said the opportunity promised “guests a truly unusual experience, where the Ikea bedroom displays will be transformed into a quirky accommodation option”. ||||| SYDNEY — You can now live your own version of the movie 500 Days of Summer — by staying a night in an Ikea store.

My husband and I are vegetarians, and make a point of eating at local veg establishments when we travel. I was very excited when I saw the website for Green...it really looked intriguing. We've been fortunate to have been able to dine in a lot of really, really, good vegan establishments, so we have pretty high expectations. The days when \\"vegan\\" meant \\"bland,\\" \\"underseasoned,\\" \\"hippy\\" cuisine are long past, or so we thought. I guess there are still some places out there that are stuck in the 70s...definitely Green fits that description. I was a bit taken aback, after looking at the website and reading about \\"Chef Damon's\\" vision, to find myself in a tiny hole in the wall waiting in line for counter service, though I could have gotten past that had the food been stellar. I was further taken aback to discover that the place apparently doesn't have a liquor license...the only drink alternatives were bottled and cannned sodas from the cooler and a couple of fruity iced teas. Still, if the food had been good... I ordered something that isn't on the on-line menu. It was described as blackened faux chicken in a grilled pita with lettuce, tomato, and tahini. My husband ordered the Argentine Po'Boy with Thyme Fries. We also ordered some samosas to share. We both, reluctantly, grabbed bottled drinks from the cooler. Almost immediately after we'd sat down, my sandwich and the order of samosas came out of the kitchen. We waited for a bit, thinking that surely my husband's sandwich would be along shortly, but after several minutes of waiting, tucked into the samosas. They were OK...not bad; nothing to write home about. To be honest, they tasted as if they'd come out of a freezer box. Any Indian restaurant can do them better, and if you don't absolutely have to be dairy free, that's where I'd recommend you go, if samosas are what you're craving. The samosas consumed, we sat, and sat some more. My husband finally urged me to get started on my sandwich, which was rapidly cooling, and we both tried a bite of the faux chicken. It was, I have to say, really unpleasant. There was no sign of any blackening seasonings having been used...no sign of any seasoning at all, really. It had an oddly fishy taste to it (too much seaweed in the kombu, maybe?), and was much tougher than most chicken analogs. The pita (which was actually flatbread) didn't appear to have been grilled at all...it was dried out to the point of being crunchy, and there were no grill marks on it at all. The only real flavor in the sandwich (other than the odd, fishy, taste of the analog) came from the tahini. I finally gave up on the whole thing as not being worth the effort of chewing. My husband's sandwich finally came out, well after I'd given up on mine. I took a bite of the faux beef, and it was OK. It reminded me of the faux beef strips you can buy at Trader Joes. The fries that came with were nicely crispy (shoestring style), but there was not even a hint of thyme about them. They'd do best to just call them \\"French Fries\\" and have done with it. My take? If you're a vegetarian, you'd do better to eat at Lalibela. If you're a vegan...well, this place will keep you alive, but you'll pay more than it's worth and, if you're familiar with really good vegan cuisine, you won't be happy with it. If this is the best Scottsdale has to offer vegans, you're better off cooking at home.","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be described as majorly negative with some elements of disappointment. The reviewer and their husband had high expectations for Green, a vegetarian establishment they found intriguing on the website, but were let down by various aspects of the dining experience. The negative sentiment is evident in their critique of certain characteristics of the restaurant, including its hole-in-the-wall setting, lack of a liquor license, and limited drink options. The reviewer also expresses further disappointment in the quality of the food, describing the samosas as mediocre and suggesting they tasted like they came from a freezer box. Disappointment is particularly apparent when discussing the sandwiches they ordered. The reviewer's sandwich was described as having an oddly fishy taste and a dried-out pita, ultimately giving up on the dish. Additionally, her husband's sandwich took a long time to arrive, and though the faux beef was considered acceptable, the fries were incorrectly described on the menu as having a thyme flavor. Overall, the reviewer concludes that the quality of Green's food was not worth the price, and suggests that vegetarians and vegans in Scottsdale would be better off eating elsewhere or cooking at home. This detailed and long review showcases a predominantly negative sentiment with an undertone of disappointment woven throughout the account of their experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hunter was born in New York City, the son of Gertrude (nee Gelien) and Charles Kelm. His mother, from Hamburg, was a German Roman Catholic immigrant, and his father was Jewish. Hunter's father was reportedly abusive, and within a few years of his birth, his parents divorced. Tab grew up in California with his mother, older brother Walter, and maternal grandparents, John Henry and Ida (nee Sonnenfleth) One of Hunter's first films for Warners was The Sea Chase (1955), supporting John Wayne and Lana Turner. It was a big hit, but Hunter's part was relatively small. Rushes were seen by William Wellman, who cast Hunter to play the younger brother of Robert Mitchum in Track of the Cat (1955). It was a solid hit and Hunter began to get more notice. His breakthrough role came when he was cast as the young Marine Danny in 1955's World War II drama Battle Cry. His character has an affair with an older woman, but ends up marrying the girl next door. It was based on a bestseller by Leon Uris and became Warner Bros largest grossing film of that year, cementing Hunter's position as one of Hollywood's top young romantic leads. In September 1955 the tabloid magazine Confidential reported Hunter's 1950 arrest for disorderly conduct. The innuendo-laced article, and a second one focusing on Rory Calhoun's prison record, were the result of a deal Henry Willson had brokered with the scandal rag in exchange for not revealing his more prominent client Rock Hudson's sexual orientation to the public. Not only did this have no negative effect on Hunter's career, a few months later he was named Most Promising New Personality in a nationwide poll sponsored by the Council of Motion Picture Organizations. In 1956, he received 62,000 Valentines. Hunter, James Dean and Natalie Wood were the last of the actors placed under exclusive studio contract to Warner Bros. Warners decided to promote him to star status, teaming him with Natalie Wood in two back-to-back films, a Western, The Burning Hills (1956), directed by Heisler, and The Girl He Left Behind (1956), a service comedy. These films also proved to be hits with audiences and Warners planned a third teaming of Hunter and Wood. Hunter rejected the third picture, thus ending Warner's attempt to make Tab and Natalie the William Powell and Myrna Loy of the 1950s. Hunter was Warner Bros.' most popular male star from 1955-1959. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Any other recognition?","completion":"Yes, Tab Hunter received recognition too.

When analyzing the tone of any piece of writing, it is crucial to examine the language, complaints, and praises present in the text. In this particular product review, let's break down these aspects to identify the overall tone. First, the language used in the review is mainly negative. The title, \\"Just too small,\\" immediately conveys dissatisfaction with the product. Additionally, phrases such as \\"I blame myself\\" and \\"just too small to make a useful mousepad\\" further demonstrate the reviewer's displeasure with the item. Moreover, the review focuses on the small size of the mousepad as a significant issue, explicitly stating that it is not suitable for effective mouse usage. This complaint is a clear indicator of a negative tone, as it implies that the product does not meet the customer's expectations or needs. However, there is a slight hint of positivity within the review. The reviewer acknowledges their own responsibility in not paying close enough attention to the product specifications. Also, they provide a helpful suggestion to other customers, encouraging them to take note of the dimensions and stick with larger items. This constructive and helpful advice can be perceived as a positive note, though the overall impression remains negative. In conclusion, the tone of this product review is primarily negative, as the language used and complaint about the size demonstrate dissatisfaction with the product. The slight positivity arises from the constructive advice given to other customers, but it is not sufficient enough to change the overall negative tone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The new wardrobe will not fit in the closet because the pick from the following. 1). wardrobe is too extensive.. 2). closet is too extensive..","completion":"As Lily stared at the massive wardrobe she had just purchased, she couldn't help but notice that something was wrong. It was quite apparent that her new acquisition was not going to fit in her walk-in closet. It seemed the two options were, either her wardrobe was too extensive, or her closet was too extensive. After careful thought, she realized that the issue wasn't that her wardrobe was too vast, but rather her closet had become too extensive over time. Lily's closet had, over the years, evolved into more than just a space where she hung her clothes. It had become a sanctuary for her most prized possessions. From her collection of vintage scarfs that she had inherited from her grandmother to her extensive shoe collection that housed over a hundred pairs, it seemed as though her closet had become an extension of her personality. Every inch of space had been utilized over time; shelves filled to the brim with accessories, piles of clothes neatly folded, and hooks that held dozens of bags. Even the floor was cluttered with storage boxes full of memories and trinkets she had accumulated throughout her life. The once spacious walk-in closet was now a labyrinth of clothes, shoes, and souvenirs from her life experiences. As Lily stood, deep in thought, she realized that it was time for a change. Her extensive closet was not conducive to her new wardrobe, and she needed to find a solution. She decided that she would have to sort through her collection and part with the things she no longer needed or used to make room for her new wardrobe. She spent the entire weekend rummaging through her closet. It was an emotionally draining task, as she came face to face with memories of her past - old love letters, souvenirs from her travels, and even the outfit she wore on her first date with her now-husband. However, Lily was determined to see the task through. She created three piles: one for donation, one for selling, and one for items she wanted to keep. By the end of what felt like an emotional rollercoaster filled with nostalgia, she had managed to sort through everything in her closet. Her once cluttered walk-in sanctuary was now a neatly organized and spacious haven for her new wardrobe. The wardrobe still had plenty of space for her cherished possessions, but it was no longer crammed to the brim, as she had thoughtfully and meticulously curated the contents to only include items of sentimental value and necessity. Bringing in the new wardrobe, her closet now sparkled with a renewed sense of order and a fresh start. Lily felt a weight lifted off her shoulders as she realized the importance of letting go of the past, making room for the present, and embracing the future with open arms. She knew that her closet would continue to be an ever-evolving aspect of her life, but she had learned a valuable lesson in not letting it become so extensive that it compromised her ability to accommodate change. With her new wardrobe all set in her now spacious closet, Lily couldn't help but smile as she admired her hard work and the transformation she had accomplished, both in her closet and within herself."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. the primary goal of therapy is to treat the underlying condition responsible for the inflammation of the blood vessels. This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","completion":"The primary goal of therapy is to treat the underlying condition responsible for the inflammation of the blood vessels. When it comes to therapy for the inflammation of blood vessels, the main focus is on addressing the root cause of the issue. This entails understanding and treating the medical condition that is leading to such inflammation. Here is a more detailed explanation of this approach: 1. Diagnosis: The first step in therapy is to accurately diagnose the underlying condition causing the inflammation. This may involve a thorough medical examination, blood tests, imaging studies, and sometimes, biopsies of the affected blood vessels. Some common conditions responsible for blood vessel inflammation include vasculitis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune disorders. 2. Medication: Once the underlying condition has been identified, a healthcare provider will generally prescribe medication to reduce and control the inflammation. Depending on the specific condition, medications can range from corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to immunosuppressive agents and biologic therapies. The choice of medication depends on the severity of the condition, the affected blood vessels, and individual patient factors. 3. Monitoring and follow-up: Since inflammation of blood vessels can cause complications and long-term damage, ongoing monitoring and follow-up care are essential aspects of therapy. Patients may need to undergo regular blood tests and imaging studies to ensure that the inflammation is under control and to assess the effectiveness of the prescribed medications. In some cases, adjustments to the medication or dosage may be required. 4. Lifestyle modifications: In addition to medication, therapy may also involve making certain lifestyle adjustments to reduce the risk of further inflammation and maintain overall health. This can include adopting a healthy diet, engaging in physical activity, quitting smoking, and managing stress levels. 5. Managing complications: If the inflammation of blood vessels has resulted in complications or damage to vital organs, additional treatments may be needed to address these issues. For example, patients with kidney damage due to vasculitis may require dialysis or a kidney transplant, while individuals with heart problems might need surgery or other interventions. 6. Supportive care: Living with a condition that causes blood vessel inflammation can be challenging, both physically and emotionally. Psychological support, such as counseling or involvement in support groups, can play a critical role in helping patients cope with the daily challenges and maintain a positive outlook. To summarize, the primary goal of therapy for blood vessel inflammation is to identify and treat the condition responsible for the inflammation. This involves a multifaceted approach that includes accurate diagnosis, appropriate medication, regular monitoring, lifestyle modifications, managing complications, and providing psychological support. By addressing the root cause and continually reevaluating the patient's progress, healthcare providers can help patients achieve better health outcomes and improved quality of life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns.

To many property developers and local government officials, housing price in China is still low compared with many developed countries. However, the average housing price in the United States is only 8, 000 yuan per square metre, while in China, it is even higher than that in the United States. \\"This shows that there are some bubbles in Chinese real estate market,\\" the International Finance News reported. Although the average price of residential houses in the United States, after changed to RMB, is about 8, 000 yuan per square metre, the houses in the US are not sold in terms of building area, as most Chinese property developers do when they sell their houses. If the US property developers sell their houses according to the building area, then the housing price will be even lower than 8, 000 yuan per square metre. In most big Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, houses are sold at a price even higher than those in the US. The high housing price in large cities in China proves that Chinese real estate market does have some bubbles. Moreover, Chinese houses cannot be compared with houses in the US in terms of building quality, environment and supporting facilities. Furthermore, it should be noted that American people's average income is several dozen times higher than that of Chinese people. How can the Chinese afford to buy a house which is even more expensive than that sold in the US? At the beginning of 2007, Chinese government issued a set of policies that aimed to benefit the public. Now in order to reduce the high housing prices, the government can regulate the real estate market by raising tax on property industry and controlling the release of loans and lands to property developers. Meanwhile, the government should allow people to build more houses through various fund-raising channels, such as funds collected from buyers or raised by working units. By applying these multiple...

OPT: [+] yes; [+] it is not possible to tell; [+] no;","completion":"[+] The premise given states that, \\"The real war in Kosovo is featured inside, as it is in Newsweek. Time berates NATO for its self-congratulatory and ill-timed birthday celebrations.\\" From this statement, we can gather some information about Time's viewpoint towards NATO and their birthday celebrations. First, Time is comparing the coverage of the war in Kosovo within their publication to that of Newsweek, implying that they believe it is important to report on the war itself, as opposed to focusing solely on NATO's celebration. Second, the choice of the word \\"berates\\" demonstrates that Time is not pleased with NATO's actions, as it means to criticize or condemn someone or something harshly. Additionally, the premise describes NATO's birthday celebrations as \\"self-congratulatory and ill-timed.\\" This shows that Time believes NATO is acting inappropriately, possibly by celebrating their own achievements while a war is ongoing. The unfortunate timing likely refers to the conflict in Kosovo; it is insensitive for NATO to be celebrating while people are suffering due to the war. Based on these observations, the hypothesis that \\"Time is unhappy with NATO for the birthday celebrations\\" is supported by the premise. The statement indicates that Time is displeased with both the content of the celebration (being self-congratulatory) and the timing of the celebration (amidst the ongoing war in Kosovo). Therefore, it can be concluded that the hypothesis aligns with the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Multi-select problem: How does the next paragraph end? A chef is standing in a kitchen. He puts pasta into a large pot. he Available choices: A. takes a sponge and scrubs it vigorously.; B. stirs the pasta and buffs it dry with a dish towel.; C. is mixing ingredients together into a bowl.; D. stirs the ingredients in the pot.;","completion":"Given the information from the provided paragraph, the suitable ending could be \\"D. stirs the ingredients in the pot.\\" This is because the paragraph describes a chef preparing pasta in a kitchen. When a chef is cooking pasta, they place it in a pot, typically full of boiling water, and stir it intermittently to prevent it from sticking together and to ensure it cooks evenly. Therefore, the statement 'he stirs the ingredients in the pot' would make the most sense given the context. The following answers can be ruled out for these reasons: Option A: Taking a sponge and scrubbing the pasta vigorously is not a logical course of action when cooking pasta. Rather, this action would be more suited to cleaning tasks in the kitchen. Option B: Buffing pasta dry with a dish towel is also impracticable in this scenario. Pasta, when cooked, is supposed to be moist and not dry. Plus, drying pasta with a dish towel is unhygienic and could contaminate the food. Option C: The chef could mix ingredients together in a bowl as part of preparing some dishes; however, the initial paragraph does not hint towards a scenario where the chef is preparing something in a bowl. Rather, the chef is busy with the pasta in the pot. So, considering the theme, culinary logic, and without any additional information suggesting otherwise, the most plausible continuation would be \\"D. He stirs the ingredients in the pot.\\" This keeps the focus on the chef's ongoing activity of cooking pasta."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

A sickly Mina Van Helsing (Jan Francis), who is visiting her friend Lucy Seward (Kate Nelligan), discovers Dracula's body after his ship has run aground. The Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy's father, Dr. Jack Seward (Donald Pleasence), whose clifftop mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner, he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts, Lucy especially. Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve), Lucy's fiancÃ©. Later that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning, Lucy finds Mina awake in bed, struggling for breath. Powerless, she watches her friend die, only to find wounds on her throat. Lucy blames herself for Mina's death, as she had left her alone. At a loss for the cause of death, Dr. Seward calls for Mina's father, Professor Abraham van Helsing (Laurence Olivier). Van Helsing suspects what might have killed his daughter: a vampire. Moreover, he begins to worry about what fate his seemingly dead daughter may now have. Seward and van Helsing investigate their suspicions and discover a roughly clawed opening within Mina's coffin which leads to the local mines. It is there that they encounter the ghastly form of an undead Mina, and it is up to a distraught van Helsing to destroy what remains of his own daughter. Lucy meanwhile has been summoned to Carfax Abbey, Dracula's new home, and soon she reveals herself to be in love with this foreign prince and openly offers herself to him as his bride.

The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The metallic bonding model explains the physical properties of metals. Metals conduct electricity and heat very well because of their free-flowing electrons. As electrons enter one end of a piece of metal, an equal number of electrons flow outward from the other end. When light is shone on to the surface of a metal, its electrons absorb small amounts of energy and become excited into one of its many empty orbitals. The electrons immediately fall back down to lower energy levels and emit light. This process is responsible for the high luster of metals. Q: Why does metal conduct heat and electricity so well? A: Possible answers: * electromagnetism. * free flowing photons. * insulation. * free flowing electrons. Answer:","completion":"Metal conducts heat and electricity so well primarily due to the presence of free-flowing electrons within its atomic structure. In the metallic bonding model, a metal consists of positively charged ions corresponding to their parent atom, surrounded by a \\"sea\\" of delocalized electrons. These electrons are not bound to any one particular atom and can move freely throughout the entire metal lattice. When an electric current is applied to a metal, the free electrons whose movement constitutes the flow of current move in response to the electric field. Electrons enter the metal at one end, and an equal number of electrons flow out from the other. Their mobility allows the metal to conduct electricity efficiently, as the electrons can traverse the entire specimen with relative ease. Furthermore, these mobile electrons can also absorb small amounts of energy, such as when light is shone on the metal's surface, and transfer that energy almost instantly throughout the entirety of the material. Similarly, when it comes to conducting heat, the free electrons play a significant role in transferring thermal energy. When one part of a metal is heated, the kinetic energy of the atoms and electrons in that region will increase. The free electrons will absorb this excess energy and move rapidly through the metal's lattice, colliding with other atoms and transferring their energy uniformly across the metal's structure. This ability to quickly distribute thermal energy results in the efficient conduction of heat, one of the many properties that make metals such versatile materials in various applications. Based on the metallic bonding model and the behavior of free-flowing electrons, it is evident that metals conduct heat and electricity so proficiently due to the presence and mobility of these delocalized electrons. This characteristic allows metals to exhibit high electrical and thermal conductivity, as well as their characteristic luster."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If they're not, it might start unnecessary drama that could dampen the event. If possible, send them via email. Ask for RSVPs so you know who is coming and can have a head count. Have your teen send reminder texts or phone calls, too, before the big day. Theme parties are fun for 4-year-olds, 40-year-olds, and everyone in between (though the themes change over time). Talk to your teen about having a theme – the kids can then dress up, you'll have fun planning out themed food, and it'll make it easier to decorate and find matching additions. This should be your teen's decision. As long as it's appropriate and doable, it should be a go. If you don't like it, give your teen a good reason why and offer alternatives. This is especially important if you're having the party at home: plan and arrange all the food and decorate till the cows come home. With a theme it'll be easier to pick out; if you don't have one, it's up to you. Here's a few things to keep in mind: Keep the snacks coming; worry less about the main food. You can always whip up spaghetti or order pizza, depending on what the party-goers feel like. But don't forget the cake! To keep the mess better for you, buy plastic plates, forks, knives, and cups to keep the after-party clean-up to a minimum. Don't be nervous to ask other parents to bring along a few dishes if the party is at your house. A few bags of chips or some liters of soda is an easy way they can chip in. You need to be there to problem-solve and diffuse any tension, but when things are going well, allow them their space and their fun. They're at an age where they can take care of themselves. Be as far away as you feel is appropriate. Odds are your teen will need you to order the pizza or take care of any mess they create. While it may not be in the way you want, you'll likely be needed to stay relatively near.","completion":"The article provides guidance for parents on planning a teen's birthday party, including involving the teen in decision-making, selecting location, inviting guests discreetly, considering a theme, arranging food, and balancing supervision with giving teens freedom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They may have been bitter enemies during the Cold War space race, but these days the U.S. and Russia work together to transport astronauts through the cosmos. And it's just as well - for since the demise of the space shuttle programme last year, NASA has been forced to piggy-back off other countries rockets for its space expeditions. This enforced co-operation was on show on Sunday, when American Sunita Williams joined colleagues from Russia and Japan on a Soyuz capsule headed to the International Space Station for a four-month mission. Scroll down for video. We have lift off: The Soyuz TMA-05M rocket launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan yesterday morning carrying three astronauts nearly 250 miles above the Earth to the International Space Station. Ms Williams, Yuri Malenchenko and Akihiko Hoshide launched successfully from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 0240 GMT. They are scheduled to berth early on. Tuesday, joining Nasa Flight Engineer Joseph Acaba and Russian. cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin aboard the ISS. 'The Soyuz had a very smooth ride into space,' a spokesman for Nasa said during a live broadcast on the agency's television channel. The Soyuz TMA-05M rocket blazed a bright orange trail through cloudy skies above the Kazakh steppe on the first stage of its journey to the ISS, a 100billion research complex orbiting 240 miles above Earth. Moscow hopes a successful mission will help to restore confidence in its once-pioneering space programme after a string of launch mishaps last year, including the failure of a mission to return samples from the Martian moon Phobos. The previous Soyuz launch on May 15 was delayed by more than a month after an accident during pressure tests damaged the Soyuz crew capsule. There were no such delays with Sunday's launch. Expensive trip: The U.S. is dependent on Russia's Soyuz TMA-05M rockets to carry personnel to the ISS since it scrapped its space shuttle programme last year. 'The most tense, the most difficult part (of the launch) has been successfully implemented,' said Vladimir Popovkin, head of Russian space agency Roscosmos. 'I have just spoken to the crew. They are feeling great,' Russian news agencies quoted Popovkin as saying in Baikonur. 'I have no doubts that all will go according to plan.' Colonel Malenchenko, a 50-year-old cosmonaut on his fifth space voyage, loosened his straps about 20 minutes after blast-off after conducting air pressure checks. Asked by Mission Control how the crew was feeling, he replied: 'Good.' A doll given to him by his daughter dangled from the roof of the capsule. Intrepid: Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko, center, U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams, right, and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, left, walk to the capsule before the countdown. Explorers: Colonel Malenchenko, left, and Captain Williams, wave to the cameras prior to launch. Captain Williams, 46, and Mr Hoshide,. 43, a civilian engineer, are both on their second space flight and their. first aboard a Soyuz spacecraft. They, along with Colonel Malenchenko, are scheduled to return to Earth in mid-November. The previous crew of three at the ISS returned on July 1. Cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, NASA astronaut Don Pettit and European Space Agency astronaut Andre Kuipers helped to dock the first privately owned spacecraft during a six-month stint in orbit. Destination space: The International Space Station is a 100billion research complex orbiting 240 miles above Earth. Sunday's launch took place less than three weeks after China's Shenzhou 9 spacecraft returned to Earth, ending a mission that put the country's first woman in space. Although China is far from catching up with the United States and Russia, the Shenzhou 9 marked China's fourth manned space mission since 2003. It comes as budget restraints and shifting priorities have held back U.S. manned space launches. Watch the video. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Q: If I tell you that Mitosisis how organisms grow and repair themselves, and ask you the question \\"how do organisms grow and repair themselves?\\", is the correct answer \\"complex\\"? The answer is:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"complex.\\" The correct answer is that organisms grow and repair themselves through the process of mitosis. Mitosis is a type of cell division in which a single cell, known as the parent cell, divides into two genetically identical daughter cells. This process plays a crucial role in growth, development, and tissue repair in multicellular organisms. During mitosis, the DNA in the parent cell replicates, and the cell's contents are divided equally between the two daughter cells. This ensures that each new cell has the necessary genetic material and organelles to function properly. As cells divide and increase in number, an organism grows, and damaged or worn-out cells are replaced, allowing for continuous repair and maintenance of bodily tissues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The realization that my daughters were playing in Nancy's house, just one-half block away, paralyzed my legs, making me unable to move when I neared the end of our driveway. Dense, black smoke was rising from behind the Sycamore Maple trees on the other side of the street and was enveloping three houses, making them barely visible. Nancy's house was one of them.

If yeasts have special structures for penetrating a host, then what has special structures for penetrating a host? Answer choices: - blood - water - sunlight - gills - bacteria - Oak - yeasts - parasites","completion":"The answer is parasites. Parasites have specialized structures for penetrating a host and establishing infection. They are organisms that live and feed on or within another organism (the host), causing harm or damage to the host in the process. There are numerous types of parasites, which can be broadly classified into two main categories: ectoparasites and endoparasites. Ectoparasites are those that live on the surface of the host, such as ticks, lice, and mites. Endoparasites, on the other hand, live inside the host’s body, including in the blood, organs, and tissues. Examples of endoparasites include protozoa (such as Plasmodium, which causes malaria), helminths (such as tapeworms and roundworms), and certain bacteria and viruses. In order to successfully infect and survive within their host, parasites have evolved specialized structures and mechanisms to penetrate host tissues or cells. Some examples of these structures include: 1. Hooks and suckers: Many helminths, like tapeworms and flukes, have hooks and suckers that allow them to anchor themselves within the host's intestine and absorb nutrients. These structures also help them resist being dislodged or eliminated from the host's body. 2. Stylets: Some parasites, like nematodes (roundworms), possess a sharp, needle-like structure called a stylet. The stylet is used to pierce through the host's cells or tissues, enabling the parasite to feed on its host. 3. Glycoproteins and enzymes: Certain parasites produce surface glycoproteins or secrete enzymes that help them attach to or break down host cells and tissues, facilitating penetration and invasion. 4. Specialized mouthparts: Ectoparasites, such as ticks and lice, have specialized mouthparts that allow them to pierce the host's skin and feed on its blood. For example, ticks possess a barbed, removable feeding tube called a hypostome, which anchors them to their host during feeding. 5. Invasion proteins and mechanisms: Some protozoan parasites, like Plasmodium (the causative agent of malaria), have developed complex mechanisms to enter their host's cells. For instance, Plasmodium's merozoite stage uses specific proteins to bind to and invade red blood cells, eventually leading to the replication and survival of the parasite within the host. In conclusion, parasites are the organisms that possess specialized structures for penetrating a host, thereby establishing an infection and deriving their nutrition from the host organism. This allows the parasite to reproduce and survive, often at the expense of the host's health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: A dipole occurs when two opposite charges are separated by some amount of distance. We have already seen dipoles in the form of polar bonds. For example, each O-H bond in water is an example of a dipole; the partial positive charge on hydrogen is separated from the partial negative charge on oxygen by the length of the bond. A molecular dipole is the geometric sum of all the individual bond dipoles in a molecule. In order for a molecule to have a dipole, it must have at least one polar bond. However, not all molecules with polar bonds have an overall molecular dipole. Sometimes the dipoles within a molecule will effectively cancel each other out, giving a zero net molecular dipole. This is often seen in symmetrical molecules. Q: What occurs when two opposite charges are separated by some amount of distance? A: A:","completion":"When two opposite charges are separated by some amount of distance, a dipole occurs.

Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored. Would the reactants concentration increase or decrease in case A than in case B?","completion":"In case A, the forward reaction is favored. This means that more reactants are being converted to products, causing the concentration of the reactants to decrease. In case B, the reverse reaction is favored, which means more products are being converted back to reactants, causing the concentration of the reactants to increase.

What is the last name of the person who was appointed secretary of the Society of Antiquaries in 1939? Answer the above question based on the context below: Wheeler had been expecting and openly hoping for war with Nazi Germany for a year prior to the outbreak of hostilities; he believed that the United Kingdom's involvement in the conflict would remedy the shame that he thought had been brought upon the country by its signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938. Volunteering for the armed services, he was assigned to assemble the 48th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery at Enfield, where he set about recruiting volunteers, including his son Michael. As the 48th swelled in size, it was converted into the 42nd Mobile Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment in the Royal Artillery, which consisted of four batteries and was led by Wheeler – now promoted to the rank of colonel – as Commanding Officer. Given the nickname of \\"Flash Alf\\" by those serving under him, he was recognised by colleagues as a ruthless disciplinarian and was blamed by many for the death of one of his soldiers from influenza during training. Having been appointed secretary of the Society of Antiquaries in 1939 and then director in 1940, he travelled to London to deal with society affairs on various occasions. In 1941 Wheeler was awarded a Fellowship of the British Academy. Cole had meanwhile entered into an affair with a man named Clive Entwistle, who lambasted Wheeler as \\"that whiskered baboon\\". When Wheeler discovered Entwistle in bed with his wife, he initiated divorce proceedings that were finalised in March 1942.In the summer of 1941, Wheeler and three of his batteries were assigned to fight against German and Italian forces in the North African Campaign. In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS Empress of Russia; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, they were forced to travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban. There, Wheeler visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of Iron Age Britain. The ship docked in Aden, where Wheeler and his men again took shore leave.

The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt.

Casper's story begins with his return to his hometown after a decade away, trying to escape from a past he wished to forget. A talented artist and skilled carpenter, Casper opens a small workshop in an alley, distancing himself from the affluent lifestyle of his successful father, a cold, mysterious man who has an iron grip on the town.

One day, Casper meets Martha, an introverted, kind-hearted librarian who loves to lose herself in a world of books and escape her reality.

As time goes by, Casper and Martha fall deeply in love, sharing their dreams and passions, and Martha teaches Casper to open up to the world once more.

He secretly works on a time-sensitive plan that will expose those responsible for the unspeakable acts before it is too late.

With his suspicions confirmed, Casper is more determined than ever to protect Martha, leaving her hidden love letters, tokens of his affection, and beautiful artworks as proof of his unwavering devotion. As the story reaches its climax, Casper uses his intelligence, cunning, and artistic talent to carefully execute a plan that will blow the lid off the criminal operation. He faces dangerous confrontations and terrifying encounters as he fights to expose the ruthless culprits and ensure justice for the town.

However, solar energy may not always be practical. Some areas are just too cloudy. Example Solar panels on the roof of this house generate enough electricity to supply a familys needs.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who does Michael ask to stay the night with? Torgo. Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"A Strange Night at Torgo's\\" Genre: Dark Comedy, Mystery, Fantasy Plot: Act 1: Michael Lewis, a charismatic yet rebellious 30-year-old man, is facing a quarter-life crisis. He loses his job and is forced to move out of his apartment, since the rent has become unaffordable without an income. Despite his friends' offers to stay with them, Michael cannot shake off the feeling of being stuck and decides to take a road trip to clear his mind and figure out his next steps. During his trip, Michael stumbles upon a relatively unknown town named \\"Whispering Willows.\\" Rumors abound about supernatural occurrences in this quaint town, sparking Michael's curiosity. He decides to stay in the town for a while, visiting the local establishments and learning about the town's history, including its founder, Torgo. While exploring the Whispering Willows library, Michael learns about Torgo, a peculiar yet influential figure who played a pivotal role in the town's foundation. Whispering Willows was established in the 1800s after Torgo had reportedly discovered a portal to alternate dimensions, attracting an eclectic mix of individuals. Act 2: As night approaches, Michael decides to visit the abandoned house where Torgo once lived, situated at the edge of town. Although the townspeople explicitly warn him against visiting the seemingly cursed site, Michael's rebellious nature and adventurous spirit entice him to explore the house. Upon crossing the threshold of Torgo's house, Michael feels an eerie sense of familiarity, like déjà vu. Ignoring his intuition, he continues investigating the dark, dusty rooms filled with curious artifacts. As he examines one of the artifacts, a peculiar, otherworldly voice interrupts his thoughts. Startled, Michael discovers that the voice belongs to Torgo, the long-deceased founder of Whispering Willows, who has been lingering between the realms of the living and the dead and trapped in his former home, roaming as a ghost. Now aware of the supernatural truth surrounding the town and its eccentric founder, Michael is compelled to find and close the mysterious portal Torgo once opened. However, Torgo has a plan of his own. Act 3: With Torgo's guidance, Michael embarks on an epic quest to locate the portal. Along the way, he encounters bizarre experiences, from witnessing strange supernatural phenomena to discovering hidden secrets that test his sanity and fortitude. As he confronts the riddles and challenges set forth by Torgo's cryptic clues, Michael cannot help but feel a growing attachment to the peculiar ghost. Ultimately, through perseverance and with Torgo's help, Michael locates the elusive portal. However, as they prepare to close it, Torgo confesses that he wishes to stay one last night on Earth before resuming his eternal journey. Desiring to repay Torgo for helping him rediscover his purpose and passion for life, Michael agrees to fulfill the ghost's wish, spending the night with him in the haunted house. As they share stories, life experiences, and vulnerabilities with each other, the odd duo forms an improbable but genuine friendship. By asking Torgo to stay the night with him, Michael has not only granted a ghost his final human connection but also found solace during his period of confusion. Epilogue: In the cold light of dawn, Michael and Torgo finally close the mysterious portal, freeing Torgo's soul and lifting the supernatural veil from the Whispering Willows. In doing so, Michael emerges with newfound perspective and direction in life, and the town itself regains its original sense of normalcy. The movie concludes with Michael's departure from Whispering Willows to the sound of joyous laughter intermingling with a fading ghostly whisper as the open road unfolds before him, marking the beginning of a renewed life filled with limitless potential."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral is a Coptic church located in the Abbassia District in Cairo, Egypt. The cathedral is the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope. It was built during the time when Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria was Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church, and was inaugurated by him in 1969. Hypothesis: St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral is located in Cairo, Germany","completion":"The hypothesis that St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral is located in Cairo, Germany is false. The information provided clearly indicates that St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral is situated in the Abbassia District in Cairo, Egypt, not Germany. Cairo is the capital city of Egypt, it is in Northeast Africa and is one of the most populated cities in Africa. The city's rich history stretches back thousands of years and it is home to numerous cultural monuments and significant artifacts. Germany, on the other hand, is a country situated in Central Europe, well-known for its history, culture, and technological advancements. It's important to note that Cairo is not in Germany for there's a significant geographical distance and distinct cultural differences between the two. St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral is an important religious site in Egypt. As stated, it's the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope, which is currently Pope Tawadros II, making it a crucial hub for the Coptic Orthodox Church. The cathedral was built during the tenure of Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria, who also inaugurated it in 1969. The cathedral is named after St. Mark the Evangelist, one of the seventy apostles of Jesus and founder of the Church of Alexandria. The cathedral has become a symbol of Coptic faith and tradition in Egypt and among the broader Christian community. Coptic Christianity has a vital and long-standing presence in Egypt. It traces back to the apostle and evangelist Mark in the 1st century, making it one of the oldest Christian communities in the world. Indeed, the term \\"Coptic\\" comes from the Greek word for \\"Egyptian\\". In conclusion, the hypothesis is inaccurate because St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral is a religious landmark located in Cairo, Egypt and not in Germany, showing the deep religious history and importance of the cathedral in Egypt. It is a significant symbol of the Coptic Orthodox Church and continues to play a crucial role in the spiritual lives of many Egyptian Christians."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is held on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month. Vietnamese families plan their activities around their children on this special day. In a Vietnamese folk story, parents were working so hard to prepare for the harvest that they left the children playing by themselves. To make up for that time, the parents would use the Mid-Autumn Festival as a chance to show their love and thanks for their children. As a result, the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Children's Festival. In the United States, this tradition continues in many Vietnamese-American families. Activities are often centered on children and education. Parents buy lanterns for their children so that they can take part in a candle and lantern parade at dawn. Lanterns mean brightness, while the parade means success in school. Vietnamese markets sell a variety of lanterns, but the most popular children's lantern is the star lantern. Other children's activities include arts and crafts in which children make face masks and lanterns. Children also perform traditional Vietnamese dances for adults and take part in contests for prizes. Unicorn dancers are also very popular. Like Chinese people, Vietnamese parents tell their children folk stories and serve moon cakes and other special treats under the bright moon. A favorite folk story is about a carp that wanted to become a dragon. The carp worked and worked and finally changed itself into a dragon. Parents use this story to encourage their children to work hard so that they can become whatever they want to be.

The text states that Spring Breakdown was released direct-to-video in 2009, three years after principal photography. This implies that the movie was completed and ready for release well before 2009. Moreover, the text mentions that Warner Independent Pictures, the film's owner, was shut down by its parent company. This event seemingly delayed the release of Spring Breakdown, as it was only able to be released after Warner Independent Pictures' shutdown. Taking these facts into consideration, we can infer that if Warner Independent Pictures had not been shut down, it is plausible that Spring Breakdown could have been launched before 2009.

It has become a popular destination for tourists and investors who are looking for an affordable piece of paradise. If you are interested in investing in the cheapest properties in Caye Caulker, it is essential to research and compare various options before making a decision. 1. Land properties: Affordable land properties are often available in undeveloped or newly developed areas on the island. These lots can be used for building a home, opening a business, or simply holding onto as an investment. Prices for land properties can vary greatly depending on the location, size, and potential uses for the property. To find the best deals, it is essential to work with real estate agents who have extensive knowledge of the local market. 2. Condos and apartments: Another option for budget-conscious buyers is to look for condominiums or apartments that are either newly built or on the resale market. These types of properties often offer the same amenities as more expensive options, such as pools and access to nearby beaches. Due diligence is crucial when purchasing these properties, as it is essential to be aware of any potential issues or maintenance costs that may arise. 3. Small homes and cottages: Smaller homes and cottages are available on Caye Caulker at affordable prices. These properties can provide an excellent opportunity for those who wish to have a vacation home or investment property. Depending on the location and overall condition of the home, these properties can be a great value for the price.

Working with a reputable real estate agent with experience in handling distressed properties is crucial to ensuring you are making a sound investment decision. Additionally, it's important to factor in any repair and renovation costs in your budget before deciding on a property. 5. Off-plan properties: Purchasing an off-plan property, particularly in a newly developed or upcoming area, can help you secure a property at a lower price point. These properties offer the opportunity for buyers to customize their homes and pay for the construction in stages, which can be more affordable for some investors. To find the cheapest properties in Caye Caulker, make sure to research meticulously and invest time into comparing different property types, locations, and price ranges.

Most of the findings are predictable, but a few are surprising. The database makes it clear that there is not a strong connection between material wealth and general contentment. It is a cliche to say that money can't buy happiness, but the old saying seems to be supported by research. Many people still cling to the belief that gaining riches will be the answer to all their problems, yet they are probably mistaken. Studies have been carried out on people who acquired sudden wealth, such as lottery winners. In most cases, after the initial joy had worn off, people were not left with a sense of lasting happiness. In fact, they tended to revert to the way they felt before they became rich. Previously contented people continue to be contented, while those who were miserable before sink back into misery. If material wealth does not bring happiness, then what does? Perhaps happiness has something to do with where you live. The authorities at the World Database on Happiness have surveyed levels of happiness in different countries. Apparently, people in America, Canada, and Singapore are very happy; people living in India and Russia, not surprisingly, are not happy. Other surveys consistently point to the importance of relationships. Family relationships in particular seem to be the key to long-term contentment. The Web site suggests that falling in love and having children are two of the situations that bring the greatest happiness. Nowadays people look to technology as an alternative source of satisfaction. People increasingly spend more time alone watching TV or surfing the Internet rather than spending time with family. Can technology truly make people happy? It is too difficult to tell, but one thing is sure: If the Web site's research is accurate, time spent with your family is a better investment than time spent making money.

Keene and Alexandra Kaczenski of the Getty Museum’s Manuscripts Department have spent the last few years preparing for an exhibition and publication titled Sacred Landscapes: Nature in Renaissance Manuscripts that aims to examine representations of “green spaces” such as gardens, vistas, and their relation to the divine. In particular, Bryan and Alexandra focus on the ways in which artists during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance embedded the pages of illuminated manuscripts with depictions of the natural world so that nature could guide prayer, chant, and meditation. For Bryan, this project represents a continuation of his interest in sacred gardens that began with his graduate work on the garden imagery that influenced Botticelli’s Agony in the Garden painting. In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance. For Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication. Though floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated—the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented—this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly “scattered” floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, “The tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific.

News article: Justin Trudeau hadn't even been weaned when a sitting United States president first predicted he'd one day become Canada's political leader. \\"Tonight we'll dispense with the formalities. I'd like to toast the future prime minister of Canada: to Justin Pierre Trudeau,\\" Richard Nixon said at a gala buffet in April 1972 during a state visit to Ottawa when Trudeau was just four months old. According to a contemporary news wire report, Trudeau's father Pierre, then nearing the end of his first four-year Liberal mandate as prime minister, responded that should his eldest son — born on Christmas Day 1971 — ever become Canada's leader, \\"I hope he has the grace and skill of the president.\\" Nixon, of course, went on to infamy, while Pierre Trudeau governed Canada for 16 years in all and ushered in a new Canadian Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Today, Justin Pierre James Trudeau is tantalizingly close to fulfilling Nixon's prophecy — polls have the Liberals leading heading into the final weekend before Monday's vote — and there's a certain symmetry in that he's seeking to replace Stephen Harper, a prime minister described as \\"almost Nixonian\\" by Harper's own former chief of staff Tom Flanagan. Sunny, approachable, sometimes too quick with a quip, relaxed in front of a camera and publicly eschewing the dark political arts, Trudeau has presented himself to Canadians as the open-book antidote to a decade of flinty, guarded Conservative governance. \\"My vision of Canada is open and confident and hopeful,\\" he said in a speech to a massive Liberal rally earlier this month in Brampton, Ont. \\"Harper wants Canadians to be afraid that there's a terrorist hiding behind every leaf and rock. That there's a sea of economic troubles lapping at our shores. I don't see things that way. I have confidence in Canada and in Canadians.\\" Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau sits down with Peter Mansbridge for an exclusive interview. 30:03 Having lived much of his 43 years in the public eye, Trudeau needs little introduction to Canadians. He's the first to recognize the downside. The Trudeau name is like a magnet, attracting or repelling depending on one's political polarity. \\"The association with my father was never a reason for me to get into politics,\\" Trudeau wrote last year in his memoir, \\"Common Ground.\\" \\"It was, rather, a reason for me to avoid entering the political arena.\\" Nonetheless, at critical junctures in this extraordinarily long 78-day campaign, Trudeau has championed his father's legacy. During a leaders' debate on foreign policy late last month in Toronto, a jibe from NDP Leader Tom Mulcair raised the Liberal leader's ire. \\"Let me say very clearly, I am incredibly proud to be Pierre Elliot Trudeau's son,\\" said Trudeau, before citing the charter, multiculturalism and bilingualism as inheritances the country can take pride in. Trudeau noted the evening marked the 15th anniversary of his father's death, \\"and I know he wouldn't want us to be fighting the battles of the past; he'd want us squarely focused on the future and how we're going to respond to Canadians' needs, and that's what we're doing tonight.\\" For a leader who'd been derisively dismissed by the Conservative campaign, the five election debates were a crucial proving ground. But the test was a long time coming. Fate and family fame had inexorably pushed Trudeau into the public sphere. His youngest brother Michel's death in a B.C. avalanche in 1998 made him a spokesman for avalanche safety. His emotional eulogy at his father's nationally televised funeral two years later further galvanized the attention. Acutely aware of the perception of political entitlement, Trudeau entered politics in the gritty Montreal riding of Papineau, where he defeated the Bloc Quebecois incumbent to become an MP in 2008. Along the way, Trudeau learned he was a natural at the glad-handing and baby-kissing of retail politics, unlike his aloof, ascetic father. Trudeau added public pugilist to his resume in March 2012 when he punched the lights out of Conservative Sen. Patrick Brazeau, an imposing figure with martial arts and military training, in a charity boxing match. In the strange alchemy of leadership politics, the three-round bout made Trudeau a contender. A year later it was a Liberal coronation when Trudeau won the leadership on the first ballot in April 2013, to become the sixth Liberal leader in seven years. He's been finding adoring crowds — and a buzzsaw of Conservative attack ads, NDP eye-rolling and skeptical media squinting — ever since. Too young. Too inexperienced. Too glib. Too rich. Too carefree. He volunteered that he'd accepted speaking fees, including from charitable organizations, while serving as an MP — an acknowledgment for which he was pilloried. He said he'd smoked pot, also as an MP, for which he was lampooned. He joked — publicly and ill-advisedly — about Russian aggression in Ukraine, dictatorial Chinese efficiency and phallic CF-18 fighter jets, sending his opponents into paroxysms of outraged I-told-you-so's. Liberal campaign co-chair resigns But Trudeau has also made a number of tough calls that too few of his detractors credit. As recently as this week, he threw his election campaign co-chair overboard after Dan Gagnier wrote to TransCanada advising the pipeline builder how to lobby a new government. He also literally shouted down his own supporters when they jeered repeated media questions on the controversy. \\"Hey, guys. Guys! Hey! We have respect for journalists in this country,\\" Trudeau snapped Thursday in Montreal. \\"They ask tough questions and they're supposed to. OK?\\" He came out hard and early against Quebec's charter of values, and against the Conservatives' popular niqab ban for citizenship ceremonies. He ordered Liberal MP expenses be put online for public viewing, booted Liberal senators from the party caucus, expelled two of his MPs following sexual harassment allegations and moved decisively to derail the influence and electoral hopes of some old-school, bare-knuckle Liberal brawlers. Trudeau has also attracted a roster of candidates with impressive credentials, from aboriginal leaders to Canadian Forces officers, international journalists and business leaders. He likes to say his campaign bid is based on platform and team, not name recognition — or presidential prophecy. Besides, who wants an endorsement from Richard Nixon? ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Justin Trudeau: \\"It's time for a change\\" Canada's Liberal Party has decisively won a general election, ending nearly a decade of Conservative rule. The centrist Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, started the campaign in third place but in a stunning turnaround now command a majority. Mr Trudeau, the 43-year-old son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, said Canadians had voted for real change. Incumbent Conservative PM Stephen Harper - in power since 2006 - has congratulated his rival. Justin Trudeau is son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, considered the father of modern Canada. Meet Justin Trudeau Young Canadians' hopes Seven key Trudeau policies Trudeau's to-do list Addressing jubilant supporters, Mr Trudeau said Canadians had \\"sent a clear message tonight: It's time for a change\\". \\"We beat fear with hope, we beat cynicism with hard work. Most of all we defeated the idea that Canadians should be satisfied with less. \\"This is what positive politics can do,\\" he said, also praising Mr Harper for his service to the country. During the 11-week election campaign, the Liberal Party said it would: Cut income taxes for middle-class Canadians while increasing them for the wealthy Run deficits for three years to pay for infrastructure spending Do more to address environmental concerns over the controversial Keystone oil pipeline Take in more Syrian refugees, and pull out of bombing raids against Islamic State while bolstering training for Iraqi forces Legalise marijuana Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Stephen Harper admits defeat Why Harper lost: Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Montreal It was a sweeping victory that seemed unthinkable five years ago, improbable just months ago and unlikely even a few days ago. When Mr Harper first announced that this year's general election campaign would be a record 78 days long, conventional wisdom was it would benefit the Conservatives, giving them more time to bring their financial advantages to bear. In hindsight, however, the lengthy campaign gave Mr Trudeau an opportunity to introduce himself to Canadians and overcome Conservative attacks that characterised the 43-year-old former high-school drama teacher as too inexperienced to lead the Canadian nation. Mr Trudeau also successfully outmanoeuvred the New Democratic Party, campaigning to that party's left on economic issues. For Mr Trudeau, the hard work of bringing the Liberal Party back from the ashes is over. Now, as the next prime minister of Canada, the even harder work of governing is about to begin. Trudeau brings Liberals back on top Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC watched election night events unfold in a bar in Montreal From austerity to deficit The economy loomed large during the campaign. Mr Harper highlighted his legacy of balanced budget and tax cuts, while Mr Trudeau pointed to sluggish growth to support his calls to boost demand through public spending. Mr Trudeau's infrastructure policy is projected to cost C10bn in the first two years, equivalent to 0.5% of Canada's GDP - tipping the federal budget into deficit. But, BBC business reporter Robert Plummer says, if the money is spent on the wrong kind of infrastructure, it may not do any good while saddling the government with unnecessary debt. Whatever happens, richer Canadians can expect to face a higher tax bill, handing over more than half their income in combined federal and provincial taxes, while ordinary folks can look forward to tax breaks. And in the short term, Mr Trudeau's policies may help stabilise the economy, making it unlikely that the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates further - meaning borrowing costs should remain low and house prices relatively high. What now for Harper? Mr Harper, one of the longest-serving Western leaders, had been seeking a rare fourth term. Speaking after the polls closed, he said he had congratulated Mr Trudeau, and that the Conservatives would accept the results \\"without hesitation\\". Mr Harper will stand down as Conservative leader but remain as an MP, his party says. There is no fixed transition period under Canada's constitution. Mr Trudeau is expected to be sworn in in a few weeks' times. Tom Mulcair of the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) said he had \\"congratulated Mr Trudeau on his exceptional achievement\\". The NDP is on course to win 44 seats, less than half the number they held in the outgoing parliament. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"In the news article, it talks about how Justin Trudeau became the leader of Canada's Liberal Party and eventually won the general election, ending almost a decade of Conservative rule.

Trump announced on Friday that he had chosen Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana as his running mate. Here is some background on Mr. Pence, who called himself “Rush Limbaugh on decaf” when he hosted a talk radio show and who quoted the Bible when he was in Congress. Experience: A six-term Indiana congressman, Mr. Pence was elected governor in 2012. He has ushered in big tax cuts and last year drew national attention for signing a “religious freedom” law that critics said allowed businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples. Childhood: The son of a gas station manager, Mr. Pence was an altar boy and once considered entering the priesthood. He was raised as a Catholic, though he now considers himself a born-again Christian. Family: Mr. Pence married his wife, Karen, in 1985. They have a son and two daughters. Education: Graduated from Hanover College, in Hanover, Ind., in 1981 and received a law degree from the Indiana University McKinney School of Law in 1986. How he could help Mr. Trump: Mr. Pence could appease social conservatives who remain wary of Mr. Trump, who also needs to do well in the Rust Belt. Mr. Pence would give him a strong footing in Indiana, a swing state. Mr. Pence, who is seen as averse to confrontational politics, could provide a counterweight to some of the harsher aspects of Mr. Trump’s personality. How he could hurt Mr. Trump: Mr. Pence’s conservative positions could turn off moderates and independents. He lacks national name recognition and he failed to deliver Indiana for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whom he supported in the state’s Republican primary, suggesting that his presence on the ticket might not be enough to tip the general election to Mr. Trump. Fun fact: The Pences are animal lovers and would bring their beagle, Maverick, and their two cats, Pickle and Oreo, to the vice-presidential residence. Governor Mike Pence of Indiana, who Donald J. Trump announced as his running mate on Friday, has a relatively low approval rating among governors. An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the law school Mike Pence graduated from in 1986.

Step 1: Energy builds up in the crust of the earth Justification: This occurs due to the continuous movement and interaction of the tectonic plates and the convection currents in the earth's mantle. Step 2: The energy causes the fault lines to give way Justification: When the energy build-up becomes too much, it overcomes the friction and resistance along the fault lines. Step 3: The earth's plates move Justification: After the fault lines give way, the plates slide or move resulting in a displacement. Step 4: The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions Justification: As the plates shift and the energy is released, the vibrations resulting from the movement radiate outwards.

The answer to the question: How many nautical miles does the does the coastal nation have sole exploitation rights over natural resources? is inside the article: \\"Freedom of the seas\\" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline.

But I , I had to come back to a home that looks exactly as the same as before you were gone . Answer the following question: Why is the narrator so sullen after a trip ?","completion":"In order to answer the question, let's break down the information provided step by step: Step 1: Understand the context The narrator mentioned two failed long-distance relationships. This implies that the narrator has experienced emotional pain and perhaps some disillusionment with relationships. Step 2: Analyze the situation The narrator mentioned that 'you' (the person they are talking about) came to their place to take a break from normal life. This suggests that the narrator and this person spent time together and perhaps developed a connection during this period. Step 3: Identify the emotions involved The narrator uses words like \\"reality weighs heavily upon my heart\\" and mentions that they return to a home that looks the same as before 'you' were gone. This indicates that the narrator feels sadness, loss, and a sense of emptiness after the person left. Step 4: Answer the question The narrator is so sullen after the trip because they have developed an emotional connection with the person who visited them, which has now ended. The visit may have temporarily filled the void left by their previous failed long-distance relationships. The person leaving to go back to their normal life has likely brought back feelings of loss and sadness for the narrator, reminding them of their previous experiences with relationships that didn't work out. Returning to a home that hasn't changed physically serves as a painful reminder that despite their emotional journey, nothing has changed in their surroundings, making the gap left by the departing visitor even more apparent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli . and the situation: Mike is studying for his biology exam. He found that all body cells are not equal in size - some are large and some are small. He labeled the large cells as class A cells. Then he labeled the small cells as class B cells.

Review: This movie is a mess, but at least it's not pretentious. The box art for the video markets it as a \\"fun throwback\\" to 1950s giant bug movies. In reality, it's a transparent bargain basement ripoff of \\"Aliens\\". The producers clearly wanted to make an \\"ALIEN\\" picture, but they mustn't have had much money. In fact, it doesn't look like they had ANY money, really. I hope everyone got paid who worked on this thing. The basic plot is retained--group of people isolated with murderous insectoid creature--and an earthbound location is inserted for budgetary reasons, I presume. Instead of setting the film in space, where no one can hear you scream, they set the film in a hospital, where everyone can see your budget laid bare. The amusing thing about \\"Blue Monkey\\" (and there is only one thing amusing about it) is, the filmmakers didn't abandon the \\"ALIEN\\" aesthetics. Even though we're in a hospital, we still have an improbably cavernous annex where science fiction experiments are being conducted, in this case the venerable \\"growth hormone\\" plot device. The annex also doubles as a boiler room (or something), so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth. The boiler room is so large that it is laced with multi-leveled steel catwalks, perfect for allowing slime to drip down between the slats. The idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a drooping flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location. He touches it and says \\"Ow\\", so we know he's been hurt. The cut on his finger causes him to lapse into unconsciousness in a matter of minutes, and at the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth (I guess in an \\"ALIEN\\" picture this would be called the \\"mouthburster\\"?). The worm is isolated, but some naughty little kids (leukemia patients) sneak up on it and \\"accidentally\\" give it some experimental growth hormone. You know everyone's in trouble when some fornicating hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a crane, and pretty soon a maintenance man finds some obligatory cocoons, right before he's grabbed by a pair of semi-convincing insectoid arms. The rest of the movie is dominated by the semi-offscreen monster, semi-obscured by the semi-darkness. Which brings us back to \\"ALIEN\\". How, you ask, can a movie set in a hospital incorporate all those flashing strobe lights that are always in the \\"ALIEN\\" movies? No problem...a power outage (or something) causes the electrical system to go awry, which apparently causes strobe lights to blossom in every room of the hospital and flicker constantly throughout the movie. This doubles as a convenient cloak for the less-than-special effects (although the bugs are pretty neat looking, they don't move too well, and the baby bug looks charmingly like a Cootie toy). OK, so what \\"ALIEN\\" bases haven't we covered...OH, water dripping down the walls! Check...we'll divide the massive hospital into two parts, then send some of the characters through the damp, drippy basement to get to the other side. Problem solved, we now have the opportunity for numerous \\"foreboding tunnel\\" shots. And don't forget the fog...well, you never really need an excuse for this in horror movies, do you? OK, maybe inside of a hospital you do, so we'll create smoke by having lots of things spark & burn. I haven't said anything about the negligible acting, not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow. I take it \\"Blue Monkey\\" was supposed to be lighthearted and fun, and if so then it is a nice try, but the pieces don't come together and the movie ends up being a real drag.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose only child was Lisa Marie? Presley's only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career. Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \\"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.\\" Dave Marsh calls the performance one of \\"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\\".By January 1969, the single \\"If I Can Dream\\", written for the special, reached number 12. The soundtrack album rose into the top ten. According to friend Jerry Schilling, the special reminded Presley of what \\"he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and...

I don't reckon the sun's ever come up quite the same since the day it happened. I've been watching it for years now and to me it still don't look right somehow. Maybe it's just me thinking it, sending myself doolally after what I've done. But I swear every morning it creeps up and it's looking at me, all knowing like. And when you reckon the sun's acting like that over you there isn't a right lot you can do about it, beyond burying yourself away like a mole in the soil. That's what I've been doing more or less in the score or so years that have gone by since. But however tight I shut them curtains to stop that damn sun lighting me up, it still don't stop the inside of my head from pounding out the truth. No way it's ever going to stop harassing me neither, not unless the deaf and dumb lass was to happen right back on my doorstep and give me the chance to tell her that it wasn't never meant to work out this way. The deaf and dumb lass went by the name of Mitzi Barker. Her being deaf and dumb, she was the kind of lass you went up the lane with if you didn't want no-one shouting their gob off about it after. Funny but it's the small things I recall best about her, like the way her hair reeked of bonfires and how that little old checkered dress of hers rode right up her thigh with no help from me. After we'd finished our business we'd head over the trout farm and I'd hunker down and poach us up a couple of rainbows for our tea.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: Linus suffers withdrawal after being separated from what? his blanket A:","completion":"Title: The Unraveling Thread Step 1: Introduce the protagonist, Linus, and establish the importance of his blanket Our protagonist, Linus, is a young man in his 20s who has had an intense emotional attachment to a particular blanket since childhood. The blanket is an old, worn, and frayed, yet intricately woven piece passed down through generations in his family. Linus relies on his blanket for comfort during times of stress and uncertainty. Step 2: Create a dramatic event that separates Linus from his blanket One day, while Linus is out, his apartment catches on fire due to an electrical fault. Linus returns home to find his apartment in ruins and his beloved blanket destroyed. Devastated, Linus goes through the motions of life but is overwhelmed by anxiety and loss without his security blanket. Step 3: Introduce a supporting character who pushes Linus to cope with the loss Linus's best friend, Emily, who has been supportive of him throughout their friendship, notices that Linus has changed since the loss of his blanket. She encourages Linus to face his fears by suggesting therapy to help cope with his withdrawal symptoms and anxiety. Step 4: Present a goal for Linus - recreate the blanket As part of his therapy, Linus's therapist suggests that he could rebuild the connection he had with the blanket by learning how to weave and recreating the blanket himself. Linus starts attending a weaving class, reluctantly at first, but slowly becomes more engrossed in the process. Step 5: Introduce a subplot - Linus discovers the origin of the blanket Linus finds a small, undamaged piece of his original blanket among the charred remains of his apartment and realizes that the design on the blanket is actually a map. Intrigued, Linus traces his family's history and discovers that his ancestors were skilled weavers who used their talents to hide vital information (like maps) within their creations. Step 6: Introduce a conflict - Linus must choose between recreating the blanket or revealing the map to its intended recipients Linus learns that the map woven into his ancestral blanket leads to a long-lost treasure that once belonged to a powerful but secretive group. Linus must choose between recreating the blanket as a means to regain personal comfort, or relinquishing the information to the secret group to protect them from a potential threat. Step 7: Climax - Linus makes a decision and faces the consequences Ultimately, Linus decides that the greater good is more important than his personal attachment to the blanket. He gives the map to the appropriate people within the secret group, who thank him for his sacrifice. Step 8: Resolution - Linus learns to cope without the blanket Linus continues attending therapy sessions and weaving classes, finding new ways to manage his anxiety. With the support of Emily and the confidence gained from his journey, Linus begins to live a fulfilling life without depending on the security of his childhood blanket. The Unraveling Thread is a heartfelt story about embracing change, personal growth, and overcoming emotional attachments and fears. Linus' journey is an inspiring tale of bravery and sacrifice, demonstrating the importance of self-discovery and the power of friendship."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Summarize this article: If you get into an argument with your child, don't let your ego get in the way of your relationship regardless of whether you are wrong or right. Try to remind yourself that you are the parent, and letting a fight drag on simply because you want to win is not good for your child or your relationship with them. Develop your conflict resolution skills. If you struggle with what to do when a problem arises between you and your child, then work on your conflict resolution skills. Developing ways to calm down, analyze the situation, and communicate effectively with your child will help to ensure that you do not behave like a toxic parent. Your child will likely forget about who won or lost a certain fight, but they will probably remember how your actions during that fight made them feel about you and themselves. Thus, it is important to be as mature as possible. Don't ignore your child or make them feel stupid. If you're not sure how to end a fight, try calmly telling your child you need a few minutes to yourself. Take this time to calm down if you need. When you've calmed down, return to your child, and apologize for fighting. You don't even need to bring up what the fight was about or who was right/wrong. If you can't bring yourself to apologize, you can at least say, “I don't like it when we fight. Let's go do something fun together instead.” Give them a hug, and remind them how much you love them. For many parents, this can be difficult to do, especially if you tend to be overcritical of yourself. Many parents criticize their children because they simply want them to be the best they can be without realizing how this makes the child feel about themselves. Thus, it's important to think before you speak when you talk with your child, especially when it comes to talking to them about their performance on something. Instead, act as a guide for your child. Remind yourself that your child is learning how to do things every day, and they need your help, not your judgments. If you have a hard time grasping this, think about how you feel when someone you love criticizes you. It probably doesn't make you feel good about yourself, even if you know it's not true. Even the most secure people don't enjoy being criticized. If your child is doing something that you think should be done differently, avoid saying something like, “That's such a dumb way to do that. Why would you think that's a good idea?” Instead, say something more positive such as, “You're doing great, can I show you how I normally do it? Then you can do it whichever way you prefer.” Remember that just because you do something a certain way doesn't mean it is the best way. Even if it is the best way, it's good to let your child have autonomy and figure some things out for themselves. One habit of many toxic parents is that they demand the attention of their children, especially when they are upset about something. Remind yourself, that, in your relationship with your child, you are not the center of attention, and your child probably doesn't have the maturity or coping skills to make you the center of their attention. Even if they do, it is not fair to expect your child to act as your caretaker. This doesn't mean that you can't be honest with your child about emotions you might be having. For example, if you are feeling sad and your child asks you what's wrong, you can tell them that you're feeling sad because something happened that you didn't want to happen. If it is appropriate, you can also tell them the reason you're sad. However, you should also remind your child that you'll be OK, you just need a bit of time to feel sad. You can do this rather than expect them to comfort you. Parenting is tough, so it is important to remember that making mistakes does not make you a toxic parent. Raising children can be very difficult, and occasionally, you might lose your cool. It is important to tell your child that you're sorry, remind them that you love them very much, and explain to them why you lost your temper, but make it clear that it wasn't because you think they are a bad kid. Forgive yourself. When you make a mistake, don't beat yourself up over it. You can reflect on what happened and why you think it happened in order to do better in the future, but it won't help you or your children to let yourself feel like a failure. Abuse is perhaps the worst thing that can happen to a child. The obvious forms of abuse are physical and sexual abuse. Both of these forms of abuse constitute completely unacceptable forms of behavior for a parent. However, a perhaps more common form of abuse is verbal abuse, which toxic parents are often guilty of using. This occurs whenever you say something to your child that harms their sense of self-worth or playing mind games aimed at putting you in control of your child's emotions. Verbal abuse may not leave physical signs that the abuse happened, but it certainly leaves emotional scars that may afflict your child for the rest of your life. Many parents aren't aware of the research, which makes it clear that spanking is just as harmful to a child's emotional well-being as other forms of physical abuse, such as slapping, punching, pinching, etc. If you have been spanking your child as a means of punishment, look for other, healthier ways to discipline your child for bad behavior. For example, take away a privilege and explain to them the reason that they have lost that privilege and when they can have it back. When it comes to child sexual abuse, any form of sexual touching between a child and an adult is considered sexual abuse. If you realize that you have been abusing your child either physically, sexually, or verbally, you should recognize that you have a problem and stop immediately. Seeking professional help for your issues is perhaps the best way to deal with anger and control issues. The first thing you need to do is understand what abuse is. Stop trying to rationalize your behavior. Yes, parenting is tough, but abusing is never a good (or acceptable) way to deal with your frustration no matter how mad you might be. In many cases, abusers often abuse because that's how they were raised. Getting professional help to learn how to better deal with your anger and emotions is often the best way to stop the cycle. One way to avoid abusing a child is to walk away from the situation when you feel that you are too frustrated or angry to deal with the situation rationally. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Summary:","completion":"This article says that when you argue with your child, it's important to not let your feelings get in the way and remember that you are the parent. You should work on solving problems together and being kind, instead of criticizing or ignoring them. It's also important to not expect your child to take care of you when you are upset. When you make a mistake, say sorry and forgive yourself.

There, Emily makes an apparently imaginary friend she calls \\"Charlie\\".

The band consists of Kelly Jones (lead vocals, lead guitar), Richard Jones (bass, piano, backing vocals), Adam Zindani (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Jamie Morrison (drums) and touring member Tony Kirkham (keyboards). The group previously included Stuart Cable (1992-2003) and then Javier Weyler (2004-2012) on drums. Stereophonics have released ten studio albums, including six UK number one albums. The band released their third album, Just Enough Education to Perform, in April 2001. The album included the track \\"Mr. Writer\\", which includes lyrics that criticise a critic who the band believe gave them a negative review. The album also contained one of the band's most famous tracks, \\"Have a Nice Day\\", which reached number five in the UK charts. To promote the new album, Just Enough Education to Perform, the Stereophonics played a two-day festival, which was called A Day at the Races. This event was held in Donington Park on the first day and at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on the second. The concerts were supported by Ash, Black Crowes and the Crocketts, with Proud Mary playing Donington only. Over 200,000 separate tickets were sold for the weekend festival. The performance was released on a DVD in 2002. 2003 saw the release of their fourth album, titled You Gotta Go There to Come Back. In September 2003, drummer Stuart Cable was sacked. According to reports, it was because of his lack of commitment to the band. Cable, at the time, presented a TV show called \\"Cable TV\\" and felt that the band would never improve. Because of this, he missed several rehearsals and live concerts. He was eventually replaced by Javier Weyler. Steve Gorman, from the Black Crowes, stood in for Cable during the band's live performances until Weyler was appointed. When asked about Cable leaving the band in a 2010 interview with Rip It Up magazine, Kelly Jones admitted to the difficulty of the situation. Towards the end of the year, Stereophonics did a sold-out tour of the UK, ending with a Christmas show at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, supported by Feeder, Ocean Colour Scene and Adam Masterson. The show was closed with a live version of \\"Merry Xmas Everybody\\", originally recorded by Slade.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name whose older sister hears nothing but praise from their mother? Connie Wyatt is a restless 15-year-old who is anxious to explore the pleasures of her sexual awakening. Before she enters her sophomore year in high school, she spends the summer moping around her family farm house. She suffers from her mother's put-downs, while hearing nothing but praise for her older sister, June. Her father somehow manages to float around the family tensions. She also helps paint the cottage, just as her mother constantly demands her to. Connie passes the time cruising the local shopping mall with her friends and flirting with boys. When an actual date leads to heavy petting, however, she flees from the boy's car. At a hamburger joint, an older man confides to her, \\"I'm watching you!\\" and proves it soon after. One afternoon, her mother and June warn Connie to be careful with her flirting, and she is left alone in the house, while her family goes to a barbecue. Later, as Connie is playing around the house, a man who calls himself Arnold Friend approaches her in a 1960s convertible with that name painted on it and identifies himself as \\"A. Friend\\". He dresses and acts like James Dean, and name-drops several teenybopper acts, even though he is much older than she is. He comes off very kind and friendly, but a bit suspicious, alternating between talking to her in a warm, seductive voice and shouting insults to his fellow car passenger when he asks Arnold if he should \\"pull out the phone,\\" possibly to keep her from calling the police. Arnold tells Connie about how he has been watching her and that he knows all about her, recounting the details about her family's barbecue plans with amazing accuracy. He then starts talking about how he could be her lover. She starts to get scared and tells him to go, but he coerces her into going with him, threatening to burn down the house, while his friend remains at the house, supposedly to watch over it while they are gone.

By eliminating ads, App.net envisions a social platform where users can enjoy a more organic and authentic experience. They believe that by charging a fee, they can offer superior service while maintaining user privacy and satisfaction. This also allows them to focus solely on fostering meaningful connections and conversations between users, without the driving force of profits from advertising. Moreover, by opening up the platform to developers, App.net encourages innovative new features and improvements to be created by third-party developers. This could result in a more diverse and robust ecosystem that caters to user needs, allowing the platform to stay ahead in terms of technological advancements and user experience. This collaborative approach invites creativity and enables the development of custom applications to enhance the social network's functionality. App.net's model could potentially revolutionize social media by proving that users are willing to pay for a premium ad-free experience, leading to other platforms following suit. This shift could create an online environment where users have greater control over their own data and experience while empowering creators and developers to push the boundaries of social media innovation. However, it's worth noting that this model might not be appealing to everyone. For some users, the 50 annual fee may seem too steep, especially considering how many social media platforms are available free of charge. Additionally, the reliance on developers to improve and evolve the platform might lead to inconsistencies or slow growth in new features and improvements compared to competitor platforms that monetize through advertising and invest heavily in in-house development. Regardless of whether App.net ultimately succeeds in making a lasting impact, it serves as an intriguing exploration of the potential for ad-free, user-centered social media. As concerns surrounding data privacy and advertising overload continue to grow, companies and users may increasingly turn to alternative platforms that prioritize user experience and offer innovative models that shift away from ad-supported revenue streams."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Several state holidays, such as Independence Day and Victory Day, draw big crowds and often include displays such as fireworks and military parades, especially in Vitebsk and Minsk. The government's Ministry of Culture finances events promoting Belarusian arts and culture both inside and outside the country. Belarusian literature began with 11th- to 13th-century religious scripture, such as the 12th-century poetry of Cyril of Turaw.By the 16th century, Polotsk resident Francysk Skaryna translated the Bible into Belarusian. It was published in Prague and Vilnius sometime between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe. The modern era of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century; one prominent writer was Yanka Kupala. Many Belarusian writers of the time, such as Uładzimir Žyłka, Kazimir Svayak, Yakub Kolas, Źmitrok Biadula, and Maksim Haretski, wrote for Nasha Niva, a Belarusian-language paper published that was previously published in Vilnius but now is published in Minsk.

Joel went to the supermarket to go grocery shopping for Justin, because Select from the following. +Joel is his father. +Justin is his father.","completion":"Joel went to the supermarket to go grocery shopping for Justin, because Joel is his father. In this sentence, Joel takes on the role of a caring and responsible father, ensuring that his son Justin has everything he needs in terms of groceries and nourishment. By performing this act of care and service, Joel is demonstrating his love and commitment to his child's well-being and ensuring that he is providing for his family, something a father might typically be expected to do. This sentence highlights the relationship between Joel and Justin, emphasizing the parental bond between them. The act of grocery shopping may seem like a mundane task, but it carries a deeper meaning as it reflects the daily responsibilities and sacrifices that parents often make for their children, and serves as a way to bond and establish trust in the relationship. By mentioning that Joel is shopping for Justin, the author makes it clear that the father is providing for the son, and this act of kindness and support forms an essential part of the relationship. Moreover, the act of grocery shopping for someone else can also indicate a willingness to sacrifice one's time and energy for the benefit of another person. This further establishes the deep bond between the two characters, with Joel displaying his affection and commitment towards Justin in a simple, yet meaningful way. On the other hand, if the sentence ended with \\"Justin is his father,\\" it would complicate the relationship between the two characters, potentially implying that Justin is the one who should be responsible for the grocery shopping or other chores. This alternative ending could still signify a strong bond between the characters. However, it would potentially suggest a closer examination of their roles and responsibilities within their family dynamics. Overall, the sentence ending with \\"Joel is his father\\" strengthens the connection between the two characters and showcases the care, love, and responsibility a father often has towards his child. By completing this task, Joel is not only helping Justin but is also building the trust and connection which form the foundation of their relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Set up fans so that they are diagonal and create a airflow. They should run almost constantly during the winter months, to ensure the entire greenhouse is benefiting from the heater. They can also be located near the top of the supports. Some ventilation of carbon dioxide is essential. The vents should be adjustable. You will need to open them wider in the summer months. Solar heat may only account for 25 percent of the heat in your greenhouse, so a backup heater is essential. You can also use a wood or oil-based heater, but it must be vented to the outside to ensure good air quality, carbon dioxide poising is a real danger to be looked out for in such a close space. You should check with your town or council to see what heating options are available in your area. If you can afford to outfit your greenhouse with its own temperature control system, then you can set it up to grow almost anything. Employ an electrician and a contractor to install your system. It may need regular maintenance to ensure it can handle ventilation and heating in the winter. You should install several thermometers in case 1 breaks. Place them at different levels of the greenhouse so that you can observe the temperature in your greenhouse at all times. You can buy a thermometer that measures the temperature inside your house and inside your greenhouse, so that you can watch it closely during the winter months. Summary:","completion":"Set up diagonal fans to create airflow and run them constantly during winter for even heating. Ensure proper ventilation of carbon dioxide with adjustable vents, which should be opened wider in summer. Solar heat may cover only 25% of heating needs, so a backup heater is necessary.

In this case, we will move the -4v term from the left side of the equation to the right side by adding 4v to both sides. -4*v - 170 + 4*v = -38*v + 4*v The new equation becomes: -170 = -34*v Step 2: Solve for the variable v. To solve for v, we need to isolate it. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -34. -170 / -34 = -34*v / -34 The new equation: 5 = v Thus, the solution to the math problem -4*v - 170 = -38*v is v = 5."},{"prompt":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Bull Durham Movie plot: \\"Crash\\" Davis (Costner), a veteran of 12 years in minor league baseball, is sent down to the single-A Durham Bulls for a specific purpose: to educate hotshot rookie pitcher Ebby Calvin LaLoosh (Robbins, playing a character loosely based on Steve Dalkowski)[2][3] about becoming a major-league talent, and to control Ebby's haphazard pitching. Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of \\"Meat\\", and they get off to a rocky start. Thrown into the mix is Annie (Sarandon), a \\"baseball groupie\\" and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the \\"Church of Baseball\\" and has, every year, chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student. Annie flirts with both Crash and Ebby and invites them to her house, but Crash walks out, saying he's too much a veteran to \\"try out\\" for anything. Before he leaves, Crash further sparks Annie's interest with a memorable speech listing the things he \\"believes in\\", ending with \\"I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days... Good night\\". Despite some animosity between them, Annie and Crash work, in their own ways, to shape Ebby into a big-league pitcher. Annie plays mild bondage games, reads poetry to him, and gets him to think in different ways (and gives him the nickname \\"Nuke\\"). Crash forces Nuke to learn \\"not to think\\" by letting the catcher make the pitching calls (memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after Nuke rejects his calls), and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his \\"heat\\" (fastballs). Crash also talks about the pleasure of life in \\"The Show\\" (Major League Baseball), which he briefly lived for \\"the 21 greatest days of my life\\" and to which he has tried for years to return. Meanwhile, as Nuke matures, the relationship between Annie and Crash grows, until it becomes obvious that the two of them are a more appropriate match, except for the fact that Annie and Nuke are currently a couple.
