Schalke 04 attacking midfielder Julian Draxler will be out for the rest of the year after picking up a thigh injury in their 1-0 win over Augsburg on Friday, the club said on Saturday. Germany's talented World Cup winner lasted only 11 seconds from the start of the Bundesliga game, pulling a thigh muscle, with sports director Horst Heldt saying it looked serious. 'He was again injured and it looks like a serious muscle injury,' Heldt said. 'I do not expect Julian to play any more in this first half of the season.' Julian draxler (centre) picked up the injury just 11 seconds into Schalke's 1-0 win over Augsburg. The 21-year-old (pictured) is likely to miss the rest of 2014 after picking up a thigh injury on Friday. The news will come as a massive blow to new manager Roberto Di Matteo as the young attacking midfielder is an influential member of the Schalke side. Draxler has been heavily linked with a move away from the Gelsenkirchen club in recent transfer windows with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger a keen admirer of the Germany international's talents. The 21-year-old is set to miss their remaining three Champions League group games plus Germany's Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar and friendly against Spain next month. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Julian Draxler, the attacking midfielder for Schalke 04, will be sidelined for the rest of the year due to a thigh injury he sustained during a recent 1-0 victory over Augsburg. This unfortunate incident took place just 11 seconds into the Bundesliga game, and Schalke's sports director, Horst Heldt, confirmed that the injury appeared to be severe. The 21-year-old midfielder is a valuable addition to their team, having played a notable role in Germany's World Cup win. His absence is a considerable blow to Schalke's new manager, Roberto Di Matteo, as Draxler serves as a crucial member to the team's success. The young talent's exemplary performance on the field has caught the attention of various European clubs, with Arsenal being among them. Their interest hasn't gone unnoticed, and Arsène Wenger, Arsenal's manager, has been vocal in expressing his admiration for Draxler's skills. Unfortunately, the timing of this injury is incredibly inconvenient for both Schalke and the German national team. As a result, Draxler will be forced to miss the remaining three Champions League group matches as well as Germany's Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar and their friendly match with Spain next month. Though Draxler's injury poses challenges for both his club and national team, it provides an opportunity for other players to step up and demonstrate their capabilities. The Schalke management and fans will be eager to see Draxler return to the field in full strength once he recovers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Geo TV owners print front-page apology to Pakistan's ISI spy chief Hamid Mir, who survived an attack by gumen in Karachi, is surrounded by fellow journalists after his appearance before a judicial commission. Photograph: T Mughal/EPA Pakistan's embattled media group printed a grovelling front-page apology to the army on Monday after allegations broadcast by Geo TV that the country's spy chief had plotted to assassinate one of the channel's star journalists. The apology came two days before an anticipated ruling by the broadcast regulator on the affair and marked a clear retreat by a media conglomerate after weeks of bruising public criticism from the army, opposition politicians, extremist clerics and media rivals. The text, printed in English on the front page of the News and in Urdu in the bestselling Daily Jang, said its coverage of a gun attack in Karachi that seriously injured journalist Hamid Mir in April had been \\"excessive, distressful and emotional\\". After the shooting of Mir, Geo TV had responded by giving prominence in its hours of coverage to the allegations from Mir's brother that Zaheer-ul-Islam, the head of military spy agency the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate (ISI), had ordered the assassination attempt. The company said it deeply apologised to the ISI chief and his family. It also insisted that it has \\"the greatest regard and respect for the armed forces of Pakistan and its leadership\\". Initially Geo had put up a vigorous defence of its actions but its position has progressively weakened as the weeks have gone by. At the behest of the army the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) was asked to consider banning Geo. Under military pressure many cable companies dropped or downgraded Geo, overturning the channels once dominant audience share. And other private channels have ripped into their main rival, accusing it of betraying the country. Clerics have also accused Geo of broadcasting blasphemous material in a light entertainment show – a move that potentially put the group's journalists at risk from violent retaliation. The furore has aggravated an increasingly acrimonious relationship between Pakistan's civilian government and the army, with many assuming Geo had received the backing of the ruling party to attack the ISI. Pemra is set make a decision on the army's complaint against Geo on Wednesday. Although Geo framed the row as merely one of the \\"ups and downs\\" of any other \\"relationship\\" and said it was time to move forward, many analysts believe the military establishment will not be satisfied with an apology alone.

The parents notice that the elderly family dog is not well, and express concern about it dying and how sad their daughter would be. It can be replaced by Repet, an animal cloning service, but Adam doesn't trust clones. Cloning knowledge is held by the multinational corporation Replacement Technologies. Human cloning is technically possible, but illegal. Adam thinks his daughter should just learn to accept death as a part of life, rather than being cushioned from it.Arriving at his helicopter piloting business, he and his partner Hank Morgan (Michael Rapaport) learn they are to transport Replacement Technologies CEO Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I have a new situation: In sub-Saharan Africa there are two predominant groups of antelope present. The first group of antelope, group A, have long necks and strong teeth. The second group of antelope, group B, have shorter necks and weaker teeth. Because of their longer necks and stronger teeth, the antelope from group A are more easily able to pick fruit and leaves from the tall trees in the region compared to antelope from group B. But I can use this background: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. What is an answer for this question: Which group of antelope is more adapted to the environment? The answer is:","completion":"Based on the description of the two groups of antelope in sub-Saharan Africa and the background information on the theory of evolution by natural selection, it can be concluded that Group A, the antelopes with long necks and strong teeth, are more adapted to the environment. This conclusion is drawn based on several key factors outlined in the information provided: 1. Adaptation: As the theory of evolution by natural selection suggests, organisms with heritable traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction in their environment are more likely to be successful in passing on their genes to the next generation. In the case of the antelopes in sub-Saharan Africa, the long necks and strong teeth of Group A provide them with better access to food sources from tall trees, such as fruits and leaves. This increased accessibility to resources is a clear advantage for their survival in this particular environment. 2. Environmental conditions: The sub-Saharan Africa region, where these antelopes are found, consists of tall trees, which serve as primary food sources for the herbivorous animals living there. As Group A has an easier time reaching these food sources with their long necks and strong teeth, they are better suited to thrive in this environment compared to Group B, which possesses shorter necks and weaker teeth and would, therefore, face more difficulty in accessing food from tall trees. 3. Fitness and reproductive success: The theory of natural selection emphasizes the importance of \\"fitness\\" in determining the survival and reproductive success of organisms in a particular environment. Since Group A antelopes are better adapted to the sub-Saharan environment due to their advantageous traits, they are more likely to have greater reproductive success than their Group B counterparts. Over time, this would result in the genes associated with long necks and strong teeth becoming more common in the antelope population. In conclusion, the antelopes from Group A in sub-Saharan Africa are more adapted to their environment due to the combination of their advantageous traits, specifically their long necks and strong teeth, which enable them to access food resources more readily than the antelopes from Group B. This increased adaptation, combined with the principles of natural selection, suggests that over time, the prevalence of these advantageous traits will likely increase in the antelope population within this region, due to the greater fitness and reproductive success exhibited by Group A."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Both the original and this remake were (allegedly) shot in one take with no actual cuts or edits with a single camera, similar to the 1948 experimental film 'Rope' by Alfred Hitchcock.We begin with an overhead shot of a young woman, Sarah (Elizabeth Olsen) sitting on some rocks in a lake. As she gets off and begins to hop among the rocks back to the shore, the camera descends and begins following Sarah in real-time. She walks up to an obviously dilapidated house. The house is three stories tall and has red-brick exteriors with all of the windows boarded up. Sarah's father John (Adam Trese) meets her near the front steps and tells her sternly to pick up the gardening tools lying about. John then asks Sarah about her Facebook profile, and she admits that her ex-boyfriend may want to get back together with her, much to John's disapproval.John's younger brother and Sarah's Uncle Peter (Eric Sheffer Stevens) walks through the front door and greets the two of them. He says that there is a big problem in the house. They walk in, and though it is daylight outside, the house is almost pitch black as all the windows are boarded.

When he was three months old, he was adopted by real estate appraiser Howard Dunham, and his homemaker wife Joyce, who raised him in a devoutly Presbyterian household in an affluent Dallas neighborhood, as an only child. He began ventriloquism in 1970 at age eight, when his parents gave him a Mortimer Snerd dummy for Christmas, and an accompanying how-to album. The next day he checked out a how-to book on ventriloquism from the library, and explained in 2011 that he still had it, remarking that he was \\"a thief in the third grade\\". On July 18, 2003, Dunham appeared on Comedy Central Presents, his first solo appearance on Comedy Central. During his half hour piece, he showcased Jose Jalapeno on a Stick, Walter, an early version of Melvin the Superhero Guy and Peanut, whom Dunham had begun to merchandise into a line of dolls. The appearance was successful, but Comedy Central resisted giving Dunham more airtime, feeling that he was not a good fit for them. By 2005 Dunham decided to gamble on financing his own comedy DVD, Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself, which was taped in Santa Ana, California. Dunham's manager, Judi Brown-Marmel, lobbied the network to air it, pointing to Dunham's drawing power and merchandising profits, and arguing that the network needed more diverse content. Surprised by the high ratings of the first Blue Collar Comics concert movie that same year, the network began to reconsider its brand. In late 2006, Comedy Central aired Arguing with Myself, drawing two million viewers when it aired, and selling two million DVDs. In 2007, Dunham appeared as The Amazing Ken with Jose Jalapeno on a Stick in the Larry the Cable Guy feature film Delta Farce. His second special, Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity, was taped at the Warner Theater in Washington, D.C. that same year. It served not only to cement Dunham's stardom, but to introduce his most controversial character, Achmed the Dead Terrorist, which became a viral Internet sensation. A clip of Achmed from Insanity attracted over 140 million hits on YouTube, making it the ninth most watched clip on that website as of October 2009. By 2008, Dunham's characters had crossed language barriers, with his specials dubbed for audiences in various countries such as France, and Dunham attracting requests for performances in South Africa, Australia, Norway, Denmark, China, and the Middle East. Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special was taped at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin that same year, and premiered on Comedy Central on November 16, 2008, watched by 6.6 million people. It became available on DVD and Blu-ray on November 18, 2008. The special's premiere was the highest rated telecast in Comedy Central's history. In September 2008, his career reached new heights as he began performing in arenas filled with tens of thousands of people. Dunham was somewhat wary of such large venues, but adapted by adjusting the timing of his often rapid exchanges with the puppets so that audience members farthest from the stage could have time to react. In addition to his comedy specials, Dunham also released his first music album, Don't Come Home for Christmas, on November 4, 2008. It contains original Christmas songs as well as a parody of \\"Jingle Bells\\" by Achmed entitled \\"Jingle Bombs\\".

Elbridge Gerry was born on July 17, 1744, in Marblehead, Massachusetts. His father, Thomas Gerry, was a merchant operating ships out of Marblehead, and his mother, Elizabeth (Greenleaf) Gerry, was the daughter of a successful Boston merchant. Gerry's first name came from John Elbridge, one of his mother's ancestors. Gerry's parents had eleven children in all, although only five survived to adulthood. Gerry was from an early time a vocal opponent of Parliamentary efforts to tax the colonies after the French and Indian War ended in 1763. In 1770 he sat on a Marblehead committee that sought to enforce importation bans on taxed British goods. He frequently communicated with other Massachusetts opponents of British policy, including Samuel Adams, John Adams, Mercy Otis Warren, and others. In May 1772 he won election to the Great and General Court of the Province of Massachusetts Bay (its legislative assembly). There he worked closely with Samuel Adams to advance colonial opposition to Parliamentary colonial policies. He was responsible for establishing Marblehead's committee of correspondence, one of the first to be set up after that of Boston. However, an incident of mob action prompted him to resign from the committee the next year. Gerry and other prominent Marbleheaders had established a hospital for performing smallpox inoculations on Cat Island; because the means of transmission of the disease were not known at the time, fears amongst the local population led to protests which escalated into violence that wrecked the facilities and threatened the proprietors' other properties. Gerry reentered politics after the Boston Port Act closed that city's port in 1774, and Marblehead became a port to which relief supplies from other colonies could be delivered.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere. I am facing a new situation today: In the year 1630 during the month of January Captain Cook began his voyage from the port of Calais in Europe, which is in the Northern Hemisphere. His intention was to find the mythical land in the Southern Hemisphere. After about eleven months of sailing, in December 1630, he reached Australia, which is indeed in the Southern Hemisphere. Thinking he finally reached the mythical land, he commenced his return voyage to Europe on June, 1631, He reached Europe in the middle of the following year on July, 1632. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which place received less direct sunlight when Captain Cook started his voyage to the mythical land in 1630, Europe or Australia? A:","completion":"When Captain Cook began his voyage in January 1630, Europe, located in the Northern Hemisphere, was receiving less direct sunlight compared to Australia, which is located in the Southern Hemisphere. As mentioned in the background article, during November, December, and January, the Southern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. These months are considered the warmest in the Southern Hemisphere due to the increased solar flux caused by Earth's axial tilt. Therefore, in January 1630, Australia would have been in the midst of its warmest season, experiencing increased exposure to direct sunlight. On the other hand, the Northern Hemisphere, where Europe is located, experiences increased direct sunlight in the months of May, June, and July. Since Captain Cook's voyage began in January, Europe was in the colder part of the year, when the Northern Hemisphere receives less direct sunlight. The axial tilt of the Earth during this period would have placed Europe further away from the Sun, resulting in reduced solar flux and cooler temperatures. In conclusion, based on the background information and understanding of Earth's axial tilt and seasonal changes, Europe received less direct sunlight than Australia when Captain Cook started his voyage to the mythical land in 1630."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Movie plot: Lord Voldemort, an evil and powerful dark wizard, has just been defeated. When he tried to kill a one-year-old boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the killing curse rebounded upon him, destroying his body. Harry is left an orphan with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Voldemort having killed his parents, Lily (Geraldine Somerville) and James (Adrian Rawlins) Potter. Professors Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) and Gamekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) leave him on the doorstep of his ultra-conventional, insensitive, negligent Muggle (non-magical) relatives, the Dursley family, who take him in. Harry's relatives decide to conceal his magical heritage from him and make him live in a cupboard under the stairs for ten years.Shortly before Harry's eleventh birthday, he receives a letter addressed specifically to him. His outraged uncle, however, reads and burns it before Harry has a chance to look at the contents. The sender does not give up, and the Dursleys receive successively larger numbers of the same correspondence. Soon, his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) becomes so paranoid that the Dursleys, with Harry in tow, hide in a hut on a small island to escape. That night (which happens to be before Harry's birthday), he is visited by an enormous man named Hagrid who bursts through the locked door of the hut. With Hagrid holding the Dursleys at bay, Harry finally reads his letter, in which he learns he has been invited to study magic at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The next day Harry and Hagrid head to Diagon Alley in London (the secret magical location hidden behind the famous wizarding pub The Leaky Cauldron).

Answer:","completion":"Quidditch is a fictional sport invented by author J.K. Rowling in the Harry Potter series. It is a popular and highly competitive sport in the wizarding world, played by witches and wizards on flying broomsticks. The game consists of two teams, each with seven players: three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper, and one Seeker. The objective of the game is to score points by getting the Quaffle, a ball, through one of the three opposing team's hoops, while the opposing team's Keeper tries to block the shots. Chasers are responsible for passing the Quaffle and scoring goals. Meanwhile, Beaters use bats to hit Bludgers, which are two enchanted balls that fly around the field trying to knock players off their brooms. The Beaters' role is to protect their teammates from the Bludgers and attempt to direct them towards the opposing team. The most important ball in the game is the Golden Snitch, a small winged ball that the Seeker on each team tries to catch. Catching the Snitch is worth 150 points and ends the game. The team whose Seeker catches the Snitch usually wins the game, but there are instances where a team can still lose even after catching the Snitch if the opposing team has a higher score. Quidditch is played extensively throughout the Harry Potter series and is a significant part of the students' life at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, with inter-house competitions and international events like the Quidditch World Cup."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What size pea plants will result when a pure tall plant is crossed with a pure short plant?","completion":"When examining the inheritance of traits in pea plants, Gregor Mendel's principles of genetics can be applied to explain how the offspring will inherit the specific trait. In this case, we are looking at the height of pea plants – where the allele for tall (T) is dominant over the allele for short (t). To understand the resulting size of pea plants when a pure tall plant is crossed with a pure short plant, we first need to know the genotypes of both parental plants. A pure tall plant will have the genotype TT, meaning it possesses two dominant alleles for the trait of height. A pure short plant, on the other hand, will have the genotype tt, carrying two recessive alleles for the height trait. When the tall plant (TT) is crossed with the short plant (tt), the offspring's genotype and phenotype can be predicted using a basic genetic tool called a Punnett Square. T | t ----- T | t The Punnett Square is divided into four sections, representing each possible combination of alleles that the offspring can inherit. Based on this simple cross, we have the following combinations: 1. Tt – Tall (from the first row and first column) 2. Tt – Tall (from the first row and second column) 3. Tt – Tall (from the second row and first column) 4. Tt – Tall (from the second row and second column) As a result, all four possible offspring will have the genotype Tt and will exhibit the tall phenotype. This is because the dominant allele (T) is expressed in their genotype, masking the effects of the recessive allele (t). These offspring are considered heterozygous for the height trait, as they possess one dominant allele and one recessive allele. In conclusion, when crossing a pure tall pea plant (TT) with a pure short pea plant (tt), all offspring will exhibit the tall phenotype due to the presence of the dominant allele (T) in their genotype (Tt)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Huddie William Ledbetter (January 20, 1888 - December 6, 1949) was an American folk and blues musician notable for his strong vocals, virtuosity on the twelve-string guitar, and the folk standards he introduced. He is best known as Lead Belly. Though many releases credit him as \\"Leadbelly\\", he himself wrote it as \\"Lead Belly\\", which is also the spelling on his tombstone and the spelling used by the Lead Belly Foundation. Context: Lead Belly was born Huddie William Ledbetter on the Jeter Plantation near Mooringsport, Louisiana, on January 20, 1888 or 1889 (generally accepted to be the former). The 1900 United States Census lists \\"Hudy Ledbetter\\" as 12 years old, born January 1888, and the 1910 and 1930 censuses also give his age as corresponding to a birth in 1888. The 1940 census lists his age as 51, with information supplied by wife Martha. However, in April 1942, when Ledbetter filled out his World War II draft registration, he gave his birth date as January 23, 1889, and his birthplace as Freeport, Louisiana (\\"Shreveport\\"). His grave marker bears the date given on his draft registration. Ledbetter was the younger of two children born to Wesley Ledbetter and Sallie Brown. The pronunciation of his name is purported to be \\"HYEW-dee\\" or \\"HUGH-dee.\\" He can be heard pronouncing his name as \\"HUH-dee\\" on the track \\"Boll Weevil,\\" from the Smithsonian Folkways album Lead Belly Sings for Children. His parents had cohabited for several years, but they legally married on February 26, 1888. When Huddie was five years old, the family settled in Bowie County, Texas. The 1910 census of Harrison County, Texas, shows \\"Hudy\\" Ledbetter living next door to his parents with his first wife, Aletha \\"Lethe\\" Henderson. Aletha is registered as age 19 and married one year. Others say she was 15 when they married in 1908. It was in Texas that Ledbetter received his first instrument, an accordion, from his uncle Terrell. By his early twenties, having fathered at least two children, Ledbetter left home to make his living as a guitarist and occasional laborer. When Lead Belly was released from his last prison sentence, the United States was deep in the Great Depression, and jobs were very scarce. In September 1934, in need of regular work in order to avoid cancellation of his release from prison, Lead Belly asked John Lomax to take him on as a driver. For three months, he assisted the 67-year-old in his folk song collecting around the South (Alan Lomax was ill and did not accompany his father on this trip). Question: What kind of music style did he play?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Lead Belly played a music style called folk and blues. His songs had strong singing and he was really good at playing a twelve-string guitar. He also taught people new folk songs that became very popular.

Kurt is in love with Ray and asks her to marry him, but she refuses because while she likes Kurt, she doesn't return his romantic feelings. While visiting the train station with Kurt, Ray meets Walter Saxel and the two fall for each other at first sight. Walter soon confesses to Ray that he is actually engaged to another woman in town, Corinne, who comes from a wealthy background and whose mother is friends with his own mother. Nevertheless he has fallen in love with Ray, and asks her to meet him at a local band concert that he will be attending with his mother. Walter hopes to introduce Ray to his mother and perhaps get her approval of the relationship. On the day of the concert, Ray is late arriving because her younger half-sister Freda is suicidal over her boyfriend, Hugo, leaving town. Freda begs Ray to go after Hugo and stop him, threatening to throw herself out a window if Ray does not help. By the time Ray has dealt with Freda's situation and gotten to the concert, it is over, and Ray cannot find Walter or his mother in the departing crowds. Walter, thinking she stood him up, writes her an angry letter and marries Corinne., what would be the answer ?

Fact 2: Day and night temperatures varied widely. Given the two facts above, a planet rotating causes?","completion":"Given the two facts: 1. A planet rotating causes cycles of day and night on that planet 2. Day and night temperatures vary widely From these facts, we can infer that a planet's rotation causes changes in temperature on its surface. Here's why: Earth's rotation provides an example. As it rotates on its axis (an imaginary line passing through the North and South Poles), the planet experiences periods of daylight and darkness--days and nights. This cycle is due to one portion of the planet facing the Sun (daytime) while the other half is turned away from the Sun (nighttime). During the daylight hours, the portion of Earth exposed to the Sun receives sunlight and therefore heats up. This causes that part of the Earth to experience generally warmer temperatures, often translated into \\"daytime\\" temperatures. During the nighttime hours, the portion of Earth turned away from the Sun is not receiving sunlight. Consequently, it cools down because no new heat is being received, and the heat that was accumulated during the day is gradually being lost to space. This results in cooler temperatures, often referred to as \\"nighttime\\" temperatures. On any planet, not just Earth, this rotation and subsequent exposure or lack of exposure to a heat source like a star, would cause significant variations in temperature between the day and night sides of the planet. Therefore, a rotating planet's cyclical exposure to its star (like the Sun for Earth) would cause variations in temperature—typically warmer temperatures during its day when the planet is exposed to its star, and colder temperatures during its night when the planet is not exposed to its star."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Trying to end a two-game losing streak, the Giants went into Lincoln Financial Field for a crucial Week 8 game with the Philadelphia Eagles, as the divisional lead was up for grabs. New York trailed greatly in the first quarter as Eagles fullback Leonard Weaver got a 41-yard touchdown run, followed by quarterback Donovan McNabb's 17-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brent Celek (with a blocked PAT). Philadelphia would add onto their lead in the second quarter with a 30-yard field goal from kicker David Akers. The Giants would get on the board as quarterback Eli Manning found tight end Kevin Boss on an 18-yard touchdown pass, but the Eagles continued their scoring as McNabb completed a 54-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeSean Jackson and a 23-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jeremy Maclin. Philadelphia would begin the third quarter with an increase to their lead as Akers nailed a 35-yard field goal. New York tried to rally as kicker Lawrence Tynes booted a 35-yard field goal, followed by running back Ahmad Bradshaw. However, the Eagles would seal the win in the fourth quarter as running back LeSean McCoy got a 66-yard touchdown run. How many yards difference was Donovan McNabb's touchdown pass to Brent Celek compared to his touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson?","completion":"Imagine a football field where the players are trying to score points by moving the ball to the other side. The Giants and the Eagles were two teams playing a game. Donovan McNabb is the leader of the Eagles, and he threw the ball two times to his friends, Brent Celek and DeSean Jackson, to help them score. When he threw the ball to Brent Celek, they gained 17 yards, like taking 17 big steps on the field. Later, when he threw the ball to DeSean Jackson, they gained 54 yards, which is like taking 54 big steps. Now, to find the difference between these two throws, you can think of it as counting the steps between 17 and 54. You can do this by subtracting the smaller number (17) from the bigger number (54): 54 - 17. If you count on your fingers, or use toys or crayons to help you count, you will find that the difference is 37 yards. So Donovan McNabb's touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson went 37 yards more than his pass to Brent Celek."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Given the below context: Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the turbine spins less quickly happens, how will it affect LESS salt being removed from the water. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let us first break it down step-by-step and justify the effect of a slower spinning turbine on the salt removal process. 1. Water is heated: The heating of water is crucial for the evaporation process. A slower spinning turbine would not directly affect this step, as the heat source is typically separate from the turbine. 2. The heated water evaporates: The evaporation process depends on the temperature and surface area of the water, not the speed of the turbine. Therefore, a slower spinning turbine would not have a direct impact on this step. 3. The salt is left behind: As the water evaporates, the dissolved salt remains in the original container. This step is not dependent on the turbine speed, so a slower spinning turbine would not directly affect the amount of salt left behind. 4. The evaporated water condenses on a cold surface: The rate of condensation may be slightly affected by the air flow produced by the spinning turbine. If the turbine spins less quickly, it may result in reduced air circulation, which could potentially slow down the condensation process. However, this effect would be minimal and not significantly impact the overall salt removal process. 5. The evaporated water is collected: The slower spinning turbine may have an indirect effect on collecting evaporated water, as it could slightly extend the time needed for condensation. However, this impact would not change the efficiency of salt removal dramatically. 6. The process is repeated: As long as the heating, evaporation, and condensation processes continue to function effectively, the slower spinning turbine would not have a significant impact on the overall process. 7. More salt is removed from the water: The ultimate result of the process – the removal of salt from the water – is chiefly determined by the efficiency of the heating, evaporation, and condensation steps. Although a slower spinning turbine could slightly impact the condensation process, this effect is likely to be minimal and not substantially alter the overall salt removal efficiency. In summary, while a slower spinning turbine might have a minimal indirect effect on the condensation process, it is unlikely to significantly affect how much salt is removed from the water. The primary steps responsible for salt removal - heating, evaporation, and condensation - are largely independent of turbine speed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are many ways in which living organisms can affect their ecosystem. In some areas, it is because of fire management. Fire is a natural event, so managing fire correctly is very important. In other areas, fisherman have taken too many fish from one area. This places the species at risk of extinction. It also affects other living things that may rely on these fish for food. The image below shows a picture of a mine. Mining changes the Earths surface. This area may once have been a forest or a prairie. Think about how many plants and animals may once have lived here.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Running like the wind, roaring like thunder, tigers have long been feared and respected as a king of the animal world. But last week a report said that there are no more than 30 wild tigers left in south China. This was the conclusion of a team of scientists from China's State Forestry Administration and the World Nature Fund. The South China tiger, also known as the Chinese tiger, is native to southern China. In the 1950s, there were over 4,000 tigers found in mountain forests in the country. But due to the destruction of their natural habitat and uncontrolled hunting, it has been pushed on to the list of the world's top ten most endangered species. Sixty-six of the big cats can be found in the cages of a dozen zoos around China. But they are nothing like their wild cousins. They have lost their natural skills such as hunting and killing. If they were set free they could not look after themselves. \\"Breeding has damaged the quality of the species,\\" said Pei Enle, deputy director of the Shanghai Zoo. To reintroduce the species into the wild, the country started a programme to send five to ten young tigers to South Africa. Four of them have already arrived. Progress has been made as two elder tigers have recovered some of their instincts and can hunt wild animals by themselves at the African base. \\"South Africans are very experienced in reintroducing big animals to the wild. The country has very good natural conditions for the tigers to learn in,\\" said Lu Jun, office director of the National Wildlife Research and Development Centre. \\"We tried in Fujian Province, but it was not successful as there was not a complete eco-chain and there was a lack of space.\\" The tigers should return to China in 2009 when the reservations in Fujian are ready.

He also states that Chinese writers of the early 20th century described Tibet as a feudal dependency of China, not an integral part of it. Sperling states that this is because \\"Tibet was ruled as such, within the empires of the Mongols and the Manchus\\" and also that \\"China's intervening Ming dynasty ... had no control over Tibet.\\" He writes that the Ming relationship with Tibet is problematic for China’s insistence of its unbroken sovereignty over Tibet since the 13th century. As for the Tibetan view that Tibet was never subject to the rule of the Yuan or Qing emperors of China, Sperling also discounts this by stating that Tibet was \\"subject to rules, laws and decisions made by the Yuan and Qing rulers\\" and that even Tibetans described themselves as subjects of these emperors.Josef Kolmaš, a sinologist, Tibetologist, and Professor of Oriental Studies at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, writes that it was during the Qing dynasty \\"that developments took place on the basis of which Tibet came to be considered an organic part of China, both practically and theoretically subject to the Chinese central government.\\" Yet he states that this was a radical change in regards to all previous eras of Sino-Tibetan relations.P.

You probably thought of Google. But Google wasn't always the name of the famous search engine. In fact, the original name was BackRub! BackRub was the name two graduate students gave to the new search engine they developed in 1996. They called it BackRub because the engine used backlinks to measure the popularity of Web sites. Later, they wanted a better name -- a name that suggests huge quantities of data. They thought of the word googol. (A googol is a number followed by 100 zeros.) When they checked the Internet registry of names to see if googol was already taken, one of the students misspelled the word by mistake, and that's how Google was born. Google is just one example of a name change in the business world. Many other companies have decided to change their names or the names of their products. Here are some more examples: Jerry Yang and David Filo, two young computer specialists, developed a guide to Internet content in 1994. They called it \\"Jerry and David's Guide to World Wide Web.\\" But they soon realized that this wasn't a very catchy name, so they searched through a dictionary and found a better one: \\"Yahoo.\\" Sometimes companies change their names because of the popularity of one of their products.

(Reuters) Jillian Michaels, the fitness trainer and former host of NBC’s “The Biggest Loser” reality show, has accused Lionsgate of failing to compensate her for videos the studio posted to its YouTube fitness channel — to the tune of 10 million. A Lionsgate spokesman declined to comment. “Despite receiving millions of dollars in revenue from YouTube, and half of all views on the YouTube BeFit channel relation to Ms. Michaels’ Lions Gate (videos), Ms. Michaels has not received any compensation whatsover,” the complaint said. Michaels is alleging Lionsgate is in breach of her 2007 deal with the studio, under which she is entitled to a certain percentage of home-video gross revenue. YouTube paid Lionsgate 5 million to create BeFit, according to the complaint, and also pays a share of ad revenue generated by the channel. Lionsgate’s BeFit, launched in 2012, has generated more than 200 million views to date and has more than 1.5 million subscribers on YouTube. According to Michaels, Lionsgate did not consult her before they used her image and brand on the channel, and exceeded the number of videos posted to YouTube allowable under her contract. In her complaint, Michaels alleged that the BeFit channel on YouTube “has cannibalized sales of the Lions Gate Pictures (videos) from which Ms. Michaels would have received a royalty.” Michaels is represented in the matter by King & Ballow, a law firm based in Nashville, Tenn. The complaint also is on behalf of Michaels’ J.M. Athletics and Empower Media LLC. The complaint was filed last week with with JAMS, a private mediation firm, in L.A.

The premise highlights the absence of laws to address the fundamental economic principles of supply and demand that could impact the pricing of medical goods and services. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that medical prices will increase to a specific price point (1000 per pill) as a direct result of Congress's actions. It is important to note that the actual increase in prices is likely to be influenced by multiple factors, including operational costs, market competition, and price negotiation by insurance providers and pharmacies. Therefore, attributing the price increase to a single cause, like the absence of conforming amendments in legislation, may be an oversimplification of the issue. Moreover, it would be difficult to predict the exact change in medical prices without detailed information and analysis of various market forces and trends. Additionally, numerous factors, such as the type of medication, existing patents, and industry trends, could lead to different price points for different medications.

What is the answer?","completion":"The ream is a common retail unit of paper. Consisting of 20 quires of 25 sheets each, a ream contains a total of 500 sheets of paper. This standard measure of paper quantity is widely used across different industries and settings, including offices, schools, and businesses that utilize paper for various purposes, such as printing, writing, photocopying, and crafting. Paper is a versatile and essential item, made primarily from cellulose pulp derived from wood, grasses, or rags. The process of creating paper typically involves breaking down natural fibers, mixing them with water to create a slurry, and then spreading the mixture onto a flat surface to drain the water and form an even layer of interwoven fibers. Once dried, this sheet of fibers becomes a durable and user-friendly material – paper. Reams play a crucial role in paper-related transactions, as they provide a standardized way of quantifying large amounts of paper, ensuring accurate pricing and reducing the potential for confusion or errors. The size of the sheets in a ream can vary depending on the intended use or personal preferences. For instance, widely-used paper sizes in reams include A4, Letter, and Legal sizes. Apart from the standard 500-sheet ream, other variations of ream sizes exist for certain situations. A short ream contains 480 sheets, while a long ream is composed of 516 sheets of paper. These alternative sizes are less common and predominantly used for specialized purposes. In conclusion, a ream is a common retail unit of paper, typically containing 20 quires of 25 sheets each, for a total of 500 sheets.

As she pondered the question, she took another bite of the heavenly grilled-cheese sandwich. The sensation of the cheese melting in her mouth and the tanginess of the tomato soup reminded her of simpler times and the comfort of home-cooked meals. Her mind wandered, and she found herself reminiscing about the surprisingly wonderful moments she'd already shared with Jason. Indeed, her journey to San Francisco had so far been a rollercoaster ride of emotions and unexpected twists. She had come to the city, hoping to find new experiences, and maybe even reinvent herself a little. But at the core of her adventure, what she was truly seeking, was a connection – something that would breathe life into her stagnant existence. From the start, Jason had been an enigma, a wild card in her carefully planned escapade. He was charming, witty, and had an air of mystery about him that was both thrilling and unnerving – precisely the kind of person she would have usually steered clear of. However, there was something about his presence that drew her in, making it nearly impossible to resist the allure of the unknown. Their time together was filled with memorable moments – from spontaneous midnight picnics under the stars to indulging in decadent Godiva s'mores that would leave them laughing and chocolate-stained. It was like being in a dream – a dream that she never wanted to wake up from. But that's exactly what she feared – that once the spell broke, reality would come crashing down, and she would be left with nothing but a bittersweet memory of their brief encounter. Still, her heart skipped a beat as she thought about the possibility of a passionate affair with Jason – the excitement, the intense emotions, and the overwhelming sense of connection that only two people who have fallen deeply for each other could experience. If she were to risk her heart, it could mean the start of something extraordinary; a love story that would span beyond the borders of time and space. But, alongside the anticipation of such a profound connection, she couldn't shake the nagging doubts that lingered in the back of her mind. What if this affair turned out to be nothing more than a fleeting moment in time? What if her heart suffered a terrible blow, and she was left worse off than when she'd first arrived in San Francisco? She feared trusting Jason too much, only for him to disappoint her – or even worse, to break her heart. With a deep sigh, she took another dip of her grilled-cheese triangle into the tomato soup, cherishing the warmth that spread through her body as she slowly savored each bite. She knew that she would need to make a decision, one that could change the course of her life – either by taking the plunge and risking a passionate but uncertain romance with Jason or settling for the safety of her well-structured, predictable world. The clock on the wall ticked away as she weighed the pros and cons, her heart and mind battling fiercely in their attempt to decide what the best course of action would be. But deep down inside, something stirred – a feeling that whispered, nudging her towards the cusp of unprecedented bliss. It spoke of love, courage, and the notion of embracing the unexpected surprises that life held in store. As she finished the last remnants of her comforting meal, she knew what she needed to do. It was time to step into the uncharted territory of her own heart and be prepared for the wild ride that awaited her.

Neil Hudson won what premier motocross championship in 1981? A:","completion":"Neil Hudson won the 1981 250cc Motocross World Championship, which is a premier motocross championship governed by the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM). A British motorcycle racer born in 1957, Neil Hudson began his motocross career in the mid-1970s, initially riding for the Maico factory team. He went on to ride for a number of teams throughout his career, including Yamaha, Kawasaki, and Suzuki. Hudson experienced great success during his motocross career, consistently finishing high in the rankings and representing his home nation in international competitions. In 1980, Hudson finished second in the 250cc World Championship, setting the stage for the following season. In 1981, he switched from riding Kawasaki to riding Yamaha. That same year, he achieved his career-defining accomplishment by winning the 250cc Motocross World Championship while riding for the Yamaha factory team. This victory made Hudson the first British rider to win the prestigious title in that class. Throughout the 1981 season, Hudson demonstrated exceptional skill and determination, consistently finishing at or near the top in numerous races. As the championship progressed, Hudson managed to secure enough points to stay ahead of other top racers, such as Georges Jobé and Hakan Carlqvist. Ultimately, Hudson's performances throughout the season -- and his consistent accumulation of points -- led him to secure the 1981 250cc Motocross World Championship. Neil Hudson continued to compete in motocross at a high level for several years after his 1981 triumph, earning a reputation for being a fierce competitor and passionate racer, but he couldn't replicate the same level of success that year. After retiring from professional racing, he continued to be involved with the sport, sharing his vast experience and knowledge with the next generation through coaching and mentoring. In the motocross world, Neil Hudson is still remembered for his groundbreaking achievement in securing the first 250cc World Championship for the United Kingdom in 1981."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Explanation: The premise tells us that the employment level is calculated by dividing the total man-hours worked in the year by the total active members times 2080 hours per year. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the employment level is equal to the number of new hires and has doubled since last year. These two statements are not related or dependent on each other. The premise explains a formula used to calculate the employment level, while the hypothesis is about the change in the number of new hires. That's why the premise doesn't entail the hypothesis. The other answers are not correct because the relationship between these two statements is clear: they are separate and don't affect each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to choose an under the sink water filter Make sure you have room under your sink for a filter. The filter will attach to the pipes beneath the sink, so clear enough space to accommodate the filter system. Understand your water composition.","completion":"Knowing what is in your water is crucial because different filter types deal with different contaminants. If your water comes from a municipal system, it's likely treated for most common harmful substances, but it might still contain certain contaminants like chlorine, lead, pharmaceuticals, or other pollutants. Conversely, if you source your water from a well, you will likely need a filter that can handle heavy metals, bacteria, chemicals, or specific substances that are commonly found in groundwater. You can identify what contaminants are present in your water by requesting a water quality report from your local water provider or by using a home water testing kit. These tests can inform you about the presence of various contaminants, including heavy metals, chlorine, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), pesticides, and bacteria. Based on your water composition, decide what type of water filter you need. There are many types available, including activated carbon filters, reverse osmosis filters, UV filters, and ceramic filters, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Activated carbon filters are excellent at removing chlorine, sediment, and volatile organic compounds. Meanwhile, reverse osmosis filters can handle a broader range of substances, including dissolved salts, fluoride, and bacteria. UV filters are effective against microorganisms like bacteria and viruses, and ceramic filters are good at straining out sediments and bacteria, albeit they do not effectively remove chemical contaminants. Contemplate your water usage. Water filters have different capacities, which means they can only filter a certain amount of water before needing a replacement. So, consider your household's water consumption habits and select an under-sink water filter that can handle that volume. Also, different filters have different flow rates. If you want a filter that won't slow down your water, check the gallons per minute (GPM) on the filter. Pay close attention to the filter's maintenance and operating costs. Maintenance could include changing the cartridge of the filter, which varies from model to model. This upkeep can add to the overall cost of the filter system over time, so be sure to factor this into your budget. Additionally, some systems, particularly reverse osmosis and UV filters, require electricity to operate, adding more to operational costs. Finally, consider the installation process. Some under-sink water filters are relatively simple to install on your own with basic tools and instructions, while others may require professional installation. If you're not confident in installing the filter yourself, check whether the manufacturer offers professional installation or ask your plumber for assistance. Remember, a water filter is an investment in your health and the taste of your water. Make sure the one you choose can effectively handle all the potential issues within your specific water source. After all, clean, safe drinking water is essential for a healthy life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: I have never been a stop-and-smell-the-roses type of person. For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

Despite his enormous wealth, Wilson made a conspicuous exception in his will: he bequeathed his expansive fortune to numerous charities, with the exception of personal gifts to his loyal assistant of 20 years and his business manager. Beyond his business acumen, Wilson was known for his humble lifestyle that contradicted his millionaire status. His friends fondly reminisced over how the openly gay magnate often chose public transportation over luxury transport options. Despite his wealth, Wilson was a typical sight on the subway and it wasn't unusual for him to share cabs across the city. However, his humbleness didn't just stop at his lifestyle choices. Wilson was also keen on philanthropy, and he had been strategically giving away his wealth for several years to causes close to his heart. Environmental and educational causes were at the top of his giving list. By establishing such a legacy, his memory will continue to have a positive impact, long after his untimely demise. Even in his death, Wilson’s life serves as a poignant reminder of the significance of giving back to society regardless of our personal circumstances. His extraordinary example of charity, humility, and authenticity challenges us all to question how we might contribute to the world beyond our existence. Obviously, the loss of a remarkable man like Robert Wilson leaves a significant void. But it's important for those struggling with similar painful circumstances to reach out and find professional support.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Inzamam-ul-Haq ( pronunciation ;Punjabi, Urdu: nDmm lHq; born 3 March 1970), also known as Inzy, is a former Pakistani cricketer, and former captain. He is the leading run scorer for Pakistan in one-day internationals, and the third-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket. He was the captain of the Pakistan national cricket team from 2003-07 and is considered to be one of the best leaders in Pakistan Cricket history. Inzamam rose to fame in the semi-final of the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Inzamam captained Pakistan in thirty Tests, winning eleven, drawing nine and losing ten. Only three players have captained Pakistan in more Test matches, but all have better win-loss records and only Imran Khan has a lower win percentage than Inzamam. Although the Oval Test match in 2006 was poised as a victory for Pakistan before the controversy took place and had it not occurred, Inzamam's record would have had a win more and a loss less. However, Inzamam held the captaincy until March 2007, the longest captaincy tenure since 1992, when Imran Khan retired. Captaincy had a positive effect on Inzamam's batting, often leading by example in pressure situations, averaging greater as a captain (52) than without (50). In ODI's Inzamam also held the highest average as captain in ODI's and is currently third on that list behind the former Australian skipper Ricky Ponting and the Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. After early failures in Australia, he took a depleted Pakistan side to India in 2005 and played an important role in securing a draw by winning the final test match from an unlikely position with an innings of 184 runs. He subsequently led his side to an ODI success against West Indies (away), England (home) and Sri Lanka (away) as well as Test Series victories against England (home), India (home), Sri Lanka (away). Inzamam had seemed to have united the Pakistan side and victories led them to 2nd place in the ICC Test Rankings and 3rd place in the ICC ODI Ranking. The latter part of Inzamam's tenure as Pakistan captain was less successful and the team was embroiled in many controversies culminating in a disappointingly early exit from the 2007 Cricket World Cup at the hands of lowly ranked Ireland. In the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Inzamam captained the Pakistani team to its first loss to associate ICC member Ireland (on St Patrick's Day). This result and their previous loss to West Indies, led to them being knocked out of the tournament. A day later he announced his retirement from One Day International Cricket and resignation as Test captain. The announcement was made the same day that Bob Woolmer, Pakistan's coach, died in his hotel room in Kingston, Jamaica. He dedicated his final ODI to Woolmer to whom he shared a good relationship with for three years and affectionately called him 'The Bob'.

Let's break down and compare the essential components of both sentences to understand the differences clearly: 1. Sentence 1: \\"A sensible protocol for the use of such transfer flow control signals must be used, however, to avoid potential blocking conditions.\\" - The term \\"sensible\\" refers to something that is practical, reasonable, or has sound judgment. - \\"Such transfer flow control signals\\" implies that this sentence is referring to specific, previously mentioned types of flow control signals in the context. - \\"Potential blocking conditions\\" indicate the situation that might arise due to those flow control signals, causing processes to be blocked or prevented from executing tasks. 2. Sentence 2: \\"A potential protocol for the use of sensitive flow control signals must be used, however, to avoid such deadlock conditions.\\" - In this sentence, \\"potential\\" refers to something that has the possibility or the capability of occurring. Here, it's talking about a protocol that is not yet firmly established but can be useful in handling sensitive flow control signals. - \\"Sensitive flow control signals\\" suggest that these signals may be easily influenced or affected by external factors (like noise or interference), and they require extra care when being processed and managed. - \\"Such deadlock conditions\\" imply that this sentence is referring to specific, previously mentioned types of deadlock conditions that need to be avoided. In summary, the first sentence is talking about using a practical and sound-judgment-based protocol for managing particular transfer flow control signals to prevent potential blocking situations. On the other hand, the second sentence discusses the implementation of a potentially useful protocol to handle delicate or easily influenced flow control signals and preclude specific kinds of deadlock conditions. While both sentences discuss the need for protocols to manage flow control signals and avoid adverse situations, they differ in terms of the type of protocol, the nature of the flow control signals, and the specific undesirable outcomes being discussed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? padded .","completion":"The sentiment of the given movie review sentence, \\"padded,\\" can be determined by analyzing the context and meaning of the word in the context of a movie review. In this sense, \\"padded\\" is commonly used to describe a film with unnecessary or excessive content that does not significantly contribute to the overall development of the movie. \\"Padded\\" implies that the film might have been unnecessarily extended, potentially affecting the pacing, storytelling, or character development. Considering this, the sentiment of this movie review sentence can be classified as negative. The reviewer likely believes that the movie had scenes or content that could have been removed or streamlined without losing any crucial aspects of the plot. This negative sentiment suggests dissatisfaction with the film's structure and, to an extent, may highlight the reviewer's belief that the creators could have done a better job at managing the film's content. In conclusion, the sentiment of the given movie review sentence \\"padded\\" is negative. It implies that the movie contains extraneous and unnecessary content, possibly affecting the pacing, storytelling, or character development. This criticism could lead to a lower overall rating or recommendation for the movie, as the presence of excessive padding often detracts from the viewer's experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I feel totally alive,\\" he said. \\"It feels more natural to stand.\\" In the past few years, standing has become the new sitting for 10 percent of AOL employees at the firm's Virginia branch. Part of a standing popularity is among accountants, programmers, telemarketers and other office workers across the nation. GeekDesk, a California firm that sells desks raised by electric motors, says sales will triple this year. Standers give various reasons for taking to their feet: It makes them feel more focused, prevents drowsiness , and makes them feel like a general even if they just push paper. (Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfels works standing up. So does novelist Philip Roth.) But unknown to them, a debate is spreading among ergonomics experts and public-health researchers about whether all office workers should be encouraged to stand--to save lives. Doctors point to surprising new research showing higher rates of diabetes, obesity, heart disease and even mortality among people who sit for long stretches. A study earlier this year in theAmerican Journal of Epidemiologyshowed that among 123,000 adults followed over 14 years, those who sat more than six hours a day were at least 18 percent more likely to die during the time period studied than those who sat less than three hours a day. \\"Every rock we turn over when it comes to sitting is astonishing,\\" said Marc Hamilton, a leading researcher on inactivity physiology at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana. \\"Sitting is harmful.

So my boyfriend and I are living in a major city, about a thousand miles away from where we are both from. We dated back in the day for around 8 months when we both lived in our hometowns and parted ways when our lives weren't going in the same direction. Coincidentally, we both moved to the same city a couple years later and we reconnected and now have been dating here for about a year and a half. We've been doing pretty well and we just moved in together, having signed a preliminary 6 month lease. I thought things were going great, he is in graduate school and is working a really awesome job on the side that is exactly what he wants to do, and I'm working full-time and just completed my application for grad school. He's been going through a really hard time recently, as his grandpa who raised him recently just passed two weeks ago. He spent around two weeks in his hometown surrounded by his family and friends before the passing and after, and I joined him for various parts of the process. He's been back for three days now and he just seems really down, which is understandable. However, today he dropped the bomb on me that he wants to be out of the city by June and wants to move back home to be with his family and friends because he says he's miserable here and he hates the city that we live in. He has never given me any indication that he hates this place, in fact all he does is rave about his job and I thought he really liked it here. He says he hates the people here, that he doesn't feel appreciated in his job, and that he has no friends and really wants to be around people that support him. So essentially, in my mind, he's willing to give up an awesome job and quit grad school to move back to a place that he used to complain about non-stop. I feel I should also mention that he does have mild clinical depression and he used to be treated, but is no longer on medication. The thing that makes me the most angry is that he says he's been feeling this way since last November, way before I had officially decided whether or not I wanted to go back to grad school, and he knew this. I don't understand why he didn't tell me that he was feeling this way because had he, I might be more open to the idea of moving back home, but as it stands with my commitments, I don't want to go.

Jim's land is not very fertile because it has clay soil with a high pH, while Bob's land has very fertile soil and has a good productivity on it. But I can use this background: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils.

Article: Use a sod cutter to remove the marked turf. Slice the turf into strips along each baseline, creating a bare path of earth that is 3 feet wide. Roll the strips up and remove them from the area. Replace the turf with a mix of sand, clay, and silt. Use a mix that’s 50-75% sand and 25-50% clay and silt. A mix that’s too sandy will be unstable underfoot, while a mix with too much clay and silt will be too hard and compact. For each base, dig a 2’ x 2’ hole, 8.5” deep, where the base will be. Level the bottom and then set your anchor inside. Before burying the anchor, attach the base to the anchor's post. Double-check the anchor's placement by remeasuring the base’s distance from the back tip of home plate. Reposition the anchor if necessary. Then fill the hole back in with soil. Compact the soil at the bottom of your hole to make sure your anchor doesn’t settle any farther down over time. Make sure the bottom is level so that the base will be, too. Also make sure that the soil you shovel back into the hole is compact by adding only small amounts at a time and packing that in before shoveling in more. Remember that for second base, you’re measuring from the back tip of home plate to the center of second base. For first and third bases, you’re measuring from the back tip of home plate to the foul-side corner of each base. The top of your anchor post should be roughly a half-inch below the top of your hole. Lay a 2x4 over the hole and measure the distance between its bottom and the top of the post to double-check the distance before burying the anchor. Remove the marked turf within your pitcher’s mound. Replace the turf with a mix of sand, clay, and silt. For adults, build your mound until the center rises 10 1/2 inches higher than home plate. For Little League, make your mound 6 inches at its highest. Then create the “slope” in front of the pitcher’s rubber by removing 1 inch of soil from the mound for every foot in front of the rubber, starting one foot out, until the soil reaches ground level at the edge of the mound. For the pitcher’s mound, use a mix that’s 40% sand, 20% silt, and 40% clay. Dig a 10” x 23” hole, 9.5” deep, where the rubber will be, with the longer side parallel to the front of home plate. Level the bottom, place the anchor inside, and stake it into position. Press soil along the base of each tube in the anchor to prevent concrete from leaking inside. Then fill the area surrounding the anchor with concrete without covering the anchor itself. Once the concrete has dried, withdraw the stakes and plug the anchor’s tubes. Refill the hole with soil. Then unplug the tubes and attach the rubber. When you first place the anchor into the hole, attach the rubber. Double-check the anchor’s placement by measuring the distance between each of the rubber’s front corners with those of home plate to make sure they’re equidistant. Then gently remove the rubber without moving the anchor out of position. Compact the soil at the bottom of your hole to make sure your anchor doesn’t settle any farther down over time. Make sure the bottom is level so that the rubber will be, too. Also make sure that the soil you shovel back into the hole is compact by adding only small amounts at a time and packing that in before shoveling in more. The top of each tube should be 1.5” below the top of the hole. Lay a 2x4 over the hole and measure the distance between its bottom and the tubes’ tops to double-check the distance before pouring concrete. Remove the marked turf within your batter’s area. Replace the turf with a mix of sand, clay, and silt. Then outline your batter’s and catcher’s boxes with chalk. Batter’s boxes (for both left-handed and right-handed players) are 4 feet wide and 6 feet long for adults, while those in Little League are 3 feet wide and 6 feet long. Measure the boxes so their midpoints are even with that of home plate. Allow six inches of free space between each box and home plate. The catcher’s box is 43 inches wide and 8 feet long for adults, and 25 inches wide and 8 feet long for Little League. Measure your box so that it’s center is even with that of home plate. For each, begin your measurement from the back corner of home plate. From there, measure a distance of 325 feet along the outside of the square created by the baselines. At that distance, plant a pole marker. Then stretch a lining cord between the back corner of home plate and the pole marker. Chalk directly over the lining cord to create your foul line. Also an install a protective fence that extends 400 feet from home plate behind each foul line to shield spectators. Protect spectators behind the batter’s area from missed pitches and stray balls. Install a backstop 60 feet behind home plate for adult players; for Little League, install it 25 feet behind home plate. Failing that, plant hedges instead to catch stray balls. Standard-sized backstops stand 30 to 40 feet high and measure 30 feet wide directly behind home plate, with 40-foot extensions running parallel with the baselines from either end. For a 30-foot height, dig foundation holes 2 feet in diameter and 7.5 feet deep for the supports. For a 40-foot height, make your holes 9.5 feet deep. Once they are placed inside each hole, secure the poles firmly in place by filling the hole with concrete.

For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. x = 10, equation weights = [1, 3, 5, 6]","completion":"To compute the result of the given polynomial expression with the given value of x, we can use the following steps: 1. Start by understanding the given equation weights, which are [1, 3, 5, 6]. This means the polynomial equation is: 1x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x + 6. 2. Replace the variable x with the given value, which is 10 in this case: (1 * 10^3) + (3 * 10^2) + (5 * 10) + 6 3. Calculate the expression step by step: (1 * 1000) + (3 * 100) + (5 * 10) + 6 4. Continue with the calculation: 1000 + 300 + 50 + 6 5. Add the terms together to get the final output: 1000 + 300 + 50 + 6 = 1356 So, after substituting the given value of x (x = 10) in the given polynomial equation with weights [1, 3, 5, 6], the result is 1356."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: An increase in temperature of a gas in a rigid container increases the pressure. Q: What happens when an increase in temperature of a gas in a rigid container happens? A: Answer:","completion":"When an increase in temperature of a gas in a rigid container occurs, it leads to several phenomena taking place at molecular and macroscopic levels that result in an increase in the gas pressure inside the container. In order to understand the processes that occur, we can consider the Kinetic Theory of Gases and the Ideal Gas Law as our guiding principles. The Kinetic Theory of Gases states that all gases are composed of molecules in constant random motion. These molecules collide with each other and the container's walls, resulting in a force acting on the walls of the container. This force per unit area is what we perceive as pressure. When we increase the temperature of a gas, we are essentially providing thermal energy to the gas particles. This extra energy results in an increase in the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules. The Ideal Gas Law establishes a relationship between pressure (P), volume (V), temperature (T), and the number of gas particles (n) as follows: PV = nRT where R is the ideal gas constant. In the scenario of a rigid container, the volume (V) does not change. Therefore, when the temperature (T) increases, it directly causes an increase in pressure (P), if the number of particles (n) and the ideal gas constant (R) remain the same. Now let's discuss the two main factors that occur when the temperature of a gas in a rigid container is increased: 1. Increased molecular speed: As the temperature is increased, the gas molecules gain more kinetic energy, which results in an increase in their individual speeds. As these faster-moving molecules collide with the container's walls, the force exerted on the walls increases. Since pressure is the force exerted per unit area, this directly results in an increase in pressure. 2. Frequency of molecular collisions: With an increase in temperature and molecular speeds, the gas molecules also collide more frequently with the container's walls. Each collision transfers momentum from the molecule to the wall, which then exerts a force on the wall. The higher the frequency of collisions, the higher the force exerted. Consequently, the pressure inside the container increases. In conclusion, when an increase in temperature of a gas in a rigid container occurs, it causes the gas molecules to gain more kinetic energy and move at greater speeds. This directly leads to an increase in both the force exerted by the molecules on the container walls and the frequency of molecular collisions with the walls. As a result of these combined effects, the pressure of the gas inside the rigid container increases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write highlights for this article: (CNN)A war with Ukraine would be \\"apocalyptic\\" but will probably never happen, Russian President Vladimir Putin said. \\"I believe such (an) apocalyptic scenario is unlikely, and hope that it will never get to that point,\\" he told Russian media Monday. Putin said he's confident the crisis will stabilize if the Minsk Agreement is implemented. The accord, between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany, includes a ceasefire between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists and an agreement for both sides to pull back heavy weapons. Despite frequent violations of the ceasefire, Putin said there's no need for immediate action beyond the Minsk Agreement, such as more international peace talks or the formal recognition of rebel separatist groups like the People's Republic of Donetsk and the People's Republic of Lugansk. \\"I really hope (the Minsk Agreement) is implemented, and if it is -- it is the right way to normalization of situation in that Ukrainian region,\\" Putin said. But the chaos on the ground in eastern Ukraine suggests the truce is crumbling. In the past week, shelling has intensified in the city of Donetsk. And on Friday, Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council reported 300 violations of the ceasefire, which was less than a week old. Ukraine has said its forces won't back down until attacks from the rebels stop. Pro-Russian separatists have also accused Ukraine of instigating violence. In his interview, Putin also said there's no chance Crimea -- which was annexed by Russia last year -- will go back in Ukraine. \\"Regarding the return of any territories, such things are of revengeful nature, and it is not about return of some territories somewhere,\\" Putin said. \\"Crimea will remain Russian, Ukrainian, Tatar, Greek, and German -- it will be a home to all these nations. With regard to its nationality, Crimean people made their choice, which we must respect.\\" On the streets of Moscow, many Russian point their fingers at the United States for the Ukraine crisis. The latest polls show 81% of Russians have a negative view of the U.S. -- the highest number since the collapse of the Soviet Union. State-run media reports the United States wants to encroach on Russia. And the Kremlin's propaganda campaign seems to be paying off. \\"My attitude to America is bad,\\" one woman said. \\"The way I watch the news, I realize the Americans want to get a hold of half of Russia.\\" Russia has denied widespread claims that it is supporting the pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine and has sent its own troops to the border. The United Nations says more than 5,000 people have been killed since mid-April amid the fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian troops. Many of those killed were civilians.

Graeme Obree (born 11 September 1965), nicknamed The Flying Scotsman, is a Scottish racing cyclist who twice broke the world hour record, in July 1993 and April 1994, and was the individual pursuit world champion in 1993 and 1995. He was known for his unusual riding positions and for the Old Faithful bicycle he built which included parts from a washing machine. He joined a professional team in France but was fired before his first race. Obree has created some radical innovations in bicycle design and cycling position but has had problems with the cycling authorities banning the riding positions his designs required. Obree was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire but has lived almost all his life in Scotland and considers himself Scottish. An individual time triallist, his first race was a 10-mile time trial to which he turned up wearing shorts, anorak and Doc Marten boots. He thought the start and finish were at the same place and stopped where he had started, 100 metres short of the end. He had started to change his clothes when officials told him to continue. He still finished in \\"about 30 minutes.\\" Obree suffers from bipolar disorder. He attempted suicide in his teens by gassing himself. He was saved by his father, who had returned early from work. In the 1990s he took an overdose of aspirin washed down by water from a puddle. He had personality problems, sniffed the gas he used to weld bicycles, and was being chased for PS492 owed in college fees. The bike shop that he ran failed and he decided the way out of his problems was to attack the world hour velodrome record. It had been held for nine years by Francesco Moser, at 51.151 kilometres. Obree said: The record had fascinated me since Moser broke it. It was the ultimate test - no traffic, one man in a velodrome against the clock. I didn't tell myself that I will attempt the record, I said I would break it. When your back is against the wall, you can say it's bad or you can say: 'I'll go for it.'

These are exercises you already do and increasing them can help you burn more calories throughout the day. Think about your day and see if you can find additional ways to add in more steps or to move more. A little planning can help you find a few ways to add in activity or find an extra few minutes to be active. Try adding in activity like: taking the stairs over the elevator, parking far away from your destination and standing or walk in place during TV commercials. Make a rule to walk to your destinations if they are under 1 mile (if safe and appropriate for you). Skip taking the bus or driving. Going to the gym, doing high intensity aerobic classes or spending money on expensive equipment isn't possible or comfortable for everyone. Walking is an activity that most healthy people can do that can help burn calories and increase your cardiovascular fitness. If you walk 30 minutes on five days of the week, you'll be meeting the minimum guidelines for physical activity (150 minutes per week). If you don't have time for a full 30 mins, try breaking up your walk into three 10 minute increments. You don't have to spend hours in the gym or purchase expensive equipment to include strength training. Even light weight resistance training can help increase muscle mass and muscle tone. Again, you can break up your strength training routine into 10 minute increments if it fits better into your schedule. Try including exercises that are easy to do at home and require no extra equipment. Exercises can include: sit ups, push ups, tricep dips, lunges or side leg lifts. Sometimes people think exercise just means running on a treadmill, but there are tons of ways to get exercise, inside and outside the gym. Try a new machine at the gym, or go for a long bike ride or a challenging hike. Try jumping rope or playing hopscotch with your kids or younger siblings. Put on some upbeat music and dance around your house. This is a fun way to get your heart rate up and get some exercise. Make walking fun by taking an interesting tour or visiting a local museum. Or try skipping instead of walking or running. Play a sport. Try joining a local soccer, tennis or basketball team for a fun and exciting way to be active.

Options: - court room - chicken coop - backyards - natural history museum - cherry tree Explain why a human would choose \\"cherry tree\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","completion":"A human would choose \\"cherry tree\\" as the answer to the question, \\"Where would a weasel go if it is hungry?\\" for several reasons, primarily related to the weasel's natural environment, behavior, and dietary preferences. It is important to first eliminate the other available options to understand why \\"cherry tree\\" is the most suitable answer among the choices provided. 1. Courtroom: A courtroom is an indoor, human-built environment where legal proceedings take place. It is highly unlikely for a weasel to be present there, as courtrooms are not natural environments for weasels and do not offer them food. Moreover, weasels have no interest in human legal affairs. 2. Chicken coop: Although a weasel might invade a chicken coop to prey on small and vulnerable birds, it is not their ideal hunting environment. Weasels mainly hunt smaller mammals, but avian prey is a secondary option for them. A chicken coop could also potentially be located within or near a farm, posing risks to weasels due to human activity. 3. Backyards: While it is possible to find weasels in the backyards of homes that are close to their natural habitats, a backyard alone doesn't provide an inherent guarantee of food for a hungry weasel. The availability of food would depend on what specific vegetation, small mammals, and other prey species are present in that particular backyard. 4. Natural History Museum: This option can be easily ruled out as it is an indoor human-built environment specifically for showcasing exhibits, artifacts, and information about the natural world. This setting would not provide natural food sources or an appropriate environment for a weasel. Now, let's consider \\"cherry tree.\\" Weasels are small, carnivorous mammals that primarily live in forested areas and grasslands. Their natural diet consists of small mammals like mice, voles, and rabbits but also includes bird eggs and insects. A cherry tree, being part of a forested or wooded ecosystem, provides an ideal environment where a weasel can find food sources, especially bird nests containing eggs. Furthermore, cherry trees can attract insects due to their flowers and fruit, which weasels might consume opportunistically. When comparing the available options, humans would reasonably conclude that \\"cherry tree\\" is the most likely and suitable place for a hungry weasel to go in search of food. This choice provides the most favorable natural environment for the weasel to locate prey, in conjunction with the animal's typical dietary preferences and behaviors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Justin and Thomas are two college students conducting an experiment in their chemistry laboratory course. They are mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium based compounds. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature. If Thomas wanted the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, should he increase or decrease the temperature of his reactions?","completion":"To find out if Thomas should increase or decrease the temperature of his reactions to get a similar rate as Justin's reactions, we need to consider the relationship between temperature and reaction rate. Step 1: Consider the effect of temperature on reaction rate. As mentioned, higher temperature leads to faster reaction rates due to an increase in energy and movement of particles. They collide more often and with greater force, increasing the chances of successful reactions. Step 2: Compare the reaction conditions of Justin and Thomas. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature. Given the relationship between temperature and reaction rate outlined in the first step, Justin's reactions will have a faster rate. Step 3: Determine how Thomas can modify his reaction conditions to match Justin's reaction rate. To achieve a reaction rate similar to Justin's, Thomas should increase the temperature of his reactions. This will cause the particles in his reactants to have more energy and move faster, leading to more frequent and forceful collisions, and therefore increasing the rate of his reactions to a level comparable to Justin's."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The World Wars refer to the two major global conflicts that occurred in the 20th century, namely World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945). These wars involved a majority of the world's nations, including all of the great powers, which were organized into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Central Powers in World War I, and the Allies and the Axis Powers in World War II. The culmination of these wars resulted in significant political, cultural, economic, and social changes across the world. World War I, also known as the Great War, began in 1914 after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, which led to a series of diplomatic crises and eventually the mobilization of European alliances. The war was primarily fought between the two aforementioned alliances, with the Central Powers consisting of Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria, while the Allies included France, Russia, the United Kingdom, Italy, and the United States, among others. The conflict was marked by trench warfare, the introduction of modern weaponry and technology like chemical gas and machine guns, and the massive loss of life. The war ended in 1918 with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed heavy reparations and restrictions on Germany, leading to widespread economic and political instability in Europe. World War II began in 1939, largely as a result of long-standing issues left unresolved by World War I and the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany, along with the aggression of Imperial Japan and Fascist Italy, led to the formation of the Axis Powers. They sought to expand their territories and influence, which triggered the start of the war with the invasion of Poland by Germany. The Allies, including the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and France, fought against the Axis in a series of campaigns spanning across Europe, Africa, and Asia. Significant events during the war include the Holocaust, the Battles of Stalingrad and Midway, and the D-Day invasion of Normandy. World War II came to an end in 1945 with the defeat of the Axis Powers and the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. The Korean War, which began in 1950 and continued until the signing of a ceasefire in 1953, was a conflict between North Korea, backed by China and the Soviet Union, and South Korea, supported by the United States and other Western nations. The war began when North Korean forces invaded South Korea, attempting to reunify the Korean Peninsula under communist rule. The conflict soon escalated, with both sides receiving military assistance from their respective allies. Major battles during the Korean War included the Battle of Inchon and the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. The fighting eventually led to the establishment of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which divides the peninsula along the 38th parallel. Although an armistice was signed in 1953, no formal peace treaty has ever been established, and tensions still exist between North and South Korea. In summary, the World Wars were momentous global conflicts that resulted in massive casualties, political upheaval, and significant changes in the world order, marking the end of old empires and the rise of new superpowers. The Korean War, while more localized, demonstrated the growing tensions between East and West during the early years of the Cold War and has had long-lasting effects on the relationships between the countries involved."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

I can use this background: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. Now, I have a new situation: The Gorge saw some negative effects due to deforestation. The Valley has a more fertile soil, it's not overgrazed, and the trees and bushes are abundant, and the productivity has increased several fold over the past decade. Biodiversity in the Valley is varied, and the soils are nutritious and retain more water, nitrogen and carbon. Answer this question please: Which area experiences more soil erosion? A:","completion":"A: The area that experiences more soil erosion is the Tibetan Plateau (the degraded land), as the decrease in biodiversity and poor soil quality leads to less plant life to anchor the soil, making it more susceptible to erosion. In contrast, the Valley has fertile soil, abundant trees and bushes, and a higher biodiversity, which contributes to better soil retention and reduced erosion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write an article with the title: \\"Fed Rate Rise Could Come ‘Relatively Soon’ as Data Point to Stronger Economy\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Fed Rate Rise Could Come 'Relatively Soon' as Data Point to Stronger Economy Introduction Recent economic data suggests that a stronger economy could be on the horizon, leading to the possibility of a Federal Reserve rate rise relatively soon. As inflation indicators and economic growth metrics point to an improving domestic environment, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) may be inclined to increase the federal funds rate. This article examines the factors at play and the potential implications that a rate hike could have on the financial markets and the wider economy. Economic Factors Influencing a Rate Hike Decision Several key economic indicators are bolstering the case for a rate hike in the near term. These factors include the following: 1. Lower Unemployment: The US unemployment rate has decreased steadily, reaching a near multi-decade low and reflecting a resilient labor market. 2. Inflation: The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, has been inching closer to the Fed's 2% target, an important threshold for the central bank. 3. GDP growth: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data signals a stronger economy with steady growth rates in recent quarters, surpassing many analyst expectations. 4. Consumer Confidence: Consumer confidence has been rising, with retail sales displaying a healthy upward trend, suggesting increased economic activity and spending. Potential Implications of a Rate Hike A rise in the federal funds rate could have wide-ranging implications for both the financial markets and the broader economy. 1. Positive Implications: - Economic Growth: A rate hike signals confidence in the strength of the economy and can lead to increased investment, which in turn could stimulate further growth. - Currency Strength: Higher interest rates could attract foreign investment, leading to a stronger US dollar and consequently, lower import prices. This may contribute to a healthier trade balance. - Controlling Inflation: By raising interest rates, the Fed effectively makes borrowing more expensive and can help to keep inflation in check, ensuring it does not outpace economic growth. 2. Negative Implications: - Increased Borrowing Costs: A rate hike would increase the cost of borrowing for both consumers and businesses, potentially leading to reduced spending, investment, and economic activity. - Stock Market Volatility: Higher interest rates can negatively impact stock prices, as investors adjust their expectations for future earnings and discount rates. This volatility can create uncertainty in financial markets. - Debt Burdens: As borrowing costs rise, both consumers and corporations with significant debt loads may feel increased pressure, potentially leading to higher default rates and financial stress. Preparing for a Rate Hike Market participants, businesses, and consumers should begin preparing for the potential implications that a rate hike may bring. This includes considering the following steps: 1. Diversifying investments: Investors should ensure that their portfolios are adequately diversified to protect against the potential for market volatility and changing perceptions of risk. 2. Refinancing debt: Consumers and businesses with high levels of variable-rate debt may consider refinancing to lock in lower rates before they climb higher. 3. Building savings: In the face of potentially higher borrowing costs, individuals should focus on building a solid financial foundation by bolstering emergency funds and reducing reliance on credit. Conclusion The possibility of a Federal Reserve rate hike appears to be gaining traction as economic data points to a stronger economy. While the implications for financial markets and the broader economy are multifaceted, preparation is key. By staying aware of economic trends and making prudent financial decisions, individuals and businesses can better adapt to the changing interest rate environment and weather any potential storms that may arise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hoping to add to a three-game winning streak, the Broncos traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina for an interconference match-up with the Carolina Panthers at Bank of America Stadium. In the first quarter, the Panthers struck first, with quarterback Cam Newton connecting on a 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Greg Olsen. However, the Broncos would reel off 29 unanswered points and dominate the remainder of the game. Quarterback Peyton Manning threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon Stokley. The Broncos grabbed the lead in the second quarter, with return specialist Trindon Holliday returning a punt 76 yards for a touchdown, followed by a 53-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater, then in the third quarter, cornerback Tony Carter returned an interception off Newton 40 yards for a touchdown.

The move could hasten impeachment proceedings against President Rousseff, correspondents say. Opposition lawmakers want to remove Ms Rousseff over claims she manipulated accounts to hide a growing deficit. Following Tuesday's vote, the embattled president cancelled a trip to attend a summit in Washington this week. At its leadership meeting on Tuesday, the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] decided that its six remaining ministers in President Rousseff's cabinet must resign or face ethics proceedings. Brazil tumbles like 'House of Cards' Rousseff faces perfect storm Brazil's bigger threats What's gone wrong? \\"The decision was taken by acclaim in a historical meeting marking the withdrawal from Dilma (Rousseff's) government,\\" Senator Romero Juca tweeted [in Portuguese]. The announcement came a day after tourism minister Henrique Eduardo Alves from the PMDB stood down. The BBC's Laura Bicker in Sao Paulo says President Rousseff could now be temporarily suspended from office by Congress as early as May. She would be replaced by Vice-President Michel Temer, leader of the PMDB, while the Senate decides if she should permanently leave her post, our correspondent adds. Speaking before the vote, Osmar Terra, a lawmaker from the PMDB, said he had little doubt which way it would go. \\"It will be a goodbye to the government,\\" he said. Analysts say a considerable number of lawmakers from the PMDB have felt uneasy about their alliance with the left-wing Workers' Party for a while. The impeachment process centres on the question of whether Dilma Rousseff used illegal accounting manoeuvres or not. But in practical terms, MPs and senators are looking mostly on whether she has the strength and legitimacy to rule Brazil, as the country faces a severe economic crisis as well as a political one. The PMDB was the first major coalition partner to jump ship. It is also the group that has most to gain should Ms Rousseff be impeached. Mr Temer has reportedly been talking to opposition leaders and working on forming a cabinet. But despite her weakened stance, Ms Rousseff and her Workers' Party still have support from many in Congress and in the streets. There will be a lot to play for in the coming days. Critical month for Rousseff Their unease has been compounded by calls for Ms Rousseff's impeachment and a widening corruption scandal involving senior members in the Workers' Party. The president needs one third of the members of the lower house of Congress to vote against her impeachment for the proceedings to be shelved. Without the PMDB, she could lose as many as 69 votes at once in the 513-member Chamber of Deputies. Another of Ms Rousseff's coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democratic Party (PSD) said it had given its lawmakers a free vote in any possible impeachment proceedings. On Monday, Ms Rousseff's mentor and predecessor in office, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, likened the moves to impeach her to a coup. But Lula himself is under pressure. The Supreme Court suspended his appointment as Ms Rousseff's chief of staff earlier this month and is due to take a final decision on the matter next week. Opponents of the government said the president had given Lula the post so he could escape investigation and possible proceedings over allegations of money laundering. Under Brazilian law, cabinet members can only be investigated by the Supreme Court, not by lower courts. There have been mass protests demanding the impeachment of President Rousseff in cities like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. But there have also been rallies in support of the government by those who say the president is the victim of a campaign to drive the Workers' Party from government.

Context: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

My heart went down when Miss Chan, our head teacher, said that Matthew and Beth, two students from England, would spend three months with us! I was worried that I had to speak English so much! But at the end of the school day, I was happier than I thought: the morning with them today was more enjoyable than I expected. Today is the most unforgettable first day I have had! Matthew is fantastic! His English is clearer and easier to listen to than I thought. The other English student, Beth, is the most helpful girl I've ever met. There were lots of things to do on the first day. Beth offered to help Miss Chan put up all the notices. Of course, some of the credit should also go to ME because I translated some of the notices for her. Miss Chan praised us! We finished all the preparations 10 minutes earlier than expected, then Beth and I talked for a while, Matthew sang several English songs and did some stand-up comedy at the party. We all praised him. When the bell rang to end the first school day, none of us wanted to leave. When I went back home, I had a little headache.

What is the last name of the person who established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London in 1934? Answer the above question based on the context below: Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL. In 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at Lydney Park and Verulamium and the Iron Age hill fort of Maiden Castle. During World War II, he re-joined the Armed Forces and rose to the rank of brigadier, serving in the North African Campaign and then the Allied...

In case A he stirred the solution, but in case B he didn't stir the the solution. In case C he heat the solution up, but in case D he cooled the solution down. In case E he used finely ground solute, but in case F he used cubes of solute. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which case the solute would have larger surface area, case E or case F? A:","completion":"In the given paragraph, John adds solute to a solvent under six different conditions, looking at various factors that affect the dissolution process. Among these conditions, the differences in solute surface area are investigated in case E and case F. In case E, the solute is finely ground, while in case F, the solute is in the form of cubes. The surface area of a solute is a crucial factor in determining the rate at which it dissolves, as a larger surface area allows for more contact between the solute and the solvent molecules. This increased contact results in more collisions and interactions between the molecules, leading to faster dissolution. Comparing case E and case F, the finely ground solute in case E would have a larger surface area than the cubic solute in case F. This is because the particles in case E are much smaller, and the total exposed surface of all the particles combined is significantly greater than that of a few larger cubes in case F. When a substance is ground or crushed into smaller particles, the surface area increases, enabling more solvent molecules to interact with the solute particles simultaneously. In case F, with the solute in the form of cubes, there is less overall exposure, fewer interaction points, and reduced collisions between the solute and solvent molecules, which results in a slower rate of dissolution compared to case E. Therefore, the solute would have a larger surface area in case E, where the solute is finely ground, compared to case F, where the solute is in the form of cubes."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

(CNN) -- As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Hengameh Shahidi\\" correctly answer the question \\"What are the names of some of the women in prison charged for being women's activists?\\"? Choices: a. no b. yes","completion":"b. yes The correct answer is 'yes' because the paragraph mentions Hengameh Shahidi as one of the women's rights activists who have been sent to prison for their activism.

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt. Still though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them? A little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft.

Question: Jeff and Jeremy were neighbors and best friends since kindergarten. They always enjoyed the same hobbies and did everything together. When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested. The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer. Which sport would Jeff play better do to his size, basketball or soccer? Answer:","completion":"Jeff would play basketball better due to his size. The reasoning behind this choice is as follows: 1. Basketball is a sport where height can be a significant advantage. A taller player has longer arms, which can make shooting and blocking shots easier, and they can also reach the basketball hoop more easily for scoring points. 2. Soccer, on the other hand, is a game where height is not necessarily an advantage. Soccer requires more footwork and agility and height doesn't necessarily give an advantage in these aspects. Taller players might even find it a significant disadvantage at times, where lower body strength and agility become critical. Therefore, considering Jeff's increased growth, he would likely be a better fit for basketball."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

His mother Sarah (Barton) Longacre died early in his life; his father, Peter Longacre, was the descendant of early Swedish settlers of North America. When Peter Longacre remarried, his son found the home life intolerable, and James Longacre left home at the age of 12, seeking work in the nearby city of Philadelphia. He apprenticed himself at a bookstore; the owner, John E. Watson, took the boy into his family. Over the following years, Longacre worked in the bookstore, but Watson realized that the boy's skill was in portraiture. Watson granted Longacre a release from his apprenticeship in 1813 so that he could follow an artistic muse, but the two remained close, and Watson would often sell Longacre's works.Longacre became apprenticed to George Murray, principal in the engraving firm Murray, Draper, Fairman & Co. at 47 Sansom Street in Philadelphia. This business derived from the firm established by the Philadelphia Mint's first chief engraver, Robert Scot. Longacre remained at the Murray firm until 1819; his major work there was portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hancock which were placed on a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence by publisher John Binns; the work cost Binns a total of 9,000 (equal to 147,307 today). Also employed at the Murray firm from 1816 was the man who would be Longacre's predecessor as chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht. Longacre's work at the company gave him a good reputation as an engraver skilled in rendering other artists' paintings as a printed engraving, and in 1819, he set up his own business at 230 Pine Street in Philadelphia.Longacre's first important commission were plates for S.F.

Movie plot title: Balls of Fury Movie plot: Eleven year old Randy Daytona becomes anxious when he learns that his father Peter has bet on his performance in the 1988 Summer Olympics table tennis finals. During his first game between his opponent Karl Wolfschtagg from the German Democratic Republic, Daytona has an accident and suffers an injury. Unable to continue, he loses the match. Loan sharks in the employ of criminal mastermind Feng murder his father, and Daytona leaves competitive ping-pong. Nineteen years later, Daytona is dismissed from the Peppermill casino and meets FBI agent Ernie Rodriguez, who requests his assistance in arresting Feng for running guns. Feng's hidden jungle hideout hosts a black-market Ping-Pong tournament, and Daytona's invitation is a way for the FBI to infiltrate Feng's organization. When Daytona agrees, Rodriguez tells him to win enough championships that Feng's scouts notice him. After losing a local tournament, Daytona is apprenticed to a blind man in Chinatown named Wong, who was Feng's former mentor. Daytona also meets Wong's niece, Maggie. When locals vandalize Master Wong's house for violating their edict against teaching white people ping pong, Daytona is forced to play against \\"The Dragon\\", a young girl, in exchange for Wong's right to stay. After Daytona beats the Dragon, Feng's men take notice of his win and bring Daytona, Rodriguez, and Wong to Feng's facility.

Kayla does not get a lot of enjoyment our of life anymore like Cynthia because","completion":"Kayla does not get a lot of enjoyment out of life anymore like Cynthia because she has been going through a rough patch lately. Several different factors have contributed to her current state of unhappiness, and she struggles to find joy in the things that once brought her immense satisfaction. First, Kayla's job has become quite monotonous and unfulfilling. She works long hours at a corporate office where her creativity is stifled, and the demands of her superiors weigh heavily on her shoulders. The constant stress and lack of excitement in her career have taken a toll on her overall well-being. Additionally, the long hours have left her with little personal time, making it even more challenging to pursue interests or hobbies outside of work. Second, several of Kayla's close relationships have suffered due to various reasons. Losing contact with friends who have moved away or simply drifted apart has left her feeling isolated and lonely. With fewer people around her for support and camaraderie, Kayla finds it harder to stay positive and optimistic in the face of life's difficulties. Furthermore, a recent breakup with her significant other has added to her feelings of sadness and abandonment. Third, Kayla's once-vibrant social life has dwindled in recent years. Once a fixture in her local community, she now finds that her peers are increasingly focused on their own lives, careers, and families. The lack of social interaction and genuine connection with others has left her craving more meaningful relationships and experiences. On the other hand, Cynthia has managed to maintain a sense of enjoyment in her life for several reasons. Firstly, she has pursued her passions and turned them into a career, allowing her to find happiness in her work. This fulfillment and sense of purpose have helped her remain enthusiastic and upbeat about her everyday life. Secondly, Cynthia has made it a priority to cultivate and maintain close relationships with her friends and family. She understands the importance of a strong support system in maintaining emotional well-being. By investing in these relationships, Cynthia always has a network of people she can lean on during difficult times. Lastly, Cynthia is an active member of her community and makes a conscious effort to engage with others. She participates in local events, volunteer opportunities, and clubs, which allows her to cultivate new friendships and create a sense of belonging. This active engagement with her community keeps her connected and prevents feelings of isolation. In conclusion, Kayla's unhappiness stems from a combination of a draining career, difficult personal relationships, and a dwindling social life. However, by following Cynthia's example in finding a fulfilling career, cultivating strong personal relationships, and actively engaging in one's community, Kayla has the potential to rediscover joy and satisfaction in her life. It will take time, effort, and possibly some support from a counselor or therapist, but there is hope for Kayla to rekindle her lust for life and find happiness once again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: OPT: (a). geology (b). methodology (c). biology (d). taxonomy A:","completion":"The name of the science that is concerned with naming and grouping organisms is (d). taxonomy. Taxonomy is a sub-discipline of biology that focuses on identifying, naming, and classifying organisms based on their shared characteristics and evolutionary relationships. The term \\"taxonomy\\" is derived from the Greek words \\"taxis\\" (meaning \\"arrangement\\" or \\"order\\") and \\"nomos\\" (meaning \\"law\\" or \\"knowledge\\"), which together signify the science of classification. The history of taxonomy dates back to ancient times when classification systems were developed to categorize and study plants, animals, and minerals. However, the modern system of taxonomy is chiefly attributed to the works of Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician who significantly contributed to the development of binomial nomenclature - the method of naming organisms using a two-part scientific name, genus, and species. For example, Homo sapiens is the scientific name for humans, where \\"Homo\\" represents the genus and \\"sapiens\\" indicates the species. The goal of taxonomy is to provide a systematic framework for organizing, studying, and understanding the immense diversity of life forms on Earth. This is accomplished by grouping organisms into hierarchical categories based on their shared characteristics and evolutionary relationships. These categories are often referred to as taxonomic ranks. The primary taxonomic ranks, from most inclusive to most exclusive, are Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species. There are also subcategories within these ranks, such as subphylum and infraclass, which work to classify organisms even further. Over time, advancements in molecular biology and genetics have led to revisions in taxonomic classifications, as well as the discovery of new organisms and the reclassification of existing ones. Techniques such as DNA sequencing allow scientists to examine the genetic makeup of organisms, providing more precise and accurate information about their relationships within the tree of life. Consequently, taxonomy is a continuously evolving field, with modifications being made to reflect the latest discoveries and insights into the natural world. In conclusion, taxonomy is the scientific discipline that deals with the naming, classification, and grouping of living organisms based on their shared characteristics and evolutionary histories. This vital field of study helps us understand and appreciate the intricate connections and relationships between different life forms, which is essential for effective conservation measures, the development of new medicines, and the advancement of our understanding of biodiversity on our planet."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Q: passage: An American Dietetic Association study found that cast-iron cookware can leach significant amounts of dietary iron into food. The amounts of iron absorbed varied greatly depending on the food, its acidity, its water content, how long it was cooked, and how old the cookware is. The iron in spaghetti sauce increased 945 percent (from 0.61 mg/100g to 5.77 mg/100g), while other foods increased less dramatically; for example, the iron in cornbread increased 28 percent, from 0.67 to 0.86 mg/100g. Anemics, and those with iron deficiencies, may benefit from this effect, which was the basis for the development of the lucky iron fish, an iron ingot used during cooking to provide dietary iron to those with iron deficiency.

To show off your waistline, tuck the blouse in, or simply tuck in the front. The blouse can be a solid color or patterned. You can also pair the blouse with a jacket or thin belt. It’s best to tuck the sweater in so that your look isn’t too bulky. Mom jeans are baggier than most other jeans, and combined with an untucked sweater, your form won’t be very distinct. Put on your favorite over-sized sweater and try tucking in the front part. You want the waistline of your jeans to be noticeable. If your sweater isn't super bulky, try tucking in all of it for a sophisticated look. Pair it with a belt if desired. Off-the-shoulder tops are a great choice when you want to wear a more loose-fitting shirt with your jeans. They’ll balance out the shape of your mom jeans by showing off your shoulders while also giving you a bohemian look. Since most mom jeans are high-waisted, pairing them with a crop top is a popular choice. Crop tops allow you to show off your waistline, and they come in all forms — from loose-fitting t-shirts to tight spandex tops. Try out some different styles and see which one you like the best.

The headmaster refuses, so Mohammed's father eventually takes him home. Mohammed's father, who is a widower, now wants to marry a local girl and is preparing for the wedding. He approaches the girl's parents with gifts and they give him approval. He tries to hide the fact that he has a blind son because he fears the girl's family will see that as a bad omen. Meanwhile, Mohammed happily roams around the beautiful hills of his village with his sisters. He touches and feels the nature around him, counting the sounds of animals, and imitating them. He displays a unique attitude towards nature, and seems to understand its rhythms and textures as a language. Mohammed goes to the local school with his sisters and reads the lessons from his textbook in Braille, which amazes the children and the teacher. Fearing his bride-to-be's family will learn of Mohammed, his father takes him away and leaves him with a blind carpenter who agrees to make him an apprentice. The blind carpenter mentors the boy, who wants to see God. Mohammad says God does not love him and thus made him blind and tells him about how his teacher told him that God loves them more as they are blind, but then asks why God should make him blind if he loves him more. He also tells him that he wanted to be able to see God, to which his teacher had said that God is everywhere and that you can also feel God. The carpenter then just says that he agrees with his teacher and walks away, possibly affected by the boy's words, as he himself is blind.

The game was an injury-laden game for both teams, with a total of seven players lost for both teams, with Chicago losing five (Lance Louis , Chris Spencer , Matt Forte , Devin Hester , and Charles Tillman ), while Minnesota lost Kyle Rudolph and Harrison Smith to concussions. The Bears first offensive play resulted in Matt Forte fumbling for the first time all season when he ran into Evan Rodriguez, and had the ball recovered by Vikings linebacker Chad Greenway. The Vikings then scored a field goal on Blair Walsh's 40-yard field goal. The Bears then struck back when Nick Roach stripped the ball from Adrian Peterson, which was recovered by Tillman. Jay Cutler, returning from the concussion he sustained two weeks prior, moved the ball downfield to the Vikings one-yard line, where Michael Bush ran in to give the Bears the lead. The Bears closed out the quarter with a 10-3 lead after Gould kicked a 47-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Bears scored again on Bush's second one-yard touchdown run. On the ensuing extra point, holder Adam Podlesh faked the kick and ran in to give the Bears two points. Chris Conte would eventually intercept Christian Ponder at the 48-yard line and return the interception 35 yards to the Vikings 13-yard line. Cutler then hit Matt Spaeth in the left corner of the end zone to increase the score to 25-3. Early in the second half, Minnesota would record their first touchdown of the game on Ponder's two-yard pass to Rudolph, and Gould would then make a 46-yard field goal late in the third quarter to end the game with a Chicago victory. In his return, Cutler completed 15 of 17 passes for 117 yards with one touchdown and a 115.0 passer rating in the first half, and would end the game with stats of 23 of 31 passes completed for 188 yards with one touchdown, one interception and an 86.5 passer rating. Receiver Brandon Marshall recorded 12 catches for 92 yards, and passed the 1,000 yards receiving mark for the sixth time in his career with 1,017 yards, making him the first Bears receiver to record 1,000 yards in a season since Marty Booker in 2002.

The employees at the lab weren't planning on analyzing any frogs, but when they found the one outside their front door they changed their mind. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which frog will have more tissue broken down? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, it cannot be definitively concluded which frog, Frog X or Frog Y, will have more tissue broken down. However, we can discuss the potential factors that may contribute to tissue breakdown in each frog and make an informed speculation. Frog X, found in a pond in the forest, has a parasite present in its body. The presence of a parasite can potentially lead to the breakdown of tissues in the host, depending on the type of parasite and the severity of the infection. Parasites may induce an immune response in the host organism, which can cause inflammation and tissue damage. Additionally, some parasites directly consume or damage host tissues, leading to tissue breakdown. Furthermore, the breakdown of tissues could also happen because of other factors associated with living in the wild, such as injuries, nutritional deficiencies, or exposure to other pathogens. Frog Y, on the other hand, was found just outside the laboratory and is missing one eye. The fact that the frog is missing an eye could indicate the presence of some form of trauma or injury, which may have led to tissue damage or breakdown. The injury or the event that caused the eye loss could have also affected other tissues in the frog's body, leading to further tissue breakdown. Similar to Frog X, additional factors related to living in the wild and potential infections, even at a location close to the laboratory, may impact tissue breakdown in Frog Y. While it is possible that both frogs have experienced varying levels of tissue breakdown, we do not have enough information to accurately determine which frog will have more tissue broken down. Factors such as the type and severity of the parasitic infection in Frog X, the cause of Frog Y's missing eye, and any possible underlying health conditions or infections in both frogs would need to be considered and investigated in a laboratory setting before drawing a conclusion. In summary, although we cannot definitively determine which frog, Frog X or Frog Y, will have more tissue broken down, we can speculate on the potential factors that may contribute to tissue breakdown in each frog. A more comprehensive analysis of the health of both frogs and detailed examination of the specific parasite in Frog X and the cause of Frog Y's missing eye would be required to answer this question accurately."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a subject line for this message: As detailed in the attached FERC notice, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved FERC's Information Collection Request for \\"Reporting of Natural Gas Sales to the California Market\\" through the six-month emergency period that will expire on 1/31/02. (Emergency reporting requirements are automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations.) However, it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the reporting requirements could be extended. OMB has advised FERC that, if it decides to request renewal of the Information Collection Request after that date, it must address certain issues as part of its supporting statement (more specifically, \\"include an explicit discussion\\"). As you may remember, in addition to requesting rehearing of the FERC order, ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems with FERC's estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed collection of information. We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements, much less keep our records in that manner. We manage our business on an aggregated basis, and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significant manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale. We stated that we might even have to hire full-time staff to dedicate to the task. The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requires FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the reporting requirements past 1/31/02. (FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through 9/30/02 to coincide with the end date of its mitigation plan.) OMB questioned the practical utility of requiring disaggregated data when \\"commenters\\" reported that they did not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way. OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant data manipulation in order to respond, and the resulting disaggregation would likely be artificial. OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden estimates after \\"consulting with respondents\\", and it must provide a list of the names, affiliates, and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted.

A:","completion":"To solve the task, you are asked to find the probability that the product of two integers, one from set m and one from set t, is negative. To do this, you will need to follow these steps: 1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes, which is the product of the number of elements in set m and the number of elements in set t. 2. Determine the number of outcomes that would result in a negative product. 3. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of negative product outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes Set m has 5 elements, and set t has 5 elements, so there are a total of 5 * 5 = 25 possible outcomes. Step 2: Determine the number of outcomes that would result in a negative product Negative product outcomes can be achieved when one integer is positive and the other is negative. So we need to count the combinations of positive and negative integers in sets m and t: - Set m has no positive integers and 5 negative integers. - Set t has 3 positive integers and 2 negative integers. The combinations that will result in a negative product are: - One integer from the 5 negatives in set m and one integer from the 3 positives in set t: 5 * 3 = 15 combinations. Step 3: Calculate the probability Probability = (Number of negative product outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) Probability = 15 / 25 = 3 / 5 The probability that the product of the two randomly selected integers (one from set m and one from set t) will be negative is 3/5 or 60%."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who bought a series of lots in the area on Peter Brooks' behalf? , can you please find it? The Monadnock was commissioned by Boston real estate developers Peter and Shepherd Brooks in the building boom following the Depression of 1873–79. The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission. Burnham and Root would become the architects of choice for the Brooks family, for whom they would complete the first high-rise building in Chicago, the 10-story Montauk Building, in 1883, and the 11-story Rookery Building in 1888. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 had destroyed a 4-mile (6.4 km) by 0.5-mile (0.80 km) swath of the city between the Chicago River and Lake Michigan, and subsequent commercial development expanded into the area far south of the main business district along the river that would come to be known as \\"the Loop\\". Between 1881 and 1885, Aldis bought a series of lots in the area on Peter Brooks' behalf, including a 70-by-200-foot (21 by 61 m) site on the corner of Jackson and Dearborn streets. The location was remote, yet attractive for several reasons. The construction of the Chicago Board of Trade Building in 1885 had made nearby LaSalle Street the city's prime financial district, driving up property... Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person who bought a series of lots in the area on Peter Brooks' behalf is Owen.

Real GDP per capita (measured in 2009 dollars) was 52,444 in 2017 and has been growing each year since 2010. It grew 3.0% per year on average in the 1960s, 2.1% in the 1970s, 2.4% in the 1980s, 2.2% in the 1990s, 0.7% in the 2000s, and 0.9% from 2010 to 2017. Reasons for slower growth since 2000 are debated by economists and may include aging demographics, slower population and growth in labor force, slower productivity growth, reduced corporate investment, greater income inequality reducing demand, lack of major innovations, and reduced labor power. The U.S. ranked 20th out of 220 countries in GDP per capita in 2017.

Heavy rains cause flooding, and hurricane rains can cause landslides and flash floods. Given these facts, what is caused by flooding among the following options: - landslides - desert - sunlight - drought - Water expanding - erosion - contamination - Pollution","completion":"Flooding, a natural disaster, occurs when excessive amounts of water overflow from a water body, such as rivers, lakes, or the ocean, or after heavy rainfall. In extreme cases, hurricanes and other climatic events can also lead to floods. Among the given options, flooding is known to cause landslides, erosion, contamination, and pollution. 1. Landslides: Heavy rainfall or flooding can cause the ground to become saturated with water, resulting in landslides. Saturated soil weakens the structural integrity of slopes, leading to the downhill movement of rock, soil, and other debris. This can be particularly dangerous in hilly or mountainous areas, where the steepness and instability of the slopes increase the risk of landslides. 2. Erosion: Flooding can lead to erosion, the process where water gradually wears away the earth's surface, including rocks, soil, and other materials. Floodwaters, particularly those with high velocity, can significantly erode river banks, coastal areas, and other regions it contacts. This causes the landscape to change and may lead to additional hazards, such as the collapse of structures built on eroded land or the loss of fertile agricultural land. 3. Contamination: Floodwaters often mix with contaminants from various sources, such as sewage systems, industrial facilities, and agricultural lands. This can result in widespread water contamination, making the water unsafe for human consumption or use. Flooding can contaminate the water supplies of entire communities, posing significant health risks, including the spread of waterborne diseases and other illnesses. 4. Pollution: In addition to spreading contamination, flooding can also exacerbate pollution in various ways. For instance, floodwaters can carry pollutants like chemicals, oil, and waste from various sources, dispersing them throughout the environment. This can lead to the pollution of rivers, lakes, and other water bodies, which may harm aquatic life and disrupt ecosystems. Additionally, flooding can cause the overflow of hazardous waste facilities and other industrial sites, releasing dangerous substances into the environment. In conclusion, heavy rains and flooding are associated with several detrimental environmental effects, including landslides, erosion, contamination, and pollution. Communities and governments must take proactive measures to mitigate these consequences and protect both human life and the natural environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We learn that Sidney's mother was killed almost one year before, and that Sidney and her father are alone. Sidney's testimony identified Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) as the killer, although Cotton swears that he is innocent.The next day, Sidney's school is abuzz with news of the murder, and classes are temporarily cancelled. Sidney decides that since her father is gone and she is alone, she is going to stay with her her best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan). Sidney, Tatum, and BIlly sit with their group of friends, which includes Randy (Jamie Kennedy), who is obsessed with horror movies, and Stu (Matthew Lilliard), a class clown type who used to date Casey Becker.Sidney goes home to wait for Tatum to pick her up. The... Answer:","completion":"The real killers in the movie \\"Scream\\" are Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) and Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard). They work together, taking turns to don the ghostface costume and terrorize the town of Woodsboro. Both have their motives for committing the murders. Billy Loomis is driven primarily by revenge against Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and her family. He blames Sidney's mother, Maureen, for the disintegration of his own family. Maureen had an affair with Billy's father, which led to Billy's mother leaving the family. Out of anger and a twisted sense of vengeance, Billy resolves to kill Maureen. He and Stu concoct a plan and carry out the murder of Maureen one year before the events of the film take place. They frame Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) for the crime, who is eventually convicted largely based on Sidney's testimony. Stu Macher, although not bearing such personal grudges, is an eager accomplice to Billy. He is portrayed as being easily influenced and primarily motivated by a desire for notoriety and the thrill of evading capture. Stu is also revealed to be the one responsible for killing his ex-girlfriend, Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore), in the opening scene of the movie. As the movie progresses, Billy and Stu carry out a series of murders, all the while taunting and stalking Sidney. The climax of the film occurs during a house party at Stu's residence. Here, they reveal their true identities to Sidney and plan to frame her father, Neil (Lawrence Hecht), for the murders. However, Sidney manages to outsmart and defeat them with the help of Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), the news reporter, and Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), the horror movie enthusiast. In conclusion, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher are the real killers in the movie \\"Scream.\\" Their motivations stem from personal vendettas, a lust for infamy, and a fascination with horror movie tropes. Ultimately, their plan is foiled, and they are defeated by the very person they sought to terrorize, Sidney Prescott."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the two facts above, what enhances the effects of erosion?","completion":"Given the two facts above, the effects of erosion are enhanced by: 1. Lack of vegetation: Plant roots help hold the soil in place, reducing wind erosion, and a vegetative cover provides a physical barrier against wind and rain. 2. Dry soil conditions: Moist soil is heavier and harder for the wind to pick up, so dry soil is more susceptible to wind erosion. 3. Loose soil structure: Soils with poor aggregation and structure are more easily broken down by wind and water. 4. Soil particle size: Smaller soil particles are more easily picked up by the wind, increasing the risk of erosion. Clay and silt particles are more likely to be transported by wind than sand particles. 5. Increased wind speed and duration: Erosion rates increase significantly with increased wind speed and duration. 6. Lack of windbreaks: Rows of trees, shrubs, or other structures that slow down wind speed can help protect soil from wind erosion. 7.

The American Dream drove not only 1800s gold-rush prospectors but also waves of immigrants throughout that century and the next.People from Europe, and a large number of Chinese, arrived in the US in the 19th century hoping that in America they would find gold in the streets.But most.instead, worked as railroad laborers.They created the oldest Chinatown, in San Francisco, and gave the city a Chinese name \\"the old gold hill\\". In the 20th century, some critics said that it was no longer possible to become prosperous through determination and hard work. Unfair education for students from poor families and racial discrimination almost made the American Dream a nightmare . Then, in the 1990s, California saw a new wave of dreamers in Silicon Valley.People poured their energy into the Internet.

Answer a question about this article: Charles \\"Wag\\" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London, England. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Also in 1966, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park, who became his friend and mentor. The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20. He would go on to win the title a further three times. Schwarzenegger then flew back to Munich, training for four to six hours daily, attending business school and working in a health club (Rolf Putziger's gym where he worked and trained from 1966–1968), returning in 1968 to London to win his next Mr. Universe title. He frequently told Roger C. Field, his English coach and friend in Munich at that time, \\"I'm going to become the greatest actor!\\" Which of the bodybuilders Schwarzenegger idolized as a kid did he meet in 1966?","completion":"The bodybuilder who Arnold Schwarzenegger idolized as a child and had the opportunity to meet in 1966 is Reg Park. Born in 1928, Reg Park was a British bodybuilder and businessman who won the Mr. Universe title three times in the midst of his career. He later ventured into the film industry, featuring primarily in Italian movies. In the year 1966, during Arnold Schwarzenegger's time in London where he was staying with Charles \\"Wag\\" Bennett to improve his skill in bodybuilding, he had the fortunate opportunity to encounter his childhood idol, Reg Park. This meeting would prove to be a significant event in Schwarzenegger's life, as Park didn't just become an acquaintance but also a mentor and a friend to the young Schwarzenegger. Having admired Park's achievements in the domain of bodybuilding from an early age, Schwarzenegger was deeply influenced by him, and their meeting further fostered this admiration. Through his relationship with Park, Schwarzenegger not only gained valuable inspiration that fueled his ambition, but he also got to learn directly from one of his greatest inspirations. This mentorship played an important role in Schwarzenegger's career development. After his intense training program devised by Bennett, Schwarzenegger eventually achieved the high esteemed title of Mr. Universe in 1967, at the age of 20, which made him the youngest ever Mr. Universe. He went on to win the title three more times in subsequent years. Schwarzenegger's determination and focus on his goal, coupled with the impactful guidance he received from influential figures in his life like Bennett and Park, greatly facilitated his iconic success in the realm of bodybuilding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the September 11 attacks, it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away the fact that the US government gave 245 million dollars to the new evildoers du jour. Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001. Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of the Taliban's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies. Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords, it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid -- the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage.

Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare.

Disapproval of Donald Trump is at a new high, support for the Mueller investigation is broad and half of Americans in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll favor Congress initiating impeachment proceedings against the president. Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Sixty percent in the national survey disapprove of Trump’s performance in office, numerically the highest of his presidency, albeit by a single point; that includes 53 percent who disapprove strongly, more than half for the first time. Thirty-six percent approve, matching his low. See PDF for full results, charts and tables. Mary Altaffer/AP, FILE The results come a week after Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was convicted of fraud, and his former longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to eight felonies, including illegal campaign finance actions that he said Trump directed. Trump’s average approval rating since taking office is the lowest for any president in modern polling since the 1940s. One factor: Contrary to his “drain the swamp” rhetoric, 45 percent say corruption in Washington has increased under Trump, while just 13 percent say it’s declined. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Suspicions of the president relating to the Mueller investigation are substantial. Sixty-one percent say that if assertions by Cohen are true, Trump broke the law. Fifty-three percent also think Trump obstructed special counsel Robert Mueller’s work. The national survey, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, finds that half the public supports Congress initiating impeachment proceedings against Trump, 49-46 percent; support rises to 57 percent among women. And support for the investigation running its course is broader: Americans overall back Mueller’s probe by 63-29 percent. Fifty-two percent support it strongly, a high level of strong sentiment. Andrew Harnik/AP, FILE Mueller prosecuted Manafort and referred the Cohen case to federal prosecutors in New York. Support for Mueller’s investigation peaks at 85 percent among Democrats, but also takes in 67 percent of independents and even a third of Republicans (32 percent). Forty-one percent of conservatives back Mueller, rising to more than seven in 10 moderates and liberals. In Trump’s dispute with Attorney General Jeff Sessions for allowing the investigation to proceed, the public sides with Sessions, 62-23 percent. Sixty-four percent also oppose the idea of Trump firing Sessions; just 19 percent support it. Further, while Trump has railed against the Manafort prosecution, Americans call it justified by an overwhelming 67-17 percent, including nearly half of Republicans. The public opposes Trump pardoning Manafort by essentially the same margin, 66-18 percent, with 53 percent strongly opposed. Even among Republicans, 45 percent oppose a Manafort pardon; 36 percent support it. The damage to Trump on these ethics concerns overwhelms his better rating for handling the economy, an essentially even split, 45-47 percent. That demonstrates that a good economy only makes it possible for a president to be popular – it’s no guarantee. Approval, Groups The president’s approval rating is highly partisan, but with relative challenges for Trump across the board. His job rating matches his low among Republicans (78 percent approve) and Democrats (6 percent) alike. It’s 35 percent among independents. He’s at new lows among college-educated Americans (albeit just by a point; 29 percent approve), moderates (24 percent) and blacks (3 percent, with a nearly unanimous 93 percent disapproving). The single biggest shift is among college-educated white women – just 23 percent now approve of Trump, down 17 points from the peak in April 2017, with disapproval up 20 points, from 55 percent then to 75 percent now. Still, even among non-college white men, a core Trump group, his approval is down 15 points, from 70 percent just this spring to 55 percent today. Other Group Results Trump’s approval rating is 12 points lower among women than men, and that gender gap is reflected elsewhere. As noted, 57 percent of women favor Congress initiating impeachment proceedings; that drops to 40 percent of men. Seventy percent of liberals support impeachment proceedings, declining to 51 percent of moderates and 30 percent of conservatives. Impeachment support is highest, a vast 80 percent, among blacks; 37 percent of whites agree. Some of these gaps narrow on whether or not the charges against Manafort were justified. Two-thirds of men and women alike say they were, as do two-thirds of whites – including 64 percent of white men without college degrees. Even among Republicans, conservatives and those who approve of Trump’s work in office, more see the charges as justified than as unjustified, by 48-28, 49-30 and 47-29 percent, respectively. (The rest express no opinion.) As noted, 45 percent of Republicans oppose Trump pardoning Manafort, with 36 percent support. It’s similar among conservatives, 46-34 percent. Trump approvers split about evenly on a Manafort pardon, with 39 percent opposed, 37 percent in favor. Opposition to a pardon goes higher in other groups – 68 percent among men and 64 percent among women, for example (no real difference between them), 64 percent among whites and Hispanics alike, and 82 percent among blacks. Sixty-one percent, as noted, say that if Cohen’s claim that he acted at Trump’s direction is true, Trump committed a crime. That view is lowest among Republicans, 28 percent. But there’s concern for Trump in other core groups: A substantial minority of conservatives, 41 percent, say he broke the law if Cohen’s telling the truth. So do 44 percent of evangelical white Protestants, 52 percent of whites and 52 percent of non-college white men, all groups whose support Trump needs. Methodology This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Aug. 26-29, 2018, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,003 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.6 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 33-25-37 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President Trump’s disapproval rating has hit a high point of 60 percent, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll that also finds that clear majorities of Americans support the special counsel’s Russia investigation and say the president should not fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions. At the dawn of the fall campaign sprint to the midterm ­elections, which will determine whether Democrats retake control of Congress, the poll finds that a majority of the public has turned against Trump and is on guard against his efforts to influence the Justice Department and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s wide-ranging probe. Nearly half of Americans, 49 percent, say Congress should begin impeachment proceedings that could lead to Trump being removed from office, while 46 percent say Congress should not. [Read full poll results | How the poll was conducted] And a narrow majority — 53 percent — say they think Trump has tried to interfere with Mueller’s investigation in a way that amounts to obstruction of justice; 35 percent say they do not think the president has tried to interfere. Overall, 60 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s job performance, with 36 percent approving, according to the poll. Because of random sampling variation, this represents only a marginal shift from the last Post-ABC survey, in April, which measured Trump’s rating at 56 percent disapproval and 40 percent approval. The new poll was conducted Aug. 26 to 29, in the week after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted of federal tax and bank fraud and after former Trump attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty and implicated the president in illegal payments to silence women who alleged sexual encounters with Trump. The four-month gap between Post-ABC polls makes it difficult to attribute the modest uptick in disapproval of Trump to specific events. Other public polls have shown Trump’s disapproval rating in the low- to mid-50s and have not tracked a rise since the Manafort conviction and Cohen guilty plea. Trump has tried to rally support for Republican candidates in the Nov. 6 elections by pointing to his economic record. This week’s poll finds that despite the president’s unpopularity with voters, he gets better ratings when it comes to the economy: 45 percent of Americans approve and 47 percent disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy. [Trump at a precarious moment in his presidency: Privately brooding and publicly roaring] Trump’s overall popularity breaks down along lines of partisanship, ethnicity and gender, according to the poll. While 78 percent of Republicans approve of his performance, 93 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of independents disapprove. More men support him than women, and while 45 percent of whites back him, 19 percent of nonwhites approve. The poll finds that there are clear limitations to Trump’s efforts all summer to politicize and discredit the Russia investigation. The president has fired a near-daily barrage of tweets labeling the probe a “witch hunt” and attacking the credibility of Mueller and several current and former Justice Department officials. But 63 percent of Americans support Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, with 52 percent saying they support it strongly; 29 percent oppose the probe. Opinions on Mueller’s work also break down along partisan lines, with 61 percent of Republicans opposing the probe but an even larger 85 percent of Democrats expressing support. Among independents, however, a two-thirds majority of 67 percent back the investigation. Trump has complained that Manafort was treated unfairly by Mueller’s prosecutors, and after a jury convicted Manafort last month, the president tweeted that he felt “very badly” for him. But 67 percent of Americans think Mueller’s case against Manafort was justified, while 17 percent say it was unjustified, according to the poll. Trump’s praise of Manafort has stirred speculation that he might pardon his former campaign chairman, but the poll finds that it would be a political land mine for the president. Two-thirds of Americans oppose Trump pardoning Manafort — 53 percent strongly oppose it — and 18 percent support a pardon. Trump has ratcheted up his public attacks on Sessions in recent weeks and has consulted his personal attorneys and other advisers about firing the attorney general, whom he has viewed as insufficiently loyal after Sessions recused himself last year from overseeing the Russia investigation because of a conflict of interest. But the public is squarely behind Sessions. Sixty-four percent of Americans do not think Trump should fire Sessions, with 19 percent saying he should and 17 percent saying they have no opinion. Nearly half of Republicans, 47 percent, say Trump should not fire the attorney general, with 31 percent saying he should. Just under a quarter of Americans, 23 percent, say they agree with Trump’s criticisms of Sessions for allowing the Mueller investigation to proceed, while 62 percent say they side with Sessions, who has said he is following the law. Two-thirds of Americans say they had read or heard at least some of the news about Cohen’s guilty plea to eight violations of banking, tax and campaign finance laws, though less than a quarter heard “a great deal” about the news. Cohen told a federal judge last week that before the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump directed him to pay off two women to keep their stories of alleged affairs with Trump from becoming public. [Michael Cohen says he worked to silence two women ‘in coordination’ with Trump to influence 2016 election] The poll finds that 61 percent of Americans think that Trump committed a crime if he did direct Cohen to make the payments, while 31 percent say he did not commit a crime. Democrats are hoping to retake control of one or both houses of Congress in November’s elections. If they do, party leaders will face pressure from their energized base to use congressional oversight committees to investigate potential misconduct by the president and his administration, as well as perhaps begin impeachment proceedings. The survey finds a clear partisan divide on the issue. While 75 percent of Democrats say Congress should begin impeachment hearings, 82 percent of Republicans say lawmakers should not. Among independents, 49 percent support impeachment while 46 percent oppose it. The Post-ABC poll was conducted among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on conventional and cellphones; the margin of sampling error for overall results is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

The people in the city needed to go to different places, like work and school, so they used cars and bicycles to get there. One sad day, a very bad thing happened. A woman was driving her car and didn't pay enough attention to where she was going. As she was driving, she didn't see a person riding a bicycle near her. Because she didn't look, her car hit the person on the bicycle. This made the person on the bicycle very hurt. In fact, it was so bad that the person could not live anymore. Hitting someone with your car like that is also against the rules of the road. So, a lot of people got very sad and worried about what happened, and they wanted to make sure it didn't happen again. A judge, who is like a wise grown-up who helps make sure people follow the rules, needed to talk about this bad event. The judge wanted to find out why the woman driving the car didn't look and why she hit the person on the bicycle. The judge said that the driver should have been more careful when using her car, because cars can be very dangerous if people don't use them the right way. In the end, the judge said that it was very important for everyone to follow the rules of the road and to always look and pay attention. This is how we can keep each other safe and not let bad things happen when we share the roads with cars and bicycles. So, remember boys and girls, always look and pay attention when you're riding your bicycle or if you're in a car with your parents. That way, everyone can have a safe and happy time when traveling in the big city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Both adultery and cohabitation are currently classified as second-degree misdemeanors, which could mean up to 60 days in jail for offending couples, according to Chapter 798 of the 2013 Florida Statutes. Granted, even members of the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee agreed that although some people may consider cheating and cohabitating to be immoral, these laws are virtually impossible to enforce and unnecessary in this day and age. Most officials won't admit it, but regulating what consenting couples do behind closed bedroom doors is just plain stupid.

As a Massachusetts native, I think I speak on behalf of the entire Bay State when I say we're totally OK with you having sex with a rodeo clown. As far as we're concerned, what happens at the rodeo stays at the rodeo. We're pretty liberal like that -- a solid blue state through and through. Wait, what's that you say? There are horses present? Won't somebody think of the horses?! If we've said it once, we've said it a thousand times: No having sex with rodeo clowns in the presence of horses! And we mean it!

This is the 21st century, people: Women don't just lie around waiting for their princes to arrive! In fact, it's literally illegal to do so in Colorado, where kissing a sleeping woman is prohibited by law. So, guys, you'll just have to find some other way to wake her from the evil witch's spell. Wink, Wink In Alabama, it's against the law for a man to seduce \\"a chaste woman by means of temptation, deception, arts, flattery, or a promise of marriage.\\" (That doesn't leave you a lot of options.)

Weirdly, though, Louisiana has no problem with people fucking corpses. It turns out they're not alone. A quick survey of nationwide laws on sodomy and necrophilia shows that there are four states that explicitly ban the former in some way, while remaining silent on the latter: In Louisiana and North Carolina, two willing adults can't get no oral satisfaction, but they can diddle a dead person. Oklahoma and Kansas are also cool with you banging the dearly departed, but they ban oral intercourse between consenting gay or lesbian partners. For the record, several other states—Nebraska, New Mexico, and Vermont—also appear to allow necrophilia, but they're cool with sodomy, too, so at least they're consistent. It turns out there's actually a fraught history behind necrophilia and the law; many of the states that think they've banned it actually have vague injunctions banning \\"crimes against nature,\\" or they classify it as a sexual assault against a partner who can't give consent. That leads to some trouble in the courts. In Wisconsin a few years back, three young men were arrested while trying to dig up a corpse for sex. Since the state didn't have an explicit necrophilia ban, they were charged with attempted sexual assault for their intent to have sex with an unwilling party. But an appeals court threw out their conviction, saying a corpse isn't a person under state law, and therefore consent isn't an issue. (The state Supreme Court, apparently afraid of suborning a corpse-banging epidemic, voted 5-2 to restore their conviction on shaky legal grounds.) The problem is that \\"the dead body is a quasi-subject before the law,\\" according to legal theorist John Troyer in his landmark 2008 journal article on the subject, and \\"the ambiguous juridical standing of the human corpse in necrophilia cases compounds the sexual monstrousness of the necrophiliac and of necrophilic acts.\\" In any case, it seems to offend our modern moral intuitions that any sex between consenting adults could be illegal, but sex with a dead person—can anyone be less willing than a corpse?—could be permissible. Of course, Christian moralizers would say that's why all non-straight, non-missionary sex should be illegal: because parsing out the secular legal intricacies of various sex acts is a lot muddier than resting on the word of God. That would be great!... if everyone believed in their God and their interpretation of that God's sexual laws. But hell, not even Louisiana legislators can apparently get on board with that thoroughgoing reasoning. And until they do, the anti-sodomy, anti-necrophilia religious right is just flogging a dead horse. (But not fucking it, obviously.) Full map—red states are the anti-blowjobs, corpse-sex-friendly states: (h/t Stuff You Should Know) ||||| Escorts Fail to Take Down Utah Sex Solicitation Law (CN) - Utah's sexual solicitation laws pass constitutional muster, the 10th Circuit ruled, disagreeing with a federal judge who found one provision of the statute too vague. Three escort services - Bushco dba Babydolls Escorts, Companions LLC and TT II Inc. - had sued Attorney General Mark Shurtleff and Salt Lake Police Chief Chris Burbank over HB 121 in 2011. Passed in March 2011, the law subjected sexually oriented businesses, or SOBs, to broadened statutes defining what activities constitute an intent to buy or sell sex. It amended Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-1313 by adding two new provisions, Sections 1313(1)(c) and 1313(2). Subsection 1(c) says that a person may be arrested for soliciting sex if police believe the person had an \\"intent to engage in sexual activity for a fee.\\" Acts proscribed when commissioned for a fee include exposing \\"a person's genitals, the buttocks, the anus, the public area or the female breast below the top of the areola,\\" the touching of genitalia, masturbation and \\"any act of lewdness.\\" Subsection 2 says that the \\"intent to engage in sexual activity for a fee may be inferred from 'a person's engaging in, offering to engage in, or requesting another to engage in any of the acts described' above 'under the totality of the existing circumstances.\\" U.S. District Judge Dee Benson found subsection 2 \\"unconstitutionally vague\\" last year and ordered it severed and stricken from the statute. The other section survived, and Benson also dismissed Burbank from the action as an unnecessary party. Both sides appealed, but the state prevailed Monday, persuading a three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit that both provisions should have been upheld. They are not \\"unconstitutionally overbroad because they do not encompass a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct,\\" Judge David Ebel wrote for the court. The panel rejected the argument from the escort services that the amended statutes would \\"chill\\" a variety of protected expression, including \\"theatrical performers who use some of the enumerated exposure or touching to convey an artistic message.\\" \\"Even assuming, without deciding, that the exposure and touching enumerated in the amendments is constitutionally protected expressive conduct under some circumstances, we nonetheless conclude that the amendments do not reach a substantial amount of protected speech,\\" Ebel wrote. \\"The statute only prohibits participation in the enumerated exposure or touching done with the intent to engage in, or pay for, sexual activity for a fee. On the face of the statute, it does not reach any touching or exposure done without that intent. \\"In other words, the sexual solicitation statute does not criminalize the enumerated touching or exposure when done without the intent to participate in statutorily defined sexual activity for a fee. Thus, it does not reach the conduct of an actor clasping her breast as part of a stage performance or a wife touching her husband's buttocks during an embrace. The intent requirement contained in the statute ensures that the statute only criminalizes the enumerated touching and exposure when done with the intent to participate in, for a fee, statutorily defined sexual activity.\\" Additionally, subsection 2 does not broaden police discretion to the point the provision \\"authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement,\\" according to the 27-page ruling. \\"Instead, it constrains the officer's discretion,\\" Ebel wrote. In upholding the laws, the court relied on the four-prong test for justifying incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms created by the U.S. Supreme Court with the 1968 case United States v. O'Brien. Here, Utah's amendments did not \\"place too great a burden\\" on the speech rights of escort services, according to the ruling. \\"The District Court rejected the argument that § 1313(1)(c) was overbroad and held that the provision 'does not infringe on a substantial amount of protected speech,'\\" the 27-page ruling states. \\"The district court also held that the provision 'satisfies all four prongs of the O'Brien test and does not infringe on expression protected by the First Amendment.' We likewise hold that the amendments are not unconstitutionally overbroad and do not violate the First Amendment.\\" ||||| PA frowns upon truck drivers having sex in tollbooths, and the state of Utah is cool with bestiality (as long as no one’s trying to make a buck, that is).

Cottonwood, Arizona: Couples having sex in a vehicle with flat wheels will be fined. The fine will be doubled if the sex occurs in the backseat. 4. Newcastle, Wyoming: Couples are banned from having sex while standing inside a store's walk-in meat freezer. 5. Tremonton, Utah: No woman is allowed to have sex with a man while riding in an ambulance. In addition to normal charges, the woman's name will be published in the local newspaper. Um... discrimination, anyone? 6. Oblong, Illinois: It's punishable by law to have sex while hunting or fishing on your wedding day. 7. Bozeman, Montana: All sexual activity between members of the opposite sex in the front yard of a home after sundown is illegal — if they're nude. 8. Connorsville, Wisconsin: It's against the law for a man to shoot off a gun when his female partner has an orgasm. 9. Utah: Sex with an animal — unless performed for profit — is not considered sodomy and therefore is legal. 10.

Choices: - believe in god - migraine - complete high school - die suddenly - cross river The rationale to choose \\"die suddenly\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"\\"die suddenly\\" due to various scientific, physiological, and statistical factors that contribute to the lethality of a gunshot to the head. In this detailed explanation, we will explore the reasons why a bullet to the head is likely to result in sudden death, making it the most logical choice among the given options. 1. Anatomical factors: The head houses the brain, which is the organ responsible for controlling and coordinating all bodily functions. The brain is protected by the skull, but a gunshot can penetrate this natural barrier. When a bullet enters the skull, it damages vital regions of the brain, including those responsible for critical functions such as breathing, heart regulation, and consciousness. Depending on the bullet's path and the damage it causes, the individual may experience instantaneous or near-instantaneous death. 2. Physiological factors: A gunshot to the head can cause extensive damage to the brain, resulting in immediate physiological consequences. These may include swelling, bleeding, and the release of chemicals and toxins from damaged tissue. These physiological factors contribute to the high likelihood of sudden death as brain function deteriorates rapidly after receiving such a traumatic injury. 3. High velocity and energy transfer: Bullets are typically fired at high speeds, making them capable of transferring a significant amount of energy upon impact. This energy transfer can result in severe skull fractures, bone fragments penetrating the brain, and large-scale tissue destruction. The combination of these factors greatly increases the chance of sudden death upon being shot in the head. 4. Medically induced factors: In cases where the gunshot victim does not die immediately, the resulting complications and medical interventions can contribute to death. Brain swelling, intracranial pressure, blood loss, and infection are just a few of the possible complications that can ultimately lead to death, even after the initial injury has been stabilized. 5. Statistical factors: According to numerous studies, gunshot wounds to the head have a mortality rate of above 90%, making them more likely to be fatal than any other type of firearm injury. This high mortality rate substantiates \\"die suddenly\\" as the most accurate answer to the question. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"die suddenly\\" as the answer to the question regarding the likely outcome of being shot in the head revolves around the unique combination of anatomical, physiological, and statistical factors. These factors overwhelmingly point to a high likelihood of death, making it the most logical choice among the given options.

Given the fact \\"if one electrical conductor contacts another electrical conductor then electricity will flow through both conductors\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"If one electrical conductor touches another one what will flow through them both?\\"","completion":"The answer to that question is that electricity will flow through both conductors when one electrical conductor touches another. Let's further elaborate this. In the realm of physics, electricity represents the energy resulting from the existence of charged particles such as electrons or protons, either statically as an accumulation of charge or dynamically as a current. An electric conductor is a material that allows electric charges to pass through freely. These charges can either be negative (like electrons) or positive. Essentially, when two conductive materials make contact, a pathway for electrons to move is formed. This movement of electrons from one point to another is what we call electric current or electricity. This flow of hence comes into being due to the voltage difference between the two conductors. It's important to note that the flow will continue until the voltage levels in the two conductors equalize, assuming there isn't a power source maintaining the voltage difference. Most metals are good conductors of electricity, some popular examples include copper, aluminium, gold, and silver. The reason why these materials are great conductors is due to their atomic structure. Metals typically have one or two electrons in their outer shell and these electrons are not tightly bound to the nucleus, hence they are capable of moving freely through the material when a voltage difference is applied. Therefore, in any typical electrical appliance or equipment, current travels from the power source across the wiring (conductor) and back again. That's why most wires comprise a metal conducting material, and touching or connecting these wires without proper caution can create an unintentional flow of electric current, thereby causing a short circuit. This could potentially lead to electrical fires or damaging the appliance connected. Further, the actual amount of electricity that flows through will greatly depend on the resistance of the conductors. According to Ohm's Law (Voltage = Current x Resistance), higher resistance results in lower current for a given voltage. Hence, while the conductive property of the material is the primary factor in allowing the flow of electricity, the flow can be regulated or hindered by the resistance of the circuit. To sum up, if one electrical conductor touches another one, electricity represented by the flow of electrons, will move through both."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mia De Graaf. Ultimo founders Michelle and Michael Mone negotiated to share personal number plates, computer passwords and a collection of small properties in a bitter divorce settlement, it has emerged. But court documents reveal the pair made a deal not to sell their Glasgow mansion for less than £2.1million and it is still on the market, reports claim. The couple, who created the lingerie brand together in 1996, split in 2011 after Michael, 46, allegedly had an affair with a bra designer. Deal: Court documents reveal Michelle and Michael Mone spent their settlement dividing secret passwords and number plates but agreed to put their entire mansion - and all its possessions - on the market for £2.1m. Venture: The couple founded MJM International, which owns Ultimo, in 1996 after marrying in 1992. Michelle, 42, raged publicly at her husband for refusing to sell her their baby grand piano and part of their luxurious home. Unable to reach an agreement, they had to put the lot up for sale. The couple demolished the original building, and built 'Telperion', a five-bedroom home, six times the size of the average British house. It is located in Thorntonhall, a pretty village regarded as one of the most desirable places to live in Scotland. It is also being offered with all the furniture - estimated to have cost the couple £600,000 - which will be separately negotiated. Contentious: The pair fought over the luxurious mansion they built together in Thorntonhall, Glasgow. Business: After years of bitter divorce deals, Michelle eventually bought Michael out of their business. The property boasts a vestibule and reception room, drawing room, dining room, dining kitchen, family room, cinema and five bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms. There is a state-of-the-art kitchen designed by the acclaimed Clive Christian and featuring beautifully made Edwardian style units and four dishwashers. But according to The Scottish Sun on Sunday, they settled on dividing up other items including their fleet of four personalised cars and their own secret passwords used in the business. Now linked to cricketer Shane Warne and businessman Karl French, Michelle has been embroiled in controversy over student halls being built next to the home where she now lives with her three children. She paid £780,700 for the three-bedroom duplex and had extensive works done before moving into it last August. The property has a magnificent reception hall and stairway and is now worth more than £1 million. However, the 42-year-old businesswoman was aghast at the thought of 'anti-social' Strathclyde University students becoming her neighbours or attending events at the house.","completion":"Ultimo founders Michelle and Michael Mone have negotiated a bitter divorce settlement, dividing up personal number plates, computer passwords, and a collection of small properties.

Movie title: A Bug's Life Context: Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, lives in a colony of ants in the middle of a dried creek. They are led by Princess Atta and her mother, the Queen. The colony is oppressed by a gang of marauding grasshoppers, led by Hopper, that arrive every season demanding food from the ants. One day, when the annual offering is accidentally knocked into a stream by Flik's latest invention, a grain-harvesting device, the grasshoppers demand twice as much food as compensation. The ants trick Flik into accepting his plan to recruit \\"warrior bugs\\" to fight off the grasshoppers. While Flik actually believes in the plan, the other ants see it as an opportunity to get rid of Flik and save themselves trouble. Making his way to the \\"big city\\" (a heap of trash under a trailer), Flik mistakes a group of circus bugs that have recently been dismissed by their money-hungry ringmaster, P.T. Flea, for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent and accept his offer to travel with him back to Ant Island. After they arrive, the circus bugs and Flik both discover their mutual misunderstandings during a welcome performance by the ants. The circus bugs then attempt to leave, but are forced back by a bird that attacks the group. They save Dot, Atta's younger sister, from the bird as they flee, gaining the ants' respect in the process. At Flik's insistence, they continue the ruse of being \\"warriors\\" so the troupe can continue to enjoy the attention and hospitality of the ants. The bird encounter inspires Flik into creating a false bird to scare away the grasshoppers.

Answer with \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft. <sep>For what country was the stabbed man a part of the military?<sep>Pakistan Output:","completion":"No"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: Editor's Note: Parag Khanna is a senior research fellow at the New America Foundation, visiting senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, and author of The Second World and How to Run the World. David Skilling is founding director at Landfall Strategy Group, a Singapore-based advisory firm. By Parag Khanna and David Skilling – Special to CNN In the current phase of globalization, financial, ecological, political and social crises are occurring simultaneously and magnifying each other in unpredictable ways. From the Fukushima nuclear meltdown reshaping German politics and the European power industry, to America’s sub-prime mortgage meltdown threatening the Eurozone, such chain reactions are undermining an already fragile stability. Large countries and blocs such as the U.S., China and the EU, and new groupings like the G-20 and the BRICS, are grappling with this unprecedented combination of structural challenges and black swans. But there is little evidence of real progress. Coordinated financial regulation remains a chimera, and domestic pressures are fueling the risk of protectionist measures and immigration barriers. The failures of the WTO’s Doha Round and the Copenhagen climate change talks are further evidence of the difficulties in making collective progress on global issues. Perhaps we need to look elsewhere for the next generation of policy innovations. Specifically, it is small countries and city-states (or city-regions) that are the locus of creative thinking today. Unlike the G-20, which brings together 20 countries that represent over 80 percent of the world economy and population, small, advanced economies – those with populations of under 20 million people – represent about 2 percent of world GDP and population. Yet from Sweden and Denmark to Singapore and New Zealand, small states boast an impressive track record of sustained policy innovation in areas such as economic reform, public sector restructuring, healthcare delivery, and educational performance. Because small countries are much more exposed and vulnerable to global developments, they have an acute understanding of globalization’s turbulent dynamics. They are open to the world by necessity, not choice, and have developed mature policy responses over a longer period of time. By the same token, small states tend to be good global citizens, both because they aren’t in a position to throw their weight around and also because they tend to have a large stake in global outcomes on issues such as climate change, exchange rate volatility and open markets. By contrast, big countries aren’t too big to fail. They don’t face the same pressure to respond to emerging challenges and opportunities, and are often slower to innovate. Interestingly, modernization occurs in selected pockets in large countries. In America, for example, policy dynamism is a local phenomenon. Massachusetts leads America in healthcare standards, while Florida is experimenting with smart grids for its utilities. Meanwhile, parts of the Midwest and South have stagnated in recent years. Indeed, cities and provinces around the world are assuming a more important leadership role on global policy issues, such as the C40 grouping of cities on climate change. Even big countries seem to work better in smaller parts. The same is true for global diplomacy. For decades it has been small states that have advanced the opening of global trade. And there are many more examples. The process spearheading global principles around sovereign wealth funds was hosted by Chile, the leading example of managing natural resource endowments for future generations comes from Norway and Singapore has led the world in economic development and urban technology and planning. All of these small states can and should actively export their ideas and experience around the world – even and especially to bigger states. For these reasons, it makes sense for a “g-20” to convene as often as the G-20 does. The g-20 would comprise small and innovative states such as Denmark, Finland, Israel, New Zealand, Singapore, the Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates, and others. It would not be a universally representative or formal body – the G-20 is neither of these things either. And the “g-20” can be more open to inviting cities and companies with breakthrough ideas into its consultations as well. Global governance doesn’t suffer for lack of competitive groups and agendas, but there is an urgent need for groups focused on generating breakthrough ideas. The G20 is needed, but it is not enough. It is in this spirit that the “g-20” should convene to provide a platform for small states and actors to generate ideas that can overcome the inertia and positively impact the deliberations and actions of larger powers. The world needs big ideas now. They are more likely to come from small places. The views expressed in this article are solely those of Parag Khanna and David Skilling.

While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last.

Answer this question: what popular soft drink had its birthplace in waco texas??","completion":"Dr Pepper, a popular soft drink, was born in Waco, Texas, back in the 19th century. This well-known beverage features a distinctive, unforgettable flavor and has a long and fascinating history. The inception of Dr Pepper dates back to the 1880s, when Charles C. Alderton, a pharmacist at Morrison's Old Corner Drug Store, sought to create an inventive, refreshing drink for customers. Alderton, an Englishman, had a background in medicine and worked in the Waco area. As a pharmacist, he experimented with different combinations of syrup and carbonated water, driven by his desire to offer a novel and exciting palate experience for the patrons of the drugstore. During the course of his experiments, Alderton stumbled upon a unique blend of carbonated water and a secret mix of fruit syrups, which he believed was the perfect recipe. This new drink, initially known as the \\"Waco,\\" quickly caught the attention of passersby and began gaining popularity among the locals. Wade B. Morrison, the owner of the drugstore, also took notice of the growing interest and potential of the beverage, ultimately deciding to turn it into a marketable product. The name \\"Dr Pepper\\" was suggested by Morrison in honor of Dr. Charles T. Pepper, a physician and personal acquaintance. Although the true reason behind the name remains more of a speculation than a definitive fact, it is said that Morrison had once worked for Dr. Pepper and was grateful for the kindness and support the doctor had shown him. In 1891, Morrison teamed up with beverage chemist Robert S. Lazenby, who owned the Circle A Ginger Ale Company, to market the drink. Together, they founded the Artesian Manufacturing and Bottling Works, which later became known as the Dr Pepper Company. Dr Pepper was first introduced to a broader audience at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, a world's fair held in St. Louis, Missouri, where it attracted significant attention. Today, Dr Pepper is a well-loved soft drink enjoyed by millions of consumers worldwide. Over the years, the brand has gone through various ownerships and mergers, as well as numerous packaging and advertising innovations. The Dr Pepper Snapple Group, the company responsible for distribution and production of Dr Pepper, became a separate entity in 2008 and later merged with Keurig Green Mountain to become Keurig Dr Pepper in 2018. Despite its evolving corporate structure and progress, the Dr Pepper brand maintains its roots and continues to celebrate its birthplace in Waco, Texas."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: It Came from Beneath the Sea Movie plot: A nuclear submarine on maneuvers in the Pacific Ocean, captained by Commander Pete Mathews (Kenneth Tobey), comes into contact with a massive sonar return. The boat is disabled but manages to free itself and return to Pearl Harbor. Tissue from a huge sea creature is discovered jammed in the submarine's dive planes. A man-and-woman team of marine biologists, Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue) and John Carter (Donald Curtis), is called in; they identify the tissue as being a small part of a gigantic octopus. The military authorities scoff, but are finally persuaded after receiving reports of missing swimmers and ships at sea being pulled under by a large animal. Both scientists conclude the sea beast is from the Mindanao Deep, having been forced from its natural habitat by hydrogen bomb testing in the area, which has made the giant creature radioactive, driving off its natural food supply.[3] The scientists suggest the disappearances of a Japanese fishing fleet and a Siberian seal boat may be the work of the foraging sea beast. Both Pete and the Navy representatives express doubt and demand further proof. Later, as Pete assists John and Lesley, a report comes in of an attack on a French shipping boat; several men escaped in a raft. The French survivors are questioned by psychiatrists, and when the first sailor's description of a creature with giant tentacles is met with skepticism, the other sailors refuse to testify. Lesley is able to convince the first sailor to repeat his story for government officials, who then have the evidence they need. The U.S. government halts all sea traffic in the North Pacific without revealing the reason. John flies out to sea to trace a missing ship, while Pete and Lesley follow up on a report of three missing people on the coast of Oregon. The local sheriff, Bill Nash (Harry Lauter), takes Pete and Leslie to the site of the attack, where they find a giant suction cup imprint in the beach sand; they then request that John join them.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. In this task, you are given a review of movie. Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Q: I saw most of the episodes of RMFTM as a teenager on \\"Cliffhanger Theater\\" running after midnight on a local station some years ago, and then again when Mystery Science Theatre riffed on it in the early 90's. Time has not been kind to it. I can certainly make allowances for the special effects, which were quite impressive for a low budget 50's serial (IMO Commando Cody's flying scenes were better than George Reeves/Superman's in his TV show). And I can also make allowances for the ahem, \\"acting\\", and fight choreography -. except for the guy who plays the ruler of the Moon Men. He is incredibly miscast. He looks and acts like the fellow who comes to fix your plumbing, not the despotic ruler of an alien race. Even the corny dialog works all right - everyone rattles off their lines like strings of firecrackers, with no wasted time or pauses for things like \\"thought\\" or \\"introspection\\". Since everyone does this, the viewer finds it immersive after awhile, and even to my modern sensibilities, it doesn't bother much. What really irritates me is the writing and the plotting. I'm not talking about the sunny weather on the moon, or baking soda powered rocket ships, or a flying suit that has controls labeled \\"up/down\\" and \\"fast/slow\\". I'm not even bothered by the cheesiness of the resolutions to the cliffhangers that end each chapter. I'm talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are dumber than fence posts and have no cumulative memory. And by the fact that although that the dialog clips along like an express train, the plot goes through the same motions again and again. Dig it: Commando Cody and his pal are the spearhead of a top secret hi tech science lab charged with protecting Earth (or at least the USA) against an insidious alien invasion. But his office has no guards or security checkpoints. They don't even have locks on the front doors. So the bad guys walk RIGHT IN and beat the crap out of the Cody and his staff ...not once (perhaps understandable) but SEVERAL times. They even kidnap his female assistant on the second try. And they never get any smarter. To further prove my point, allow me to point out the way that Cody jumps in his flying suit and flies around getting into trouble and never actually seems to succeed in catching anyone. He does this over and over and over. Cody also flies his ship to the Moon (the woman assistant comes along to cook), stays for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and comes back. Cody captures one of the Atomic Ray guns...and immediately loses it again to the bad guys because he couldn't be bothered to lock it up. And so on.And you would think that if Cody's efforts were so vital to saving the USA from the Moon Men, that he might ask for a few soldiers with carbines, a few helicopters and a tank or two to back him up, instead of just working with the local police all the time. This was supposed to be a military operation, but they act like it's another episode of \\"Gangbusters\\". It's all rather hard to stomach. I appreciate that the creators were severely limited in the scope of their story by budget and time constraints...and I appreciate that Cody is actually a reasonably tough hombre (even though he loses half of his fistfights). But I just can't help yelling \\"DOOR! LOCK THE DOOOOR!!\\" when the gangsters simply walk into his lab, or try to blow up the ship and there are NO security measures at the landing site in place...not even a fence (!). Still, it's OK. Of the three Republic serials I've watched, \\"Phantom Creeps\\" had a better plot, and \\"Undersea Kingdom\\" had more atmosphere (hah!) and a better hero than \\"Radar Men\\", but it's an OK time-waster. BTW...why \\"Radar\\" men? They didn't use radar, they used Atomic Ray Guns.

Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. The \\"escape\\" character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of \\"escape\\" encountered in URL encodings, C language strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning.

Product review: It is a travesty that this spectacular event has not been released in full high-definition. I am baffled by this. The answer is:","completion":"The given review would most likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. However, it is important to consider the context of the situation and the product being reviewed. I will explain the reasons below: 1. Limited format availability: The review title \\"Why No Blu-Ray?\\" suggests that the product may only be available in a lesser-quality format, such as DVD or digital. This may be an important factor for potential buyers who are looking for a high-quality viewing experience that is provided by Blu-Ray discs. Missing out on such an experience might disappoint customers, especially those who value visual and audio quality. 2. Baffled reviewer: The reviewer expresses their confusion and disappointment at the lack of a Blu-ray release, using words like \\"travesty\\" and \\"baffled.\\" This strong language implies that the reviewer might be a highly engaged consumer or an expert in the field, which can lend significant weight to their opinion and influence other potential buyers negatively. 3. Positive evaluation of the event: Despite the reviewer's disappointment regarding the format, they do describe the event as \\"spectacular,\\" indicating that the content itself may be of high quality. However, this aspect of the review would only serve to increase the chances of purchasing the product if potential buyers are willing to overlook the lack of a high-definition format. 4. Importance of reviews: Reviews play a critical role in shaping a potential buyer's decision-making process. A negative review, such as the one provided, can create doubts in the minds of prospective buyers. It can be particularly influential if there are not many other reviews to counterbalance the negative perspective. In conclusion, while the reviewer does praise the event as spectacular, their overall dissatisfaction with the lack of a Blu-Ray option is a significant drawback that may discourage potential buyers. Thus, the chances of purchasing the product in question would most likely decrease based on this review, unless the prospective buyer places little importance on having a high-definition format or the negative review is counterbalanced by a significant number of positive reviews."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.\\"?

Why not create a fake lip ring to achieve that edgy style without any permanent effects? Making a fake lip ring is simple, affordable, and a fun DIY project. In this article, we’ll guide you through the step-by-step process of creating your very own custom lip ring. Step 1: Gather the Materials To start, you'll need the following materials: - Wire, preferably made of a safe, non-toxic, and hypoallergenic material like stainless steel or niobium. - A kitchen pan. - Wire-cutting pliers. - A file, sandpaper, or an emery board. - Optional: beads, charms, or other decorations for customization. Step 2: Boil the Wire Boiling the wire in a kitchen pan serves to clean and sterilize the material, making it safe to wear. Fill the pan with water, and bring it to a boil. Submerge the wire in boiling water for a few minutes. Once complete, carefully remove the wire with a pair of tongs and let it cool down. Step 3: Cut Your Desired Length Using wire-cutting pliers, snip off a short length of wire (approximately 1 to 1.5 inches) for your lip ring. The length may vary depending on the size and final look you intend to create. Step 4: Smooth the Edges To prevent any injuries while wearing your lip ring, it's vital to smooth out any sharp edges. Use a file, sandpaper, or an emery board to gently rub away the rough edges until they are smooth and safe to touch. Step 5: Shape the Wire Bend the snippet of wire into a circle using your fingers or small round-nose pliers. Make sure the circle is big enough to fit around your lip comfortably without being too tight. Step 6: Adjust the Overall Shape Take a moment to refine and adjust the overall shape of your lip ring. You may want to create a round or oval shape that follows the contours of your lip. Step 7: Create the \\"Gap\\" and the \\"Flat\\" The gap is where the lip ring will sit, and the flat is the part that rests against the inside of your lip. Gently bend the wire near the smoothed ends to create a small gap for the lip ring to slide on and off. Next, create the flat section by slightly bending the wire where it touches the inside of the lip. Step 8: Try On Your Fake Lip Ring Slide the fake lip ring onto your lip to ensure a comfortable and secure fit. If necessary, make any adjustments to the size or shape until you're satisfied with the fit. Step 9: Customize Your Lip Ring Get creative and customize your new lip ring with beads, charms, or other embellishments. Ensure that any decorations you add are also safe and hypoallergenic. Conclusion And there you have it--your very own DIY fake lip ring! With these simple steps, you can create a stylish and personalized lip accessory that brings an edgy look without the pain or permanence of a real piercing.

This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules. If they left their space ship and did not use their electronics, they would not be able to hear each other. Next time you watch a science fiction movie, think about this factoid.

Q: In this task, you are given a context, a subject, a relation, and many options. Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Context: A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus., Quail is a collective name for several genera of mid-sized birds generally placed in the order Galliformes. Old World quail are placed in the family Phasianidae, and New World quail are placed in the family Odontophoridae. The species of buttonquail are named for their superficial resemblance to quail, and form the family Turnicidae in the order Charadriiformes. The king quail, an Old World quail, often is sold in the pet trade, and within this trade is commonly, though mistakenly, referred to as a \\"button quail\\". Many of the common larger species are farm-raised for table food or egg consumption, and are hunted on game farms or in the wild, where they may be released to supplement the wild population, or extend into areas outside their natural range. In 2007, 40 million quail were produced in the U.S. , Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds., In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs., Charadriiformes is a diverse order of small to medium-large birds. It includes about 350 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most Charadriiformes live near water and eat invertebrates or other small animals; however, some are pelagic (seabirds), some occupy deserts and a few are found in thick forest., The Galliformes are an order of heavy-bodied ground-feeding birds that includes turkey, grouse, chicken, New World quail and Old World quail, ptarmigan, partridge, pheasant, junglefowl and the Cracidae. The name derives from \\"gallus\\", Latin for \\"cock\\" or \\"rooster\\". Common names are gamefowl or gamebirds, landfowl, gallinaceous birds, or galliforms. \\"Wildfowl\\" or just \\"fowl\\" are also often used for the Galliformes, but usually these terms also refer to waterfowl (Anseriformes), and occasionally to other commonly hunted birds. This group has about 290 species, one or more of which are found in essentially every part of the world's continents (except for the innermost deserts and perpetual ice). They are rarer on islands, and in contrast to the closely related waterfowl, are essentially absent from oceanic islandsunless introduced there by humans. Several species have been domesticated during their long and extensive relationships with humans., Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction., The king quail (\\"Excalfactoria chinensis\\"), also known as the blue-breasted quail, Asian blue quail, button quail, Chinese painted quail, or Chung-Chi, is a species of Old World quail in the family Phasianidae. This species is the smallest \\"true quail\\" and is quite common in aviculture worldwide. In the wild they range from southeastern Asia to Oceania with 10 different subspecies., Coturnix is a genus of eight extant species and two known extinct species of Old World quail . They are related to the francolins , jungle bush quail , snowcocks and rock partridges . Species of Coturnix and the aforementioned genera belong to their own monophyletic clade , Coturnicinae , a subfamily within the family Phasianidae . Some authors consider this clade , together with a sibling assemblage , the Gallininae ( including the junglefowl , long - billed partridge and Chinese bamboo partridge ) warrants classification in its own family , Coturnigallusinidae . Quail of Coturnix live in pairs or small social groups and form larger groups during migration . Not all species migrate , but most are capable of extremely rapid , upward flight to escape from danger . Unlike related genera , Old World quail do not perch in trees . They devote much of their time to scratching and foraging for seeds and invertebrates on the ground . Typical habitats are dense vegetation such as grasslands , bushes alongside rivers and cereal fields . They are predated upon heavily by the diurnal hawks ., In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies., Buttonquail or hemipodes are members of a small family of birds, Turnicidae, which resemble, but are unrelated to, the quails of Phasianidae. They inhabit warm grasslands in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Australia. There are 16 species in two genera, with most species being found in the genus \\"Turnix\\" and only one being found in the genus \\"Ortyxelos\\"., The New World quails or Odontophoridae are small birds only distantly related to the Old World quail, but named for their similar appearance and habits. The American species are in their own family Odontophoridae, whereas Old World quail are in the pheasant family Phasianidae. The family ranges from Canada through to southern Brazil, and two species, the California quail and the bobwhite quail, have been successfully introduced to New Zealand. The stone partridge and Nahan's partridge, both found in Africa, seem to belong to the family. Species are found across a variety of habitats from tropical rainforest to deserts, although few species are capable of surviving at very low temperatures. Thirty-four species are placed in ten genera. , The Phasianidae are a family of heavy, groundliving birds which includes pheasants, partridges, junglefowl, chickens, Old World quail, and peafowl. The family includes many of the most popular gamebirds. The family is a large one, and is occasionally broken up into two subfamilies, the Phasianinae, and the Perdicinae. Sometimes, additional families and birds are treated as part of this family. For example, the American Ornithologists' Union includes Tetraonidae (grouse), Numididae (guineafowl), and Meleagrididae (turkeys) as subfamilies in Phasianidae., Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus., Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses.

More than 133 billion litres (35 billion gallons) are sold per year—producing total global revenues of 294.5 billion (£147.7 billion) in 2006.

The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court.

The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller.

Answer the following question: When I first started out in the field, I was working at a private hospital in the locked psychiatric unit, and there was a call from one of the med floors requiring someone from our unit to assist with a problem of a young man who had bitten through his cotton restraints on his wrists. They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless. I recall being plagued by this young man’s face for some time when I tried to go to sleep at night.

Choices: - pollen - microbes - bacteria - pathogen A: The answer is:","completion":"- pathogen An infection may be intracellular or extracellular, depending on the type of pathogen involved. Pathogens are disease-causing microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites. Intracellular pathogens live inside host cells, while extracellular pathogens live outside host cells. Intracellular pathogens, like viruses and some bacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis), have evolved to live and multiply within host cells. This allows them to evade the host's immune system and access nutrients inside the cells. They typically enter the host cells by either being engulfed by the host cell membrane or by injecting their genetic material inside the host cell. Extracellular pathogens, on the other hand, survive and reproduce outside host cells. These may include bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (which causes pneumonia) and fungi like Candida albicans (which can lead to yeast infections). Extracellular pathogens can colonize surfaces of host tissues, or they may secrete toxins or enzymes that damage host cells and tissues to obtain nutrients. The type of infection, whether intracellular or extracellular, often determines the most effective treatment approach, which may include antibiotics, antivirals, antifungal agents, or other therapeutic interventions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Secondly, while the app is generally reliable, I have noticed occasional system crashes and delays in receiving messages.

Answer:","completion":"In order to answer this question, let me first provide a brief background on both of the television series: Auction Kings and Pawn Stars. Auction Kings is a reality television series produced by Authentic Entertainment for the Discovery Channel. The show's premise revolves around the daily activities of a prominent auction house called Gallery 63, which is based in Atlanta, Georgia. Paul Brown, the owner, and his crew are involved in finding, buying, and auctioning various unique and valuable items. The series first aired on October 26, 2010, and ran for four seasons until late 2013. Pawn Stars, on the other hand, is an American reality television series produced by Leftfield Pictures for the History channel. The show primarily documents the daily activities of the Harrison family-run pawn shop called the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, located in Las Vegas, Nevada. The cast – Rick Harrison, Corey \\"Big Hoss\\" Harrison, Richard \\"Old Man\\" Harrison, and Austin \\"Chumlee\\" Russell – help showcase real-life encounters with customers and provide historical information about the items brought to the store for pawning or selling. Pawn Stars first premiered on July 19, 2009, and continues to be a popular series on the History channel. Now, comparing the premiere dates of both shows, it is clear that Pawn Stars aired first on July 19, 2009, while Auction Kings began airing on October 26, 2010. Therefore, Pawn Stars is the series that aired first between the two. The success and longevity of Pawn Stars have made it a staple in modern reality television and have inspired similar shows, such as Auction Kings, which followed in its footsteps."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The author mentions that they \\"don't live with a parent,\\" providing context for the reader that the author is possibly an adult or someone who does not have immediate family nearby. 3. The following part, \\"for the sake of my (currently non-existent) sex life,\\" expresses a personal issue or desire that the author is discussing with friends. The tone is humorous and light-hearted, as the author uses self-deprecating humor to discuss their personal life. 4.

Based on this analysis, I would classify the sentiment of this tweet as predominantly lighthearted and humorous with a hint of desperation. The tone is informal and casual, as the author is speaking with close friends about their personal life. It is important to note that the author's use of humor and self-deprecation results in this tweet not being overly negative or depressive. Instead, it creates a sense of camaraderie among friends, opening up a conversation for solutions while maintaining a light and easy-going atmosphere.

Problem:Passage: Efforts to control population growth led to the one-child policy in China, which used to include more severe consequences, but now imposes fines on urban couples who have more than one child. Due to the fact that some couples wish to have a male heir, many Chinese couples continue to have more than one child. The policy itself, its social impacts, and the effectiveness of limiting overall population growth are controversial. In spite of population control policies, the human population continues to grow. At some point the food supply may run out because of the subsequent need to produce more and more food to feed our population. The United Nations estimates that future world population growth may vary from 6 billion (a decrease) to 16 billion people by the year 2100. There is no way to know whether human population growth will moderate to the point where the crisis described by Dr. Ehrlich will be averted. Another result of population growth is the endangerment of the natural environment. Many countries have attempted to reduce the human impact on climate change by reducing their emission of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. However, these treaties have not been ratified by every country, and many underdeveloped countries trying to improve their economic condition may be less likely to agree with such provisions if it means slower economic development. Furthermore, the role of human activity in causing climate change has become a hotly debated socio-political issue in some developed countries, including the United States.

The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words.

Neil had chosen a highly rated spa for his treatment, while William, who was always trying to save a few bucks, went for a cheaper and less regarded establishment. As the two friends left their respective massage parlors, they couldn't wait to discuss their experiences. Step 1: Establish the conversation between Neil and William and their experiences. Neil proudly boasted about his relaxing and rejuvenating massage, going into detail about the calming atmosphere, the skilled hands of his masseuse, and the quality of the essential oils used during the session. William, on the other hand, couldn't help but express his disappointment with his own experience. He described the noisy ambiance, the untrained masseuse who applied too much pressure at certain points, and the substandard oils that left his skin feeling greasy. Step 2: Explore the consequences of their choices. As the two friends continued to share their experiences, they started to see how their choices had greatly influenced the outcome of their massages. Neil appreciated the fact that his decision to invest in a highly rated spa came with a higher price tag but ultimately delivered a more enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Meanwhile, William started to regret his decision to cut corners and save money, realizing that he had wasted his time and money on an unsatisfactory service that didn't truly benefit him. Step 3: Add a twist that leads to new realizations for both friends. Despite their starkly different experiences, both Neil and William were able to learn some valuable life lessons from their respective choices. Neil realized that sometimes paying a little more for a quality service can translate to a significantly more satisfying experience, and the value derived can far outweigh the additional expense. William, on the other hand, learned a hard lesson about trying to cut corners and the importance of doing thorough research before making a decision. Additionally, as the two friends passed by a third massage parlor that neighbored William's, they noticed that it too had very high ratings and a reasonable price point. Both Neil and William came to understand that there could be a middle ground between quality and cost, and it was up to them to strike that balance in their life choices moving forward. Step 4: Conclude the story with their new understanding and how it will impact future decisions. With their newfound wisdom, Neil and William, now better equipped, decided to make more informed choices when choosing self-care services in the future. They vowed to share their experiences with each other and help each other find the perfect balance of quality and affordability. For it was in this journey of friendship, discovery, and well-being that they realized the value of learning from one another's experiences and growing together. And who knows, maybe in the future, they would find a spa where they could both enjoy a relaxing, professional massage at a reasonable price."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I joined a club recently where I met a true Indian. I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared? The next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us. Will a true Indian point fingers at an Indian?

St. John's experiences milder temperatures during the winter season in comparison to other Canadian cities, and has the mildest winter for any Canadian city outside of British Columbia. Precipitation is frequent and often heavy, falling year round. On average, summer is the driest season, with only occasional thunderstorm activity, and the wettest months are from October to January, with December the wettest single month, with nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation on average. This winter precipitation maximum is quite unusual for humid continental climates, which most commonly have a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum (for example, most of the Midwestern U.S.). Most heavy precipitation events in St. John's are the product of intense mid-latitude storms migrating from the Northeastern U.S. and New England states, and these are most common and intense from October to March, bringing heavy precipitation (commonly 4 to 8 centimetres of rainfall equivalent in a single storm), and strong winds. In winter, two or more types of precipitation (rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow) can fall from passage of a single storm. Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 335 centimetres per winter season. However, winter storms can bring changing precipitation types. Heavy snow can transition to heavy rain, melting the snow cover, and possibly back to snow or ice (perhaps briefly) all in the same storm, resulting in little or no net snow accumulation. Snow cover in St. John's is variable, and especially early in the winter season, may be slow to develop, but can extend deeply into the spring months (March, April).

The paragraph specifically states that the Shahid Dastgerdi Stadium is also known as PAS Tehran Stadium, and provides the Persian name \\"ورزشگاه شهيد دستگردی,\\" which directly translates to \\"Shahid Dastgerdi Stadium.\\" Therefore, it is accurate to say that \\"ورزشگاه شهيد دستگردی\\" is also known as Shahid Dastgerdi Stadium. The paragraph also provides further information about the stadium, mentioning that it is located in the Ekbatan area of Tehran, Iran, and that it was named after a casualty of the Iran–Iraq War. This adds more context to the stadium's name and its significance. Also, the mention of PAS Tehran F.C. as the former home team of the stadium and the current hosting of the Iran national under-20 football team adds to the overall understanding of the uses and importance of the Shahid Dastgerdi Stadium. As the paragraph is quite specific about the naming and history of the stadium, it is clear and unambiguous that \\"ورزشگاه شهيد دستگردی\\" is indeed also known as Shahid Dastgerdi Stadium."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tocqueville believed that war and colonization would \\"restore national pride, threatened\\", he believed, by \\"The gradual softening of social mores\\" in the middle classes. Their taste for \\"material pleasures\\" was spreading to the whole of society, giving it \\"an example of weakness and egotism\\". Applauding the methods of General Bugeaud, Tocqueville went so far to claim that \\"war in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread, perfected and made everyone aware of this new science.\\" Tocqueville advocated racial segregation in Algeria with two distinct legislations, one for European colonists and one for the Arab population.

It would increase or decrease? Answer:","completion":"If Jim were to increase the weight of the vehicle, the fuel efficiency of the vehicle would generally decrease. This is because a heavier vehicle requires more energy (and therefore more fuel) to overcome inertia, accelerate, and maintain speed. Greater weight means a higher amount of mechanical effort is required to move the car, making the engine work harder and thereby consume more fuel. Moreover, a heavier vehicle generates more rolling resistance in the tires and larger air resistance, both of which contribute to increased fuel consumption. Therefore, when designing a new car, it is essential to find a balance between necessary structural integrity, safety, and using lightweight materials to reduce the overall weight for better fuel efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although the industrial complex lies within the historic 16-sided polygon, it is no longer part of the wild area. After Curtiss-Wright's lease ended and it donated six of the eight buildings in the complex to the state in 1963, Pennsylvania formed the Commonwealth Industrial Research Corporation to administer and lease the Quehanna facilities, which it did until 1967. Over the years a series of tenants have occupied parts of the industrial complex. One company manufactured logging trailers there from 1967 to 1971, and another processed frozen meat from 1968 to 1970. In 1968 Piper Aircraft established a plant to make metal and plastic parts for airplanes. The complex was renamed from Quehanna to Piper, a name it retains. Piper employed up to 1,000 people, but moved its operations from Pennsylvania to Florida in 1984.The Young Adult Conservation Corps was also based at Piper from 1977 to 1982. This federally funded program employed up to 45 young people for local conservation projects in the state parks and forests and on state game lands. In addition, Sylvania Electric Products used two buildings in the industrial complex as warehouses for light bulbs until 1993.

Hana, a rare Sumatran tiger, had given birth to three cubs on Nov. 17, and though one hadn't made it long past the birth, the other two seemed to be thriving and bonding with their mother, the Times of Israel reports. That's why zookeepers were horrified to find the 5-week-old cubs were missing on Friday; they determined that Hana had killed and eaten them. \\"We discovered they had been killed when we went to weigh them,\\" Nili Avni-Magen, the zoo's chief vet, tells AFP. Although the Times notes that both wild tigers and those in captivity will eat their young if they're stressed, hungry, or looking to mate, the tragedy was unexpected. \\"This was a complete surprise,\\" Avni-Magen tells Haaretz. \\"We truly thought we were beyond this and that she was on the right path.\\" And a tragedy it is, since there are believed to be fewer than 400 of the critically endangered tigers left in the wild in Sumatra, the World Wildlife Fund notes. Various conservation programs have enjoyed success at upping the tigers' population: Around 261 of these tigers now exist in zoos thanks to captive-breeding programs, up from 180 in 2008, AFP reports; 32 were born just this year in captivity. The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, which showcases animals featured in the Hebrew Bible, has an especially impressive mating record in terms of endangered species, per AFP. Although Avni-Magen says the news \\"is disappointing and very, very sad,\\" the zoo \\"will learn the lessons. It could be that this is connected to the behavior of the male.\\" (Read how a med student saved this tiger cub's life.) Article:","completion":"Once upon a time, in a zoo far away in a place named Jerusalem, a mommy tiger named Hana had three cute baby tigers. This was big news because Hana is a special Sumatran tiger. There are not many like her left in the world, only about 400, like counting all your fingers and toes twenty times! But then, something very sad happened. After only five weeks, two of the baby tigers were not there anymore. The zookeepers looked everywhere but couldn't find them. Then they found out that Hana, their mommy, had eaten them. You might ask - why would a mommy eat her own babies? Well sometimes, wild animals like tigers do this if they're too stressed, hungry, or want to have more babies. Think of it like when you're very scared or anxious, or very very hungry, you might do things that you normally wouldn't, right? It's similar for tigers too. The zookeepers were really surprised because they thought Hana was happy and safe, and that she wouldn't do anything to harm her babies. They were very, very sad about it. And it was a big loss because we have to protect the Sumatran tigers - they are very important and special animals. But don't worry, even though this is very sad news, there is also good news. More and more baby Sumatran tigers are being born in zoos to keep them safe from danger in the wild and increase their population. In 2008, there were 180 tigers like Hana in zoos, but now, there are 261! That's an increase of 81 tigers - can you imagine a group of 81 tigers? Almost enough to fill up your whole kindergarten, right?! And the zookeepers in Jerusalem are very good at helping tigers like Hana have babies. Even though they are very sad about what happened, they are ready to learn from this and help Hana feel safe and happy again. They believe it could have something to do with the daddy tiger's behavior. So, even though something very sad happened to Hana and her babies, remember that the story is not over. The zookeepers are doing everything they can to help Hana, and they will keep working hard to protect all the Sumatran tigers around the world.

Available choices: (a). yes (b). it is not possible to tell (c). no","completion":"(a). Yes This is because the phrase \\"A boy surfs on a wave\\" provides enough information to imply that \\"A person is in the water.\\" The reasoning behind this conclusion is as follows: First, by definition, a boy is a young male human, which makes him a person. This satisfies the \\"person\\" aspect indicated in the second phrase. Next, the action in the first phrase is \\"surfs on a wave.\\" Surfing by nature is a water-based activity. It requires one to be on a surfboard riding moving waves typically in the ocean, which obligatorily puts the person doing this action, in this case the boy, in the water. This means he is either directly contacting the water or at the very least is immediately above the water's surface at the time of surfing. Therefore, the interaction that a surfer has with the wave and subsequently the inherent water environment during the process of surfing can lead us to logically conceive that \\"A person is in the water,\\" such that we could clarify it as \\"A person is in or on the water.\\" Hence, given the information provided in the initial phrase \\"A boy surfs on a wave\\", it logically follows that \\"A person is in the water.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu. Answer:","completion":"The full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I can be deduced through the information provided in the context. The information given states that Mary of Burgundy was the granddaughter of Philip the Good and was married to Maximilian I. Therefore, we can infer that the grandfather in question is Philip the Good. Philip the Good, also known as Philip III, was the Duke of Burgundy from 1419 to his death in 1467. His full name was Philip III of Burgundy, or in French, Philippe III le Bon, and he was a member of the Valois-Burgundy dynasty. He was an influential patron of the arts and played a significant role in the development and growth of the Netherlandish illumination industry, which dominated Europe for several generations. His extensive collection of illuminated books served as the foundation for the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library, and his patronage and support continued through his descendants, including Mary of Burgundy and Maximilian I."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said.

Geological history of Earth During the Permian all the Earth's major land masses, except portions of East Asia, were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea. Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (Panthalassa, the universal sea), and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era.

These differences are the primary reasons why I am not giving a rating of 5, which would imply that the two sentences mean the same thing. Nevertheless, the fact that both sentences mention violent attacks in Iraq with some casualties and injured individuals suggests a strong overlap in meaning. Although the specific numbers are different, the core message of both sentences is that there have been violent incidents in Iraq, causing deaths and injuries among the people. Therefore, a rating of 4 indicates that the two sentences have a high level of textual similarity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: We live in a \\"now\\" culture. If it takes more than five seconds for a website to load, we won't view it. We want to call our friends now, even if we'll see them in 10 minutes. The \\"now\\" culture is one of convenience, and let's face it, convenience can make our lives easier. Unfortunately, by gaining convenience, we've lost some of our patience. If you're like me, patience does not come naturally. Here are a few tips I've learned along the way to cultivate more patience in my life: Ask yourself why you're in a hurry. If you feel rushed while going about your normal day, ask yourself why. Will the world end if you get home five minutes late? What if you stop to talk to the random people you meet each day? If you do stop to talk, you'll be amazed how much more connected you'll feel to your community. Hang around people who have patience. I had a lot less patience before I met my husband. Being around him daily has certainly given me a greater appreciation for the art of waiting. He's not only a great example of someone who lives his life patiently, but he tells me if I'm getting too anxious or impatient. If you don't know someone who's patient in your immediate circle of friends, take a class like yoga where meditation is part of the art. _ . Sometimes you can lose sight of long-term goals in the rush towards instant gratification. Most people trying to lose weight have a hard time cutting out sugary or carb-loaded foods completely. It helps to cut these lofty long-term goals into smaller chunks. To encourage weight loss, you can slowly cut back on your calorie intake or increase your exercise regimen each week. Whatever route you take, setting those little goals will help you achieve the big ones faster. Think of the things you've gained by being patient.

At Gotham Bikes in Tribeca, a manager who gave his name as \\"Ben W.\\" said the shop has seen an increase in its overall sales due to the bike-share program. \\"It's getting more people on the road, more people learning about the sport and getting involved,\\" he said. An employee at Danny's Cycles in Gramercy said Citi Bike is a good option for people in a city famed for its traffic jams and aggressive drivers. \\"They can try out a bike without buying one:' James Ryan said. Rentals are not a big part of the business at either Gotham Bikes or Danny's Cycles. But for Frank's Bike Shop, a small business on Grand St., the bike-share program has been bad news. Owner Frank Arroyo said that his rental business has decreased by 90% since Citi Bike was launched last month. Arroyo's main rental customers are European tourists, who have since been drawn away by Citi Bikes. However, Ben said the bike-share is good for bike sales at his shop. \\"People have used the bike-share and realized how great it is to bike in the city, then decide that they want something nicer for themselves,\\" he noted. Christian Farrell of Waterfront Bicycle Shop, on West St. said at first he was concerned about bike-share, though, he admitted, \\"I was happy to see people on bikes.\\" Farrell's early concerns were repeated by Andrew Crooks, owner of NYC Velo, at 64 Second Ave. \\"It seemed like a great idea, but one that would be difficult to put into use:' Crooks said of Citi Bike.

With the introduction of Heidi Range, former member of fellow English girl group Atomic Kitten, the group began to experience a higher level of commercial success whilst keeping the critical acclaim they had achieved with their debut album. They released three studio albums before Buena announced her departure in December 2005, leading to Amelle Berrabah being brought in to replace her. Following the release of their first greatest hits album, the new line-up released two studio albums. In September 2009, after 11 years in the Sugababes, Buchanan, the final original member, was replaced by former UK Eurovision entry Jade Ewen. Range, Berrabah and Ewen released the group's seventh studio album, \\"Sweet 7\\", in 2010, after which they signed to RCA Records, before announcing an indefinite hiatus in 2011. In 2013, Ewen confessed that the Sugababes had split two years earlier. The original line-up of the band reformed in 2011, under the new name Mutya Keisha Siobhan. - The 23rd Annual Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards (generally known as ARIA Music Awards or simply The ARIAs) took place on 26 November 2009 at the Acer Arena at the Sydney Olympic Park complex.

What is the relationship between 'long hot summer ' and 'polydor records'? Answer:","completion":"\\"Long Hot Summer\\" is a song by British all-female pop group Girls Aloud, taken from their third studio album \\"Chemistry\\" (2005). The song was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, and his production team Xenomania, and produced by Higgins and Xenomania. Girls Aloud was signed to Polydor Records, a sub-division of Universal Music Group, which released their music, including the single \\"Long Hot Summer.\\" Polydor Records has also been associated with other popular acts such as The Saturdays and was responsible for promoting and distributing the group's music. So, the relationship between \\"Long Hot Summer\\" and \\"Polydor Records\\" is that Polydor Records was the record label responsible for the release, distribution, and promotion of Girls Aloud's \\"Long Hot Summer\\" as part of their discography."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali (; Dutch: [a:'ja:n 'hi:rsi 'a:li] ( listen); born Ayaan Hirsi Magan, 13 November 1969) is a Somali-born Dutch-American activist, feminist, author, scholar and former politician. In early 2014 Brandeis University in Massachusetts announced that Ali would be given an honorary degree at the graduation commencement ceremony. In early April, the university rescinded its offer following a review of her statements that was carried out in response to protests by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and lobbying by Joseph E. B. Lumbard, Head of the Islamic Studies Department, other faculty members and several student groups that accused Hirsi Ali of \\"hate speech\\". University president Frederick M. Lawrence said that \\"certain of her past statements\\" were inconsistent with the university's \\"core values\\" because they were \\"Islamophobic.\\" Others expressed opinions both for and against this decision. The university said she was welcome to come to the campus for a dialogue in the future. The university's withdrawal of its invitation generated controversy and condemnation among some. But, The Economist noted at the time that Hirsi Ali's \\"Wholesale condemnations of existing religions just aren't done in American politics.\\" It said that \\"The explicit consensus in America is ecumenical and strongly pro-religious...\\" The university was distinguishing between an open intellectual exchange, which could occur if Hirsi Ali came to campus for a dialogue, and appearing to celebrate her with an honorary degree. A Brandeis spokesperson said that Ali had not been invited to speak at commencement but simply to be among honorary awardees. She claimed to have been invited to speak and expressed shock at Brandeis' action. Hirsi Ali said CAIR's letter misrepresented her and her work, but that it has long been available on the Internet. She said that the \\"spirit of free expression\\" has been betrayed and stifled. David Bernstein, a law professor at George Mason University, criticised the Brandeis decision as an attack on academic values of freedom of inquiry and intellectual independence. Among the commenters, Jeffrey Herf, a Brandeis alumnus and historian, published an open letter criticizing Lawrence's decision, saying it had \\"done deep and long-lasting damage to a university.\\" Lawrence J. Haas, the former communications director and press secretary for Vice President Al Gore, published an open letter saying that Lawrence \\"succumbed to political correctness and interest group pressure in deciding that Islam is beyond the pale of legitimate inquiry... that such a decision is particularly appalling for a university president, for a campus is precisely the place to encourage free discussion even on controversial matters.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Why did they rescind?","completion":"Brandeis University rescinded its offer to give Ayaan Hirsi Ali an honorary degree because, according to University President Frederick M.

One sad day, Gia was feeling very very sad and didn't know how to make her heart feel better. She decided to do something called \\"suicide,\\" which means taking her own life. This made everyone who loved her very sad, especially her boyfriend, Ryan. After some time, Ryan wanted to talk about Gia and about suicide so that people could learn from her story. It was important for him to share what happened so that others could understand what suicide is and how to not let it happen. He wanted to help others not feel so sad and lost. Ryan talked about how he didn't understand why Gia was so sad and lost, and how he would do anything to help her if he could turn back time. He wanted everyone to know that it's important to be there for the people you love. If you see someone who is feeling sad, don't be afraid to talk to them and help them feel better.

If you see raised ant beds, especially if they were lower before, then there may be a storm coming. When the air pressure falls before a storm, birds feel discomfort in their ears. This causes them to fly lower toward the ground or to perch on lower tree branches or power lines. You may also observe the birds eating ground insects. This behavior suggests that a storm is coming. If the birds are flying high in the sky, then there will likely be fair weather. If you’re near the sea, look for seagulls perched on the beach, which could indicate that a storm is coming. Watch for large groups of roosting birds. Birds also become quiet before a storm. Singing and chirping birds could indicate good weather. Birds can sense air pressure and will time their migrations to good weather. If you see flocks of birds migrating in the sky, then the weather will likely be good that day. If a storm is going to be short, birds will usually wait for the rain to end before looking for food. If you see birds eating during a storm, then it will likely last for a long time. Birds can sense the pressure patterns, allowing them to predict the weather. Bees and butterflies return to their homes before a storm for safety. In the case of bees, they also work to preserve the hive. If you don’t see any bees and butterflies when you would expect to - such as in a field of flowers - then there may be a storm coming. Cows usually gather together and lie down in their pasture before a rainstorm. This is likely because it cools down before a storm, and cows like to be close to the ground when the weather cools. Cows lying on the ground is an indication that it may rain. This only applies to cows, not other livestock. Snakes will leave their nests before bad weather, even if it’s in the middle of wintertime. Seeing snakes in unexpected places or at a time when the snake would normally be in its nest can be a sign of bad weather. Snakes can even predict earthquakes. If you see a snake out of its nest behaving erratically, there could be an earthquake coming. Snakes usually come out of their nests in sunny weather to warm themselves. They don't like the cold because they are cold-blooded. A snake out of its nest when it's not a warm, sunny day is an indication that bad weather is coming. Tortoises will seek higher ground before a storm, so look for movement to higher locations. You may see them in the road one to two days before a rain. Summary:","completion":"Animals like ants, birds, bees, butterflies, cows, snakes, and tortoises can sometimes predict and react to upcoming storms or bad weather, so if you see them acting differently, it might mean a storm is coming."},{"prompt":"Given the below context: Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish.

With the center of gravity in the fiscal cliff negotiations shifting to the Senate and to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, lawmakers and President Obama will try to break the stalemate today at 3 p.m. ET when President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden sit down with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. There are now just four days to go before the country falls off the cliff, and as ABC’s Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl noted on “Good Morning America” today, this is actually the very first meeting all sides have had together in six weeks. The last time this group met was Nov. 16. http://abcn.ws/VGsGrV That may be hard to believe, but it’s not really that surprising when you listen to the rhetoric coming from both Senate leaders. “Republicans aren’t about to write a blank check for anything Senate Democrats put forward just because we find ourselves as the edge of the cliff,” McConnell said on the Senate floor yesterday. Meanwhile, Reid likened Speaker Boehner’s leadership in the House to a “dictatorship” that was preventing “the vast majority of the House of Representatives to get what they want.” Most Capitol Hill insiders agree that the we probably go off the fiscal cliff — at least for a little while — with a real deal to come in January after the new Congress is sworn in, but there may be another option on the table. The two sides could come together to support what Karl described as a “small deal that would at least prevent these tax increases from going into effect for most people.” Chances of that happening? Jon Karl puts them at three to five percent. Not exactly a glass-half-full scenario. ABC’S AMY WALTER: Perhaps it’s because I’m a parent to a six-year-old, but the only way to make sense of the fiscal cliff shenanigans is to put it in child rearing terms. If there is no consequence for bad behavior, then the bad behavior will continue. Think how many times you have heard (or said) “if you don’t stop this right now then X will happen.” When X doesn’t happen (the car doesn’t pull over, dessert is still served etc), the child learns that he or she can indeed get away with breaking the rules. In Washington, the only real consequence is losing an election. And, since both sides believe they won in 2012 (Democrats held the White House and Senate despite high unemployment; Republicans held the House despite sky-high disapproval ratings), neither side sees a real downside to letting the country fall off the fiscal cliff. A frustrated public, a declining Dow — these are not the consequences that will spur either side to action. It’s only when defeat, real lasting defeat is felt, that compromise will happen. with ABC’s Elizabeth Hartfield (@LizHartfield) NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF, GULF WAR COMMANDER, DIES AT 78. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the retired general credited with leading U.S.-allied forces to a victory in the first Gulf War, died Thursday. He was 78 years old. ABC’s Michael James reports, Schwarzkopf, called “Stormin’ Norman” because of his reportedly explosive temper, actually led Republican administrations to two military victories: a small one in Grenada in the 1980s and a big one as de facto commander of allied forces in the Gulf War in 1991. “‘Stormin’ Norman’ led the coalition forces to victory, ejecting the Iraqi Army from Kuwait and restoring the rightful government,” read a statement by former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Gulf War. “His leadership not only inspired his troops, but also inspired the nation.” http://abcn.ws/12Sy0ii WHITE HOUSE LASHES OUT AT ‘CONGRESSIONAL STUPIDITY.’ With only days to come up with a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff, the White House said “congressional stupidity” was damaging the economy but that an agreement could be reached if Republican leaders don’t get in the way. ABC’s Sarah Parnass, John Parkinson and Reena Ninan report, while Boehner has put the onus on the president and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a White House official used testy language to put the responsibility back on Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. “What we need is for the Senate Minority Leader not to block a vote and for Boehner to allow a vote,” a White House official told ABC News. “The hits to our economy aren’t coming from outside factors, they’re coming from congressional stupidity.” http://abcn.ws/12FUTWY BUSH 41 GETTING EXCELLENT TREATMENT. The AP’s Michael Graczyk reports, “Former President George H.W. Bush, who has been hospitalized for more than a month, is getting excellent medical treatment and would advise people to ‘put the harps back in the closet,’ his longtime Houston chief of staff said Thursday evening. But Jean Becker also pointed out in her statement that the 88-year-old Bush is sick and likely will be in the hospital for a while after a ‘terrible case of bronchitis which then triggered a series of complications.’” http://abcn.ws/12SyEfB ED MARKEY DECLARES CANDIDACY IN SENATE SPECIAL. The Boston Globe’s Mark Arsenault reports, “US Representative Edward J. Markey, dean of the state’s Washington delegation, will run in 2013 for the Senate seat expected to open with the nomination of Senator John F. ­Kerry to head the State Department. Markey, 66, a Malden Democrat elected to the House in 1976, is the first prominent candidate to ­declare a run for Kerry’s seat, which will be filled through a special election early next summer, probably in June. Kerry, a Democrat and head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is expected to be easily confirmed by the Senate in coming weeks as the next secretary of state.” http://bo.st/UvYmEP SENATORS CHAFE AT INACTION OVER FISCAL CLIFF DEAL. The New York Times Jennifer Steinhauer reports, “Senators bid hasty goodbyes to families, donned ties and pantsuits in lieu of sweat pants and Christmas sweaters and one by one returned to the Capitol on Thursday to begin the business of doing nothing in particular. But for once, those lawmakers were fully united, if only around their sadness and frustration at being stuck in Washington in a holiday week, peering over the edge of the fiscal abyss. Not to be outdone, Speaker John A. Boehner, who failed last week to cobble together enough votes for his own bill, ordered House members to return on Sunday.” http://nyti.ms/VloqCm EXPERTS: TRAINED POLICE NEEDED FOR SCHOOL SECURITY. The AP’s Larry Margasak reports, “the student’s attack began with a shotgun blast through the windows of a California high school. Rich Agundez, the El Cajon policeman assigned to the school, felt his mind shift into overdrive. While two teachers and three students were injured when the glass shattered in the 2001 attack on Granite Hills High School, Agundez confronted the assailant and wounded him before he could get inside the school and use his second weapon, a handgun. The National Rifle Association’s response to a Connecticut school massacre envisions, in part, having trained, armed volunteers in every school in America. But Agundez, school safety experts and school board members say there’s a huge difference between a trained law enforcement officer who becomes part of the school family – and a guard with a gun.” http://apne.ws/VaJgSq HAWAII’S BRIAN SCHATZ SWORN INTO SENATE.

John Bolton and John Yoo penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal calling for the senate to block an end run on nuclear arms. “President Obama has made eliminating all nuclear weapons his signature policy. In 2011, his New Start Treaty committed the United States to a ceiling of 700 strategic delivery vehicles and 1,550 strategic warheads,” Bolton and Yoo write. “Now, as he promised in March, he seeks even deeper reductions through “a step we have never taken before—reducing not only our strategic nuclear warheads, but also tactical weapons and warheads in reserve.” But the president faces the Constitution’s requirement that two-thirds of the Senate consent to any treaty. In 2010, the Senate ratified New Start with a vote of 71-26, but only after ending a filibuster with the exact 67 votes needed for a treaty. After his nasty re-election campaign, partisan budget wrangling and unfulfilled promises to modernize our nuclear stockpile, Mr. Obama will have a hard time finding 12 Republican senators to support any new nuclear deal with Russia. Senators should block end-runs around the Constitution’s treaty clause.” http://on.wsj.com/THJsg5 @politicalwire: Why neither side wants a fiscal cliff dealhttp://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/12/28/why_they_want_to_go_over_the_fiscal_cliff.html … @ChadPergram: Republican Study Cmte Chair Jim Jordan: Sen Reid and his colleagues should accept the House-passed plan or approve an acceptable alternative @markknoller: No one holds out much hope the group can reach a deal to avert the fiscal cliff on Tuesday, but stranger things have happened. @thegarance: “what on earth is Washington doing setting cat policy — polydactyl or otherwise — for Key West, Fla.?” http://trib.in/Tudqk7 @jackshafer: But consider the upside.

Available choices: (A). yes. (B). it is not possible to tell. (C). no.","completion":"(C). no. Based on the given information, it cannot be concluded that \\"The boys are watching tv.\\" The description provided details a scene in which two young men are handling an orange outboard boat, presumably lifting it either into or out of the water, with visible whitecap waves present. The natural setting and physical activity being performed by the two young men directly contradicts the idea of them watching television. Television watching typically takes place indoors or in a more passive, stationary environment. In contrast, the scenario described involves an outdoor activity that requires strength, focus, and coordination. The young men are engaged in a task related to boating, which does not resemble a passive recreational activity such as watching television. Based on the information provided, we can reasonably conclude that the boys are not watching television in this particular scenario.

So she decided not to add any sugar. The hot cocoa tasted boring. OPT: a). Being healthy isn't always fun.; b). She loved the donut she was eating.;","completion":"a). Being healthy isn't always fun. It was a cold winter evening. Snow fell gently onto the ground outside, covering the desolate landscape in a pristine white sheet. Lexi had loved winter for as long as she could remember. She mostly enjoyed indulging in her favorite activities – hot cocoa and curling up with a blanket in front of the fireplace. But this year was different. Lexi had made a resolution to be healthier. It had been a challenging year for her, filled with stress, tempting fast food, and skipped workouts. She knew she needed to make a change for the sake of her body and mind. But she also knew that changing habits was not going to be an easy ride. One of the hardest things to let go of was her undying love for sugary treats, such as her all-time winter comfort – hot cocoa. This evening, Lexi found herself craving that rich and sweet concoction she had always adored. She knew she could not stop herself altogether from having it, but she was determined to modify the recipe to make it healthier. To do so, she decided not to add any sugar. As she stirred her cocoa concoction on the stove, she felt a pang of sadness at the thought of omitting the sweet ingredient that she was sure would transform the otherwise mundane liquid into a delightful and warming treat. But she had vowed to keep her resolution. With a deep breath, Lexi poured herself a steaming mug of unsweetened cocoa. The anticipation was palpable as Lexi took her first sip. Her taste buds were met with a strong and bitter taste, completely devoid of the sweetness she had been accustomed to. Her heart sank, and she realized being healthy wasn't always fun. Despite the bitterness of her first sip, Lexi knew she needed to give it a chance. Over time, as she continued to drink the healthier version of her beloved hot cocoa, she noticed that her taste buds began to adjust. The bitterness transformed into a rich chocolate-y flavor that she started to appreciate. One day, complex layers of cocoa flavor seemed to reveal themselves to her as if they were always hidden beneath the sticky sweetness that she once craved. Lexi found her palate opening up to a whole new world of flavors that she had never experienced before. Lexi's journey to living a healthier lifestyle was not easy, as she had to battle with temptation and make tough choices. However, the newfound appreciation for healthier options made her realize that although being healthy isn't always fun, the payoff is worth it. As she persevered and continued incorporating healthier choices into her life, Lexi found herself feeling stronger, more energetic, and happier than ever. The self-discipline required to make these changes bled into other aspects of her life, leading her to develop an inner strength that she never knew she had. The winter evenings continued to be filled with warmth and comfort, but instead of indulging in unhealthy treats, Lexi learned to find enjoyment in the simple pleasures of life that supported her well-being. This newfound resilience allowed her to approach future winters - and life - with a sense of optimism and confidence that she could face any hurdle and come out stronger on the other side. And while she never lost her love for sweet treats, she also never forgot the lesson she learned about the importance of balance and self-discipline on her journey to a healthier, happier life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea., what would be the answer ?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Thanks Richard for asking. Yes. I have something to tell. We have record rainfall during 24 hours in Lahore, breaking previous one day record by more than 60%. Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs. This morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office. When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen. My wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit. Later in day we heard about the most stupid thing; people were inside their houses, watching flames from pole but not knowing what to do. THEY DID NOT EVEN COME OUT TO SHARE THE ACTIVITY. That has happened today. I am going to ask everyone about it one by one. Also, I am still looking for the guy who went to complaint office and was never seen thereafter this morning. That can happen to anybody. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How long did it take for the narrator to extinguish the fire?

Sentence 1: but um we were i mean um you know all schools were closed for almost for for over or for for a week Sentence 2: They decided that lessons should continue as per normal in schools. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The two sentences present distinct information about the status of schools and their operation. In the first sentence, the speaker is conveying that \\"all schools were closed for almost, for over or for a week,\\" which means that schools were not operating during that time, presumably due to an unspecified event or circumstance. On the other hand, the second sentence states that \\"They decided that lessons should continue as per normal in schools.\\" This sentence implies that a decision was made to resume regular school activities and lessons, possibly after an interruption or change in operations. However, this sentence does not indicate whether that decision was made before, during, or after the timeframe mentioned in the first sentence. It is important to note that the first sentence is filled with filler words such as \\"um\\" and repetitions of ‘for’ which makes it less concise, while the second sentence is more straightforward and clear in its message. Nevertheless, the fundamental point remains that these two sentences do not entail each other, as they convey different information about the status of schools and their operations. The first sentence refers to a past event where schools were closed for a specific duration, while the second sentence is about a decision taken to continue lessons as per normal in schools without providing direct information about any prior closures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The task requires rounding each integer in the given list to the nearest tens place (nearest multiple of 10). Here's the solution for the given instance: 1. Start with the first integer, -224. 2. Determine the nearest multiple of 10. Since -224 is closer to -220 than -230, -220 is the nearest multiple of 10. So, round -224 to -220. 3. Continue with the next integer, 481. 4. Determine the nearest multiple of 10. Since 481 is closer to 480 than 490, 480 is the nearest multiple of 10. So, round 481 to 480. 5. Repeat the process for the remaining integers: - 211 is closer to 210 than 220. So, round 211 to 210. - 115 is closer to 120 than 110.

Summarize the following: Though you may feel that you have done nothing wrong, determine if there is anything at all that you can improve on. You might yell at her sometimes or rarely clean up after yourself. Though you can’t control your mom, you can control yourself and work to minimize the issues you have with her. Domineering mothers often have a hard time letting go of control of their children and letting them be adults. Show your mother that you are responsible so that she feels comfortable letting you make your own decisions. Complete your chores, take on more responsibilities in the home, and keep your promises to your parents. Your mom’s control might stem from simply trying to be involved in your life. Though she displays this desire in an unhealthy way, try to find a way to let her in. See if she’ll let you stay out later on Saturday night if you do more chores that morning. If she is nervous about you going away to college, set up a communication plan and safety plan so she feels more secure. Your mom might be so domineering that you feel scared around her at times. However, begin to establish assertiveness in small ways. Look her in the eyes during conversations. Speak up, keep your voice strong and steady, and hold your head high. Your mom’s control over you is probably so frustrating at times that you want to scream. Instead of lashing out at her or others, find a more productive way to channel your anger. Take up a hobby like painting, drawing, or writing poems. Sit in a hot bath to soothe yourself or meditate. You can also vent to someone you trust. Perhaps your dad, second mom, step parent, aunt, uncle, or grandparent is far less domineering than your mother. Sit down and have a talk with them to see if they can help you or give advice. They might be able to talk to your mom for you or have a tip on how to deal with her. Pull them aside and say something like, “Hey Dad, I’m not trying to go behind Mom’s back or anything, but I’m starting to feel smothered. She won’t even let me close my bedroom door to do homework. Do you have any advice or can you talk to her for me?” Summary:","completion":"Examine your own actions and behaviors to identify areas of improvement when dealing with a domineering mother. Show responsibility in order to gain her trust and try to understand her underlying concerns, which may stem from wanting to be involved in your life.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Paleobotanist How organisms acquired traits that allow them to colonize new environments—and how the contemporary ecosystem is shaped—are fundamental questions of evolution. Paleobotany (the study of extinct plants) addresses these questions through the analysis of fossilized specimens retrieved from field studies, reconstituting the morphology of organisms that disappeared long ago. Paleobotanists trace the evolution of plants by following the modifications in plant morphology: shedding light on the connection between existing plants by identifying common ancestors that display the same traits. This field seeks to find transitional species that bridge gaps in the path to the development of modern organisms. Fossils are formed when organisms are trapped in sediments or environments where their shapes are preserved. Paleobotanists collect fossil specimens in the field and place them in the context of the geological sediments and other fossilized organisms surrounding them. The activity requires great care to preserve the integrity of the delicate fossils and the layers of rock in which they are found. One of the most exciting recent developments in paleobotany is the use of analytical chemistry and molecular biology to study fossils. Preservation of molecular structures requires an environment free of oxygen, since oxidation and degradation of material through the activity of microorganisms depend on its presence. One example of the use of analytical chemistry and molecular biology is the identification of oleanane, a compound that deters pests. Up to this point, oleanane appeared to be unique to flowering plants; however, it has now been recovered from sediments dating from the Permian, much earlier than the current dates given for the appearance of the first flowering plants. Paleobotanists can also study fossil DNA, which can yield a large amount of information, by analyzing and comparing the DNA sequences of extinct plants with those of living and related organisms. Through this analysis, evolutionary... Q: What is paleobotany? A: Choose your answer from: * study of diseased plants. * study of new plants. * study of fresh plants. * study of extinct plants.

Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them.

The work raised the band's profile and landed them a major-label American record deal with Elektra Records. Their first album under Elektra, Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements (August 1993), was an underground success in both the US and the UK. Mark Jenkins commented in Washington Post that with the album, Stereolab \\"continues the glorious drones of [their] indie work, giving celestial sweep to [their] garage-rock organ pumping and rhythm-guitar strumming\\". In the UK, the album was released on Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, which is responsible for domestic releases of Stereolab's major albums.In January 1994, Stereolab achieved their first chart entry when the 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline, entered at number 75 on the UK Singles Chart. (Over the next three years, four more releases by the band would appear on this chart, ending with the EP Miss Modular in 1997.) Their third album, Mars Audiac Quintet, was released in August 1994. The album contains the single \\"Ping Pong\\", which gained press coverage for its allegedly explicit Marxist lyrics. The band focused more on pop and less on rock, resulting in what AllMusic described as \\"what may be the group's most accessible, tightly-written album\\". It was the last album to feature O'Hagan as a full-time member. He would continue to make guest appearances on later releases. The group issued an EP titled Music for the Amorphous Body Study Center in April 1995. The EP was their musical contribution to an interactive art exhibit put on in collaboration with New York City artist Charles Long. Their second compilation of rarities, titled Refried Ectoplasm (Switched On, Vol. 2), was released in July 1995., what would be the answer ?

We planned on going for the weekend. Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it.

The boat was retired after the 1955 season. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Gold Cup is just a name, it is actually made from silver.","completion":"While it is true that the Gale V won the American Power Boat Association Gold Cup in 1955 with Lee Schoenith as the driver, the conclusion that the Gold Cup is just a name and is actually made from silver cannot be accurately drawn based solely on the information provided about the Gale V and its racing successes. To draw conclusions about the Gold Cup itself, a more informative approach would be to study its history, meaning, and importance within the sport. The Gold Cup, originally known as the Challenge Cup, is an American motorboat racing trophy, first awarded in 1904. It is one of the oldest active motor sports trophies in the world and serves as the premier event for unlimited hydroplane racing. The American Power Boat Association (APBA) organizes the Gold Cup races, and the event has been held every year, except during World War II and other breaks due to various reasons. The name \\"Gold Cup\\" is derived from the trophy's appearance, which is a magnificent, 2.5-foot tall, 30-pound artistic masterpiece made of solid gold. The cup features intricate detailing, which includes a flared bowl on top, supported by an elongated stem with three winged female figures, and a base with cast relief plaques depicting various watercraft. The award has undergone some modifications over the years, but the gold material has remained consistent throughout its history. Contrary to the assumption that the Gold Cup is made of silver, the trophy is indeed crafted using gold. The connection between the Gale V hydroplane team's accomplishments and the Gold Cup's composition does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the cup is made of silver. In conclusion, while the Gale V did have significant achievements in the 1950s, it is essential to look into the history and background of the Gold Cup itself to understand its significance and true composition. The Gold Cup has been and continues to be an esteemed award in the world of motorboat racing, made of gold, and not silver, honoring the champions who take part in this prestigious event."},{"prompt":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What type of spouses do Haredi normally have?\\" is in \\"A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup.

The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews.

However, these questions are related since both of them revolve around hiring engineers in Japanese companies. Let's breakdown both questions to understand their differences and connections: Question 1: \\"Do Japanese companies hire mechatronics engineers?\\" This question is specifically asking if Japanese companies employ individuals skilled in mechatronics engineering. Mechatronics engineering deals with the integration of mechanical, electrical, control, and software engineering in the design and manufacture of intelligent systems and products. Japanese companies like Toyota, Mitsubishi, and Panasonic are known for their involvement in automation and robotics, which often require mechatronics engineers. So, the answer to this question is B). yes. Question 2: \\"Do Japanese companies hire Indian engineers?\\" This question is about the recruitment of Indian engineers by Japanese companies, regardless of their engineering specialization. It focuses on nationality rather than a specific field of engineering. Japanese companies are increasingly collaborating with Indian engineers, both in India and Japan. Companies such as Honda, Sony, Toshiba, and TCS Japan have employed Indian engineers to leverage their expertise in various fields, including software development, automobile, and electronics. Thus, the answer to this question is B). yes. In summary, both questions address different aspects of Japanese companies' hiring practices. The first question is specific to the employment of mechatronics engineers, while the second question involves the hiring of Indian engineers, regardless of their field of specialization. Nonetheless, the answers to both questions are positive, indicating that Japanese companies do hire mechatronics engineers, and they also recruit Indian engineers in various engineering domains."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 1: Upon sending a friend request to someone on Facebook, I got 'This person has reached the friend request limit and can't accept any more'. What is the maximum limit and why? Question 2: I am an Indian guy. I send friend requests to many girls having mutual friends. Why don't they accept the request? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answer to Question 1: The maximum limit of friends on Facebook for a regular user profile is 5,000. After reaching this number, a person cannot accept more friend requests. When you send a friend request to someone who has reached this limit, you will receive the message \\"This person has reached the friend request limit and can't accept any more\\" because that person cannot add you as a friend until they remove some existing friends to make space. This friend limit is set by Facebook to prevent users from creating networks that are too large to be manageable and also to maintain a more genuine social experience that focuses on real relationships rather than just amassing a huge number of contacts. The main reasons for establishing such a limit include: 1. Performance: Managing updates, notifications, and processing data for a large number of friends can be resource-intensive for both Facebook’s servers and the user’s device. By limiting the number of friends, Facebook ensures that the user experience remains smooth and optimal. 2. Privacy: A vast network can expose a user's personal information to more people, increasing the risk of misuse or unintentional breaches of privacy. Limiting the number of friends helps users maintain a reasonable level of control over their personal information. 3. Authenticity: A high friend limit can lead to a superficial social network with less meaningful connections. By imposing a friend limit, Facebook tries to encourage users to create more sincere connections with people they genuinely know and care about. Answer to Question 2: Receiving friend requests and accepting them is a personal choice of the person one sends a request to. Although many girls may share mutual friends with you, they may not accept the requests for several reasons, some of which include: 1. Familiarity: Most people prefer to add friends they know well or have interacted with before. If they haven't met you or don't know you well, they may choose not to accept the request. 2. Privacy concerns: Many individuals are concerned about their online privacy and might only add friends they trust, even if there are mutual connections. 3. Profile authenticity: If your profile appears incomplete or lacks authenticity, with limited pictures or information, they might be hesitant to accept your friend request. 4. Personal preferences: Different people have different preferences for adding friends, and some individuals might be selective regarding who they add. It's essential not to take it personally if someone doesn't accept your friend request. It's important to respect their decision and focus on building genuine connections with those who do accept the request. In conclusion, the answers to these two questions are not the same. Question 1 deals with Facebook's technical limitation of a maximum number of friends, while Question 2 deals with the personal preferences and choices of the individuals receiving friend requests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a matter of fact, it is often very difficult for adoptees to find out about their birth parents because the birth records of most adoptees are usually sealed. The information is secret so no one can see it. Naturally, adopted children have different feelings about their birth parents. Many adoptees want to search for them, but others do not. The decision to search for birth parents is a difficult one to make. Most adoptees have mixed feelings about finding their biological parents. Even though adoptees do not know about their natural parents, they do know that their adopted parents want them, love them and will care for them.

UPDATED: IDF searches frantically for kidnapped soldier as Gaza truce shattered Smoke rises from the sites of Israeli air strikes on Rafah, in Gaza City. At least 40 Palestinians were killed. (Getty Images) Israeli forces are searching for a missing soldier, believed kidnapped by militants in the southern Gaza Strip, as the three-day ceasefire collapses only hours after it began. Intensive Israeli shelling killed at least 35 people and wounded more than 150 in southern Gaza today, medics said, shattering the fragile truce . But Israeli Defence Force troops are now frantically searching for an army officer believed kidnapped in a Hamas ambush that involved gunmen and suicide bombers that reportedly burst from concealed tunnels. The IDF has confirmed two soldiers were killed in fighting in the Gaza Strip today while Second Lieutenant Hadar Goldin, 23, is believed captured. \\"Initial indications suggest that a soldier has been abducted by terrorists in an incident where terrorists breached the ceasefire,\\" IDF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner said. A Palestinian health worker helps an injured child following the latest Israeli assault in Gaza (Getty Images) Asked if that meant the truce was over he replied: \\"Yes. We are continuing our activities on the ground.\\" He said the officer, believed to be from the Givati Brigade, was snatched by militants who emerged from concealed tunnels. One militant is reported to have detonated his suicide vest during the attack. He said the clash took place in Rafah, on the border with Egypt, where an AFP correspondent earlier reported fierce fighting as the army warned residents by telephone to stay in their houses as it \\"pursued terrorist elements.\\" The Times of Israel has reported that the kidnapped IDF member is an officer from the Givati Brigade, an infantry unit with amphibian capabilities that has extensive experience in Gaza operations. An IDF spokesman said earlier on Twitter: \\"We are conducting extensive searches in S. Gaza in order to find a missing IDF soldier. We suspect the soldier was kidnapped by Hamas today”. The renewed fighting, which saw Israel pound Palestinian militants in apparent response to renewed rocket fire, shattered the short-lived cease fire and jeopardises international efforts for a durable ceasefire. The skies over Gaza initially fell silent after the humanitarian truce announced overnight by US Secretary of State John Kerry, the longest of several agreed since the conflict broke out on July 8. It gave a brief respite to people in the battered strip from fighting that has killed nearly 1,500 on the Palestinian side, mostly civilians, and 61 Israeli soldiers and three civilians on the other. But within hours air raid sirens warning of rocket fire were heard on the Israeli side of the border, and heavy artillery shelling renewed in the southern city of Rafah, killing dozens of people and injuring up to 100 more, medics said. Hamas have not confirmed or denied the capture of an IDF soldier but said Israel's announcement of the capture was simply a \\"justification for Israel retreating from the truce, and a cover-up for massacres especially in Rafah,\\" referring to Israeli shelling that killed at least 35 people just hours after the truce took hold. A separate military statement claimed an IDF soldier was captured prior to the 72-hour truce going into effect. Palestinian onlookers and motorists pause to inspect an Israeli army bomb laying unexploded on the road, prior to the truce being broken. (Getty Images) But Hamas said it was Israel which violated the truce. \\"It is the occupation which violated the ceasefire. The Palestinian resistance acted based on... the right to self-defence (and) to stop the massacres of our people,\\" spokesman Fawzi Barhum said in a statement. The United Nations said it was informed by Israel of \\"a serious incident this morning involving a tunnel behind IDF (army) lines in the Rafah area\\". \\"If corroborated, this would constitute a serious violation of the humanitarian ceasefire... by Gazan militant factions, which should be condemned in the strongest terms,\\" the statement said.

It sounds like the perfect living arrangement for cash-strapped students. Two mothers believe they have devised a way for struggling students to save on accommodation costs when they leave home to study at university. Kate Barnham and Amanda Flude have launched Student Swaps, an online accommodation forum for parents and students, in advance of the introduction in September of PS3,000 higher education top-up fees. Their website says, \\"The principle behind Student Swaps is to enable students to literally swap family homes.\\" The website will hold a database of students who would like to swap and link them with suitable matches. So those from one town / city could swap with those from a different town / city. The site describes itself as offering a \\"cost-free accommodation alternative... at a time of growing student debt\\". There is no charge for the service at the moment but Ms Barnham and Ms Flude intend to introduce a PS10 annual fee if it becomes established. However, the National Union of Students (NUS) has warned that, while the scheme may sound appealing to struggling freshers, it lacks any formal regulation. Veronica King, NUS vice-president of welfare, said, \\"The fact that this scheme has even been suggested is evidence to the high levels of debt students now face on graduation.\\" Recent research has shown that students are more likely to live at home in coming years, in a bid to cut down on the cost of a degree. \\"This is worrying, as it may mean that students choose their university on the basis of where it is, rather than because it offers the best course for them. It also means students will miss out on what is for some a key part of the student experience-living away from home.\\" Question: Now many students would prefer a university _ .

Even though cats aren't known for being the friendliest creatures, often preferring to be by themselves rather than constantly in owners' arms, they should not be constantly trying to get away from people. This can be a sign that they need a reduction in environmental stressors. If your cat consistently ducks out of the room or dodges behind furniture every time someone enters the room, you should try to figure out what's wrong. New cats may hide more than cats who are accustomed to their homes, so don't be alarmed if your new cat hides for a while after moving in. If you have a cat cohabitating with other pets, it should be easy to tell if aggression is a normal behavior or not. If your cat consistently snaps at or picks fights with animals it used to play happily with, the cat very well may be stressed. Your cat may be sick instead of stressed, so identify any stressors that could be triggering this behavior before heading to the vet. You are also probably attuned to how your cat interacts with other humans. If your cat used to be warm toward people, or even passively accepted their presence, and suddenly starts lashing out, you have a problem.

I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination.

Read this article and answer this question The Hotak dynasty was an Afghan monarchy of the Ghilji Pashtuns, established in April 1709 by Mirwais Hotak after leading a successful revolution against their declining Persian Safavid overlords in the region of Loy Kandahar in what is now southern Afghanistan. It lasted until 1738 when the founder of the Afsharid dynasty, Nader Shah Afshar, defeated Hussain Hotak during the long siege of Kandahar, and started the reestablishment of Iranian suzerainty over all regions lost decades before against the Iranian archrival, the Ottoman Empire, and the Russian Empire. At its peak, the Hotak dynasty ruled briefly over an area which is now Afghanistan, Iran, western Pakistan, and some parts of Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. In 1715, Mirwais died of a natural cause and his brother Abdul Aziz succeeded the monarchy. He was quickly followed by Mahmud who ruled the empire at its largest extent for a mere three years. Following the 1729 Battle of Damghan, where Ashraf Hotak was roundly defeated by Nader Shah, Ashraf was banished to what is now southern Afghanistan with Hotak rule being confined to it. Hussain Hotak became the last ruler until he was also defeated in 1738. How many years after the Battle of Damghan did Nader Shah defeat Hussain Hotak during the long siege of Kandahar?","completion":"The Battle of Damghan happened in 1729, and Nader Shah defeated Hussain Hotak in the long siege of Kandahar in 1738.

Question: ‘The Thought Police’ feature in which 1949 novel? Answer:","completion":"The Thought Police, also known as the Thinkpol, are a central element in the 1949 dystopian novel \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" by the English author George Orwell. This seminal work depicts a totalitarian regime controlled by the Party, led by the omnipresent and enigmatic figure of Big Brother. The novel is set in the superstate of Oceania, which is one of the three global powers that arose after a global cataclysm and are perpetually engaged in war. The Thought Police act as the Party's secret law enforcement, whose primary role is to monitor and punish individual thoughtcrimes – thoughts that defy or challenge the Party's ideology, authority, policies, or intentions. Their methods involve pervasive surveillance, the use of informants, secret agents, and psychological manipulation techniques, often by exploiting an individual's fears and vulnerabilities. They maintain an atmosphere of constant fear and paranoia in the society, as anyone can be accused of being a thought criminal at any time. The novel follows the story of Winston Smith, a low-ranking member of the Party who becomes disillusioned with the oppressive regime. As Winston slowly comes to terms with his own thoughtcrimes and begins his descent into rebellion, the pervasive nature of the Thought Police looms large over his life. Nineteen Eighty-Four explores themes of censorship, surveillance, totalitarianism, and the erosion of individual freedom in an omnipresent surveillance state. The Thought Police serve as the embodiment of the constant monitoring and suppression of dissenting thoughts and opinions, and the concept has become deeply ingrained in popular culture as a symbol of state control over individual freedoms and privacy. The novel has had a lasting impact on the modern understanding of the potential dangers of unchecked state power, as well as the erosion of civil liberties in the name of national security. In today's world, where the proliferation of surveillance technologies and the increasing need for cybersecurity pose significant challenges to privacy and freedom of expression, Orwell's depiction of the Thought Police continues to resonate as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of surrendering these fundamental rights to an authoritarian regime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because glucagon plays a crucial role in maintaining and regulating blood sugar levels when they are low. Among the given options, this perturbation would be considered as \\"directly impacting a step of the process.\\" Here's the step-by-step explanation: 1. The blood sugar level drops in the body. 2. Cells in the pancreas release glucagon. 3. Since there is less glucagon, this step is directly impacted. The pancreas cannot release adequate glucagon required to regulate blood sugar levels. 4. The liver, in response, turns the available glucagon into glucose, but it may not produce enough glucose to restore blood sugar levels to normal. 5. The liver releases the limited glucose into the blood. 6. The blood sugar levels may not be fully restored due to insufficient glucagon in the blood.

This situation changes when Pesh-Chidin and a dozen of his followers (who have left the reservation) pass through the area, ritualistically killing settlers and taking their daughters to be sold into sex slavery in Mexico. Among those captured is Maggie's eldest daughter, Lilly. Maggie's rancher boyfriend Brake Baldwin was among the settlers killed. The U.S. Cavalry refuses to help retrieve the captive women as its resources are tied up conducting forced relocation of captive Native Americans. This leaves Maggie, her father, and her younger daughter Dot alone in tracking the attackers. The group unexpectedly meets up with Kayitah, a Chiricahua, and an old friend of Jones, who also happens to be tracking the attackers with his son Honesco, because among the captives is a young Chiricahua woman who is engaged to Honesco. After the two agree to join the group, and Maggie treats Honesco's injuries, Kayitah informs Maggie that Jones had been a member of their Chiricahua band where he gained the name Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan (\\"shit for luck\\") during his wanderings. It is finally with the combined efforts of the two families that they are able to free the women, at the cost of Kayitah's life, and immediately flee to the mountains with the kidnappers behind them.

Movie title: WarGames Movie plot: During a surprise drill of a nuclear attack, many United States Air Force Strategic Missile Wing missileers prove unwilling to turn a required key to launch a missile strike. Such refusals convince John McKittrick (Dabney Coleman) and other systems engineers at NORAD that missile launch control centers must be automated, without human intervention. Control is given to a NORAD supercomputer, WOPR (War Operation Plan Response), programmed to continuously run military simulations and learn over time. David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) is a bright but unmotivated Seattle high school student and hacker. After receiving a failing grade in school, he uses his IMSAI 8080 microcomputer to hack into the district's computer system. He then changes his grade and does the same for his friend and classmate Jennifer Mack (Ally Sheedy). Later, while dialing every number in Sunnyvale, California to find a set of forthcoming computer games, a computer that does not identify itself intrigues David. On the computer he finds a list of games, starting with general strategy games like chess, checkers, backgammon, and poker and then progressing to titles like \\"Theaterwide Biotoxic and Chemical Warfare\\" and \\"Global Thermonuclear War\\", but cannot proceed further. Two hacker friends explain the concept of a backdoor password and suggest tracking down the Falken referenced in \\"Falken's Maze\\", the first game listed. David discovers that Stephen Falken is an early artificial intelligence researcher, and guesses correctly that his dead son's name \\"Joshua\\" is the backdoor password. David does not know that the Sunnyvale phone number connects to WOPR, or \\"Joshua\\", at Cheyenne Mountain Complex. He starts a game of Global Thermonuclear War, playing as the Soviet Union.

The character, portrayed by John Wood, is an early AI researcher who is very familiar with the supercomputer WOPR or \\"Joshua\\". As the plot unfolds, David Lightman, the young hacker, unwittingly starts a simulation of a nuclear conflict between the US and USSR, causing NORAD officials to believe they are under attack. After understanding what has happened and realizing the gravity of the situation, David, with his classmate Jennifer Mack, seek the help of Falken. Together, they manage to convince the military that the reported 'attack' is merely a game simulation by the supercomputer WOPR. Falken persuades them that the supercomputer will eventually understand that nuclear war cannot be won and will cancel the second strike just as it does in the game of tic-tac-toe. Therefore, it is through Falken's interaction that the military officials are convinced to cancel the second strike and allow the supercomputer to continue its simulation until it learns that neither side can win a nuclear war."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the following context: Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realising that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and the baby falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to put the baby's diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up putting the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off, nonchalantly. Tom and Jerry catch up with the baby, only to lose it again, and fearing that it has crawled into a cement mixer on the 30th floor, the two dive straight in, only to find that the baby never did enter the mixer but instead playing with a hammer.

Grim disappeared upstairs himself, and returned about ten minutes later in the uniform of a Shereefian officer--that is to say, of Emir Feisul's Syrian army. Nothing could be smarter, not anything better calculated to disguise a man. Disguise, as any actor or detective can tell you, is not so much a matter of make- up as suggestion. It is little mannerisms--unstudied habits that identify. The suggestion that you are some one else is the thing to strive for, not the concealment of who you really are. Grim's skin had been sun-tanned in the Arab campaign under Lawrence against the Turks. The Shereefian helmet is a compromise between the East and West, having a strip of cloth hanging down behind it as far as the shoulders and covering the ears on either side, to take the place of the Arab head-dress. The khaki uniform had just enough of Oriental touch about it to distinguish it from that of a British officer. No man inexperienced in disguise would dream of choosing it; for the simple reason that it would not seem to him disguise enough. Yet Grim now looked so exactly like somebody else that it was hard to believe he was the same man who had been in the room ten minutes before. His mimicry of the Syrian military walk--blended of pride and desire not to seem proud--was perfect.

This can be achieved through studying and mimicking the mannerisms, and even the wardrobe, of the person or character you are trying to disguise as. Specifically in this text, the author discusses how the character Grim took on the uniform and walking style of a Shereefian officer to effectively disguise himself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The experiment is led by Professor Klaus Thon and his assistant, Dr. Jutta Grimm. He decides to join in. Tarek participates as a journalist while wearing a pair of glasses with a built-in mini-camera. Tarek has a car accident shortly before the experiment, after which he meets a woman called Dora. She spends the night with him and Tarek keeps thinking of her, shown in flashbacks. The 20 volunteers are pronounced guards and prisoners, 12 prisoners and 8 guards, and are being observed by a team of scientists. In the experiment, the prisoners lose their civil rights and have to obey arbitrary rules, such as completely eating their meals. The guards are given nightsticks, but are told not to use violence in any case. Each prisonerâs name is taken away and replaced by a number. Tarek (prisoner nr. 77) initially refuses to acknowledge the guards' superiority by drinking the milk of one of his co-prisoners because of that prisoner's lactose intolerance, or by throwing his blanket out of his cell to provoke the guards. He befriends his cellmates, Steinhoff and SchÃ¼tte. Psychological changes develop and the situation deteriorates. The circumstances seem to be escalating after a few days. It becomes clear that limits are not only being reached but being surpassed when the guards kidnap Tarek from his cell late in the night, order him to strip fully naked, shave his head bald and urinate on him.

A:","completion":"Gary Byrne, born on July 19, 1954, in Sydney, Australia, is a former professional footballer who made a significant impact on the Australian soccer scene. From his humble beginnings at Camden Tigers, a local youth club, Byrne went on to play for several teams throughout his career, including Sutherland Sharks, Canberra City, and Blacktown City. His playing years spanned a period of 15 years, from 1971 to 1986, demonstrating his dedication and talent in the sport. Byrne was not only successful at the club level but also represented his country on the international stage, donning the green and gold of the Australian national team. He earned his first national cap in 1975, and over the years, he went on to make a total of 36 appearances for the national team until 1983. His international career was highlighted by his ability to find the back of the net, scoring a total of 1 goal for Australia. Although the exact number of caps and goals scored during his tenure with each club is unclear, Gary Byrne's long-standing presence in the football scene during those years attests to his skill as a player. Today, he is remembered as an important figure in the history of Australian soccer, having brought pride to both his clubs and his country through his performances on the field."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

I mean that school, how many schools apart from maybe Hogwarts look like that? The twee police station looked like the set from Heartbeat ( a nauseating British series set in the 60s).This film just couldn't make its mind up what it wanted to be- a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women's friendships. If it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked( i say just). But those scenes just didn't work with the tragedy in the second half. I also find it implausible that Kate would ever speak to Molly again after her terrible behaviour.

At first I was going to say giving them daily chores, but the “reward” part of that has actually not been realized yet (what with all the eye rolling and such). So I will have to go with family dinners at the table. Sometimes, “dinner” is fast food, sometimes it is a meal I slaved over for hours - that part doesn’t seem to matter. Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”. My twins will be Seniors next year, and I know that our table will look a little different from now on.

Second question: What would football look like if there is no Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First Question: The main differences between Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are that they are two very talented soccer players with their own unique styles. Messi is more of a dribbler and playmaker, which means he likes to control the ball and create scoring chances for himself and his teammates. Cristiano Ronaldo is more of a goal-scorer and is known for his powerful shots and great heading abilities. While Messi is smaller and quicker, Ronaldo is taller and stronger. They play for different clubs and come from different countries (Messi is from Argentina, and Ronaldo is from Portugal). Second Question: If there were no Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, football would still be fun to watch, but we would miss their incredible skills and goals.

Process: - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled. Question: suppose lava chambers are aggravated with build up pressure happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"C: No effect The process of air intake and respiration in the human body is primarily regulated by the respiratory system, which consists of the nose, mouth, windpipe, bronchial tubes, and lungs. The occurrence of external events, such as the build-up of pressure in lava chambers, would not directly impact the amount of oxygen being brought into the body. The respiratory system's primary function is to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the body's cells. It does this by taking in air through the nose or mouth, which then travels down the windpipe and into the lungs via the bronchial tubes. Within the lungs, oxygen is transferred to the blood, and carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of cellular respiration, is removed. The oxygen-rich blood is then transported throughout the body to nourish cells, while carbon dioxide is brought back to the lungs and exhaled from the body. Lava chamber pressure build-up is a geological phenomenon that occurs when magma accumulates beneath the Earth's surface. This build-up of pressure can lead to volcanic eruptions if the pressure becomes too great and the magma forces its way through or around any solid rock that may be containing it. This event is neither related to nor has any direct influence on the respiratory system or the amount of oxygen being brought into the human body. External factors that could potentially impact the respiratory system and subsequently, oxygen intake, include air quality, altitude, and physical fitness. However, geological events such as pressure build-up in lava chambers are not among these factors. To summarize, the build-up of pressure in lava chambers is a geological event that would have no direct effect on the human respiratory system or the amount of oxygen being brought into the body. The respiratory system functions independently of geological occurrences, and its primary purpose is to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the body's cells."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She carries a single ski boot and describes eXistenZ, which is a new game system (metaflesh). Almost everyone in the room volunteers to test the new system. At the door, a game company worker Ted (Jude Law) screens Noel Dichter (Kris Lemche) for recording devices. Noel has an outdated gamepod, and is anxious about the demo.The demo uses flesh like gamepods to allows players to interact with the game. As they go into a trance to enter the game, Noel pulls an odd-looking gun out from inside his gamepod and shoots Allegra in the shoulder. The gamers attached to her feel the impact, and Noel gets shot by security. Ted grabs the gun and whisks Allegra away. In the car, Allegra throws Ted's phone away, as it can be used to track them. He uses a pocketknife to dig out the bullet, which is a tooth. They realize the gun and ammo are made of flesh and bone, which would not be detected by a scanner.They stop at a motel. Ted wants to check in with Antenna, but Allegra wants to test the game, and needs Ted to help her. Ted does not have a \\"bio-port\\". They go to a gas station and ask the attendant Gas (Willem Dafoe) to install an illegal port. He agrees, after recognizing Allegra.

Given the two facts above, the trcipes femoris is used to move what? The answer is:","completion":"The triceps femoris, also known as the quadriceps femoris, is a large muscle group that includes four muscles on the front of the thigh. These muscles are the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and vastus intermedius. Given the two facts provided, the triceps femoris is used to move the lower leg (specifically, the shank) and the thigh. Fact 1: Muscles can only contract. This is an essential concept in muscular physiology. When a muscle contracts, it pulls on its attached bones, resulting in movement at the joint. Muscles cannot push, so they always work in pairs to create opposing movements for both flexion and extension. Fact 2: The triceps femoris pulls the thigh forward and extends the shank. This means that when the triceps femoris is contracted, it moves the thigh forward in the hip joint, which is known as hip flexion. At the same time, it extends the shank (the part of the leg between the knee and the ankle), which is called knee extension. This movement is essential for various activities like walking, running, jumping, and climbing stairs. Taking these two facts into consideration, the triceps femoris muscle group plays a crucial role in the movement of the lower leg and thigh. To be more specific, it is responsible for hip flexion and knee extension. Consequently, this muscle group enables us to perform a wide range of everyday activities and maintain our balance and stability throughout these movements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In a world today of immense technology, population growth and economic flourish, planning for future residential and commercial developments needs careful analysis with well thought through assumptions about effects on the environment and the people of the community. One example of a growing city is Wooster, Ohio, my place of residency, Wooster in the last five years has grown considerably in population, leading to a growth in commercial business. Surrounded by farmland, Wooster's planning commission chose to extend the community into these farm areas in the form of residential and commercial areas. Picture this--corn fields, old trees, clean air, country roads, and wildlife are all part of the area. Within four years, the people living on this farm step outside on their front porch to view an extensive shopping center containing Wal-Mart, McDonald's, Wendy's, TCBY, and a Cinemark movie theatre. The once quiet road is now a city street with traffic lights, busy with automobiles day and night. The air smells of car exhaust and fast food. Some destruction of farmland is unavoidable when a city expands. Instead of expanding outward, planning commissions should consider interior _ of a city. Tearing down unusable buildings could remodel many areas inside the city. In addition, commercialized buildings could extend upwards to avoid unnecessary use of land. Environmentally, commercial expansion is harmful to the land. Besides forms of pollution, wildlife, including both plants and animals, is put at risk. A planning commission could have realized the benefits of environmental protection. Why not preserve the beauty and naturalness of the land while at the same time allowing for growth?

Pick from: (i) yes; (ii) it is not possible to tell; (iii) no;","completion":"(iii) No, The hypothesis \\"China has no missiles in their arsenals\\" is not true based on the given premise. The premise states that China currently has about 20 missiles that could potentially hit the United States, and they are working on expanding their capabilities with more survivable, mobile launchers. This means that China does have missiles in their arsenal, and the number is significant enough to pose a potential threat. It is essential to consider that the possession of missiles is part of any major military power's strategic planning and defense system. It is not surprising that China, as one of the most powerful nations in the world, would possess such equipment and seek to continuously improve and expand upon its capabilities. Moreover, the fact that China is actively working to supplement its missile force with more mobile and survivable launchers indicates that they are prioritizing the development and enhancement of their missile capabilities. This could be rooted in a desire for deterrence against external threats or to maintain regional dominance and influence. In conclusion, the hypothesis that China has no missiles in their arsenal is not true based on the provided information, as it indicates that China has a considerable number of missiles as part of their military capabilities. The development and growth of this missile force highlights China's strategic objectives and its continuous pursuit to strengthen its military and national security capacities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The prospect of accepting it had caused a row between UKIP's only MP, Douglas Carswell, and party officials. Britain's political parties have to rely on donations to fund their campaigning activities. But opposition parties are entitled to millions of pounds a year in public funds to help pay for their activities in Parliament. This is called Short money. It takes its name from former Labour MP Ted Short who was instrumental in its introduction as leader of the House of Commons in 1974 and 1975. To qualify for Short money, a party must have at least two MPs or one MP and more than 150,000 votes. The amount payable to qualifying parties is £16,956.86 for every seat won at the most recent election plus £33.86 for every 200 votes gained by the party. There is also a travel fund of £183,336 which is shared between the parties in line with the same formula. In addition, the Leader of the Opposition's office is entitled to about £777,500 to help with running costs. The parties receive a monthly payment. The exact amount each party will receive in this Parliament is still being calculated by the House of Commons authorities. But here are some rough estimates based on the funding formula. Labour is in line to get at least £6.2m a year - about the same as it received in the last Parliament. The SNP will get something in the region of £1.2m - a big increase on the £187,000 it received in the last Parliament, in recognition of the massive increase in votes and seats it saw at the general election. There is a crumb of comfort for the Lib Dems, who did not receive Short money in the last Parliament because they were part of the government. They are likely to get about £540,000 a year this time. UKIP and the Greens are in the unusual position of having gained millions of votes between them but ending up with just one MP each. That means Green MP Caroline Lucas and UKIP's Douglas Carswell could be the most well-funded MPs in British history. UKIP, which was not entitled to Short money in the last Parliament, will be entitled to about £650,000. The Green Party is in line to get about £212,000 - a big increase on the £66,019 the party received in the final year of the last Parliament. Plaid Cymru will get roughly the same as it got in the last Parliament, when it received £81,000. The DUP received £166,000 and that is expected to remain the same. The SDLP retained three seats on a slightly lower vote Yes. Caroline Lucas said: \\"The Green Party will be taking its Short money allocation because we take very seriously our responsibility to the million plus voters who backed us. \\"It will be used to employ staff to help me, as the sole Green MP, hold the government to account as effectively as possible.\\" The original idea was to create more of a level-playing field for opposition parties. The governing party has access to the full might of the civil service machine to formulate its policies. To hold ministers properly to account, opposition party MPs should be able to employ researchers and carry out detailed policy work. That was the thinking. It is meant to be used on policy research for frontbench spokesmen and to pay staff salaries in the Whips and leader of the opposition's offices. It is not meant to be used for political campaigning or paying staff salaries at party HQ. \\"Very little information is published about the qualifying parties' use of their Short money allocation in carrying out their parliamentary business,\\" according to a paper by the Commons library. \\"There has been some concern over the years about whether Short Money is being used appropriately,\\" it adds. The parties are required to submit a report from an independent auditor at the end of every financial year to verify that their Short money was spent \\"exclusively in connection with the party's parliamentary business\\". Douglas Carswell is a longstanding campaigner against what he sees as the undemocratic and corrupt nature of Westminster politics. He fell out with UKIP party officials when they suggested he use the Short money to employ 15 members of staff. \\"I am not a US senator, I don't need 15 staff,\\" said Mr Carswell. \\"UKIP is supposed to be different.\\" Not as far as we know. Short money is only available to parties whose MPs who take the oath in the Commons. Initially, this meant that Sinn Fein, whose MPs do not take up their seats, were not entitled to it. But in 2006, MPs agreed to allow opposition parties \\"who have chosen not to take their seats\\" to access public funds to pay staff wages for MPs \\"in relation to the party's representative business\\" Sinn Fein uses the money for press, publicity and other representative functions. The Democratic Unionist Party has repeatedly called for this arrangement to be brought to an end. A similar scheme, Cranborne Money, after the then Leader of the House of Lords, was agreed on 27 November 1996, to provide financial assistance for opposition parties, in the House of Lords. What was that article about?","completion":"The article discusses the concept of Short money, which is a form of public funding allocated to opposition parties in the UK Parliament to help pay for their activities. This funding is derived from a formula based on the number of seats a party has won and the total votes it has received. It was introduced in the 1970s by former Labour MP Ted Short and is intended to create a level-playing field for opposition parties as they hold the government accountable. The article provides estimates of the Short money allocations for various political parties in the UK Parliament based on the funding formula. Among them are Labour with £6.2m a year, the SNP with around £1.2m, the Lib Dems with £540,000, UKIP with £650,000, the Green Party with £212,000, Plaid Cymru with around £81,000, and the DUP with £166,000. The article also highlights concerns about whether Short money is being used appropriately by the political parties and mentions the need for an independent auditor's report to verify its usage exclusively for parliamentary business. Additionally, it touches upon the controversies surrounding UKIP MP Douglas Carswell and the eligibility of Sinn Fein MPs for Short money, given that they do not take up their seats in Commons.

One of the band's biggest fans was a young boy named Aaron Carter. Aaron had a special reason for taking such an interest in the band. Nick Carter, one of the Backstreet Boys, was Aaron's big brother. Even before Nick joined the band in 1996, Aaron loved music. From the age of two, Aaron spent most of his time listening to the radio. He sang along with his favorite songs. He made up dances to go with them. So Aaron's family was not surprised when Aaron decided to follow Nick into the music world. Aaron got off to a fast start. At the age of seven, he joined a band in his hometown of Tampa, Florida. But after two years, Aaron didn't want to be part of a band anymore. He wanted to sing alone. Soon, Brother Nick gave Aaron a helping hand.

Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century After reading the above, is \\"Morality tales\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of tales are \\"The Lust of the White Serpent\\" and the \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda?\\"\\"?","completion":"Yes, \\"morality tales\\" is the correct term to describe \\"The Lust of the White Serpent\\" and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda.\\" These stories teach lessons about good and bad behavior, especially regarding the consequences of the dangerous beauty of the femme fatale character, Madame White Snake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Music has a positive effect on work in the office; 4). David Guetta is the head of the experiment; Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A new study suggests that listening to music in the office improves the speed and accuracy of tasks such as data entry, proof reading and problem solving. In an office-based experiment, 88 per cent of participants were found to produce their most accurate work when listening to music. The study also found that 81 per cent completed their fastest work when music was played. And it matters what type of music you listen to. For instance, if you're doing your tax returns, then classical music is the most effective as it improves maths skills. Listening to Jessie Jor Justin Bieber could also improve your speed, with 58 per cent of participants completing data entry tasks faster while listening to pop songs. During proof-reading, dance music, such as David Guetta, had the biggest positive impact with participants increasing their speed by 20 per cent compared to tests undertaken with no music at all. Dance music also had a positive effect on spell-checking with a 75 per cent pass rate compared to 68 per cent when no music was played at all. The research, undertaken by Brighton-based Mind lab International, suggests that silent offices may be the least productive. 'The Music Works experiment revealed a positive _ between music and productivity - overall it showed that when listening to music, nine out of 10 people performed better,' said Dr David Lewis, chairman of Mind lab International.

Male Sellers on eBay Have an Edge Over Women, Study Finds Successful sellers on eBay know certain things matter: item description, appealing photos, strong seller ratings and, of course, price. Now, a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances suggested another factor might make a subtle difference: whether the seller is a man or woman. Using data supplied by the company, researchers analyzed some 630,000 auction transactions on eBay in the United States and reported that, on average, when men and women with equal selling reputations sold the same products, women received lower prices than men. The difference was far less pronounced for used items: Women sellers received about 97 cents for every dollar men received. But with new items, where the authors say direct comparison is easier, women received about 80 cents on average for every dollar men sellers received. “The basic point — that people have different expectations of women versus men and so we treat them very differently in the world — it’s fascinating and depressing,” said Linda Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who was not involved in the study. “On eBay, wow,” she added, noting eBay’s fame as a forum where anyone can sell anything. It also does not require that sellers identify their gender. “This would be kind of the best example where you would think that discrimination would be at its smallest. So we can interpret these data as a lower bound of what we can expect in other environments.” The study did not paint a universally negative picture for women. For some items, like toys and pet products, women received somewhat higher prices than men. And women tended to have better reputations as sellers, although they tended to have less selling experience. Nor did the study, which controlled for seller reputation, experience, number of photos, use of bold lettering and other elements, indicate that buyers were actively or even consciously discriminating. Male and female buyers appeared to treat women sellers the same, the authors said. “We actually think that most of it is unconscious,” said Tamar Kricheli-Katz, a professor of law and sociology at Tel Aviv University, who conducted the study with Tali Regev, an economist at IDC Herzliya. “The fact is that most of us have biases. We hold them unconsciously, and it makes it difficult to change.” Besides analyzing actual eBay transactions, the researchers conducted an experiment to see if people could tell the gender of sellers from user profiles. People guessed correctly in 1,127 of 2,000 cases, wrong in 170 and did not know the rest. In another experiment, the researchers asked people to place value on a 100 Amazon gift card sold by someone named either Alison or Brad. On average, Alison’s gift card was valued at 83.34, while Brad’s was valued at 87.42. Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist and expert on gender wage gaps, said the study was intriguing but needed more analysis. “Just perceiving that somebody’s a woman, what exactly does it mean?” she asked. “It’s got to mean something about the quality of the good or service or something that’s not captured in the data that they have.” Without that additional information, Dr. Goldin said her hunch is that “the majority of people would be bidding less if they thought that, ‘This really isn’t a 1948 Rolex’ or ‘This really isn’t Jackie Robinson’s signature.’ ” The researchers said eBay allowed them access to data on transactions, sellers and buyers, including gender. They evaluated transactions from 2009 to 2012, focusing on the 420 most popular items in eBay’s broader categories, and on auctions because no negotiation is involved. Sellers considered to be stores were excluded. EBay did not provide financing for the study, but set conditions, according to the authors and to editors at Science Advances. The researchers’ contract allowed eBay to approve any study before publication, mostly for potential disclosure of proprietary data and trade secrets; the authors said eBay “ended up approving the study without asking us to drop any of our results.” EBay declined to discuss the specifics of the study with a reporter. In a statement, the company did not challenge the results. “This study, which was based on data from more than four years ago, was not conducted or commissioned by eBay,” the statement said, adding, “We are passionate about harnessing our platform to empower millions of people by leveling the playing field for them. We do not reveal the gender of our sellers, although they can choose to do that themselves.” Because the study computed averages, the experience of individual sellers might not match the trend, experts said. Indeed, when The New York Times, in reporting about the study, asked on Facebook if women eBay sellers felt that gender helped or hurt their sales, many people who posted responses said they felt gender was a nonissue on eBay. “Price, shipping, description … that’s what eBay buyers worry about,” wrote Susan Butler Carpenter, a former banker who is now a stay-at-home mother in Pennsylvania and an eBay seller for 16 years. “Anyone who says their gender as a woman has hurt or helped their sales is full of it. Why look for an issue where there is none?” A few female sellers said they believed some buyers reacted differently because they were women. Melanie Fodera, 21, a senior at Albion College in Michigan and a seller for about seven years, said when selling a Detroit Lions jersey for “100 or best offer,” she was offered 50. “I countered 75, and their message to me was, ‘You don’t know what this is worth because you’re a girl,’ ” said Ms. Fodera, who usually sells women’s clothes and has an eBay page decorated with roses. Another Facebook commenter, Justina Gilliam, posted: “It all depends on what I’m selling, really. I don’t sell often, but I’ve gotten men who think they can take advantage when I list sports tickets/memorabilia and women who get upset if I can’t answer intricate details about a Lladró that was given to me but I’m getting rid of because I don’t care for it.” In the 631,516 auctions the authors analyzed, women were about 23 percent of sellers. They received, on average, 0.88 fewer bids for the same items, the authors said. New items, where researchers found the largest gender gap, accounted for 78,350 sales. The biggest advantage for male sellers occurred in categories like new video games (the gap was especially huge for Nintendo Wii). The authors analyzed the text sellers used, finding that women used slightly more positive language, saying “works great” more often than “never used,” for example, Dr. Regev said. But wording differences did not account for the price gap. Cecilia Ridgeway, a gender issues expert at Stanford, said when reading the study, “I did not think, ‘Oh, eBay needs to fix this.’ I don’t think this is a key thing we’ve got to do for gender equality.” Still, she said she viewed the study as an indicator of “the importance of gender as a way of making sense of any human being. That doesn’t mean people endorse these beliefs; they just know them.” An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the journal that published a study about different outcomes for women and men in sales. The journal is Science Advances, not Science. A version of this article appears in print on February 20, 2016, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Buyers on eBay Bid More for Goods Sold by Men, Study Says .

Context: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: What does the author seem to most probably believe about the availability of seasonal produce? Options: A. that seasonal produce is in limited supply B. most likely that people can find places that sell seasonal produce where they live C. not enough information D. that seasonal produce is most likely available only at farmers markets Answer:","completion":"B. most likely that people can find places that sell seasonal produce where they live"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I am middle aged man, seperated, very depressed. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing, but there is some overlap between the two questions. Here's a detailed analysis of both questions: Question 1: How can an Indian single man get emotional support at middle age? This question focuses on seeking emotional support specifically for middle-aged single men in India. Emotional support refers to the assistance and encouragement one receives from friends, family members, or professionals. Here are a few steps a middle-aged Indian single man can take to get emotional support: 1. Reach out to friends and family: Open up to friends and family members about your feelings and ask for their help and guidance in overcoming your emotional challenges. 2. Join support groups: There are various online and offline support groups that cater to single men and other individuals seeking emotional advice and assistance. Participating in such support groups can provide crucial emotional support from people who are or have been in similar situations. 3. Seek professional help: If you're finding it difficult to cope with your emotions or you suspect that you may be experiencing depression, it's advisable to seek help from a mental health professional who can guide you in dealing with these emotions effectively. 4. Engage in hobbies and activities: Taking up hobbies and activities that you enjoy or joining clubs or organizations that interest you can help form connections with like-minded individuals, which in turn can lead to a strong support system. 5. Volunteer or give back: Participating in volunteer work or doing charity activities can help make new friends and provide a sense of purpose, subsequently fostering emotional well-being. Question 2: How do I get female friends in Quora? I am a middle-aged man, separated, very depressed. This question focuses on forming friendships with females on a specific online platform, Quora. While friendships can provide emotional support, this question is more specifically targeted towards expanding the social circle of a middle-aged man going through a separation. Here are some steps on how to make female friends on Quora: 1. Create a well-rounded profile: Make sure your Quora profile is complete and informative. Include a clear profile photo and write a brief description about yourself and your interests. 2. Be active and contribute: Participate in discussions related to topics that interest you. By answering questions and engaging with others' answers, you will be able to build a network of people with similar interests. 3. Follow interesting and relevant users: Follow female Quora users who share your interests or contribute valuable insights to the platform. By doing so, you are likely to find more opportunities to interact and connect with them. 4. Engage in respectful and meaningful conversations: When interacting with other users (female or otherwise), always maintain a respectful and friendly attitude. Share your thoughts and opinions, but also be open to learning from others and receiving different perspectives. 5. Join Quora Spaces: Quora has various topic-specific communities known as Spaces. By joining relevant Spaces, you'll have more opportunities to encounter and interact with people (including females) who share your interests. 6. Be patient and genuine: Building friendships takes time, especially online. Avoid being overtly pushy or desperate in your interactions. Show genuine interest in other users' thoughts and opinions, and allow the development of friendships to occur naturally. In conclusion, while the two questions are different in their scope, they both deal with the broader theme of emotional support and building connections in a middle-aged, single, and separated man's life. It's essential to remember that emotional support can come from various sources, including friends, family, professionals, or even new connections made online."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"An elderly man is cooking hotdogs outside.\\", does it logically follow that \\"An old man is cooking hotdogs on a grill.\\"?","completion":"It can be reasonably inferred that \\"An old man is cooking hotdogs on a grill.\\" given the original statement, \\"An elderly man is cooking hotdogs outside.\\" However, there is not enough information provided to say definitively that the two statements are logically equivalent. Let's break down the two statements and analyze the differences: 1. \\"An elderly man is cooking hotdogs outside.\\" 2. \\"An old man is cooking hotdogs on a grill.\\" Statement 1: - \\"Elderly man\\" refers to a man of advanced age, implying that the person is in a later stage of their life. - \\"Cooking hotdogs\\" suggests that the man is preparing hotdogs using some sort of heat source. It does not specifically mention the method he is using for cooking (e.g., grill, stovetop, open fire, etc.). - \\"Outside\\" indicates that this activity is taking place in an outdoor setting. Statement 2: - \\"Old man\\" is synonymous with \\"elderly man,\\" both descriptors referring to a man of advanced age. - \\"Cooking hotdogs\\" again suggests that the man is preparing hotdogs using a heat source. - \\"On a grill\\" provides more detail about the method of cooking being used, specifying that the hotdogs are being cooked on a grill. Based on these dissections, we can see that both statements describe a man of advanced age cooking hotdogs, so the subject and action in both sentences are essentially the same. However, the difference emerges in the specificity of the cooking method and location details. The first statement merely indicates that the cooking takes place outside, while the second statement specifies that it's being done on a grill. It is quite common for outdoor cooking to involve the use of a grill, so the second statement could be a reasonable inference from the first statement. Nevertheless, there are other outdoor cooking methods, like using a stovetop burner or roasting hotdogs over an open fire, so it is not an absolute certainty that the elderly man is grilling hotdogs. In conclusion, it is plausible and likely that \\"An old man is cooking hotdogs on a grill,\\" based on the original statement. Yet, without explicit confirmation, we cannot establish a direct logical equivalence between the two statements. Consequently, more information is required to determine the cooking method the elderly man is using outside with certainty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What position did the man that Hammer and Mazzoli rescue have during their training? Answer the above question based on the context below: Lawrence Hammer and Dean Mazzoli are two Naval Officers undergoing the rigorous and demanding Navy BUD/s training program. Both men quest to become Navy SEALs. During the training Hammer is shown as cocky and not a true team player. Mazzoli is a natural leader who is respected by the other trainees. The two men clash over time due to Hammer's attitude making a bad name for everyone. The two men's feud eventually is seen by the training instructs and after being punished in a \\"military manner\\" the two become friends. On liberty Mazzoli takes an interest in Barbara, a known love interest and friend of Hammer's. Barbara and Mazzoli share a romantic moment under a capsized canoe but Mazzoli breaks away before anything further happens knowing that his friend Hammer has been \\"with\\" her for a while. Later that night Hammer and Barbara elope and Mazzoli is shocked but accepts the marriage. The two finish their BUD/s training and Mazzoli informs Hammer that he is completing his SDV training on the East Coast, not the West Coast as Hammer will be doing.

Middle Ages In the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks took over much of the Middle East, occupying Persia during the 1040s, Armenia in the 1060s, and Jerusalem in 1070. In 1071, the Turkish army defeated the Byzantine army at the Battle of Manzikert and captured the Byzantine Emperor Romanus IV (r. 1068–71). The Turks were then free to invade Asia Minor, which dealt a dangerous blow to the Byzantine Empire by seizing a large part of its population and its economic heartland. Although the Byzantines regrouped and recovered somewhat, they never fully regained Asia Minor and were often on the defensive. The Turks also had difficulties, losing control of Jerusalem to the Fatimids of Egypt and suffering from a series of internal civil wars. The Byzantines also faced a revived Bulgaria, which in the late 12th and 13th centuries spread throughout the Balkans.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? The Alexandrov Ensemble (Russian: Ansambl' Aleksandrova, tr. Ansambl' Aleksandrova; commonly known as the Red Army Choir in the West) is an official army choir of the Russian armed forces. Founded during the Soviet era, the ensemble consists of a male choir, an orchestra, and a dance ensemble. In 1948 much of Berlin was still ruined after World War II, and the city was divided into four occupation zones, controlled by the USSR, France, the UK and the United States. This was before the Berlin Wall was built, and it was still possible to travel between zones. An American officer suggested a concert in the Gendarmenmarkt (in the Soviet zone at the time), and the French zone commander supported the suggestion. The musicians were to be provided by the USSR, and the Alexandrov Ensemble was chosen. A temporary stage was set up in the square, with flowers all along the front. 30,000 people came to stand and watch for three hours. In 1994, towards the end of his life, Boris Alexandrov said: \\"The visit to Germany was unforgettable. It is dominant in the history of the ensemble. It was necessary to make a new creative leap - from wartime military music to postwar relaxing harmony. It was important, and the transition had to be managed on many fronts, including getting the Ensemble back into its original pre-war role, performing the classics and singing folk songs. Before the war the Ensemble had 200 professional singers; following the war it was down to 60.\\" A previous tour to East Germany had been cancelled due to the sudden death of Alexander Alexandrov in 1946 in Potsdam, when in his bed was found an annotated copy of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, showing that A. Alexandrov had been preparing the final chorus for a performance. Now Boris, his son, was ready to follow his father's plan. The 1948 peace concert was to consist of German opera extracts and Russian folk songs (Nightingales, Zemlyanka and Roads); and after an intervention by the tenor Victor Nikitin, some German folk songs were also included. The people joined in, singing Heidenroslein, and Nikitin sang Kalinka three times in a row. The concert was very successful, and very moving. A sound recording of the concert was made, and pressed in 1985 under the Radio DDR 1 label. This is listed on the Alexandrov Ensemble discography page. However the Berlin Peace Concert did not happen in isolation. It was part of a series of punishing yearly tours to war-torn areas. The main tour season during and just after World War II appears to have run from June to October - perhaps because the large troupe usually had to perform outdoors, to accommodate large audiences. The August 1948 Berlin concert occurred two-thirds of the way through a tour to (20 June to 18 July) Prague, Most, Brno, Devin, Bratislava, Moravska Ostrava, Zilina and Kosice in Czechoslovakia; then apparently without a break (18 July to 10 October) Dresden, Weimar, Magdeburg, Stendal, Schwerin, Potsdam, Berlin, Rathenow, Leipzig, Halle, Lane, Erfurt, Chemnitz, Frankfurt an der Oder and Schwarzenberg in Germany. In 1990, the ensemble participated in Roger Waters' The Wall concert celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall. They performed an anti-war song, Bring the Boys Back Home.

I feel a touch guilty that I'm up there. But it's all right, that happens.\\" Rolling Stone: John Lennon and Yoko Ono's final years together. Producers have been remixing tracks from Ono's deep catalog of avant-garde music for the past decade. \\"At first I was prejudiced against the idea,\\" she says. \\"I had the pride of a rocker. People can get very elitist very quickly, and that's how I was.\\" When she was first approached about remixing \\"Walking On Thin Ice\\" she was especially resistant because that was the song John Lennon was working on when he died. \\"I was like, 'No, never! Don't change anything!'\\" she says. \\"It was a very sensitive subject for me.\\" Rolling Stone: Yoko Ono's Plastic Ono Band concert with Lady Gaga, Iggy Pop and more. About 10 years ago she relented and allowed a variety of artists -- from Pet Shop Boys to Basement Jaxx to Felix Da Housecat -- to create dance remixes of her work for the albums Open Your Box and Yes, I'm A Witch. \\"When I first heard the songs I cried they was so beautiful,\\" she says. \\"I was so dumb to be against it. Musically, it was as very, very rich experience for me to hear it.\\" The album was a critical and commercial success, leading to the release of Move On Fast (The Remixes), which hits shelves on March 12th. The set features remixes of her catalog by Richard Morel, Digital Dog, Wawa, Chris The Greek and many more. \\"I never thought I would go into the dance charts,\\" says Yoko. \\"I respect these producers so much now. I think one day the dance field is going to be very important musically. I mean, it's a high art now...I just feel great that people are dancing. I great and I feel it.\\" Ono rarely steps foot into a dance club, even though many of them now regularly play her music. \\"I did go to a few clubs just so people can be like, 'Yes, Yoko was there!\\" she says. \\"But it does get a bit nerve wracking to go to those places. I would love to be dancing every night until dawn, but somehow it's not conducive for my life right now.\\" See the original article on RollingStone.com.

Ono's dance remixes are created by artists such as Pet Shop Boys, Basement Jaxx, and Felix Da Housecat for albums like Open Your Box and Yes, I'm A Witch. Initially resistant to remixing her tracks, Ono ultimately embraced the idea after hearing her songs as dance music and acknowledges the potential of the dance music field to become increasingly significant in the music industry. Move On Fast (The Remixes) was released on March 12th and features remixes from a range of producers, including Richard Morel, Digital Dog, Wawa, and Chris The Greek. Although Ono is not known to frequent dance clubs, she expresses her happiness that people dance to her music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? plotting and mindless Choices: A). negative; B). positive;","completion":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"plotting and mindless\\" can be considered as A). negative. This assertion is based on the examination of both words in the sentence: 1. Plotting: This term might have a negative connotation, as it often implies the act of planning or conniving something evil or harmful. People engaging in plotting schemes are often perceived to harbor ill intentions and are possibly seeking personal gains at the expense of others. However, in some contexts, this word may be somewhat neutral, as it can imply strategizing, planning, or outlining the actions needed to achieve a specific goal. Overall, though, the act of plotting generally has a negative undertone. 2. Mindless: This adjective clearly has a negative connotation, as it denotes a lack of thought, attention, or consideration. Mindless actions or behaviors are void of reason or logic, which often leads to negative outcomes that may affect the individual or the people around them. Given the negative connotations of both words in the sentence, one can infer that the sentiment conveyed is negative.

A burst of hiring in December pushed the U.S. unemployment rate to its lowest level in nearly three years, giving the economy a boost at the end of 2011. A construction worker directs a steel hoist at the foundation of a new condo complex in Sunrise, Fla., Thursday, Jan. 5, 2012. A burst of hiring in December pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest... (Associated Press) A construction worker installs trusses on a new addition at Chardon Hills Elementary School Thursday, Jan. 5, 2012, in Euclid, Ohio. A burst of hiring in December pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest... (Associated Press) The Labor Department said Friday that employers added a net 200,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate fell to 8.5 percent, the lowest since February 2009. The rate has dropped for four straight months. The hiring gains cap a six-month stretch in which the economy generated 100,000 jobs or more in each month. That hasn't happened since April 2006. The steady drop is a positive sign for President Barack Obama, who is bound to face voters with the highest unemployment rate of any sitting president since World War II. Unemployment was 7.8 percent when Obama took office in January 2009. Still, the level may matter less to his re-election chances if the rate continues to fall. History suggests that presidents' re-election prospects hinge less on the unemployment rate itself than on the rate's direction during the year or two before Election Day. For all of 2011, the economy added 1.6 million jobs, better than the 940,000 added in 2010. The unemployment rate averaged 8.9 percent last year, down from 9.6 percent the previous year. Economists forecast that the job gains will top 2.1 million this year. The December report painted a picture of a broadly improving job market. Average hourly pay rose, providing consumers with more income to spend. The average work week lengthened, a sign that business is picking up and companies may soon need more workers. And hiring was strong across almost all major industries. Manufacturing added 23,000 jobs. Transportation and warehousing added 50,000 jobs. Retailers added 28,000 jobs. Even the beleaguered construction industry added 17,000 workers. A more robust hiring market coincides with other positive data that show the economy ended the year with some momentum. Weekly applications for unemployment benefits have fallen to levels last seen more than three years ago. Holiday sales were solid. And November and December were the strongest months of 2011 for U.S. auto sales. Many businesses say they are ready to step up hiring in early 2012 after seeing stronger consumer confidence and greater demand for their products. ||||| The U.S. job market strengthened in the second half of 2011, and December is expected to cap a solid finish. Economists forecast that employers added a net 150,000 jobs last month, according to a survey by Factset. They also predict that the unemployment rate ticked up to 8.7 percent from 8.6 percent, which was the lowest rate since March 2009. The Labor Department will issue the December jobs report at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time (1330 GMT) Friday. The projected hiring gains would mark a six-month stretch in which the economy generated 100,000 jobs or more in each month. The last time that happened was in April 2006 _ more than a year and a half before the country plunged into the Great Recession. President Barack Obama still could face voters in November with the highest unemployment rate of a sitting president seeking election since World War II. Unemployment was 7.8 percent when Obama took office in January 2009. But Obama could benefit if the unemployment rate continues to dip. History suggests that presidents' re-election prospects depend less on the unemployment rate itself than on the rate's direction during the year or two before Election Day. A more robust hiring market would coincide with other positive data that show the economy ended the year with some momentum. Weekly applications for unemployment benefits have fallen to levels last seen more than three years ago. Holiday sales were solid. And November and December were the strongest months of 2011 for U.S. auto sales. Many businesses say they are ready to increase hiring in early 2012 after seeing stronger consumer confidence and greater demand for their products. Even the projected increase in the unemployment rate could be a positive sign. The rate is expected to rise as more people feel better about their chances to find employment and resume job searches. The government counts out-of-work people as unemployed only if they are looking for work. The government uses a survey of mostly large companies and government agencies to determine how many jobs were added or lost each month. It uses a separate survey of households to determine the unemployment rate. The household survey picks up hiring by companies of all sizes, including small businesses and companies just getting off the ground. It also includes farm workers and the self-employed, who aren't included in the survey of companies. The household survey has shown an average of 321,000 jobs created per month since July, compared with an average of 13,000 the first seven months of the year. When the economy is either improving or slipping into recession, many economists say, the household survey does the better job of picking up the shift because it detects small business hiring. Economists surveyed by the Associated Press project that the economy will generate an average of 175,000 jobs per month this year. That would be a step up from average monthly gains of 130,000 last year and 78,000 in 2010. The pickup in hiring reflects some modest improvement in the economy. Growth will likely top 3 percent at an annual rate in the final three months of this year, economists expect. That would be a sharp improvement over the 1.8 percent growth in the July-September quarter. Even so, many economists forecast that growth could slow to roughly 2 percent this year. Europe is almost certain to fall into recession because of its financial troubles. And without more jobs and higher incomes, consumers may have to cut back on spending. That could drag on growth in 2012. ||||| National Archives Yes, it’s that time again, folks.

(AP) — A driver was forced to gun his engine and jump a drawbridge that began rising as he crossed it with his family. Terence Naphys, of West Deptford Township, had paid the toll to cross the Middle Thorofare Bridge with three family members in his vehicle on Aug. 1. The bridge links Cape May with the Wildwoods near the Jersey shore. As he was crossing the steel grate, it began to rise 3 to 6 feet (0.9 to 1.8 meters) because a vessel was trying to cross, police said. \\"My wife said, 'I think the bridge is opening,'\\" Terence Naphys told KYW-TV in Philadelphia. \\"He accelerated, and of course then we landed with a big impact on the concrete on the side,\\" said Jackie Naphys. Police said the landing caused minor damage to his vehicle. No one was hurt. Authorities said the operator of the bridge was to blame for the scare. \\"An employee for the Cape May County Bridge Commission stated that a large vessel was approaching the bridge and they had no contact with that vessel due to their radio being down,\\" police said in their report. The bridge tender told police he activated the bridge's lights and gates in anticipation that all vehicles would be clear. However, he wasn't sure because of sun glare. Terence Naphys said he would never cross the bridge again. ||||| One father is describing one night in August as \\"terrifying.\\" That night, his family was caught in a drawbridge accident when the bridge started to open. NBC10's Cydney Long spoke to the family about the ordeal. A family heading to Cape May, New Jersey, found themselves in an improbable situation earlier this month when a drawbridge lifted right underneath their car and they were forced to jump the opening. Terence Naphys, after paying the 1.50 toll at the Middle Thorofare Bridge that connects the Wildwoods and Cape May via Ocean Drive, was heading across the bridge when a steel metal grate suddenly lifted 3 to 6 feet underneath his car, Naphys told Lower Township police. Naphys was in the car with his wife, his daughter and his daughter's friend, and he was worried his Toyota RAV4 would fall the 65 feet down into the water. So he accelerated and jumped the gap. \\"It's scary what's going through your mind,\\" said the New Jersey resident. \\"We could have all landed in the water.\\" Family Forced to Jump Over Opening Drawbridge A New Jersey family was driving across a Cape May County drawbridge when it opened in front of them. They were forced to jump the gap. (Published Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017) The car landed on the other side of the bridge and the family was able to drive away without any injuries. But Naphys said his SUV sustained 10,000 in damage that included a bent suspension. A commercial fishing vessel was trying to pass under the bridge, and its radio communication was down, officials said. The bridge operator could not contact the large boat. The operator later told police he was blinded by a sun glare when he checked the bridge for cars, expecting Naphys' vehicle to clear in time. The bridge was built in 1940 and needs as much as 200 million in repairs and renovations, according to Cape May County officials. Investigators said the incident was an operator error and is under investigation by the Cape May County Bridge Commission. Naphys isn't sure when he'll have the courage to cross a bridge again. Lessie Brown, Believed to Be Oldest American, Dies at 114 Lessie Brown of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, died at the age of 114, according to family members.

Answer the above question based on the context below: During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all.

Credit: CDC/Debora Cartagena As swimsuit season wanes and the holiday season edges closer, Americans everywhere should take a moment to enjoy the current state of their waistline. For the average person, the time just before the start of the holiday season is the low point in an annual weight gain pattern that peaks during the holidays and takes nearly half a year to fully shed. New research findings published Sept. 27 in the New England Journal of Medicine by Cornell Food and Brand Lab Director Brian Wansink and colleagues from Tampere University of Technology of Finland analyze the wireless weigh-ins of nearly 3,000 individuals in three countries. In the U.S., weight patterns begin rising at Thanksgiving and peak around Christmas and New Year's. \\"We found that in the U.S., it isn't until after Easter, about a five-month period, that weight patterns even out,\\" said Wansink, \\"Chances are, right now most Americans are at their lowest weight of the year.\\" The trend among the 1,781 American participants indicated a weight bump of 0.2 percent during Thanksgiving, and another 0.4 percent at Christmas. It takes about five months to lose those holiday pounds, with weights typically stabilizing from May to November before the cycle begins anew. The study used scales that sent data over a Wi-Fi connection rather than requiring participants to self-report or visit a testing site for weigh-ins. The researchers also analyzed yearly weight patterns of 760 German and 383 Japanese participants. Similar to their American counterparts, those in Germany weigh the most around Christmas, while those in Japan weigh the most during Golden Week, four major holidays in the spring. Each country also showed a peak in weight gain at New Year's. \\"Everyone gains weight over the holidays – Americans, Germans, Japanese,\\" said Wansink. But, he said, an annual holiday ritual repeated at the start of the season could go a long way. \\"Instead of making a New Year's resolution, make an October resolution,\\" Wansink said. \\"It's easier to avoid holiday pounds than to lose them after they happen.\\" Explore further: Around the world, holidays bring added pounds More information: Elina E. Helander et al. Weight Gain over the Holidays in Three Countries, New England Journal of Medicine (2016). DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc1602012 ||||| Thanks Jennifer. We are looking forward to working with you. We will be in touch Your account has been created ||||| This image shows how people's average weights in three countries — Japan, the United States and Germany — changed over a one-year period. Holiday weight gain isn't unique to the United States: A new analysis finds that people in Germany and Japan also pack on pounds during festive seasons. But unlike Americans, who gain a lot of weight during Thanksgiving, people in other countries put on pounds at other \\"celebratory\\" times of the year, according to the study. In the study, which was published today (Sept. 21) in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers gave wireless digital scales to nearly 3,000 participants in Germany, Japan and the United States. [11 Surprising Things That Can Make Us Gain Weight] Over 12 months starting on Aug. 1, 2012, the people in the study weighed themselves each day. At the end of the study period, the researchers used the scale data to calculate how each participant's weight changed over the course of the year, compared to their starting weights. People in all three countries gained weight, on average, around Christmas, according to the study. Specifically, people's weight went up in the 10 days after Christmas compared to the 10 days before Christmas, the researchers found. People's average weights also increased around national holidays in their countries. In Japan, for example, there was an increase in weight during a holiday period called Golden Week, which takes place around the beginning of May. In addition, Germans saw a sharp uptick in weight around Easter, and Americans around Thanksgiving, the researchers found. But the largest gains were over the Christmas-New Year holiday season, according to the study. During this time, the Germans in the study gained an average of 1.8 lbs. (0.8 kilograms); the Americans gained an average of 1.3 lbs. (0.6 kg); and the Japanese gained an average of 1.1 lbs. (0.5 kg). The investigators, led by Elina Helander, a personal health informatics researcher at Tampere University of Technology in Finland, noted that shortly after the holidays, people shed about half of their holiday weight gain; however, the other half appears to remain until the summer or beyond. To help people avoid gaining weight during this time of year, one approach is to advise patients to have better self-control over the holidays, the researchers wrote. \\"The less one gains, the less one then has to worry about trying to lose it,\\" they wrote. Originally published on Live Science. ||||| Data obtained from 2924 persons by means of wireless scales show significant increases in weight over the Christmas holidays. Weights also increased in Japan during Golden Week, in Germany over Easter, and in the United States over Thanksgiving. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has analyzed the wireless weigh-ins of nearly 3,000 people in the US, Germany, and Japan, and has shown that, on average, people gain weight around the holiday season, such as Christmas and New Year, with patterns beginning to rise around those specific holidays. It takes an average of five months for Americans to lose their holiday weight (Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year), typically stabilizing from May to November before starting the cycle again.

The true cost of Britain’s military operations since the Cold War could be as high as £72billion. Most of it has been squandered on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan seen as ‘strategic failures’, claims a respected defence think-tank. Toppling Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein helped radicalise young Muslims in the UK, said the Royal United Services Institute. Taken down: Toppling Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein helped radicalise young Muslims in the UK, said the Royal United Services Institute. A statue of him is pulled down (above) in Baghdad in an iconic image from April 2003. Far from reducing international terrorism, the Iraq war ‘had the effect of promoting it’. It had left Britain open to homegrown attacks such as the July 7 London bombings in 2005. The authoritative study, Wars In Peace, was published as Tony Blair provoked criticism by urging the West to do more to tackle Islamic extremism. Critics said the cost of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and sending thousands of troops to Helmand province in Afghanistan in 2006 - around £30billion and 627 lives lost - was simply not worth the results. Last night John Miller, 63, the father of Royal Military policeman Corporal Simon Miller, who was murdered by a mob in Iraq in 2003, said: ‘It is disgusting. ‘What have we actually achieved by spending that kind of money and losing that many troops’ lives in those conflicts?

Death: The father of Royal Military policeman Cpl Simon Miller (pictured), who was murdered by a mob in Iraq in 2003, branded the losses 'disgusting' This included £20.6billion in Afghanistan and £9.6billion during the Iraq war - 84 per cent of the total. Another £1.5billion was spent in Bosnia and £1.1billion in Kosovo on peacekeeping missions and £238million on the war in Libya. The figures do not include what the Armed Forces would have been spending on usual running costs such as training exercises, fuel, accommodation and pay. The study also estimates another £30billion may have to be spent on long-term care for war veterans and compensation payments for deaths and injuries could add another £7billion - bringing the total cost to £71.7billion. In the study, military analysts said the UK had succeeded in six out of ten major military operations - but failed in four. Interventions in the first Gulf War, Sierra Leone in 2000 and the start of operations in Afghanistan in 2001 which drove out Al Qaeda and the Taliban leadership were among those praised. But the UK failed in Bosnia in the early 1990s, the 2003 invasion in Iraq, the deployment of troops to the insurgents’ stronghold of Helmand and the air strikes in Libya which helped oust Colonel Gaddafi but fuelled a brutal civil war. RUSI’s most scathing criticism is reserved for the Iraq deployment. It said: ‘Far from reducing international terrorism... the invasion had the effect of promoting it. ‘The rise of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) was a reaction to this invasion, and to the consequent marginalisation of Iraq’s Sunni population. Claim: The RISI said the true cost of Britain's military operations since the Cold War could be as high as £72billion, and most of it has been squandered on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan seen as 'strategic failures' ‘Today, AQAP and other radical jihadist groups stretching across the Iraqi-Syrian border, pose new terrorist threats to the UK and its allies that might not have existed, at least in this form, had Saddam remained in power.’ 'Far from reducing international terrorism... the invasion had the effect of promoting it' Royal United Services Institute. Sir David Omand, former senior security and intelligence adviser to Mr Blair, said that the term ‘War on Terror’ may have ‘helped to create the sense of an inevitable conflict between the west and the world of Islam’. However, he said Britain was now a safer place than at the time of the September 11 attacks on the US. The study said military action in Iraq and Afghanistan had dented the reputation of the Armed Forces and reduced the appetite for further overseas interventions. The failure of Parliament to vote for operations against Syria last year took place ‘in the shadow of Iraq’, said RUSI. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft. The next morning, Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias's lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy but cannot get them off of Mathias.

Allow the water to boil on medium-high heat. Hypothesis: You would first put the meat in a big pot so you can then put lots of water in it","completion":"Based on the provided context, we can draw the following detailed hypothesis regarding the initial steps of preparing buffalo chicken macaroni and cheese: In order to prepare buffalo chicken macaroni and cheese, one of the primary steps involves cooking the chicken breasts. It is recommended to use a large saucepan for this purpose. The size of the saucepan is important because it has to be spacious enough to accommodate both the chicken breasts and an adequate amount of water, which will play a significant role in the cooking process. The larger saucepan not only ensures that there is enough room for the meat but also allows the water to circulate and cook the chicken evenly. The process starts by positioning the chicken breasts at the bottom of the saucepan. It is essential to use cold water in this step, as it ensures that the chicken gets heated evenly, reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses and producing a consistent and high-quality dish. The amount of water added to the saucepan is crucial to cook the chicken sufficiently. The correct ratio should cover the chicken breasts by approximately an inch of water as it allows for even distribution of heat and proper cooking. This also helps avoid undercooking or overcooking the chicken, to get a tender and juicy result. Once the chicken and water are combined in the saucepan, the heat should be adjusted to medium-high, allowing the water to reach boiling point. This will facilitate proper cooking without drying out the chicken. It is essential to monitor the process to prevent overcooking, as it might lead to a less desirable texture and flavor in the final dish. In conclusion, the hypothesis that suggests placing the meat in a large saucepan and filling it with sufficient cold water is accurate and well-founded. This approach provides the best cooking conditions for the chicken breasts, ensuring that they are cooked evenly and achieve a tender, juicy texture that adds to the overall quality and flavor of the buffalo chicken macaroni and cheese."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The duo share a coach, but apart from that their stories could not be more different. The 40-year-old Bjorn was able to tee off at Royal St. George's -- where he blew his best chance of winning a major title in 2003 after squandering a four-shot lead on the last day -- only after several players pulled out, including Tiger Woods and lastly Vijay Singh on Monday. \\"When we started, I heard a lot of shouts like, 'Come on Tom' but I suspect they might have been for the other OPTIONS: - Bjorn, not me. - British Open, not me. - CNN, not me. - Danish, not me. - English, not me. - Rory McIlroy, not me. - Royal St. George's, not me. - Sandwich, not me. - Thomas Bjorn, not me. - Tiger Woods, not me. - Tom Lewis, not me. - U.S. Open, not me. - Vijay Singh, not me.","completion":"Tom Lewis, not me.

As Brian meticulously and lovingly tended to Christopher's garden, he couldn't help but smile at the sight of the thriving plants, the vibrant colors of the flowers, and the intoxicating scent that permeated the air. This was his sanctuary, his escape from the everyday stresses and chaos of life, a place where he could truly be at peace with himself and with nature. Christopher, on the other hand, had always been more of an admirer of gardens rather than a cultivator. He loved to sit on his porch with a cup of tea, taking in the beauty and serenity of his garden, but he never quite grasped the extensive amount of work and dedication it took to maintain such a picturesque scene. This is why he was eternally grateful for his friendship with Brian. Brian and Christopher had been friends for years, ever since they were kids playing in the neighborhood. As both their lives became increasingly busy with careers and family, they found that their love for tending and admiring gardens, respectively, was a way for them to stay connected and support each other. Brian would frequently lend a hand in keeping Christopher's garden pristine and flourishing, while Christopher provided a listening ear and unwavering support in all aspects of Brian's life. That particular afternoon, as Brian carefully removed the weeds from around the tender stems of Christopher's prized roses, he noticed a beautiful butterfly perched on one of the petals. Its wings fluttered gently in the breeze, and a small smile graced Brian's face as he took a moment to appreciate the simple joy of that moment. He loved how gardening had a way of grounding him and connecting him to the small miracles of the natural world. Meanwhile, Christopher watched from his porch, sipping his tea and feeling a sense of gratitude and pride swell in his chest as he gazed at the beautiful garden that he and Brian had nurtured together. He knew that while he may not have the greenest of thumbs, he could always count on Brian to guide him in his horticultural journey. As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the perfectly tended garden, Brian and Christopher sat together on the porch, discussing their favorite plants and flowers, exchanging stories and laughter, and soaking in the simple pleasures that the garden and their friendship provided. In those peaceful moments, as the two friends shared the beauty of their shared labor, it was clear that their bond was far more than just a love for gardening. Their connection transcended the garden itself, as they knew that regardless of what life threw their way, they would always have each other's backs, just as they had supported each other in caring for that little plot of paradise they had cultivated together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This may be one of the hardest decisions voters have to make between two appealing candidates. The big question for voters, as they face both an economic downturn and international threats, is: who will they elect? A young first-term senator promising change and new ideas, or a longtime senator with strong military experience and a reputation as a maverick ? American voters have never seen a candidate quite like Obama. He has a white mother from theprefix = st1 /USand a black father fromKenyawho left the family when Obama was very young. He spent part of his youth inIndonesia. His supporters say Obama's childhood gives him the advantage to repair the recent damage done toAmerica's image abroad. His opponents focus on his inexperience, noting he hasn't finished his first term in the Senate. However, McCain has a very different life story. He grew up in a Navy family and was a pilot during the Vietnam War in the 1960s. When Obama was in kindergarten in Indonesia, McCain's plane was shot down overVietnamand he became a prisoner of war.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Shelton for the following movie plot: Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler), a Philadelphia engineer, witnesses the rape and murder of both his wife and five-year old daughter at the hands of two burglars who break in his house: Clarence J. Darby (Christian Stolte) and accomplice Rupert Ames (Josh Stewart), leaving Shelton emotionally scarred. He is told by career-minded prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) that the case was compromised by a bungled forensic investigation and Shelton's testimony cannot incriminate either man because he blacked out during the incident. Rice, interested in maintaining his 96% conviction rate, makes a secret deal with Darby: in return for pleading guilty to third-degree murder, he will provide testimony that will send Ames to death row for what is, essentially, a robbery charge. Shelton is left feeling betrayed.Ten years later. Ames is executed via lethal injection. Due to an alteration in the chemicals, he dies in agonizing pain. Initial evidence leads to Darby, who is alerted to approaching police by a mysterious caller who tells him where a pistol he can use to his advantage is. The caller tells him if he wants to escape the police, he will come to where he is. At the meeting place, Darby realizes that the caller and his savior is none other then Shelton. Darby tries to shoot him with the pistol, only to be discover it is a trick gun, injecting him with tetrodotoxin, paralyzing him, but leaving him fully conscious. After restraining him and making preparations to ensure his prolonged awareness, Shelton slowly tortures and dismembers Darby, saying the words Darby told him 10 years before: \\"You can't fight fate.\\" It is later revealed that Darby was found in 25 pieces, and after an investigation, Rice and his team suspect Shelton.The next day, a local SWAT unit bursts into Shelton's house to find him waiting for them, and he doesn't resist arrest.

Brantley: I'm fine and u? Allen: Hungover like shit haha Brantley: I supposed so What was going on in that conversation?","completion":"In this conversation: 1. Allen starts the conversation by asking Brantley how he is. This is a common way to initiate a casual conversation and show interest in the other person's well-being. Reasoning: Asking \\"How are you?\\" is a basic conversation opener and a way to express care for the other person. 2. Brantley responds by sharing that he is fine and asks Allen how he is doing in return. This is a common way to reciprocate the question and keep the conversation going. Reasoning: Responding and asking the same question back is a way to show mutual interest and engage in the conversation. 3. Allen shares that he is feeling hungover and not well. Sharing this information provides context for how Allen might be feeling at the moment and opens up the conversation for more personal or relatable topics. Reasoning: By revealing his hungover state, Allen is being open and honest about his current condition which potentially creates a more informal or intimate conversation. 4. Brantley responds by saying that he supposed so. This response might indicate that Brantley was already aware or had an idea of Allen's situation, possibly based on previous conversations or events they both attended.

News article: A woman who said she worked for Donald Sterling filed a lawsuit Monday alleging that the embattled Los Angeles Clippers owner fired her after she refused to have sex with him and repeatedly made racist and sexist remarks in her presence. Maiko Maya King said that she was subjected to a \\"steady stream of racially and sexually offensive comments\\" by Sterling and that she was in a \\"romantic relationship\\" with him from 2005 until 2011, according to the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. ------------ FOR THE RECORD: An earlier version of this post said that in December 2013 Sterling introduced King to \\"V.\\" The time frame is not that specific. ------------ \\"He supported her financially and she worked for him and his foundation,\\" the lawsuit said. Attorney Bobby Samini, who is representing Sterling, said in an email Monday night that the allegations are \\"completely baseless.\\" Photos Clippers fans, players and others react to Donald Sterling's comments \\"Anyone objectively reviewing Ms. King's claims will have no doubt that they are without merit,\\" Samini said. King said Sterling made racist remarks about her former husband, who is African American and the father of her two children. The lawsuit alleges that Sterling asked King, \\"How could you be married to a black man?\\" and referenced her children by saying, \\"Why would you bring black people into the world?\\" The lawsuit, filed by attorney Gloria Allred, is seeking unspecified general and compensatory damages, as well as attorney fees. King says that Sterling told her in December 2013 that he needed her to be his personal assistant and caretaker. During that time, according to the lawsuit, Sterling introduced King to \\"V.\\" King later learned that V. \\"was his girlfriend\\" and \\"no longer wanted an intimate relationship with Mr. Sterling,\\" the lawsuit said. King said Sterling had agreed to pay her 10,000 a month but \\"dangled money only if she would have sex with him.\\" \\"He confided in her that he had difficulty having sexual relations and that he was bored with V.,\\" according to the lawsuit. King also alleges Sterling made racist comments about Latinos. \\"Mexicans just do drive by shootings,\\" the lawsuit claims Sterling said. Sterling, 80, is locked in a legal battle with the NBA, which is seeking to terminate his ownership of the Clippers. NBA Commissioner Alan Silver fined Sterling 2.5 million, banned him for life from the league and launched the process to end his ownership of the franchise after the public release in April of audio recordings in which Sterling made disparaging comments about African Americans. On Friday, the NBA announced a settlement with Shelly Sterling and the Sterling Family Trust that would allow the team to be sold to former Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer. A vote of the league Board of Governors will be needed to finalize the sale. But minutes before the NBA statement on the matter, Donald Sterling filed a lawsuit against Silver and the league in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. The lawsuit alleges that the NBA committed antitrust violations, breached contracts and denied his constitutional rights. ||||| Maiko Maya King claims in a lawsuit that she was in a relationship with the Clippers owner from 2005 to 2011, and was later fired after objecting to a \\"stream of racially and sexually offensive comments\\" by Sterling. Donald Sterling's legal issues aren't just with the NBA: A former employee is claiming racial discrimination and sexual harassment in a lawsuit that was filed with the Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday. Maiko Maya King claims to have been in a romantic relationship with the 80-year-old Clippers owner from 2005 to 2011, and says that she was later subjected to \\"a steady stream of racially and sexually offensive comments\\" when she was employed by him, according to the lawsuit. Read the complaint here. STORY: Donald Sterling Plans 1 Billion Lawsuit Against NBA King was married at the time that she met Sterling, and claims that he continually encouraged her to leave her husband and come work for him. King, who is represented by Gloria Allred, claims that two years after she split up with Sterling in 2011, she began working for him. While he supported her financially and she worked for his foundation during their relationship, he also allegedly made comments about her African-American husband, including, \\"How could you be married to a black man?\\" and \\"Why would you bring black people into the world?\\" STORY: L.A. Clippers Sold to Steve Ballmer for 2 Billion Referring to his relationship with King, he said, \\"I want to take you out of the black world and put you into the white world\\"; when they would fight he told her to \\"move back to the ghetto with a black man.\\" According to the complaint, after their 2011 breakup and the death of her father in 2013, King became his personal assistant and caretaker. He agreed to pay her 10,000 a month, a 100,000 bonus at the end of the year plus provide a house and car, claims King. During that time she was introduced to V. Stiviano as Sterling's girlfriend. King goes on to claim that Sterling \\"dangled money only if she would have sex with him,\\" that he was \\"bored with V\\" and would give her bonuses if she could \\"help him to perform sexually.\\" VIDEO: Donald Sterling Slams Magic Johnson, Attacks AIDS Status, Calls Anderson Cooper a Racist Sterling continued, the lawsuit alleges, to spew racist venom: \\"Black people do not take care of their children.

Sue's heart raced as she tried to figure out where the unpleasant odor was coming from. She had always kept her room clean and tidy, so she was baffled by the sudden intrusion of something so foul. She cautiously stepped out of her bed and began to investigate, following the stench that seemed to permeate the entire room. As she made her way closer to her desk, the smell grew stronger and more unbearable. She could feel her stomach churning as she approached the source. Her eyes finally zeroed in on a cup she had earlier placed on her desk, and she could see that it was filled with a lumpy, foul-smelling liquid. To her horror, Sue realized that it was spoiled milk. She couldn't believe she had forgotten to put it back in the refrigerator after she had poured some for her cereal earlier that day. The summer heat had certainly made matters worse, causing the milk to spoil rapidly and release the horrible odor. Sue quickly retrieved some gloves and cleaning supplies from the kitchen, determined to remove the source of the smell and eliminate any lingering germs or bacteria. She carefully picked up the cup of spoiled milk, making sure not to spill any of the putrid liquid on the floor or her clothes. Holding her breath, Sue made her way to the bathroom, where she poured the spoiled milk down the drain and thoroughly rinsed out the cup with hot water and soap. After scrubbing the cup clean, she moved back to her room to clean the desk and any surrounding areas that might have been affected by the smell. Using disinfectant wipes, she wiped down the entire surface of her desk, focusing especially on the area where the cup had been sitting. She also cleaned any nearby items and surfaces, including her computer mouse, keyboard, and books. To further help eliminate the odor, Sue placed a few drops of essential oils on a cotton ball and strategically placed it near her desk. With the spoiled milk disposed of and the room now cleaned, Sue took a deep breath and was relieved to find that the terrible smell had vanished. She made a mental note to never leave dairy products unattended in her room again, vowing to always put them back in the refrigerator right away. Sue returned to bed, feeling both victorious and slightly embarrassed by the incident. As she drifted off to sleep, she reminded herself that everyone makes mistakes and that she had at least managed to handle the situation efficiently. She knew that she would be more mindful in the future to ensure that her room remained a clean and comfortable sanctuary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a title for this article: The man who tried to broker the sale of the video of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford smoking what appears to be crack cocaine has told CBC's the fifth estate that residents in the Dixon Road neighbourhood in northwest Toronto were approached by individuals who offered a \\"suitcase of money\\" for the video. \\"They were some people in the neighbourhood, I would say people that are in organized crime … that drove in and showed people [a] suitcase of money and said, 'Hey, look, whoever has the video, put them in contact with us. This is their cash, their money,'\\" Mohamed Farah told the fifth estate's Gillian Findlay in a report that will air for a second time Saturday at 8 p.m. ET on CBC News Network. Farah is a well-known community organizer in the Dixon Road neighbourhood, which has a reputation for gun crime and violence. In an extensive interview with the fifth estate, he said the men in \\"fancy cars\\" flashing cash came around soon after the Toronto Star broke the story of the video and after the U.S. gossip website Gawker, which had also been offered the video, started raising money on Kickstarter to buy it. Farah said that soon he started hearing that the offers to buy the video had turned into threats, coming from people he was told had close connections to the mayor. \\"There were phone calls coming in from people claiming to be ex-military, claiming to be a police officer, saying, 'Look, if you guys don't pass the video or find the video, we'll arrest you guys, or we'll have you guys executed or some crazy stuff like that,'\\" Farah told Findlay of the fifth estate. Mohammed Farah, a community organizer in the troubled Dixon Road neighbourhood in northwest Toronto, was approached by a man in January who wanted to sell the now infamous video of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford smoking what appears to be crack cocaine with several local men suspected of criminal involvement. He agreed to be a broker between the man, now known to be Mohamed Siad, and two media outlets, which viewed the video but did not purchase it. (CBC) Findlay: \\"There were threats made to people?\\" Farah: \\"There were actual threats made, yeah,yeah.\\" Findlay: \\"On behalf of the mayor's office?\\" Farah: \\"Yeah, on behalf of the mayor's, yeah.\\" Findlay: \\"They said they were calling on behalf of Rob Ford?\\" Farah himself, who is known in the neighbourhood as a peacemaker, had been approached in January by Mohammed Siad, an alleged dealer of drugs and guns who had the now infamous video and asked Farah to help him sell it. (Farah did not name Siad in the fifth estate interview, but the Toronto Star has reported that he was the man trying to sell the video to the paper with the help of a person the Star has to date only called \\"the broker.\\") Farah told the fifth estate Siad wanted to get money for the video so he and his girlfriend could leave the city and start a new life. “He showed me one video of Mayor Rob Ford. And when I seen that video, I was pretty shocked. I was taken back by it.\\" It wasn't until March, however, that Farah approached Star reporter Robyn Doolittle, who describes that first encounter in the fifth estate report. The Star refused to pay for the video but viewed its contents and described what was on it in an extensive published report. Farah said he doesn't know what happened to the video after that and that Siad disappeared the day the article came out. \\"The next day it was in the papers; that same night he left,\\" Farah told the fifth estate. Siad would later be arrested as part of the Project Traveller raids targeting a suspected drug and gun ring operated by the Dixon City Bloods gang and was stabbed in jail soon after his arrest. He faces numerous charges, including participating in a criminal organization, conspiracy and trafficking guns and cocaine. Farah was also swept up in the same police raids, carried out at several addresses in the Etobicoke and North York areas of Toronto. He was arrested after police found a gun in the home he shares with his mother. He was held for one night in detention and is now out on bail. He faces five charges as a result of that arrest, including possession of the proceeds of crime and several charges related to the possession and careless storage of an unauthorized firearm. His mother faces the same gun-related charges, but not the proceeds of crime charge. Farah does not have a previous criminal record, but his brother is known to police. Farah told the fifth estate the gun was found \\"rolled up in carpet or something\\" and that he doesn't know how it got into his house or who owns it. \\"People that know me know that I've never been one to carry a gun around,\\" he told the fifth estate. With regard to the behaviour that appears on the video Farah was asked to help sell, he told the fifth estate that while he has never personally seen Ford doing drugs, the mayor was a regular fixture in the Dixon Road neighbourhood that local residents reported seeing Ford consume drugs there on several occasions. Farah said that in 2011, Ford started to be seen hanging around 15 Windsor Rd., the house that would later feature in photos published by the Star that show Ford with three suspected gang members, one of them being Anthony Smith, who was gunned down outside a Toronto nightclub in March. Police have described the residence as a crack house. \\"I heard his [Ford's] name come up as someone that kinda hangs out once in a while … comes there, drives through, and watches the hockey game, has a few beers and jokes … with some of the guys in the house,\\" Farah told the fifth estate. \\"Last summer is when I heard the mayor does hardcore drugs — crack cocaine, for example.\\" If you have tips on this story please email fifth@cbc.ca Title:","completion":"\\"Man Tries to Sell Video of Mayor with Suitcase of Money\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pete was the night shift guy at Crossroads Detox across town. Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year.

Summarize the following: Keep the rinds on the fruit, as they will help flavor the drink later on. When choosing the amount of citrus, lean towards the oranges and use the lemon and limes lightly. Most people love to eat the fruit in the drink, but few people can handle a straight lemon or lime! The amount and variety of fruit you choose is up to you -- sangria is endlessly customizable. Again, remove any seeds so that people can munch on the fruit without worrying about breaking a molar. Furthermore, seeds are usually bitter, and can impact the final flavor. Muddling is simply beating the fruit up a bit with a wooden spoon. This releases sugars and flavors that will work their way into the sangria. Like all the other ingredients, you can adjust the brandy to match your taste, and you can add a few other liquids here if you'd like to try something new: Orange Liquor: Gives a nice, sweet little kick to the drink without water down the alcohol content. Orange Juice: Sweetens up the drink while adding a little more citrus. Also stretches out the drink a bit more and cuts some of the alcohol. You want a light, refreshing white wine for the best sangria. Traditionally, sangria is made with a Spanish Roja, but most people substitute a nice Merlot without missing anything. You can serve the Sangria as is if you add ice, or let it blend in the refrigerator for a few hours. The choice is yours. Either way, serve the drink on ice for a refreshing, wonderful burst of flavor. If you want, you can even leave the drink to blend overnight for the best flavor. Many recipes claim you must let it sit for 4 hours. While this will taste better, it is not strictly necessary. Everything is a bit more refreshing when it has some fizz to it, and Sangria is no different. Furthermore, this is just one more chance to customize your perfect version of the classic cocktail. Club Soda: Perfect if you like a little refreshing fizz in your drink. Add as much as you added brandy. Seltzer Water: Has a bit more pucker to it, making it a great choice to balance out too-sweet sangrias, in particular. You can even try flavored seltzers, like Lemon-Lime. Champagne or Prosecco: This is sangria, so go nuts! A bubbly, light, and crisp wine or prosecco will keep the drink strong and add a refreshing punch of bubbles.","completion":"Keep rinds on fruit for flavor and use more oranges with a light touch of lemon and lime. Sangria is customizable with the choice of fruit and removing seeds for a pleasant experience. Muddling releases sugars and flavors. Adjust brandy to taste and consider additions like orange liquor, orange juice, or a light, refreshing white wine like Spanish Roja or Merlot.

Write an article based on this summary: – From 2009 to 2013, the 110-foot schooner Tara sailed around the world, collecting plankton samples from more than 200 sites, some as deep as 6,500 feet down in the ocean, Science magazine reports. Fighting volatile weather, funding issues, and even the threat of pirates, the Tara expedition team still managed to cull an impressive database of plankton, the beings that produce half the planet's oxygen and include \\"microscopic plants and animals, fish larvae, bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms,\\" per Reuters. What the samples revealed, per the BBC: about 5,000 virus \\"communities,\\" 35,000 bacteria species, and a stunning 150,000 protozoa—single-celled plants and creatures. Scientists believe most of the discoveries in the exhaustively culled database have never been IDed before. \\"There are about 11,000 formally described species of plankton—we have evidence for at least 10 times more than that,\\" Dr. Chris Bowler of Paris' National Center for Scientific Research tells the BBC. And what scientists have put under the microscope is only a small percentage of their complete inventory: They've pored over just 579 of the 35,000 or so plankton samples collected, the broadcaster reports. They also completed what Tara Expeditions is calling the \\"largest DNA sequencing effort ever done for ocean science\\" and found 40 million genes, only 20% of which were previously known. One (mostly) common denominator among many of the collected organisms: They're sensitive to changes in the mercury. \\"With changing temperatures as a result of climate change, we are likely to see changes in this community,\\" Bowler says.

Article:","completion":"Title: Tara's Expedition: Discovering the Depths of Oceans and the Novel Biodiversity of Plankton Between the years 2009 and 2013, making her way through volatile weather conditions, financial hurdles, and even the looming menace of pirates, a 110-foot schooner named Tara circumnavigated the entire globe. Endowed with a challenging but crucial mission, the Tara expedition collected plankton samples from more than 200 diverse locations scattered throughout the world's oceans. Some of these sites dove an impressive 6,500 feet into the ocean's depths, according to a report from Science magazine. The organisms collected in this wide-ranging expedition produce approximately half the world's oxygen— an unassuming yet important task undertaken by a diverse group of beings that include microscopic plants and animals, fish larvae, bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms, as reported by Reuters. The resultant findings from the Tara voyage have flooded scientists with a trove of new information and, perhaps more excitingly, unprecedented microbial biodiversity. According to the BBC, the collected samples revealed around 5,000 virus \\"communities\\", an astounding 35,000 different bacterial species, and a breathtaking 150,000 different kinds of protozoa, or single-celled plants and animals. Excitingly, Dr. Chris Bowler, a scientist at Paris' National Center for Scientific Research, reported that \\"There are about 11,000 formally described species of plankton—we have evidence for at least 10 times more than that.\\" It’s believed that the majority of these discoveries have not yet been identified, making the database a gold mine for scientific discovery. However, the Tara expedition team has only scratched the iceberg's tip. Only 579 of the estimated 35,000 plankton samples collected have been thoroughly examined due to the time-consuming nature of the analysis process, notes the BBC. In addition to this, Tara Expeditions has successfully conducted what it refers to as the \\"largest DNA sequencing effort ever done for ocean science.\\" The outcome was the discovery of 40 million different genes. Surprisingly, only 20% of these genes were previously recognized, making this a significant advancement in the understanding of marine genomes. An intriguing common aspect among many of the collected organisms is their sensitivity to mercury changes. As global temperatures increase due to climate change, it could significantly impact these vital microscopic communities. \\"With changing temperatures as a result of climate change, we are likely to see changes in this community,\\" stated Dr. Bowler, emphasizing the direct impact of human activities on the ocean's biodiversity and ecosystem. In conclusion, the Tara expedition stands as an embodiment of resilience and the spirit of discovery, encapsulating a pursuit of understanding the vast, hidden world below the surface of our oceans. It has set the stage for a deeper comprehension of our marine ecosystem, the delicate balance within which it operates, and the profound need for its preservation in light of climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"and see there's no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we know how much they pay for it\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"We knew how much the bill was.\\"?","completion":"Given the premise \\"and see there's no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we know how much they pay for it,\\" we can deduce certain information and analyze the related hypothesis \\"We knew how much the bill was.\\" Firstly, the premise asserts that there is no secrecy regarding the bill. This means that the bill's contents, the services or products provided, and the amount due are transparent and known to the relevant parties. It could also imply that there is an openness, or a lack of hidden agendas, when it comes to the bill and payment process, thereby allowing everyone involved to have access to the necessary information. This premise also highlights two critical points: 1. The bill always comes in: This signifies that the billing process is consistent and recurring. In other words, this is not a one-time occurrence, but rather a regular event that takes place, which consequently increases the chances of the involved parties becoming more familiar with the billing details. 2. We know how much they pay for it: This explicitly conveys that the cost associated with the bill is already known. The context suggests that the people involved are aware of the amount being paid by the party responsible for covering the bill. Now, let's examine the hypothesis \\"We knew how much the bill was.\\" The hypothesis suggests that there is prior knowledge or awareness of the bill's cost. When comparing this hypothesis with the given premise, it seems that they are in alignment. The premise states that the bill comes in regularly, and the people know how much is being paid for it. This directly supports and reinforces the hypothesis, signifying a logical relationship between the two statements. Since the premise indicates that the cost of the bill is known, and the hypothesis claims that this knowledge already exists, the premise indeed entails the hypothesis. In conclusion, if the premise \\"and see there's no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we know how much they pay for it\\" holds true, it implies that it entails the hypothesis \\"We knew how much the bill was.\\" The premise supports the hypothesis through its assertion of transparency, consistency, and prior knowledge of the bill's payment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government...

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,...

Trump? - not enough information - He likes American labor unions - He likes American workers - He likes American businesses Answer:","completion":"He likes American workers. While there might not be a direct quote from President Trump explicitly stating that he likes American workers, his plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum is supported by some Senate Democrats and American labor unions who believe that these measures would help protect American manufacturing jobs.

He has, however, cut meaningfully the politicians salaries. These policies have led to social unrest and to confrontations between several institutions, namely between the Government and the Constitutional Court. Several individualities belonging to the parties that support the government have also raised their voices against the policies that have been taken in order to try to solve the financial crisis.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The motive behind Passos Coelho's decisions was primarily to address and mitigate the financial crisis Portugal was facing during his tenure as Prime Minister (2011-2015). At the time, the country was struggling with high public debt, large fiscal deficits, and an unstable banking system. To remedy this, Coelho's government had to implement austerity measures to reduce public expenditure and restore fiscal balance. The specific decisions mentioned in the context include: 1. Increasing the retirement age from 65 to 66: This measure aimed at reducing pension costs in the long run, as people would have to work longer before becoming eligible for retirement benefits. An aging population and increasing life expectancy added pressure on the pension system, so this decision was aimed at ensuring its sustainability. 2. Cutting pensions, unemployment benefits, health, education, and science expenses: These cuts were made to reduce public spending and to reallocate resources towards more pressing needs. By doing so, the government sought to contain its fiscal deficit and eventually reduce public debt. 3. Abolishing obligatory English classes in Basic Education: This decision was likely taken to save on education expenses, as part of the broader cost-cutting measures. 4. Keeping judges and diplomats' pensions untouched and not raising the military and police forces' retirement age: This decision perhaps reflects the government's priorities, recognizing the importance of these professions and security forces in maintaining order and stability in the country. It could also be a result of political compromises made during the decision-making process. 5. Cutting politicians' salaries: This move was likely made to signal that the austerity measures were being shared across all levels of society and that government officials were also making sacrifices. However, these policies led to social unrest and confrontations between various institutions. The government faced criticism from individual members within the ruling coalition, as well as the opposition and the Constitutional Court. Despite the unpopularity of these measures, Coelho's decisions aimed at addressing the urgent need to stabilize Portugal's fiscal situation and put the country back on a more sustainable economic path."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To melt cheese on nachos, I would follow these step-by-step instructions to achieve the best results: Step 1: Gather necessary ingredients and equipment First, gather the necessary ingredients, which include nacho chips and your choice of cheese (such as cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a mix of different cheeses). Also, gather the necessary equipment, which includes a baking sheet or oven-safe dish, parchment paper or aluminum foil, and an oven mitt. Step 2: Preheat the oven Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) to prepare for baking. This temperature is ideal for melting the cheese evenly without burning the nacho chips. Step 3: Prepare the baking sheet or dish Line your baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil to prevent the nachos from sticking and to minimize cleanup later. If using an oven-safe dish, you can skip the lining. Step 4: Spread the nacho chips Spread a layer of nacho chips in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet or dish, ensuring there's enough space to cover the chips with cheese. Step 5: Grate or shred the cheese Grate or shred your chosen cheese(s) to ensure it melts easily and uniformly across the nachos. You will need approximately 1 cup of shredded cheese for a standard baking sheet or dish, but you can adjust this amount based on your preference. Step 6: Distribute the cheese Evenly spread the grated cheese over the layer of nacho chips. Make sure to cover the chips adequately to achieve the best cheese-to-chip ratio. Step 7: Bake the nachos Place the baking sheet or dish in the preheated oven and bake for 5-7 minutes, or until the cheese is fully melted and slightly bubbling. Keep an eye on the nachos to prevent overbaking, which can result in burnt chips or cheese. Step 8: Remove and serve Carefully remove the baking sheet or dish from the oven using an oven mitt, and let the nachos cool for a minute or two. Serve immediately with your choice of additional toppings or dips such as salsa, guacamole, jalapenos, or sour cream. By following these steps, I can successfully melt cheese on nachos to create a delicious and popular snack or appetizer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the general argument implied by these sentences?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the main points. - The primary function of marriage is to raise children. - Marriage is seen as the best way to raise children. - This view undermines same-sex couples and single parent families raising children. - Marriage suggests that same-sex couples and single parents are less able to raise children. - Marriage promotes outdated ideals. Step 2: Establish the connections between the points. - The primary function of marriage being to raise children leads to the belief that it is the best way to do so. - Believing that marriage is the best way to raise children negatively impacts other family structures such as same-sex couples and single parent families. - This belief rooted in the institution of marriage insinuates that other family structures are less competent in raising children. - Considering the mentioned points, marriage can be seen to promote outdated ideals that no longer align with today's societal values.

At the hotel, Martin realizes he left his briefcase at the airport and takes a taxi to retrieve it. On the way, the taxi is involved in an accident and crashes into the Spree, knocking Martin unconscious. The driver, Gina (Diane Kruger), rescues him and flees the scene, as she is an illegal immigrant from Bosnia. Martin regains consciousness at a hospital after having been in a coma for four days. When Martin returns to the hotel, he discovers Liz with another man, and she claims to not know him. Martin phones a colleague in the States, Prof. Rodney Cole (Frank Langella) but reaches only his voice mail. Aboard a train, Martin writes down his schedule for the next day by memory.

Summarize the following: This will allow at the salt and sugar to become evenly distributed throughout the flour. If you do not have a food processor, then put everything into a bowl and stir it briskly with a fork. You can also use plain flour instead of all-purpose flour. Start with ¾ cup (180 milliliters) of water; you will be adding the rest later, depending on how dry the dough is. Most food processors should have a spout at the top where you can pour ingredients through without taking the lid off. After a while, the dough should start to come away from the sides of the food processor. If the dough is still too dry and has floury clumps in it, add the rest of the water, one tablespoon at a time. Do this until the dough clumps together and comes away from the walls of the food processor. If you do not have a food processor, make a hole in the middle of your flour mixture, and pour the lemon juice and water in. Stir it with a fork until the dough clumps together. The lemon juice will help make the dough more elastic and easier to roll out. You won't taste it once you bake the pastry. The square should measure 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) on each side. Do not make the square too thin. This will make the dough easier to work with later. During this time, you can start preparing the butter. Make sure that the butter sticks are touching each other and that the flour is spread evenly across them. Keep doing this until the flour becomes ingrained in the butter. Once you are done mashing, remove the top parchment sheet. The square should measure 8 inches (20.30 centimeters) on each side. Leave it there for one hour. This will allow the butter to cool back down and become more manageable later. You want to end up with a square that it is about 11 inches (27.94 centimeters) on each side. Unwrap the butter and position it so that the corners are touching the flat sides of the dough square. Then, lift the corners of the dough and fold them towards the middle of the butter, creating a square-shaped packet. Do not make it too thin, and make sure that the rectangle is three times longer than it is wide. Life the bottom third up and bring it just past the middle of the rectangle. Press it down. Next, lift the top third and bring it down onto the rest of the dough, creating a square. You can turn it to the left or right. If the packet does not turn easily, the dough likely soaked up the flour. Gently lift the packet up and spread a thin layer of flour onto your work surface. Set the packet back down and try turning it again. Roll the dough out into a rectangle and fold it into thirds again. You are doing this to create thin layers of dough and butter. Let it there until it becomes firm; it should take about 20 minutes depending on how cold your fridge is. After you roll, fold, and rotate the dough two times, put it into the fridge for 20 minutes, then roll, fold, and turn it two more times. At this point, you can start using your dough in your recipe.

Answer:","completion":"Title: Code of Silence Step 1: Introduce and Establish the Main Character Silvia is a young, ambitious journalist working for a small newspaper in a bustling metropolitan city. She is determined to make a name for herself in the journalism world by uncovering a ground-breaking story, but has so far only been assigned mundane tasks such as reporting on local community events. Step 2: Inciting Incident One evening, while grabbing a quick dinner at a local café, Silvia overhears a suspicious conversation between two men sitting nearby. They are discussing the details of an assassination plot targeting a high-profile political figure. Step 3: Silvia's Decision and Call to Action Shocked by what she has stumbled upon, Silvia decides to investigate the assassination plot herself in hopes of uncovering a significant story that might get her career off the ground. She begins to document any information she can gather, taking pictures of the two men involved in suspicious activities, and following their movements throughout the city. Step 4: Building Tension and Uncovering Clues As Silvia delves deeper into the heart of the conspiracy, her investigation becomes more dangerous. She discovers that the assassination plot is part of a larger scheme involving corrupt politicians and powerful crime syndicates. Silvia's commitment to the story puts her in direct conflict with these dangerous factions, who have now become aware of her actions. Step 5: Alliance Building and Preparation Along the way, Silvia encounters and forms alliances with other key characters, including a rookie police detective, Thomas, who is also investigating the case to prove himself to his peers. Together, they begin to unravel the motives behind the assassination plot and identify the key players involved. Step 6: The Climactic Confrontation Silvia and Thomas get a lead about an upcoming meeting between the corrupt politician and the crime syndicate members. They decide to confront the plotters and expose them before the assassination can take place. The climactic confrontation occurs in an abandoned warehouse, with a tense standoff between Silvia, Thomas, and the plotters. Step 7: Resolution and Aftermath In a thrilling turn of events, the plotters are arrested and brought to justice. The planned assassination is thwarted, and the city is saved from the corrupt underbelly of the conspiracy. Silvia's investigative story becomes a national sensation, earning her the recognition she has long sought after as a journalist, while Thomas gains the respect of his peers in the police force. Step 8: Conclusion The movie ends with Silvia and Thomas, now a formidable team, continuing to work together to expose corruption and crime, reigniting the passion for justice within them and renewing their commitment to fight for a better future for their city.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Cuts too deep? No, not deep enough Editor's note: Matt Welch is editor-in-chief of Reason and co-author of \\"The Declaration of Independents: How Libertarian Politics Can Fix What's Wrong With America\\" (Public Affairs). (CNN) -- As any ex-jock can tell you, any time you try exercising a muscle that has gone unused for a decade or more, something predictable happens: It barks like hell. This is what we're seeing in this last pathetic run-up to the forced spending cuts agreed to by Congress and the president in July 2011 as a fail-safe in case the federal government couldn't agree on a totally necessary but politically difficult settlement to address the country's long-term fiscal unsustainability. \\"Hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings,\\" President Barack Obama warned. (PolitiFact verdict: half true. \\"There is no indication that Americans will lose their insurance coverage or access to all primary care because of the sequester,\\" said PolitiFact, but added \\"pretty close to 'hundreds of thousands'\\" could lose flu vaccinations and cancer screenings.) A trio of Republican senators (John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte) jointly bemoaned \\"the calamitous effects that budget sequestration would have on our nation's economy and security.\\" Politicians have been trying to outdo each other in deploying what the neoliberal Washington Monthly founder Charles Peters coined in 1976 as the \\"firemen first\\" principle -- the notion that \\"the public will support (the Clever Bureaucrat's) valiant fight against the budget reduction only if essential services are endangered. Thus, C.B. always picks on teachers, policemen, firemen first.\\" So an already rattled nation is being spooked by horror stories of three-hour airport security lines, delayed background check for gun purchases and criminals running freely through the streets. All this for a spending cut that the Congressional Budget Office estimates will be around 44 billion in 2013, a tiny sliver of the federal budget. Imagine the squeals if it included significant cuts. Zelizer: GOP will get blame for cuts No doubt there will be those who find such fear-mongering persuasive. But for the rest of us, it suggests a rather pressing and relevant question: Just what, precisely, did we get from doubling the cost of the federal government between 2000 and 2010? If the bureaucrats can't produce an explanation for the price increase of government, then they should not expect their budgets to be rubber-stamped by an already suffering public.

So the squawking you hear is from a government money-machine having difficulty adapting to a political universe that no longer accepts automatic annual increases. And we'll keep hearing it until the moment politicians have the courage to align government expenditures within miles of revenue. The Nobel Prize-winning economist James Buchanan, who died in January, warned us three decades ago about the \\"permanent disconnect\\" between revenue and spending, brought about by politicians scared of charging taxpayers full freight for government goodies. Opinion: The fairy tale on spending cuts \\"The attractiveness of financing spending by debt issue to the elected politicians should be obvious,\\" he wrote. \\"Borrowing allows spending to be made that will yield immediate political payoffs without the incurring of any immediate political cost.\\" We are living with the results: National debt greater than 100% of annual gross domestic product and no end in sight, just as the baby boomers stop working and start sucking down expensive federal entitlements. Even if borrowing costs remain at their historic lows in perpetuity, this kind of debt overhang is more dangerous than any mild bureaucratic shuffle necessitated by the 1% trim. Why? In their controversial April 2012 National Bureau for Economic Research working paper, economists Carmen M. Reinhart, Vincent R. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff concluded that when countries carry debt of more than 90% of GDP for five or more consecutive years, economic growth gets chopped down by more than a whole percentage point each year for decades. What's the best method for reversing a debt crisis? In a 2009 paper (PDF), Harvard economists Alberto Alesina and Silvia Ardagna examined more than 100 debt-reduction efforts worldwide since 1970, and asserted that \\"spending cuts are much more effective than tax increases in stabilizing the debt and avoiding economic downturns.\\" The authors found \\"several episodes in which spending cuts adopted to reduce deficits have been associated with economic expansions rather than recessions.\\" Opinion: Cuts will turn off voters GOP is courting Taxpayers shouldn't be fearing the forced spending cuts, they should be fearing that the cuts don't go nearly far enough. And politicians should realize that short-term debt service and long-term entitlements are going to keep shrinking the money left over for doling out goodies. Like other things that can't go on forever, fiscal irresponsibility won't. Time to get those muscles in shape. Follow us on Twitter: @CNNOpinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matt Welch. Summary:","completion":"In this article, Matt Welch discusses the response to forced spending cuts in the United States, agreed upon by Congress and the president in 2011. Welch argues that while politicians and interest groups predict disastrous consequences from these cuts, they are a necessary measure to address the country's long-term fiscal unsustainability. He highlights that the cuts only represent a small portion of the federal budget and points to research suggesting that spending cuts are more effective in stabilizing debt and avoiding economic downturns than tax increases. Welch asserts that taxpayers should not fear the spending cuts; instead, they should fear that the cuts do not go far enough in addressing the issue of national debt and fiscal irresponsibility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"Title: Tainted Harvest Genre: Thriller/Drama Plot Summary: In the small, close-knit town of Westbrook, a mysterious illness arises, sending the community into panic and despair. The town's people join forces to uncover the hidden truth behind the sudden wave of sickness. They soon discover that the real enemy is much closer than they thought: the very food they consume daily. A heart-pounding journey ensues as they race against time to save their town before it's too late. Act 1: The movie begins with the peaceful, idyllic setting of Westbrook, a small town surrounded by lush farmlands and a tight-knit community. The protagonist, Dr. Emma Lawson, a dedicated and compassionate physician, returns to her hometown after years of working in the city. She takes over her father's practice, the town's only clinic, following his retirement. Dr. Lawson soon learns about an increasing number of people suffering from unexplained health issues. Seemingly healthy individuals begin to fall ill, with symptoms ranging from headaches and nausea to severe complications like organ failure and even death. Concerned, she decides to investigate the causes behind this mysterious epidemic. Act 2: Joined by her childhood friend and environmental activist, James Martin, as well as other determined townsfolk, Emma sets out to find any links between the victims and possible triggers for their illnesses. They gather data and interview the afflicted, and their suspicions lead them to the town's main food suppliers. After conducting tests on various food products from local suppliers, they uncover alarming levels of dangerous chemicals found in almost all items, including fruits, vegetables, and livestock. These traces are linked to a powerful, corrupt agricultural corporation that has been supplying the town's crops and livestock with genetically modified seeds and contaminated feeds to hasten growth and increase yield without regard for safety or ethical standards. As the group digs deeper, threats and attempts to silence them intensify. The interests of the corporation collide with those of town officials who have long profited from the company's dealings. Conspiracies and scandals unravel, bringing to light the true scale of the catastrophe. Act 3: With time running out and more lives at stake, Emma and her team must expose the truth to the public and shut down the corporation responsible for the tainted food supply. They come up with a plan to garner support from the residents and pursue legal action against those involved in the wrongdoing. Unexpected allies emerge, including whistleblowers from within the corporation and once-skeptical townsfolk. During a town hall meeting, Emma reveals the evidence of the contamination and its link to the ongoing health crisis. The community rallies together, and a massive grassroots movement to boycott the corrupt corporation and its products is ignited. The town faces several challenges, such as finding alternative sources of food and dealing with the backlash from those involved in the scandal. The local authorities launch an investigation, and the corporation is shut down, with key individuals facing criminal charges. The town begins to heal, slowly recovering from the physical and emotional damages inflicted by the corruption. Emma and James continue to advocate for food safety and transparency, determined to prevent another town from suffering the same fate as Westbrook. Tainted Harvest is a gripping and thought-provoking movie that explores the lengths people will go to in search of wealth and power, the devastating consequences of corporate greed, and the undeniable strength of a community united in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sight of the bloody body of his patient clad in a bright green dress causes Capa to suffer from psychosomatic color blindness, taking away his ability to see the color red. To restart his life, Capa travels to Los Angeles to stay with a friend, fellow therapist and best-selling author Dr. Bob Moore (Bakula), who invites him to sit in on a group therapy session. But one night Moore is violently murdered in the office and Capa is plunged into the mystery of his friend's death. Moore would gather his patients every Monday for a discussion of their problems. Police detective Lt. Hector Martinez (Blades) considers them, and possibly Capa, suspects in the murder. Capa continues to live in Moore's house and begins an affair with Rose (March), a mysterious girl who comes and goes. He takes over Moore's therapy group and learns of their pasts and obsessions: Clark (Brad Dourif) suffers from severe obsessive compulsive disorder and insists on cleanliness and counting things.

Context: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study. I was continually taken aback by participants’... Question: Why was the author aware of their positionality?

WHITE FIRE was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate DVD releases and on VHS. He claimed it's one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made. I generally don't watch movies knowing that they're going to be bad, but I made an exception for this one... and I was very glad that I did. It's filled to the brim with action (much of it surprisingly, graphically gory), sleaze (isolated to nudity with a key female character, but there's so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious) and outrageously awkward dialogue, all of which adds to the laughter-inducing tone of the film. Ginty, the unusual looking star of THE EXTERMINATOR (and countless other low budget action turds) is amusing in the lead, giving the best performance he could muster. Williamson is better than usual, clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee (and he doesn't come in until midway through). The rest of the cast is also fun to watch, particularly the villains, one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mish-mash of Spanish and Italian. She's priceless. Again, I can't stress enough how gory it was. It's not so bloody that it's nauseating, but it's uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget. Also, when Ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys, he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and spilling their beers.

Possible A: die, meat, cuddly pet, feel hunger, learn how to dance Why is \\"die\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"To answer this question, I will go through the possible answers step by step and justify why \\"die\\" is the most aligned with human common sense. Step 1: Understand the question The question asks what will happen to an animal if it doesn't eat. Step 2: Evaluate the possible answers Possible Answer 1: \\"Die\\" If an animal doesn't eat, it will not get the nutrition and energy it needs to survive. Over time, the animal will become malnourished and weak, eventually leading to death. This answer is aligned with human common sense because it is a well-known fact that living beings need food to survive. Possible Answer 2: \\"Meat\\" The term \\"meat\\" refers to the edible portions of an animal's body, which is not relevant to the question about what happens to an animal if it doesn't eat. This answer doesn't make sense in the context of the question. Possible Answer 3: \\"Cuddly pet\\" While some animals might become pets, their status as a pet is unrelated to not eating. This answer doesn't address the question and thus doesn't align with human common sense in this context. Possible Answer 4: \\"Feel hunger\\" While it's true that an animal might feel hunger if it doesn't eat, this answer doesn't fully address the consequences of not eating. Feeling hungry is a short-term consequence, but the question seems to seek a more comprehensive understanding of what happens to the animal when it doesn't eat. Possible Answer 5: \\"Learn how to dance\\" This answer is unrelated to the question and is not a logical consequence of not eating. It doesn't align with human common sense in this context. Step 3: Select the answer that best aligns with human common sense Based on the evaluation of the possible answers, \\"die\\" is the answer that best aligns with human common sense because it describes the ultimate consequence of not eating for any living being, and it is a well-known fact that animals need food to survive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Process: - Grapes are grown - A selection of grapes are gathered - The grapes are washed - The stems are removed from the grapes - The grapes are crushed and added to a fermation container - Yeast is added to the container - The yeast eats the sugar in the yeast, releasing alcohol - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Grapes are scarce happens, how will it affect MORE wine being produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you presented, \\"Grapes are scarce,\\" would have a direct and significant effect on the process of wine production. Grapes, as the primary raw material used in the production of wine, play an essential role throughout the entire process. Therefore, if grapes become scarce, the wine production industry will face immediate challenges concerning the availability and subsequent use of grapes. Let us explore the potential impact of this hypothetical situation on the individual steps of the wine production process. 1. Grapes are grown: In this situation, the scarcity of grapes would mean that there would likely be a decrease in both the volume and variety of grapes available for wine production. This impacts not only the quantity of wine produced but also the quality and characteristics of the final product. 2. A selection of grapes are gathered: Grapes scarcity would significantly affect this step as well. The fewer grapes there are to choose from, the more difficult it becomes to optimize grape selection for specific types of wine. As a result, winemakers may have to compromise on the flavor profiles of their wine or experiment with untraditional blends when selecting grapes for production. 3. The grapes are washed: Although grape scarcity would not directly impact the process of washing grapes, the decreased availability of grapes could lead to a lower overall throughput in the wine production process. With fewer grapes to work with, the washing stage may run slower to ensure every grape is processed and used to its maximum potential. 4. The stems are removed from the grapes: Similar to the previous step, grape scarcity does not directly affect the removal of stems from the grapes. However, if the production process becomes more limited by the scarcity of grapes, winemakers may need to invest in more accurate and efficient equipment to remove the stems, reducing waste and maximizing grape utilization. 5. The grapes are crushed and added to a fermentation container: With the scarcity of grapes, winemakers could face challenges in achieving the desired volume and balance between grape varieties for their final wine. This step could require extra attention and adaptation in the proportion and mixing of the crushed grapes in the fermentation containers. 6. Yeast is added to the container: The scarcity of grapes indirectly impacts this portion of the process. The amount of yeast added is dependent on the quantity of the crushed grapes in the fermentation container. If grape scarcity leads to a decreased quantity of grapes for fermentation, it will, in turn, necessitate adjustments in the amount of yeast added to the container. 7. The yeast eats the sugar in the yeast, releasing alcohol: The fermentation process could be indirectly affected by grape scarcity. With less grape availability, the variety or sugar content of the crushed grapes might be different from the usual, leading to potential variation in the wine's alcohol levels. Winemakers may need to closely monitor and adjust the fermentation process accordingly to maintain their desired product. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of grapes being scarce would have a direct and indirect effect on the process of wine production. The scarcity of grapes has the potential to disrupt the delicate balance of inputs and decisions throughout the wine production process, from grape selection to fermentation. Ultimately, this scarcity could lead to reduced wine quality, lower production volumes, and an increase in experimentation to make use of untraditional blends and varieties."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Learn how to interpret a Low Pressure System (Cyclone). Learn how to interpret a High Pressure System. Article:","completion":"Title: Understanding Air Pressure: Highs, Lows, and Weather Systems Hey little buddies! Today, we're going to talk about something really interesting called \\"air pressure.\\" You know what air is, don't you? That's right! It's the stuff we breathe, and it's all around us. But did you know that air can also push and pull on things just like you do when you're playing with your toys? That's what we call air pressure! What does air pressure measure? Air pressure tells us how much force, or push, the air is using in a certain place. If the air is pushing really hard, we say it has high pressure. If the air is not pushing much, we say it has low pressure. You've probably felt air pressure change before when your ears pop while going up a hill or riding an elevator in a tall building. That's because the air pressure is different in different places. The air pressure symbols: When we're looking at air pressure on a map or a weather report, we use special symbols to show whether the pressure is high or low. The symbol for high pressure is a big \\"H,\\" like a superhero! The symbol for low pressure is a big \\"L,\\" like \\"look out!\\" These symbols help us understand what's happening in the sky and how the weather might change. Low Pressure System (Cyclone): Now let's learn about low pressure systems, or cyclones! A cyclone is like a big spinning top in the sky. These swirls in the air are caused by the warm air from the ground rising up and meeting the cool air above. The \\"L\\" symbol on the map helps us find them. Cyclones usually bring wet and stormy weather because all that spinning air scoops up lots of water from the ground and carries it up into the clouds. So when you see the \\"L\\" symbol on the weather map, grab your raincoat and umbrella! High Pressure System: On the other hand, high pressure systems are like a gentle giant helping to keep the weather calm. When air is pushed together and has high pressure, it doesn't swirl around like a cyclone. Instead, it slowly sinks back down to the ground, making the sky clear and sunny. We can find high-pressure spots on the map with the \\"H\\" symbol. That's where we're most likely to have a beautiful day for playing outside! So there you have it! Air pressure is an important part of our weather, and it helps us understand what's happening in the sky. The next time you check the weather forecast, look for those \\"H\\" and \\"L\\" symbols and see if you can predict what the day will be like. Stay curious, little buddies! And remember, whether it's a high pressure or low pressure day, every day is a great day to learn and explore!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After the country became independent from Portugal in 1974 due to the Portuguese Colonial War and the Carnation Revolution, the rapid exodus of the Portuguese civilian, military, and political authorities resulted in considerable damage to the country's economic infrastructure, social order, and standard of living. Now answer this question: What happened in Portugal that contributed to Guinea-Bissau's independence?","completion":"The Carnation Revolution in Portugal played a significant role in contributing to Guinea-Bissau's independence. This revolution, which took place on April 25, 1974, was a non-violent military coup led by the Armed Forces Movement (MFA) in Lisbon, Portugal. The MFA sought to overthrow the authoritarian Estado Novo regime, which had ruled the country since 1933 under the leadership of António de Oliveira Salazar and later Marcelo Caetano. The Carnation Revolution was named after the red carnations that were placed in the barrels of rifles and on the uniforms of soldiers, symbolizing the non-violent nature of the uprising. The revolution successfully led to the collapse of the Estado Novo regime and the establishment of a democratic government in Portugal. One of the significant factors that triggered the Carnation Revolution was the ongoing Portuguese Colonial War, which had been raging in the country's African colonies since the early 1960s. This conflict was primarily fought in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau, and was a result of local resistance to Portuguese colonial rule. The war became increasingly unpopular in Portugal due to its immense costs, both in terms of human lives and resources. The Carnation Revolution, which led to the end of the Portuguese Colonial War, directly impacted Guinea-Bissau's independence. With the new government in place, Portugal began a process of decolonization. On September 10, 1974, just a few months after the revolution in Portugal, Guinea-Bissau declared its independence from Portuguese rule. This was formally recognized by Portugal on September 26, the same year. In conclusion, the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, driven mainly by the desire to end the authoritarian regime and the unpopular Portuguese Colonial War, contributed to Guinea-Bissau's independence. The change in government in Portugal initiated a decolonization process, which led to Guinea-Bissau gaining its independence within a short period after the revolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to analyze these two statements, let's break them down further. Sentence 1 states that \\"Like all modern dinosaurs, raptors are inexplicably attracted to the scent of BBQ sauce.\\" This implies that raptors, which are considered modern dinosaurs, are drawn to the smell of BBQ sauce for some unexplained reason. Sentence 2, on the other hand, claims that \\"Raptors are turned off by food smells.\\" This statement suggests that raptors do not find the scent of food appealing. In fact, it indicates that they have a negative response to the smell of food. Given the details provided in both sentences, we can observe a contradiction. While Sentence 1 implies that raptors are attracted to the scent of a specific food item (BBQ sauce), Sentence 2 states the opposite, that they are not attracted to food smells at all. Therefore, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Instead, these two sentences present conflicting information about the relationship between raptors and the scent of food.

In other countries, new technology focuses on preventing disease and feeding an increasing population. Which statement best explains why countries focus on different types of new technology?","completion":"Countries focus on different types of new technology because their priorities, resources, and socio-economic conditions vary significantly. Multiple factors can influence a nation's technological focus, including cultural values, geographic characteristics, government policies, existing infrastructure, and economic status. By examining these factors, we can better understand the differences in technological focus among countries. 1. National priorities and cultural values: Different countries often have unique cultural values and national priorities that shape the direction of their technological advancements. For instance, a country like the United States may emphasize space exploration and advanced medical procedures due to its commitment to scientific discovery and innovation. On the other hand, a country with a history of famine and scarcity might prioritize food security and disease prevention to ensure their population's well-being. 2. Geographic characteristics: Countries with distinct geographic characteristics often focus on technologies that address their specific challenges. For example, nations with abundant natural resources and vast landscapes, such as Russia, may prioritize space exploration technologies due to their deep connection with aerospace exploration. In contrast, countries with limited arable land and high population densities like Bangladesh might concentrate on agricultural technologies that improve food productivity and access. 3. Government policies and investments: Government policies and investments also play a crucial role in shaping a country's focus on different types of new technology. Some governments may have proactive policies that encourage emerging technologies, while others may prioritize different areas of development. For example, China has implemented aggressive policies to become a global leader in renewable energy and AI technology. However, other countries might focus more on addressing domestic challenges such as food security or healthcare. 4. Existing infrastructure: A country's existing infrastructure significantly impacts its ability to adopt and develop new technologies. Nations that already have substantial investment in certain sectors, such as a well-developed healthcare system or established space exploration programs, may choose to focus their efforts on advancing existing technologies. In contrast, countries with underdeveloped infrastructure in these sectors might prioritize overcoming basic challenges before moving on to advanced innovations. 5. Economic factors: A nation's economic standing influences its capacity to invest in and develop new technology. Wealthy countries with substantial resources have the financial capacity to invest in advanced research and development projects, leading to breakthroughs in areas like medical procedures and space exploration. On the other hand, countries with limited financial resources may concentrate on technologies that serve their immediate needs, such as disease prevention and food security. These countries may also opt for technologies with relatively lower upfront costs and long-term benefits. In conclusion, the reasons countries focus on different types of new technology are multifaceted and complex. A combination of cultural values, geographic characteristics, government policies, existing infrastructure, and economic factors contribute to a nation's technological focus. This diversity in priorities is vital, as it enables countries to address both global challenges and unique local needs through the collective development and adoption of innovative solutions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What questions came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology? Is \\"Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"While the statement you provided does address the lack of cohesion among the sub-fields of anthropology, it does not specifically answer the question regarding the central questions that have occupied cultural and social anthropology. Allow me to provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer to your question. Cultural and social anthropology are two closely related sub-fields within anthropology that focus on the study of human societies, their cultural practices, and the ways in which they interact with one another. Throughout the development of these sub-fields, several key questions and themes have emerged as central areas of focus. Some of these include: 1. The Nature of Culture: One of the foundational questions in cultural and social anthropology is understanding what constitutes a culture. This has led anthropologists to explore the various ways in which humans create and convey meaning through language, symbols, and social practices. Many anthropologists aim to document and compare various aspects of culture, such as beliefs, values, norms, and customs, to better understand the diversity of human societies. 2. Social Organization and Kinship: Another core area of interest for cultural and social anthropologists is the study of social organization and kinship systems. This includes investigating the ways in which humans form social groups and relationships, such as families, clans, tribes, and other social units. Anthropologists have sought to understand the various factors that influence the formation of these groups, as well as the roles they play in different societies. 3. Power and Hierarchy: Anthropologists are also interested in exploring the various ways in which power is distributed within societies, as well as how this power dynamics may shape social interactions and hierarchies. This can involve examining the roles of social institutions, such as governments, religions, and economic systems, and their impact on an individual’s access to resources, status, and influence. 4. Cultural Change and Adaptation: As cultures and societies are dynamic and constantly evolving, another central question in cultural and social anthropology involves understanding the processes and factors that contribute to cultural change and adaptation. This can include the study of migration, globalization, and the ways in which societies respond to environmental challenges or new technologies. 5. Cultural Relativism and Ethnocentrism: A key challenge for anthropologists is overcoming their own cultural biases and approaching the study of other cultures from a neutral standpoint. This has led to the development of the concept of cultural relativism, which advocates for understanding each culture on its own terms, rather than comparing or judging it based on one's own cultural values. Addressing issues related to cultural relativism and ethnocentrism is crucial in conducting anthropological research and producing unbiased perspectives on different societies. In conclusion, the central questions in cultural and social anthropology encompass a wide range of themes, such as the nature of culture, social organization, power dynamics, cultural change, and the importance of cultural relativism. While the statement you provided does touch upon the fragmentation of the sub-fields of anthropology, it does not specifically address these central questions that have occupied the study of cultural and social anthropology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Next question: where do curling stones come from in scotland?","completion":"Curling stones, the polished granite stones used in the sport of curling, have a rich history in Scotland, as the country is known to be the birthplace of the sport. Scotland is renowned for its curling stones, which are uniquely crafted from dense, high-quality granite. The country possesses a few key sources for this prized material, which contribute significantly to the international curling community. The primary source of curling stones in Scotland is the island of Ailsa Craig, situated in the Firth of Clyde. This tiny, uninhabited island covers an area of approximately 220 acres and is known to possess two types of granite essential for producing world-class curling stones: Ailsa Craig Common Green and Ailsa Craig Blue Hone. Ailsa Craig Common Green is found across most of the island. This granite type is used for the body of the curling stones. Its excellent density, consistency, and resistance to water absorption make it an ideal choice for this purpose. Ailsa Craig Blue Hone, on the other hand, is a rarer and denser granite that forms only a small portion of the island's geological makeup. In curling stones, this granite is used for the running edges, the part of the stone that makes contact with the ice during play. Blue Hone's unique properties, such as its reduced water absorption rate and exceptional durability, provide a superior gliding surface for the stones, enabling smoother and more controlled movements. The process of extracting granite from Ailsa Craig begins with the careful removal of rock samples from the island's surface. The samples are then transported to the mainland, where expert craftsmen split, cut, and polish the granite into curling stones. Kays of Scotland, a family-owned company that has been producing curling stones since 1851, is the primary manufacturer of these Scottish curling stones. They hold an exclusive license to harvest granite from Ailsa Craig, and their stones are used in major curling events, including the Winter Olympics and the World Curling Championships. Although the majority of curling stones come from Ailsa Craig, other sources of granite in Scotland have been utilized to produce curling stones in the past. Trefor Granite Quarry in Wales and the former Corrie Quarry on the Isle of Mull are examples of these alternative origins. However, these sources are not as popular or reliable as Ailsa Craig due to differences in granite quality and availability. In conclusion, Scotland has a deep-seated connection with curling and the production of curling stones. The island of Ailsa Craig, in particular, is a significant source of the high-quality granite required to manufacture these stones. The unique properties of the island's granite, coupled with centuries of Scottish craftsmanship, have made these stones renowned and sought after by the global curling community."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer a question about the following article about Neptune: Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.

Ludovic (Ludo) Coeck was a soccer player from Belgium who played different positions like left winger and central midfielder. He played for different clubs and also played for the Belgian national team. When we say he was \\"capped\\" for the Belgian national team 46 times, it means he played in 46 games for them.

A suicide bomber detonates himself at a party in Java, Indonesia, and a Javanese Sultan's daughter, Sultana, is believed to be one of the unidentified victims. Jake Travers, an American posing as a graduate student from Cornell University, was at the scene of the blast and is held as a witness by a police detective of Detachment 88, Lieutenant Hashim. After interviewing Jake at the crime scene, Hasim and Jake are attacked by terrorists led by Malik and his henchman Achmed. Jake saves Hashim and kills two terrorists, but Achmed manages to escape. Hashim becomes suspicious after he observes Jake's combat skills. Jake and Hashim are brought to the hospital where Hashim's wife meets Jake. At Hashim's wife's insistence, Hashim invites Jake to their house for breakfast. At the house, Hashim tells Jake that he ran a background check on him through Interpol. Jake tells Hashim he is an FBI agent conducting an undercover investigation, and suggests they cooperate with one another. Returning to his apartment, Jake faxes to a friend stateside a photo of a tattoo from the corpse believed to be Sultana's. Jake's friend informs him that the tattoo is typically used by Chinese high-class prostitutes, which confirms Jake's suspicion that the body is not Sultana's. Jake follows a lead to a night club, where he brings home a prostitute bearing a similar tattoo. When the prostitute cooperates with Jake, they are ambushed by Hashim's terrorists and a Chinese gang operating the prostitution ring.

A bird hatches from an egg. 2. The bird is nurtured by its parents. 3. The bird is fed food for growth. 4. The bird grows. 5. The bird begins to learn how to fly. 6. The bird matures. 7. The bird leaves its nest (supposing the bird stays with its parents, it won't leave). 8. The bird makes its own nest. If the baby bird stays with its parents, it will not leave the nest to make its own nest, which is the step that leads to increased bird populations (through finding a mate, laying eggs, and hatching new baby birds). However, the baby bird staying with its parents might also reduce competition for resources (food, nesting locations) between closely related birds. On the other hand, it could increase competition for resources within the original family, as they share the same nest and feeding areas. Considering these factors, the baby bird staying with its parents could have the following effects on the number of birds in the population: A: More - Less competition for resources with other birds from the same family in nearby nests. B: Less - Increase in competition for resources within the original family. C: No effect - If the baby bird staying with its parents neither significantly reduces nor increases the food availability for other birds, the population might remain stable.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Parasitoids are organisms living in or on their host and feeding directly upon it, eventually leading to its death. They are much like parasites in their close symbiotic relationship with their host or hosts. Like the previous two classifications parasitoid predators do not kill their hosts instantly. However, unlike parasites, they are very similar to true predators in that the fate of their prey is quite inevitably death. A well-known example of a parasitoids are the ichneumon wasps, solitary insects living a free life as an adult, then laying eggs on or in another species such as a caterpillar. Its larva(e) feed on the growing host causing it little harm at first, but soon devouring the internal organs until finally destroying the nervous system resulting in prey death. By this stage the young wasp(s) are developed sufficiently to move to the next stage in their life cycle. Though limited mainly to the insect order Hymenoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera parasitoids make up as much as 10% of all insect species. During a parasitoid-host interaction what will happen to the host? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"During a parasitoid-host interaction, the host will eventually die as a result of the parasitoid's feeding habits and life cycle requirements. The process typically unfolds in the following manner: 1. Initial contact: The parasitoid, often an adult insect like an ichneumon wasp, locates a suitable host, such as a caterpillar. The selection of a host is generally species-specific, with each parasitoid being adapted to a particular host or a group of closely related hosts. 2. Egg-laying: The adult parasitoid lays its eggs either on the surface of the host's body (ectoparasitoid) or inside the host's body (endoparasitoid). This process is called oviposition. 3. Development and feeding: Once the eggs hatch, the parasitoid larvae begin to feed on the host. In the case of ectoparasitoids, they feed on the host's external tissues, while endoparasitoids consume the host's internal organs. At first, their feeding may cause little harm to the host, allowing it to continue its normal activities to some extent. However, as the parasitoid larva(e) grow and consume more of the host's tissues, the host becomes progressively weaker. 4. Host manipulation: Some parasitoids can manipulate their host's behavior to ensure their own survival and development. For example, they may alter the host's immune response, preventing it from attacking the parasitoid larva(e) or change the host's feeding habits to provide a better nutritional environment for the parasitoid. 5. Host's demise: Eventually, the parasitoid larvae reach a critical point in their development where they require more nutrients or space, and their feeding causes irreversible damage to the host's vital organs and nervous system. This leads to the host's death. 6. Completion of the parasitoid's life cycle: The parasitoid larvae continue to develop within or on the now-dead host, ultimately pupating and emerging as adults, ready to reproduce and continue the cycle by finding new hosts. Given this typical progression of parasitoid-host interactions, the fate of the host is invariably death, as the parasitoid consumes the necessary resources and inflicts damage that ultimately proves lethal. Although the host may not die immediately, its fate is sealed from the moment the parasitoid begins to make use of it as a resource for growth and reproduction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - You inhale - Your diaphragm moves down - Your lungs have more room - Your lungs fill with air - You exhale - Your diaphragm moves back up - Carbon dioxide is exhaled - You start the process over again. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is less oxygen in the air happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned involves a situation with less oxygen in the air. If this occurs, it will affect the process of oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. Here's a detailed explanation: Under normal circumstances, when you inhale, the diaphragm moves down, creating more room for the lungs to fill with air. This air contains oxygen, which diffuses into your bloodstream through your lung's alveoli (tiny air sacs responsible for gas exchange). Now, if there's less oxygen in the air, the concentration gradient of oxygen between the air you inhale and the bloodstream would be reduced. This reduced gradient will cause less oxygen to diffuse into your blood. As a result, your body might try to compensate for the decrease in available oxygen in several ways: 1. Breathing rate and depth: Your body might instinctively increase your breathing rate (how often you breathe) and depth (how much air you take in per breath) to try to deliver more oxygen to your bloodstream, even if the oxygen concentration in the air is lower. 2. Heart rate: An increase in heart rate can help move oxygenated blood through your body more quickly, attempting to maintain the necessary oxygen levels in your body's tissues. 3. Hemoglobin affinity: Hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells, binds to oxygen and transports it through the bloodstream. Under conditions of low environmental oxygen, hemoglobin might modify its oxygen-binding affinity to aid in extracting as much oxygen as possible from the limited supply. 4. Cellular adaptations: The body may adapt to the lower oxygen levels by producing more red blood cells to increase blood's oxygen-carrying capacity or by increasing the efficiency of oxygen usage within cells. However, these compensatory mechanisms may not always be sufficient to deliver more or even an adequate amount of oxygen to the bloodstream, especially in extreme conditions such as very high altitudes or in oxygen-deprived environments. In these cases, the lack of oxygen can lead to hypoxia (a reduced level of oxygen in tissues) which, if severe or prolonged, can have serious health consequences. In summary, although the body can initiate certain compensatory mechanisms to address the reduced oxygen concentration in the environment, there is no guarantee that a greater amount of oxygen can be delivered to the bloodstream. The perturbation does have a direct effect on the process of oxygen delivery, and the body's ability to compensate and maintain normal oxygen levels depends on the severity and duration of the reduced oxygen conditions."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Ich kenne NCIS, bereits seit den beiden Pilotfolgen bei J.A.G., und war direkt von dem gesamten Konzept begeistert. Am Abend der Pilotfolge saß ich gespannt vor dem Fernseher, und wurde nicht enttäuscht. Die Serie ist einfach Klasse! Für mich war damals auch klar, dass ich, sobald die Serie auf DVD erscheint, zugreifen werden. Die Serie ist einfach ein absolutes MUSS, für alle Fans von Krimiserien, aber auch für die Fans von J.A.G., der Serie in der NCIS ihren Anfang nahm. Für Fans des Militärmilieus führt so, oder so kein Weg an dieser Serie vorbei. NCIS ist durch und durch spannend, und überrascht immer wieder: Action, spannende Kriminalfälle gemischt mit zwischenmenschliche Beziehungen, ein Hauch Spionage, etwas Humor und der Einblick ins Militär. Es ist für jeden etwas dabei. Aber auch wer \\"nur\\" eine spannende Serie zur Unterhaltung sucht, ist mit NCIS sehr gut bedient und wird mit Sicherheit nicht enttäuscht. Diese Hälfte der 3. Staffel verfügt auch erstmals über Bonusmaterial, welches unter anderem auch Einblick in die Arbeit des echten \\"Naval Criminal Investgative Service\\" (N.C.I.S.) gibt, der Vorbild für die Serie ist. Es ermöglicht aber auch mal den Blick hinter die Kulissen der Serien. Einen Stern werde ich jedoch für die Art der Veröffentlichung abziehen müssen. Auch wenn NCIS in meinen Augen eine 5 Sterne-Serie ist, die geteilten Boxen, die den Preis der Staffel auf knapp 60 €uro treiben, kann man einfach nicht, ohne weiteres, unberücksichtigt lassen.

This region is known for its many lakes, so it's important to find an authoritative source that can provide reliable details about the size of these lakes. The second largest lake in the Lake District, after Lake Windermere, would be the one with the next largest area or volume. Here are my steps: 1. Identify and access proper digital resources such as databases or websites, which provide reliable geographical information. Sources like these often rank lakes by their size. 2. Extract the necessary information from the source. As I am an artificial intelligence, I can swiftly process large volumes of data and pinpoint the required information. 3.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"The disease is fatal.\\" is entailed by the premise \\"TUMORS AND IS A TERMINAL ILLNESS,\\" it is crucial to understand the meanings of both the hypothesis and the premise, and analyze them in relation to one another. The premise contains two concepts: tumors and terminal illness. Tumors refer to abnormal growths of cells, which can be benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Terminal illness, on the other hand, is a term that is used to describe a condition with no cure, for which the progression is expected to lead to the patient's death. Now let's break down the hypothesis. \\"The disease is fatal,\\" implies that the disease in question results in death. In this context, the disease is not specifically mentioned, so we need to infer what disease is being referred to from the premise. The most obvious choice here would be to assume the disease in question is the one related to tumors and being a terminal illness. Now to address the question of whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, in other words, if the premise guarantees the validity of the hypothesis. The connection between tumors and terminal illness in the premise suggests that the disease being discussed has both of these qualities. Given that a terminal illness is one that is expected to lead to the patient's death, it is reasonable to infer that the disease being referred to is fatal. Therefore, based on the analysis of the premise and the hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis \\"The disease is fatal\\" is entailed by the premise \\"TUMORS AND IS A TERMINAL ILLNESS.\\" The premise, which combines the concepts of tumors and terminal illness, strongly suggests that the disease in question is expected to result in the patient's death, supporting the validity of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"Jesse brought home their friend for thanksgiving because their friend's family lived far away.

A new British arrival in the city, Brian Roberts (Michael York), moves into the boarding house where Sally lives. A reserved academic and writer, Brian gives English lessons to earn a living while completing his doctorate. Sally tries seducing Brian and suspects he may be gay. Brian tells Sally that on three previous occasions he has tried to have physical relationships with women, all of which failed. They become friends, and Brian witnesses Sally's anarchic, bohemian life in the last days of the German Weimar Republic. Sally and Brian become lovers despite their earlier reservations; they conclude that his previous failures with women were because they were \\"the wrong three girls\\". Sally befriends Maximilian von Heune, a rich playboy baron who takes her and Brian to his country estate; it becomes ambiguous which of the duo Max is seducing. After a sexual experience with Brian, Max loses interest in the two and departs for Argentina. During an argument, when Sally tells Brian that she has been having sex with Max, Brian reveals that he has as well. Brian and Sally later reconcile, and Sally reveals that Max left them money and mockingly compares the sum with what a professional prostitute gets. Sally learns that she is pregnant, but is unsure of the father. Brian offers to marry her and take her back to his university life in Cambridge. At first they celebrate their resolution to start this new life together, but after a picnic between Sally and Brian in which Brian acts distant and uninterested, Sally starts to doubt continuing with the pregnancy, and is disheartened by the vision of herself as a bored faculty wife washing dirty diapers.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, the Nazi regime was rising in power at that time. The movie \\"Cabaret\\" is set in 1931 Berlin, which was during the final years of the German Weimar Republic. The Weimar Republic was a period of political and economic instability in Germany that lasted from 1919 to 1933. It was during this time that the Nazi Party, led by Adolf Hitler, gained momentum and support. In 1933, just two years after the events portrayed in \\"Cabaret,\\" Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany, and the Nazi regime began its totalitarian rule. This period preceded World War II and the Holocaust, which were heavily influenced by the Nazis' rise to power. In the movie, the Kit Kat Klub can be seen as a metaphor for the decadence and excess of the era, as well as the political apathy that allowed the Nazis to come into power.

Complete the following sentence. The bits of sand in clam chowder bothered Justin, but it didn't bother Brian because","completion":"Brian found comfort in the rustic authenticity and unpretentious beauty that the bits of sand brought to the clam chowder. For him, it was a reminder of the chowder's origins, how the clams were freshly harvested from the sandy shores where the tide caressed the beach, creating a haven where these delicious mollusks could thrive. Brian appreciated how the sand served as a symbol of the clam's natural habitat, signifying that the chowder was made with the freshest possible ingredients, sourced directly from their environment. This sensory connection to the ocean made each spoonful a transcendent experience for Brian, as he mentally journeyed to the coastal landscape where the clams were nestled before becoming part of his delicious meal. In his opinion, the sand brought out the oceanic flavors of the dish in a way that perfectly seasoned, farm-raised clams could never replicate. Moreover, Brian was a firm believer in the importance of embracing food in its most unadulterated form. He felt that the presence of sand made the clam chowder more genuine, as it was a testament to the raw, unfiltered nature in which the ingredients were interwoven into a rich tapestry of culinary delight. The sand, therefore, represented a subtle but crucial component that bestowed a certain purity upon the chowder. Additionally, Brian recognized that the chowder's untamed elements ignited something primal within him, allowing him to connect with his ancestors, who might have eaten similar dishes containing bits of sand in their clams. This sense of kinship and shared experience across the ages was something Brian found comforting and even inspirational. Furthermore, Brian appreciated that the chowder was a culinary work of art, reflecting the chef's skill in crafting a dish that balanced contrasts – the silkiness of the creaminess against the slight grittiness of the sand, the brininess of the clams harmonized with the gentle sweetness of the potatoes and onions. The sand, in its seemingly inconsequential presence, played a critical role in accentuating the chowder's essential dynamism, allowing for a more enjoyable gastronomic encounter. In summary, the bits of sand in the clam chowder did not bother Brian, because he saw them as an authenticating addition to the dish – connecting him to the natural world, honoring the purity of raw ingredients, evoking ancient culinary experiences, and showcasing the chef's artistic finesse. These factors combined to create a truly immersive and memorable culinary experience for Brian."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Select from the following. * yes. * it is not possible to tell. * no.","completion":"It is not possible to tell if the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. Explanation: The premise states that several women dressed in burkas and a child in an orange shirt are out walking in a public space. This provides some information about the situation - we know that the group consists of women and a child, and we know their attire. However, the hypothesis makes a claim about the child's gender, stating that the child is a young girl. The problem with the given hypothesis is that it cannot be definitively confirmed based on the premise alone. The premise only provides information about the attire of the individuals in the group but does not specifically mention the gender of the child. Wearing an orange shirt does not necessarily indicate the child's gender as boys and girls can both wear orange shirts. Furthermore, as the women are dressed in burkas, it is reasonable to assume that the setting is culturally diverse, where traditional clothing is common, and gender-specific clothing standards might not necessarily apply. Taking these factors into consideration, it is not possible to tell if the hypothesis is true based only on the premise provided.

Given the below context: Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents \\"a cross-section of Czech... Guess a valid title for it!

When I am heading to a restaurant close to its closing time I always call ahead and ask if it will be ok, whether I will need to rush. That is exactly what I did last week before I headed to Pizutti's. They said to come on by. When we had sat for more than a few minutes it was clear that it was a mistake. The server was harried and surly. He clearly didn't want to be there, nor did he want us there. We said something and he again repeated that he was glad we were there, but then proceeded to be rude and unhelpful. I am sorry to say, but the food did not make up for the terrible service. The pasta dish, their specialty was served luke warm. The bread was plain. The salads were wilted. I am sure we wouldn't have wanted desert, but the option wasn't available, because when we finished our main courses and inquired, he told us the chef had gone home and it wasn't available.

James Todd Smith (born January 14, 1968), known professionally as LL Cool J (short for Ladies Love Cool James), is an American rapper, actor, author and entrepreneur from Queens, New York. He is known for such hip hop hits as \\"Going Back to Cali\\", \\"I'm Bad\\", \\"The Boomin' System\\", \\"Rock the Bells\\" and \\"Mama Said Knock You Out\\", as well as romantic ballads such as \\"Doin' It\\", \\"I Need Love\\", \\"Around the Way Girl\\" and \\"Hey Lover\\". Radio was released to critical acclaim, both for production innovation and LL's powerful rap. Released November 18, 1985, on Def Jam Recordings in the United States, Radio earned a significant amount of commercial success and sales for a hip hop record at the time. Shortly after its release, the album sold over 500,000 copies in its first five months, eventually selling over 1 million copies by 1988, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Radio peaked at number 6 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and at number 46 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. It entered the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart on December 28, 1985, and remained there for forty-seven weeks, while also entering the Pop Albums chart on January 11, 1986. Radio remained on the chart for thirty-eight weeks. By 1989, the album had earned platinum status from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), after earning a gold certification in the United States on April 14, 1986, with sales exceeding one million copies. \\"I Can't Live Without My Radio\\" and \\"Rock the Bells\\" were singles that helped the album go platinum. It eventually reached 1,500,000 in US sales. With the breakthrough success of his hit single \\"I Need a Beat\\" and the Radio LP, LL Cool J became one of the first hip-hop acts to achieve mainstream success along with Kurtis Blow and Run-D.M.C.. Gigs at larger venues were offered to LL as he would join the 1986-'87 Raising Hell tour, opening for Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys. Another milestone of LL's popularity was his appearance on American Bandstand as the first hip hop act on the show, as well as an appearance on Diana Ross' 1987 television special, Red Hot Rhythm & Blues. The album's success also helped in contributing to Rick Rubin's credibility and repertoire as a record producer. Radio, along with Raising Hell (1986) and Licensed to Ill (1986), would form a trilogy of New York City-based, Rubin-helmed albums that helped to diversify hip-hop. Rubin's production credit on the back cover reads \\"REDUCED BY RICK RUBIN\\", referring to his minimalist production style, which gave the album its stripped-down and gritty sound. This style would serve as one of Rubin's production trademarks and would have a great impact on future hip-hop productions. Rubin's early hip hop production work, before his exit from Def Jam to Los Angeles, helped solidify his legacy as a hip hop pioneer and establish his reputation in the music industry.

UPDATED:. 01:30 EST, 23 November 2013. A North Carolina newspaper deliveryman picked up a teddy bear on a rural road, only to have authorities tell him later a bomb had been stuffed inside. Anthony Cannon, who works for The Shelby Star, said on Friday that he spotted the booby-trapped toy before dawn on Thursday along his route near Lattimore, a tiny town about 50 miles west of Charlotte. Later, he circled back to pick it up. 'I thought it was real unusual to be sitting in the middle of the road,' Mr Cannon, 42, said. 'It was pitch-black out there. When I picked the bear up some sort of container fell out.' Scroll down for video. A newspaper delivery man found this teddy bear (stock image) by the side of a North Carolina road on his round - and later discovered an IED packed inside. Not realizing he was holding an. improvised explosive device, Cannon left the bear and put the. cylindrical item in his car for the 20-minute drive back to Shelby. He. drove to his cousin's home, where he examined what he had found more. closely in the light. He says it was a small, liquid-filed bottle covered with tape with some wires coming out of it. Suspecting what he was holding might be dangerous, Cannon set the device down on the porch and dialed 911. Among those who responded was a bomb squad from the larger nearby city of Gastonia. 'Within about two minutes of walking up, they said it was an IED and cleared us out of the house,' Cannon said. Cleveland County Sheriff Alan Norman said Cannon was very lucky. Though he said he couldn't speak to the construction of the device or how it could be set off, the sheriff said it was capable of causing serious damage. 'It could have caused personal injury had the device activated,' Norman said. Anthony Cannon put the bear in his car and drove it to his cousin's home in Shelby (pictured) where he made the shocking discovery. The bomb was deactivated and sent to a lab. Federal investigators are inspecting the device, looking for clues as to who made it. Another bomb was discovered in the same area six months ago. In 2009, authorities discovered two homemade bombs several days apart in Shelby. None of those cases has been solved. Cannon said he and other local residents are concerned that whoever is making the bombs will eventually hurt someone. Even though he could have been seriously injured or killed, Cannon said he is happy he picked the bear up out of the road. 'If a kid had walked down the road and seen that bear, I'm pretty sure they would have picked it up,' he said.","completion":"A man in North Carolina found a teddy bear on the road while delivering newspapers.
