American pressmen had been alerted to an upcoming Buddhist demonstration to coincide with Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda in the north of Saigon. The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diem's regime, with the images of the burning Thich Quang Duc on the front pages still fresh in the minds of the public. Halberstam's report estimated that the altercation lasted for around ten minutes and also admitted that the pressmen had tried to apprehend the policeman who had smashed Browne's camera but were shielded by the rock-wielding policeman's colleagues.

Of course, it wasn’t too long ago that the nation’s angst was focused on Goldman Sachs Group and the SEC’s civil suit against the Wall street investment bank. Naturally, the questions arises, who has it worse BP or Goldman? The company behind one of the largest oil spills in U.S. history or the Wall Street investment firm accused of failing to properly disclose details about a mortgage securities deal? BP will likely face more harm from the spill than Goldman will from its Abacus deal. Just look at the pictures. For nearly two months, televisions across the world have been running 24-hour web cams showing millions of gallons of crude oil spewing relentlessly in the blue waters of the Gulf of Mexico, killing wildlife and leaving tar bars on white sandy beaches. This endless reel of environment disaster images may not turn away customers from BP gas pumps (especially if BP keeps its prices lower than competitors), but it certainly hasn’t endeared the company to another important constituent: regulators. BP is the largest operator of offshore oil rigs in the Gulf, and it will need regulatory approve to keep expanding its business here. The British company had planned 10 new offshore projects in the Gulf this year. Its chances for obtaining those permits now look quite slim. President Obama said Monday he was looking for someones a– to kick over the spill, which pundits have said is now a political test of the presidents toughness. The last gigantic oil spill  the 1989 grounding of the Exxon Valdez — occurred 21 years ago, under a less environmentally hawkish administration of George H.W. Bush and before environmental issues had gained mainstream political appeal. But in today’s political environment, lawmakers and/or regulators may be more inclined to impose draconian restrictions on BPs future U.S. business. Then there is the issue of cost. Some estimates have pegged litigation and clean-up costs at 40 billion, which is about three times BP’s annual profit. That is real money, and accounts for more than half of the 74 billion in BP lost markets value since the spill began. By comparison, one estimate has put the cost of a Goldman settlement with the SEC at around 600 million, a mere wrist slap and fraction of the company’s annual earnings. Of course, Goldman has lost about 12 billion in market value since the SEC charges were announced in mid April. But the investment bank’s stock can retrace those losses if the capital and financial markets improve. Much of Goldmans profits are generated from its trading prowess. That will likely remain strong regardless of the outcome of the SEC case. To be sure, Goldmans reputation has been tarnished by the Abacus deal  which at its heart accuses the firm of selling a product that it believed was faulty. But that cant compete with the images of oil drenched pelicans and the underwater geyser that keeps spewing and spewing. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article talks about two big companies, BP and Goldman Sachs, who both had some trouble. BP had a big oil spill in the ocean that hurt animals and the environment, and Goldman Sachs had some problems with the way they handled money. The article thinks that BP has it worse because the oil spill can cause a lot of damage and cost them a lot of money to fix it. It also says that people might not trust BP as much in the future. Goldman Sachs might lose some money and their reputation, but they can still make a lot of money from other parts of their business."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. Given an abstract, indicate which of the provided candidate titles (Option1 and Option2) best describes it (respond with the text of the title, not option1/2). Abstract: It has been assumed that the molecular weight (MW) cut-off of a newly fabricated polysulfone capillary dialyzer (F60, Fresenius, FRG) is similar to that of the human glomerulus. We recently tested the device in vivo and found this not to be so, based on the device's ability to eliminate substances of a MW of 10,000 to 60,000 daltons. One of the reasons for this discrepancy was found to be the influence of secondary membrane formation on solute permeability. Endogenous marker substances of a defined MW (beta 2-microglobulin, myoglobin, RBP, alpha 1-microglobulin, acid alpha 1-glycoprotein, alpha 1-antitrypsin, prealbumin, and albumin were measured by laser nephelometry or radioimmune assay; sieving coefficients (SC) and protein eliminations were calculated for each low MW protein.

He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965.

The Flirts, comprised of Tricia Wygal, Debra \\"Debbie\\" Gaynor, and Christina Criscione, created music that spanned a range of emotions and captured the essence of the 1980s synth-pop and Hi-NRG dance genre. Bobby Orlando, the mastermind behind The Flirts, was a prolific producer and songwriter who collaborated with many artists during the '80s and '90s. With Orlando and Clifton \\"Jiggs\\" Chase's contribution to the songwriting for \\"You & Me,\\" The Flirts could deliver a memorable and vibrant performance, which contributed to the success of the single. The album \\"Blondes, Brunettes, and Redheads,\\" from which \\"You & Me\\" was taken, showcases the group's versatility and infectious energy.

In conclusion, it is accurate to infer that \\"You & Me\\" by The Flirts was about 15 years old in the year 2000. Given its release in 1985 as part of the \\"Blondes, Brunettes, and Redheads\\" album, this single remains a testament to the creative collaboration of Bobby Orlando, Clifton \\"Jiggs\\" Chase, and the talented vocalists who made up The Flirts at the time of this release."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the given situation, the person is dissatisfied with the varying size of the cake slices handed out, which indicates an underlying concern for equitable distribution. Let us carefully analyze the provided options to understand why \\"fairness\\" is the most suitable answer. 1. Fairness - This option is the most relevant because it addresses the core problem in the scenario. The person demands equitable treatment when it comes to the distribution of cake slices. A sense of fairness ensures that everyone receives a similar share of something, thereby reducing potential conflicts or dissatisfaction. 2. Candies - While candies are a sweet treat, they do not directly address the person's concern in this situation. The issue is not with the presence of additional treats, but with the unequal distribution of the cake slices. 3. Compliments - Compliments do not resolve the problem at hand. Although they might make the person feel better momentarily, the primary issue of unequal cake distribution persists. 4. Well fed - The term \\"well fed\\" indicates that people are adequately nourished and satisfied with their food consumption. However, it does not address the specific issue of unequal cake distribution. Instead, it focuses on the general state of being content with one's food intake. 5. Arguments - Demanding more arguments in this situation is counterproductive. Arguing does not result in a resolution or address the person's unhappiness with the unequal cake slices. On the contrary, it may escalate tensions and create an uncomfortable atmosphere. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"fairness\\" as the answer to the question because it directly tackles the problem in the scenario - the varying size of cake slices handed out. By demanding fairness, the person seeks a solution that ensures an equitable distribution of cake, promoting harmony and satisfaction among everyone present.

He points out that female turtles may be able to cope with a shortage of males because they are able to store sperm. This means they can go long periods of time without encountering a male and still reproduce regularly. On top of this males are able to mate with multiple females during one season meaning there does not necessarily need to be equal numbers of males and females for populations to thrive says LaloÃ« .

Q: What is the term for the smallest blood vessels? Choices: - muscles - Aortas - arteries - capillaries A: Answer:","completion":"The term for the smallest blood vessels is capillaries. As mentioned in the given paragraph, capillaries are the tiniest blood vessels that play an essential role in connecting the smallest arteries (arterioles) and veins (venules). They function as a crucial link in the circulatory system and facilitate the exchange of substances between cells and the blood. The walls of capillaries are incredibly thin, sometimes only one cell thick. This allows for efficient transfer of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and the tissue cells. Among the choices provided: 1. Muscles - They are not blood vessels; instead, they are a type of soft tissue that facilitates movement by contraction and provide support to the body. 2. Aortas - Although they are blood vessels, more specifically, the aorta is the largest and main artery in the body that carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. 3. Arteries - These are blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to various parts of the body. Arteries come in different sizes, but the smallest ones are called arterioles, and these connect to capillaries. 4.

Marginal utility refers to the additional satisfaction a consumer gains from consuming one more unit of a good or service. Generally, as a person consumes more of a good or service, their marginal utility tends to decrease. This is known as the law of diminishing marginal utility. It suggests that the first few units of consumption yield greater satisfaction than the subsequent units. In the case of Greg and David, since Greg is in poverty, an additional unit of a good or service would provide him with greater satisfaction compared to David, who is already wealthy and has access to more resources.

A distraction can even make the pain non-existent for some babies, because before the baby even realizes what is going on, the shot will have already been administered. You can give your baby a new toy to play with or sing a song to him/her. You can also try telling your baby a funny story or reading him/her a book. Another good distraction for your baby may be cartoons. If your doctor has a TV in the examination room, tune it in to some cartoons. Your baby may become engulfed in the show and may forget why he/she is even there. If your doctor doesn’t have a TV in the examination room, ask your doctor if it is okay for you to bring your own. You can bring in a portable DVD player with your baby’s favorite show or movie. Studies have shown that if you give your baby something sweet to eat right before the vaccination, it will help to ease the pain. This trick can be used on small babies as well, by simply dipping their pacifier in some sugary water. Older babies and toddlers can suck on a lollipop. Try using a skin numbing cream to help reduce the amount of pain your baby will experience. There are a few good creams out there that will help numb the skin and keep the nerves from releasing pain signals to your baby’s brain. Make sure that you apply the cream approximately one hour before the procedure to make sure it has time to work. Check with your doctor about which cream is recommended for your baby. Your baby will feed off of your energy and if you are overly stressed then your baby will be stressed also. It is not necessary to try to explain to your baby that the shot is necessary, because your baby will not understand any of what you are saying in that moment. If your baby starts protesting the shot, it is important that you stand firm and remain calm. Never become angry with your baby and always speak in a calm, soothing tone.","completion":"The given text discusses various methods to make vaccinations easier and less painful for babies. One of the most common and effective techniques discussed is using distractions to divert the baby's attention away from the pain. Examples of distractions include giving the baby a new toy, singing a song, telling a funny story, reading a book, or watching cartoons. If the doctor's examination room has a TV, tuning into cartoons could help the baby to forget their reason for being there. Alternatively, parents can bring a portable DVD player with the baby's favorite show or movie. Another helpful approach is offering something sweet, such as sugary water on a pacifier for small babies or a lollipop for older infants. This has been proven to help ease pain during vaccinations. Moreover, using skin numbing creams can also contribute to pain reduction, as they numb the skin and prevent the nerves from sending pain signals to the baby's brain. Parents should consult with the doctor about which cream is recommended for their baby and apply it an hour before the procedure to ensure it works effectively. The text also highlights the importance of parents being calm during vaccinations, as babies can sense and mimic their parent's stress. It is unnecessary to try explaining the purpose of the shot, since the baby won't understand the situation. If the baby protests, it is crucial for parents to remain firm and calm, avoiding anger and speaking in a soothing tone throughout the process.

Plot title: The Smurfs and the Magic Flute Movie plot: Based upon the 9th album (\\"The Flute with Six Smurfs\\") of the Belgian comic-strip, \\"Johan and Peewit,\\" which featured the very first appearance of the Smurfs.The story takes place in the Middle-Ages. After young squire Sir Johan wins in a jousting tournament in his kingdom, his friend Peewit, the kingdom's court jester dwarf, celebrates by singing a victory song, with only one problem; he is so terrible a singer he drives the whole kingdom into hiding (not to mention attracting a powerful thunderstorm), and only Johan was kind enough to escort Peewit back to the castle in the rain.The next morning, a musical instrument merchant arrives in front of the castle to sell instruments to Peewit, but only the nameless King and Johann are present to meet him. After being offered some obnoxious instruments, Johan and the King angrily send off the merchant, who accidentally leaves behind one of the instruments offered - a peculiar flute with only 6 holes! When Peewit almost takes notice, Johann and the King sneak the flute off into the castle to destroy it before he can find it. They throw it in the King's fireplace, but the fire emanates green smoke that permeates the King's room! Peewit is among those who try to put the fire out, and much to the dismay of Johan and the King, he finds the flute in the ashes. But once Peewit cleans the flute and goes around the kingdom playing it, he is delighted to make a surprising discovery; once played, the flute causes anyone who hears it to dance uncontrollably and subsequently pass out from exhaustion. Just as Peewit is enjoying tormenting everyone with this newfound gift, the same merchant as before is offering instruments to the owner of a bar in town. When he is worried to notice (and mentions) that the odd 6-holed flute he had was missing, he is overheard by a shady bearded fat man named Matthew Oilycreep (AKA: Matthew McCreep), who makes inquiries about the flute to the merchant, who recalls that he dropped it at the front of the kingdom while offering it to Peewit.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Grongar Hill is located in the Welsh county of Carmarthenshire and was the subject of a loco-descriptive poem by John Dyer. Published in two versions in 1726, during the Augustan period, its celebration of the individual experience of the landscape makes it a precursor of Romanticism. As a prospect poem, it has been the subject of continuing debate over how far it meets artistic canons. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? John Dyer was influenced by the landscape in his poetry.","completion":"Yes, the sentence certainly follows the preceding text. The text details how John Dyer's poem \\"Grongar Hill\\" was a loco-descriptive piece. This means that it was a type of poem that dwells on the particulars of a specific location; in this case, the geographic location of Grongar Hill in Carmarthenshire, Wales. What the poem does is not just describe the setting in accurate geographic details but also convey the poet's subjective response and experience of that landscape — an approach that was later to become a defining characteristic of the Romantic movement in literature. Dyer's focus on the landscape in his poetry, as evidenced in \\"Grongar Hill,\\" suggests a deep appreciation for and connection with nature. This is indicative of some form of influence the physical environment had on his work. The way Dyer brings to life the landscape and interweaves it with his own feelings and sensibilities implies that the landscape held a significant place in his creative process. Moreover, the text acknowledges that Dyer's poem preceded the Romantic period, an era known for its profound emphasis on emotion, individualism, and the beauty of nature. The deep emotional resonance that Dyer's poem gives to a specific landscape — Grongar Hill — demonstrates how the surroundings could affect him emotionally, shaping his poetic vision, and thereby influencing his work. Additionally, the text further alludes to the debates over how well the poem accomplishes the standards of prospect poetry. Prospect poetry, another genre where landscape plays a critical role, further supports the claim that Dyer was influenced by the landscape in his poetry. Though the nature of influence may differ — with spectator-like observation in prospect poetry vs. active emotional engagement in Romanticism — the constant variable here is the undeniable role played by the physical environment in influencing Dyer's poetry. In conclusion, the sentence that John Dyer was influenced by the landscape in his poetry does indeed follow and align with the preceding text. His work, \\"Grongar Hill,\\" is exemplary of a poet deeply touched by the vista of a physical realm, and through his verses, he transmits this appreciation onto his readers, further enhancing the acknowledgment of landscape's influence in his poetry. It is perhaps not just the physical reality of the landscape, but also its interconnections with human experiences and emotions that constituted his poems, indicating a considerable influence of the landscape on his poetry."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Make an effort to eat less than you’re currently eating. Reduce your daily calorie intake gradually for the first week or so, then stick with an approximate amount that will allow you to lose weight without leaving you feeling totally wiped out. Counting calories isn’t a lot of fun, and it definitely requires discipline in the long run, but it’s a surefire way to achieve a leaner physique. The most elementary rule of dieting is that if you burn more calories than you consume, you’ll lose weight. Consult with a nutritionist, keep a food journal or use a calorie-counting app like MyFitnessPal to track the nutritional value of the food you eat and calculate how many calories you need to keep making progress. In order to keep your calorie intake low, the first things you should eliminate from your diet are salty, sugary, overly-processed foods and snacks. Say goodbye to French fries, pizza, cake and candy. Sweets and fatty foods contain more concentrated doses of calories per serving size, which means you can eat them in the same portions as other healthier foods and still gain weight. Junk food is a death trap for those seeking to lower their body fat percentage. The food you eat should be grilled, baked, broiled or steamed. Stay away from fatty additives like butter and oil. One simple way to drastically reduce the number of calories you’re getting is to stop eating fast food and drinking soda. This allows most people to lose an additional 2-3 pounds a week. Low-calorie, filling food are key to your success. 400 calories of vegetables will fill you to the brim while 400 calories of oil or fried chicken will leave you wanting more. Know what to eat to trick your body into telling you it's finished. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy and lean meats are all low-calorie dense foods that will help you lose weight. Fruits and veggies are mostly water-based and contain very few calories and very little fat--on the other hand, 1 g of fat is nine calories in itself. So stay away from processed goods and go green. And red, orange, blue, and yellow. Fiber is great for you, too, and only has 1.5-2.5 calories per gram. Most legumes, nuts, and seeds are excellent sources of this. 4 oz of lean chicken is good for you...until you slather it with butter and Colby-Jack. When preparing meat, take the skin off and trim the fat. And don't coat it in bread crumbs or other unnecessary additives. Don’t deep fry any food. Even if it's a vegetable; it loses its nutritional value when fried. Steam your food instead and add lots of spice. Steaming your food instead of frying it will cut down on fat and calories, and spices will spike your metabolism. Starving yourself is not the key to losing fat -- it's choosing the right foods that will burn the fat for you. Throw out the junk in your pantry and stock up on the good stuff: Fatty fish high in omega-3s help reduce the levels of leptin in your body. And that guy keeps hunger at bay and ups your metabolism. If you're not a seafood fan, talk to your doctor about taking fish oil supplements. Not as good as the natural thing, but still beneficial. An apple a day keeps the fat at bay. Apples are full of pectin, which reduces the amount of fat your body absorbs. They're also fiber-full and calorie-low, so they're really the perfect snack. Did we mention delicious? Add ginger and garlic to your meals. Ginger widens your blood vessels, garlic lowers your insulin levels, and both increase your metabolic rate. Use olive oil as your primary cooking oil. Even though oil is fat, olive oil is full of the good kind (monounsaturated) that helps lower cholesterol levels, and has many other health benefits, too. Water is the breath of life and of weight loss. Minimize your appetite (and clear your skin!) by drinking morning, noon, and night. Drink two glasses of water before every meal. You will feel fuller faster (say that three times fast) and not have room for more calories. While each person's hydration needs are different, the Institute of Medicine advises that men and women try to consume about 3.7 and 2.7 liters of water a day, respectively, including water found in food and other beverages . Green tea is a good idea, too. It's loaded with antioxidants and may help increase your metabolic rate. Whatever you do, cut out the sodas and alcohol. They're just empty calories that pack on the pounds silently without even making you feel full. Eating 5 to 7 small meals a day leads to quicker weight loss than any other meal routine. You will feel fuller all day, removing the urge to overeat. Keep your snacks healthy. Measure out portions of your favorite healthy snacks (carrots, grapes, nuts, or yogurt) and package them for easy access throughout the week. Instead of working all day, you'll be working and snacking, keeping your metabolism up. Don't skip breakfast! Your body needs that kick in the morning to get reminded to get going. Not only will you be more likely to lose weight, you'll probably keep it off too .","completion":"The article focuses on strategies for losing weight by reducing calorie intake, making healthier food choices, increasing metabolism through certain foods and spices, staying hydrated, and maintaining a consistent meal schedule."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Women in some communities are denied \\"even their basic rights as British residents\\", the Casey Review said. Dame Louise Casey accused public bodies of ignoring or condoning divisive or harmful religious practices for fear of being called racist. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said he would study the findings \\"closely\\". Dame Louise's review into the integration of minorities was commissioned by former Prime Minister David Cameron as part of the government's efforts to tackle extremism. Among her recommendations were that immigrants could take \\"an oath of integration with British values and society\\" and schoolchildren be taught British values. Her review said there was a sense that people from different backgrounds got on well together at a general level, but community cohesion \\"did not feel universally strong across the country\\". She found \\"high levels of social and economic isolation in some places, and cultural and religious practices in communities that are not only holding some of our citizens back, but run contrary to British values and sometimes our laws\\". Her report highlighted the plight of women in some Muslim communities, who she said were less likely to speak English and more likely to be kept at home. \\"Misogyny and patriarchy has to come to an end,\\" Dame Louise said, adding that public institutions must not fear being branded racist or Islamophobic. Faeeza Vaid, from the Muslim Women's Network, said migrant communities should not be blamed for failing to integrate. \\"We also see segregated white communities,\\" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. \\"Integration is everyone's responsibility.\\" Halima Begum, a Muslim woman from London, said she was \\"worried\\" that the report singled out Muslim men. \\"There is a problem with men and I see it,\\" she told the BBC's Asian Network. \\"We need to have an open debate without placing too much blame on communities.\\" Afraid of being dubbed racist, afraid of losing support, afraid of challenging minority communities - that is Dame Louise Casey's view of Britain's decision-makers. Criticising politicians and officials is the easy bit. The significance of this report is that it targets individual communities and faiths. It contrasts with the language of people living \\"parallel lives\\" - a term used in an earlier report and designed to be neutral, placing no more blame on one community than another. Dame Louise makes clear her outrage at what she calls \\"regressive practices\\" targeting women and girls. She accepts she is putting Muslim areas under the spotlight. The question for Dame Louise - an official not immune to criticism herself - is how would she achieve change? What if an elected politician refused to take her oath? What if some people - of whatever community - simply prefer to live and educate their children separately? Iqbal Bhana, a government adviser on anti-Muslim hate crime, rejected the report's claim that Britain was becoming more segregated. \\"I don't think we are divided,\\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \\"If you go to places like Bradford or Leicester you see second and third-generation people moving out of some of these communities.\\" During her research, Dame Louise spoke to women in areas of Birmingham and Manchester that she said could not leave their homes without their husband's permission. She blamed those in authority for \\"ducking the issue\\" of women's inequality out of a wish to respect different cultures. 4.1m population increase 2001-11 50%+ of the increase is due to immigration 2.8m people in Britain are Muslim - the biggest religious group after Christians 70-85% of the populations in some wards in Blackburn, Birmingham, Burnley and Bradford are Muslim 511 schools in 43 areas take more than 50% pupils from Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds 27% of births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK \\"If [the women] were white and living in Surrey, we would all be up in arms about it,\\" she said. She said not talking about these issues would only \\"give ammunition to the extreme far-right and Islamic extremists\\", who are the people \\"who set out to divide us\\". Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on social integration, agreed that division had bred extremism and was \\"sapping our communities of trust\\". Immigration was another theme in the report, in which Dame Louise said some towns and cities were \\"struggling to adjust\\" to an influx of foreign nationals. On a visit to Sheffield, she said, she had found some schools were coping with an increase in Eastern European children from 150 to nearly 2,500 over a five-year period. The report also highlighted a \\"persistent disadvantage\\" facing black men in the workplace, as well as white working class children on free meals who underperformed at school. The report made 12 recommendations, including: Mr Javid said Britain had \\"long been home to lots of different cultures and communities\\", but added that \\"all of us have to be part of one society\\". While it was right to celebrate the \\"positive contribution\\" diverse groups make to British life, nobody should be excluded from it or left behind, he said. \\"We need to take a serious look at the facts and must not shy away from the challenges we face. \\"Dame Louise's report is a valuable contribution, and I will be studying her findings closely.\\" He said he would be reporting back in the New Year.

In 1683, the Holy League of Austria, Poland, Venice, and Russia was formed to oppose the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Empire suffered defeat at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 and was forced to withdraw rapidly from Central Europe. The defeat and the chaotic situation within the Ottoman Empire created widespread social disruption in the Central Balkans, particularly in the regions of Skopje and Niš, where Karposh's rebellion originated. On 25 October 1689, the Austrian branch of the Holy League, led by General Piccolomini, reached the Plain of Skopje and were met with rejoicing by the inhabitants of the villages there. The same day, Piccolomini began a withdrawal of his forces, and on October 26, set fire to the city. Skopje burned for two whole days, through the 26th and 27 October. Most of the city of Skopje was destroyed in the fire.

Do virtual particles and energy in vacuum really exist? How do we know if they exist if we can't observe them? Where are they? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Possible answers: A). no B). yes","completion":"To answer your questions, let's go through them step-by-step and provide justifications for each step. 1. Are vacuum fluctuations an energy in a vacuum? Are these virtual particles? Step 1: Define vacuum fluctuations and virtual particles. Vacuum fluctuations refer to the temporary changes in energy that occur in empty space due to the principles of quantum mechanics. Virtual particles, on the other hand, are short-lived particles that form spontaneously in a vacuum as a result of these fluctuations. Step 2: Connect vacuum fluctuations and virtual particles. Since vacuum fluctuations cause the creation of virtual particles, we can conclude that they are energy in a vacuum. 2. How do we know there is this energy if virtual particles didn't exist? Do they really exist? Step 1: Discuss evidence for virtual particles. Although virtual particles are difficult to observe directly, their existence has been inferred through their effects on measurable quantities, such as the Casimir effect and the Lamb shift. Step 2: Conclude on the existence of virtual particles. Based on this indirect evidence, we can argue that virtual particles exist. 3. Do virtual particles and energy in vacuum really exist? How do we know if they exist if we can't observe them? Where are they? Step 1: Reiterate the existence of virtual particles and vacuum energy. As stated earlier, the existence of virtual particles and vacuum energy has been inferred from their indirect effects on measurable quantities. Step 2: Explain the difficulty in direct observation. Direct observation of virtual particles is challenging because they are short-lived and only exist for a brief period. Step 3: Describe the location of virtual particles. Virtual particles are present throughout the vacuum of space since vacuum fluctuations occur everywhere. 4. Are the questions the same? Comparing the content of the questions, they are related but not the same. The first and second questions inquire about the vacuum fluctuations and virtual particles, while the third question delves more deeply into the existence and observation of virtual particles and vacuum energy.

(CNN) -- A federal appeals court has upheld an obstruction of justice conviction against Barry Bonds, according to court documents released Friday. The court ruled that the evasiveness of the testimony the former baseball star gave to a grand jury investigating sales of performance-enhancing drugs was sufficient to convict him. In an opinion filed by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Mary M. Schroeder said the three-judge panel rejected Bonds' contention that he could only have been indicted for obstruction if his testimony had been flatly false. Attorneys for Bonds had argued that Bonds' statements to the grand jury were factually true, and that language in the federal statute under which he was charged is unconstitutionally vague. The appeals court rejected that argument. \\"When factually true statements are misleading or evasive, they can prevent the grand jury from obtaining truthful and responsive answers,\\" Schroeder wrote. \\"They may therefore obstruct and impede the administration of justice within the meaning of the federal criminal statute.\\" Bonds' testimony in December 2003 was part of an investigation that targeted his personal trainer, Greg Anderson, and employees of the California drug testing laboratory known as the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, or BALCO. The testimony that led to Bonds' conviction came when a grand jury prosecutor asked Bonds whether Anderson ever gave him \\"anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with.\\" Bonds told the grand jury that only his personal doctors \\"ever touch me,\\" and he then veered off the subject to say he never talked baseball with Anderson. 1.

We have 4 times some number (q) equal to -8 times that same number (q). The problem looks like this: 4*q = -8*q. Now, to find the value of q, we want to get q by itself on one side of the equal sign. First, we can subtract 4*q from both sides of the equation to get rid of it on the left side. So, we have: 4*q - 4*q = -8*q - 4*q This simplifies to: 0 = -12*q Now, we want to find what q is, so we will divide both sides of the equation by -12: 0 ÷ -12 = (-12*q) ÷ -12 This leaves us with: 0 = q So, the answer is q = 0.

There are many types of dance, such as ballet, hip-hop, contemporary, salsa, ballroom, and more. Think about what kind of music you enjoy and what sort of movements you may feel comfortable with. 2. Research the dance style: Once you've chosen a dance style, spend some time researching it. Look into its history, techniques, and well-known dancers or choreographers in that genre. Familiarize yourself with the basic movements and terminology to better understand it. 3. Find a learning resource: You can learn to dance through various methods, such as in-person lessons, online tutorials, or group classes. Choose a learning resource that suits your needs and preferences. Search for dance studios in your area or find online dance tutorials or lessons on platforms like YouTube or paid membership websites. 4. Dress appropriately: Wearing comfortable and appropriate clothing is important for dancing. Choose clothes that allow you to move freely and don't restrict your movements. Depending on the dance style, you may also need specific footwear like ballet slippers, tap shoes, or heels. 5. Warm-up and stretch: Before starting any dance practice, it's essential to warm up your body and stretch your muscles to prevent injury. Do some light cardio, like jogging in place or jumping jacks, followed by gentle stretches for your arms, legs, and back. 6. Break down the steps: Start by learning the basic moves or steps of your chosen dance style. Break each step down into smaller parts, focusing on foot placement, body positioning, and timing. Practice each movement slowly and deliberately until you feel comfortable performing it. 7. Practice regularly: Consistency is key when learning to dance. Set aside time each day or week to practice dancing, even if it's just for a few minutes. The more you practice, the more comfortable you will feel with the dance steps and movements. 8. Use a mirror: Watching yourself dance in a mirror can help you identify areas where you may need improvement. Focus on your posture, foot placement, and overall technique. If possible, record yourself dancing and review the footage to see where you can improve. 9. Get feedback: If you can, ask a friend, family member or dance instructor for feedback on your dancing. They may be able to offer helpful tips or identify areas where you could improve. 10. Be patient: Learning to dance takes time and practice.

The passengers were evacuated and taken on to the French terminal. Long delays and queues continued all day. The broken down train reached France at 17:15 BST where passengers were reunited with their cars. A spokesman for Eurotunnel said services should run normally on Tuesday. There were also delays on Eurostar passenger services, with delays and cancellations on trains between London St Pancras and Paris and Brussels. Eurotunnel said a fault with the overhead power lines in the tunnel caused the problem. The driver brought the train, which carries people through the Channel Tunnel in their cars, to a stop and passengers were evacuated into the middle service tunnel, which runs between the two main tunnels and is designed to allow people to escape from halted trains. A train was brought from France along the other main tunnel and parked alongside the stopped train to allow passengers to board it and be carried to France without their cars. Passenger Richard Byrom, from Maidstone, told BBC Radio Kent: \\"All of a sudden I heard this crashing noise, it didn't sound like the train itself had crashed but what became evident later on was that the power cables had got entangled or come down. \\"For about 20 minutes the train just stopped and we didn't know what had happened. \\"Eventually they said they are going to take us off the train because they couldn't move our train because it was trapped by the power cables or something like that.\\" He said the passengers had to wait in the service tunnel for about half an hour before boarding the train that took them to France and he had been stuck for about four hours in total. He said they were given an evacuation pack of a pen, notepad, playing cards, torch, fan, water and wet wipes. Another passenger, Brian Tait from Dover, said earlier the process had been \\"civilised\\" but added: \\"Communication has been bad, we have not heard when we will get our car back, it's all been word of mouth.\\" Luke Chaplin, who said he was starting a holiday with his wife that was a wedding present, said: \\"We've been given water and a sandwich, just one sandwich. Nobody has said anything about compensation.\\" Dean Bacon, from Bewdleyin Worcestershire, said: \\"This unfortunate incident has led to a total shambles, highlighting extremely poor evacuation methods and equipment. \\"After the incident happened it took four-and-a-half hours before we got out of the tunnel. \\"The evacuation train was a basic freight train and did not have any facility to cater if there was anyone with any injuries.\\" He said things had been \\"extremely difficult\\" for families with young children. \\"There were dogs barking, old people who had to stand for long periods with no clear evacuation plan,\\" he added. The train was only about seven miles into its 30 mile tunnel route when it stopped and the spokesman said it would have been quicker to tow it back to Kent but the company chose to take it to France so passengers could be reunited with their cars. Eurotunnel continued to run Le Shuttle services in the one unblocked tunnel with trains running in one direction for 90 minutes and then in the opposite direction for 90 minutes. The firm said there was a waiting time of about three hours at the terminal. Eurostar, which operates passenger trains through the tunnel running between London and Paris and Brussels, cancelled a number of services in each direction and warned passengers on trains that were running to expect delays. There had been concern the delays would affect the Tour de France with teams heading to France after finishing the third stage in London but cyclists flew to France on Monday evening on four chartered planes from London City Airport. P&O Ferries was preparing to transport the Tour's entourage earlier. The fourth stage is set to begin in Le Touquet on Tuesday. Brian Rees, from the ferry company, said: \\"We've got something like 1,100 Tour vehicles coming through the course of the afternoon and into the evening.\\" Michael and Catherine Pike, from south-east London, said they had been stranded in a car park in Calais for about three hours. Mrs Pike, 80, said: \\"We were hoping to catch a ferry but haven't heard a peep out of anybody at all. \\"There is food but nobody says a word.\\" Eurotunnel apologised for the delays and said it had tried to keep customers moving. Eurostar said four trains would be cancelled on Tuesday morning. In a statement, Eurostar said: \\"Eurotunnel engineers are working to resolve the issues and restore full power to the affected section of the Tunnel. \\"The latest operational update from Eurotunnel suggests that these works will continue until 06:00 BST on Tuesday 8 July, when the Tunnel will partially reopen. As a consequence of the ongoing loss of power, Eurotunnel has informed Eurostar that some further disruption should be expected to services tomorrow morning.\\" Summary:","completion":"A train called Le Shuttle had a problem and stopped in a big tunnel between England and France. There were 382 people on the train, and they all had to get off and wait for another train to come and take them the rest of the way to France. This made a lot of people have to wait a long time for their turn to go through the tunnel. Some people were also worried they wouldn't get their cars back right away. The company that runs the train said a problem with the power lines was the reason the train stopped. They said they are sorry for the trouble and are working to fix it so the trains can run properly again."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sinclair, from Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, had been on trial at Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court. He will appeal against the conviction. District Judge David Parsons said the offence had \\"enormous\\" potential to deter other victims from coming forward. The prosecution claimed during his trial last month that by including details of the relationship between the victim and defendant in a court report about a man convicted of voyeurism, along with other details, the article contained enough information to allow the public to make a jigsaw identification of the woman. Judge Parsons said the defendant in the case lived in a small village and when \\"coupled with local knowledge\\", work colleagues, friends, relatives and acquaintances, could have identified her after reading the article. Finding Sinclair guilty, the judge said: \\"The protection of victims of sexual offences is a matter of considerable concern. \\"This court must be mindful of the real psychological harm to the victim, harm confirmed by this victim in her victim impact statement.\\" The court heard Sinclair accepted publishing the story but denied it was likely to lead to the woman's identification and said she would not have known about the article had it not been for his prosecution. In a statement read out in court, the victim said she had been told before the sex offence trial that her details would not be made public. She said: \\"Finding out about the article has set me back and means the stress of this case is not over as it means there is now another court case involving me.\\" During his trial in April, Matthew Paul, defending Sinclair, said there was little risk of the victim being identified because only around 0.68% of the county's population - or about 450 people - read the paper. At Friday's sentencing hearing, he said circulation had increased to 3,200 but advertising revenue had been \\"dented\\" by \\"the running of the defence in this case\\". Mr Paul added: \\"It is regretted by Mr Sinclair that this slipped through the net. He did not himself have any particular role in reading it ... he skim read it at best.\\" Sinclair was fined £1,500 and ordered to pay the victim £1,500 compensation, costs of £500 and a surcharge of £150.

Its main target, among a range of geographical and scientific objectives, was to be first to the South Pole. This was not attained, but the expedition's southern march reached a Farthest South latitude of 88° 23' S, just from the pole. This was by far the longest southern polar journey to that date and a record convergence on either Pole. A separate group led by Welsh Australian geology professor Edgeworth David reached the estimated location of the South Magnetic Pole, and the expedition also achieved the first ascent of Mount Erebus, Antarctica's second highest volcano. - Dumfries (; possibly from ) is a market town and former royal burgh within the Dumfries and Galloway council area of Scotland.

Dumfries is nicknamed \\"Queen of the South\\". People from Dumfries are known colloquially as \\"Doonhamers\\". - The Solway Firth is a firth that forms part of the border between England and Scotland, between Cumbria (including the Solway Plain) and Dumfries and Galloway.

At first , manufacture of all the cars previously made by the two companies was continued along with those made under the Galloway badge but in 1928 a rationalisation was carried out . The cars were complex and expensive and sales were poor resulting in the company going into receivership in 1929 and finally closing in 1931 . The company was responsible for making the body for Sir Malcolm Campbell 's Blue Bird car in 1929 and an Arrol - Aster car was entered in the 1931 24 Hours of Le Mans . - Arrol-Johnston (later known as Arrol-Aster) was an early Scottish manufacturer of automobiles, which operated from 1896 to 1931 and produced the first automobile manufactured in Britain.

Michael John Franco, 45, faces life without the possibility of parole for the alleged murder of Jill Grant, 41, a popular Palm Desert High School math teacher whose body was found at the Golf Club at Terra Lago in the early morning hours of Dec. 23, 2013. In addition to murder, Franco faces special circumstance allegations of inflicting torture on Grant and committing the murder in the commission of a felony, initially making him eligible for the death penalty. In August 2015, prosecutors decided not to pursue capital punishment against him. Franco also faces one felony count each of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm and carrying a loaded firearm, and sentence-enhancing allegations of using a deadly weapon in the commission of a felony. Grant's body was found by golf course employees, who told Indio police that an SUV sped off from the scene, leaving tire marks along the course. Grant was found with numerous injuries; the criminal complaint lists a Toyota Prius and a box cutter as weapons used in the killing. Investigators said a search conducted the following day at Grant's residence in the 84-400 block of Onda Drive in Indio revealed blood on several items throughout the house and shoe prints consistent with impressions found at the crime scene, according to court records. Franco was taken into custody on Dec. 24, 2013 in Palm Desert. Police said in court documents that Franco had to be Tased before being taken into custody following \\"a short scuffle\\" and told police that he was trying to get to Mexico before they caught him. Franco remains held in lieu of 5 million bail. According to the criminal complaint, he was convicted of felony robbery in Alameda County in June 1990, but has no felony convictions in Riverside County. - City News Service / Image via Shutterstock ||||| Indio Police Department Indio Police Department INDIO, Calif. - A 44-year-old ex-con pleaded not guilty Thursday to murdering his girlfriend, a Coachella Valley native and popular Palm Desert High School math teacher.

Grant suffered multiple injuries; the criminal complaint lists a Toyota Prius and a box cutter as weapons used in the killing. Sherry Johnstone, assistant superintendent for personnel at the Desert Sands Unified School District, said in 2013 that Grant was \`\`a beloved teacher and part of the Desert Sands family for many years.'' \`\`We are grief-stricken -- students, faculty, staff ... Everyone loved Jill and this is a horrible tragedy,'' she said. Grant grew up in the Santa Rosa Mountains above Palm Springs and attended Palm Desert Middle School and Palm Desert High School, graduating in 1990. She attended College of the Desert, then transferred to Cal State San Bernardino, where she majored in mathematics. She taught math at Palm Springs High School for three years, starting in 1995, then began teaching at her alma mater in 1998.

Halévy about completing his old tutor's unfinished opera Noé. Although no action was taken at that time, Bizet remained on friendly terms with the Halévy family. Fromental had left two daughters; the elder, Esther, died in 1864, an event which so traumatised Mme. Halévy that she could not tolerate the company of her younger daughter Geneviève, who from the age of 15 lived with other family members. It is unclear when Geneviève and Bizet became emotionally attached, but in October 1867, he informed Galabert: \\"I have met an adorable girl whom I love! In two years she will be my wife!\\" The pair became engaged, although the Halévy family initially disallowed the match. According to Bizet they considered him an unsuitable catch: \\"penniless, left-wing, anti-religious and Bohemian\\", which Dean observes are odd grounds of objection from \\"a family bristling with artists and eccentrics\\". By summer 1869, their objections had been overcome, and the wedding took place on 3 June 1869. Ludovic Halévy wrote in his journal: \\"Bizet has spirit and talent. He should succeed\\".As a belated homage to his late father-in-law, Bizet took up the Noé manuscript and completed it. Parts of his moribund Vasco da Gama and Ivan IV were incorporated into the score, but a projected production at the Théâtre Lyrique failed to materialise when Carvalho's company finally went bankrupt, and Noé remained unperformed until 1885. Bizet's marriage was initially happy, but was affected by Geneviève's nervous instability (inherited from both her parents), her difficult relations with her mother and by Mme. Halévy's interference in the couple's affairs. Despite this, Bizet kept on good terms with his mother-in-law and maintained an extensive correspondence with her. In the year following the marriage, he considered plans for at least half a dozen new operas and began to sketch the music for two of them: Clarissa Harlowe based on Samuel Richardson's novel...

Deal with pests.\\"","completion":"Title: Orchid Care: Reviving Your Non-Blooming Plant, Rejuvenating Limp Leaves, and Overcoming Pests Introduction Orchids are renowned for their alluring beauty and exquisite blooms. However, even the most experienced gardeners can face challenges when it comes to maintaining these plants. Understanding the intricacies of orchid care will not only help you deal with non-blooming plants, limp leaves, and pests but also ensure your orchids thrive and bloom year after year. In this article, we will discuss how to: 1. Deal with an orchid that won't bloom. 2. Care for an orchid with limp leaves. 3. Overcome common orchid pests. Dealing with an Orchid That Won't Bloom 1.1: Correct Amount of Light One common reason an orchid may not bloom is inadequate light. To thrive, most orchids require bright, yet indirect sunlight. Morning and early afternoon sunlight is often best, so placing them near east or south-facing windows may be ideal. If your orchid hasn't produced blossoms in some time, consider moving it to an area where it will receive more natural lighting. 1.2: Optimal Temperature Inconsistent or inappropriate temperature is another factor that hinders orchid blooming. Maintain daytime temperatures around 70 to 75°F (21 to 24°C) and night temperatures between 60 to 65°F (15 to 18°C). Most orchids require a 10°F (5°C) drop in temperature at night for the plant to initiate spikes for blooming. 1.3: Proper Watering and Humidity Orchids need the right balance of water and humidity to bloom. Water your orchid once a week, allowing the potting medium to dry out slightly between waterings. Use purified water or rainwater, if possible, because tap water often contains minerals that can harm your plant. Mist the leaves and surrounding air to maintain adequate humidity, especially during dry months. 1.4: Fertilize Regularly Fertilization plays a key role in promoting blossoms. Use a balanced orchid fertilizer monthly during the growing season and reduce the frequency to every six weeks during the winter. Look for a fertilizer specifically designed for orchids and follow the instructions carefully to avoid overfeeding. 1.5: Regular Re-potting Over time, the potting medium breaks down, suffocating the orchid's roots. Re-pot your orchid every 18 to 24 months with a fresh orchid mix. This will promote better root growth and encourage future blooms. Caring for an Orchid with Limp Leaves 2.1: Hydration or Over-watering Limp leaves are common indicators of dehydration or over-watering. If the leaves appear wrinkled and the potting medium is dry, increase your watering frequency. Conversely, if the potting medium remains wet and soggy, reduce watering to prevent root rot. 2.2: Temperature Stress Avoid exposing your orchids to extreme temperatures, as this may also cause limp leaves. Make sure your orchid does not experience temperature fluctuations and is placed in a consistent environment. 2.3: Nutrient Imbalance Poor nutrition can cause limp leaves as well. Incorporate a balanced orchid fertilizer into your care routine to provide essential nutrients. Avoid fertilizing weak or stressed plants, as it could further exacerbate the issue. Dealing with Pests 3.1: Identifying Common Pests Orchids are prone to various pests, such as mealybugs, spider mites, scale insects, and aphids. Regularly inspect your plant for these pests, particularly the underside of leaves and joints. 3.2: Preventive Measures To avoid a pest infestation, maintain cleanliness in your plant's environment. Keep the foliage dust-free, discard dead plant matter, and ensure the potting medium is changed as required. 3.3: Pest Management Small infestations can be handled by wiping the affected areas with a cotton swab dipped in 70% isopropyl alcohol. For larger infestations, follow the directions for the appropriate insecticide or oil-based spray to eliminate the pests. Conclusion Orchid care can be complex, requiring a delicate balance of light, temperature, water, and nutrition. By identifying and addressing potential issues, you can enjoy years of stunning blooms in your home or garden. Remember to maintain a clean and healthy environment for your plants to prevent pests, and share your success with friends or family by gifting them an exquisite orchid."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Catholic Church sex abuse report names hundreds of priests, accuses leaders of cover-up: 'They hid it all.' Aug 14 Left: A photo of Michael Jackson’s nephew, singer T.J. Jackson, which federal authorities say David Milliner of Philadelphia used as a profile shot on social media accounts he set up under the name His Royal Highness Daniel David DeRothschild. Right: David Milliner’s mugshot after his arrest earlier this year by Philadelphia Police. Last year, an obscure publication, Rich and Royal Magazine, began posting breathless Facebook updates tracking every move of a man it described as the latest European royal to cause a splash in America’s celebrity social scene. Prince Daniel David DeRothschild’s August 2017 visit to Michael Jackson’s grave in Glendale, Calif., drew a line of paparazzi stretching two city blocks, magazine correspondent Ashton Alton Quartermaine III posted. His charisma, “vast American holdings,” and extensive charity work had – according to Quartermaine’s retelling – left much of the city musing: “Who [is] this man who seems to captivate everyone who comes into his presence?” But that man was no prince. In fact, he never existed at all. Instead, federal authorities say, DeRothschild, Quartermaine, and even the magazine were social-media fabrications dreamed up by an unemployed North Philadelphia man engaged in an elaborate catfishing scheme. Prosecutors say that David Milliner, 49, managed to persuade at least five prepubescent boys he met online to send him explicit photographs of themselves by pretending to be the wealthy European Prince DeRothschild online. Investigators have linked at least eight Facebook profiles and several other social-media accounts to Milliner posing as DeRothschild or supposed members of the prince’s retinue all designed to further convince his targets of his legitimacy. Their personas included a made-up chief of security; a head of communications; Quartermaine, the reporter purportedly sent to cover the prince; and DeRothschild’s supposed cousin, the self-described socialite and “son of two fashion houses,” Michael Prada Vuitton. “He convinced [his victims] that he was rich and famous,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Rotella. “And he would never send them photos of his face.” Sure, there were signs that would have given a more sophisticated audience pause. The profile photo Milliner used for DeRothschild on multiple social-media platforms was an image of a Jackson nephew, the singer T.J. Jackson. And in a December 2016 Facebook post, DeRothschild described himself as the “dolphin of France” – an apparent malapropism for “dauphin,” the term the French once used to refer to the heir apparent in their royal lineage. Yet for his young and unsuspecting targets, Milliner’s approach proved successful time and again, investigators said. Between September and November 2017, he allegedly communicated with at least eight boys across the country – the youngest of whom was 6 years old. Many of those relationships lasted for months, according to an indictment unsealed last month. When Philadelphia police in February finally traced the online activity to Milliner’s 32nd Street rowhouse — where he lived by himself — they found him chatting with yet another underage victim on a social-media video streaming service, they said. On Thursday, Milliner denied the allegations. With his shoulders slumped and his hands clasped behind his back, he pleaded not guilty to 16 child-pornography offenses during a hearing in federal court in Philadelphia. The soft voice with which he answered questions from the judge contrasted sharply with the chutzpah evident in his social-media fantasies. Boasting of himself as an “heir, socialite … humanitarian [and] trillionaire,” the DeRothschild of Milliner’s alleged portrayal led a Zelig-like existence, flitting from one newsworthy moment to another. He hosted the hottest Hollywood parties – including his “famous” February 2017 “double-mega yacht party” – and counted celebrities including Nicki Minaj, George Clooney, Prince, and Hillary Clinton as “close personal friends.” As movie mogul Harvey Weinstein’s career crumbled under the weight of sexual-misconduct claims, DeRothschild was quick to post a condemnation and demand “resignation letters of all involved.” And last year, he claimed to have attended President Trump’s first address to a joint session of Congress. Before the 2017 Academy Awards, DeRothschild turned to his Facebook page to find an adoring fan to take as his date. “We will go to every after party and you will be dressed in Marquesa,” Milliner purportedly wrote in the name of his mythical monarch while misspelling Marchesa, the high-end women’s fashion brand. “I promise you diamonds and exquisite antique jewelry that you get to keep. … I’m drinking juice looking at the ocean thinking of you.” Still, Milliner’s alleged princely persona did not work on everyone. He responded in February 2016 to those who doubted his authenticity. “I will always be His Royal Highness Prince Daniel DeRothschild IV of the mighty House of DeRothschild,” he wrote on the DeRothschild Facebook page. “And you will forever be the leeches that you were programmed to be. Common. Common as dirt.” Milliner remains in federal custody in Philadelphia pending his trial scheduled for Oct. 2. If convicted, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and could be imprisoned for the rest of his life. His lawyer, Elizabeth Toplin, declined to comment Thursday. ||||| PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A Philadelphia man pretended to be a prince in an elaborate catfishing scheme to get young boys to send them explicit photographs of themselves, according to federal authorities. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported 49-year-old David Milliner pleaded not guilty to child pornography charges during a court hearing Thursday. Prosecutors said Milliner claimed he was a man named Prince Daniel David DeRothschild and used photos of Michael Jackson's nephew, T.J. Jackson, to fool his victims. He claimed that he was a \\"trillionaire,\\" lived in a mansion and was close friends with Prince, George Clooney and Nicki Minaj, according to prosecutors. \\"He convinced (his victims) that he was rich and famous,\\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Rotella. \\"And he would never send them photos of his face.\\" Authorities said Milliner used several social media accounts in which he pretended to be members of DeRothschild's entourage to support his claims. He even fabricated a publication, Rich and Royal Magazine, to promote the prince's existence. Milliner convinced at least five boys he met online to send photos of themselves, prosecutors said. Police arrested him in February in the Philadelphia apartment where he lived alone. Milliner faces a minimum of 15 years in prison if convicted. He is in federal custody pending an Oct. 2 trial.

Next, visit the school district's website to find out about registration periods, as these may vary depending on the time of year and grade level you are enrolling your child in. Some districts offer online registration, while others may require you to visit the district office or school in-person. Familiarize yourself with the specific registration process for your school district, and follow the steps outlined to ensure a smooth enrollment experience for both you and your child. If your child has special needs or requires accommodations for disabilities, inquire about any additional forms or documentation that may need to be submitted. It's also a good idea to see if your school district offers any resources or programs to help support your child's unique needs. Once your child is officially enrolled, attend any orientation events or open houses offered for new students and parents. This will provide you with valuable information about school protocols, curriculum, and extracurricular activities, and give you an opportunity to meet your child's teachers, administrators, and other parents. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask during these events, as school staff will be there to ensure you feel well-informed and prepared for the educational journey ahead. As school commencement approaches, help your child transition smoothly by providing them with any necessary supplies, such as notebooks, pencils, and a backpack. Encourage open communication with your child about their feelings or concerns regarding the upcoming school year, and offer reassuring words or support to help ease their worries. Lastly, get involved in your child's school experience by participating in parent-teacher conferences, joining the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA), or volunteering for school events. This will give you a chance to connect with other parents and contribute to enhancing the overall school experience for your child and their peers. In summary, to register your child for school, first determine the appropriate school district by contacting your city's student assignment office. Gather documentation, follow the school district's registration process, and attend orientation events to ensure you and your child are well-prepared for the exciting educational journey ahead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes - Air enters bronchioles - Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli - Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels - Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels - Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body - Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more polluted air happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed suggests that an increase in air pollution could lead to a greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. To discuss this hypothesis, let's first break down the process of respiration and understand how air pollution may influence each step. Then, we will examine if there is indeed an impact on oxygen delivery to the blood. 1. Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes: When inhaling pollutants, the bronchial tubes can become irritated and inflamed, potentially constraining their diameter. This may lead to difficulty in breathing, reducing the overall air intake, including the oxygen captured by the lungs. 2. Air enters bronchioles: Polluted air can also cause inflammation and constriction in the bronchioles, further impairing the flow of air, including oxygen, into the alveoli. 3. Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli: Alveoli are responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and bloodstream. Air pollution, however, can compromise their functioning. Long-term exposure to pollutants can damage the alveoli's walls and reduce their efficiency in exchanging gases. 4. Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels: The capillaries surrounding the alveoli are where oxygen and carbon dioxide diffusion takes place. When pollutants enter the bloodstream, they can cause inflammation and oxidative stress, potentially disrupting this diffusion process. 5. Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels: If pollutants damage or inflame the blood vessels, it may limit their ability to properly absorb and transport oxygen to the body's cells. 6. Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body: Polluted air may introduce more free radicals and reactive oxygen species to the bloodstream, reducing the overall oxygen-carrying capacity. The presence of these harmful particles may affect the body's ability to effectively distribute oxygen as needed. 7. Blood brings carbon dioxide back to the lungs: The presence of pollutants can hinder the efficient elimination of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream, further exacerbating the strain on the respiratory system. 8. Carbon dioxide released when you exhale: Higher levels of pollutants can result in increased inflammation and oxidative stress in the lungs, potentially inducing further constriction and impeding the process of exhaling carbon dioxide. In summary, the proposed perturbation hypothesis assumes that an increase in pollution would lead to a greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. Based on the analysis of the respiration process, this hypothesis appears implausible. Instead, increased air pollution may substantially impair lung function, disrupt oxygen and carbon dioxide diffusion, and negatively impact gas exchange at all stages. Consequently, the net effect of polluted air is likely to result in a decreased amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, leading to potential health risks and complications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Primary Producers/Food Sources Protists are essential sources of nutrition for many other organisms. In some cases, as in plankton, protists are consumed directly. Alternatively, photosynthetic protists serve as producers of nutrition for other organisms. For instance, photosynthetic dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae use sunlight to fix inorganic carbon. In this symbiotic relationship, these protists provide nutrients for coral polyps (Figure 23.29) that house them, giving corals a boost of energy to secrete a calcium carbonate skeleton. In turn, the corals provide the protist with a protected environment and the compounds needed for photosynthesis. This type of symbiotic relationship is important in nutrient-poor environments. Without dinoflagellate symbionts, corals lose algal pigments in a process called coral bleaching, and they eventually die. This explains why reefbuilding corals do not reside in waters deeper than 20 meters: insufficient light reaches those depths for dinoflagellates to photosynthesize.

Kozelsk and Starobelsk were used mainly for military officers, while Ostashkov was used mainly for Polish Scouting, gendarmes, police officers, and prison officers. Some prisoners were members of other groups of Polish intelligentsia, such as priests, landowners, and law personnel. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5000; Ostashkov, 6570; and Starobelsk, 4000. They totalled 15,570 men.According to a report from 19 November 1939, the NKVD had about 40,000 Polish POWs: 8,000-8,500 officers and warrant officers, 6,000-6,500 officers of police, and 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers who were still being held as POWs. In December, a wave of arrests resulted in the imprisonment of additional Polish officers. Ivan Serov reported to Lavrentiy Beria on 3 December that \\"in all, 1,057 former officers of the Polish Army had been arrested\\". The 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers were assigned to forced labor (road construction, heavy metallurgy).Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers, such as Vasily Zarubin. The prisoners assumed they would be released soon, but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Ex-British prime minister alleges reporters sought his personal data 'News of the World' final edition London (CNN) -- A scandal that already has taken down Britain's best-selling Sunday tabloid and launched an inquiry into journalistic practices in the country widened Monday with startling allegations against two more News International newspapers. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown believes journalists from The Sunday Times and The Sun newspapers tried to obtain private information from his financial records and telephone voice messages, a source close to Brown told CNN. The efforts date back some 10 years, and include periods when Brown was prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer, the source confirmed. Journalists from The Sun tabloid -- the country's best-selling daily newspaper -- obtained details about Brown's seriously ill son and published a story about him, while people working for the upmarket Murdoch Sunday Times tricked Brown's accountants into handing over financial details, the former prime minister alleges, according to the source. News International, the British subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and owner of the papers, issued a statement saying it was aware of the allegations. \\"So that we can investigate these matters further, we ask that all information concerning these allegations is provided to us,\\" the company's statement read. Brown had not publicly addressed the allegations as of Monday evening, but his wife, Sarah Brown, found the news troubling, accoriding to a posting from a Twitter account belonging to her. \\"So sad to learn all I am about my family's privacy - it is very personal and really hurtful if all true,\\" the post read. The new allegations come in the wake of the closure Sunday of another of the company's newspapers, News of the World, over other allegations of illegal breach of privacy. Until it ceased publishing on Sunday, News of the World was the largest-selling Sunday newspaper in the country. The decision to close the News of the World followed accusations that it illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims, politicians and celebrities, and claims it may have bribed police officers. Police said Thursday they had identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone-hacking. The widening scandal and public outrage over it threaten to scuttle plans by Murdoch to create Britain's largest media company by acquiring satellite broadcaster BSkyB. U.K. Media Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced Monday in Parliament that he was referring the proposed sale to the Competition Commission for a thorough review. \\"I know that colleagues on all sides of this house and the public at home feel very concerned at the prospect of the organization which allegedly allowed these terrible things to happen being allowed to take control of what would become Britain's biggest media company,\\" Hunt said. The company said Monday that it was withdrawing its plan to sell television channel Sky News as part of its acquisition of BSkyB pending further consideration of the bid. British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg urged Murdoch to reconsider the acquisition in light of public \\"revulsion\\" over the scandal. Earlier Monday, London's Metropolitan Police angrily blasted leaks from its investigation into illegal eavesdropping by News of the World, hours after British media reported that the paper tried to bribe royal protection officers to get private phone numbers for members of the royal family. Police said News International had shared information about alleged efforts by reporters to bribe police, and that both sides had agreed to keep the information confidential. Police said they were \\"extremely concerned and disappointed\\" at the leaks, which they said \\"could have a significant impact on the corruption investigation.\\" Police, the royal family and News International all refused to answer CNN questions about allegations that a reporter sought company money to pay a royal protection officer for the confidential details about the royal family. BBC business editor Robert Peston claimed Monday that News of the World e-mails showed former royal correspondent Clive Goodman \\"was requesting cash from the newspaper's editor, Andy Coulson, to buy a confidential directory of the royal family's landline telephone numbers, and all the phone numbers -- including mobiles -- of the household staff.\\" Goodman was sent to prison in 2007 for illegally intercepting royal family voice mails. Coulson insisted he knew nothing about the crime, but resigned as editor because it happened on his watch. He went on to become communications director for David Cameron, who is now the British prime minister, but resigned from that post earlier this year because of fallout from the phone-hacking scandal. He was questioned by police on Friday and released on bail until October. Allegations that the paper's eavesdropping extended to murder and terror victims and the families of fallen troops prompted the News of the World's owner to shut down the paper on Sunday. Murdoch has not apologized to the family of a murdered British teenage girl whose phone messages were illegally intercepted, a lawyer for the girl's family said Monday. Rebekah Brooks, who was editor of the newspaper at the time 13-year-old murder victim Milly Dowler's phone was hacked, should resign, Dowler family lawyer Mark Lewis also said. \\"She should do the honorable thing,\\" Lewis said. \\"She was editor at the time Milly was taken. She should take editorial responsibility\\" for the actions of her journalists, he said. Brooks has since been promoted to chief executive of News International, the company that publishes Murdoch's British newspapers. Murdoch has stood by her so far. She may be questioned by police about the scandal in the coming weeks, a News International source told CNN Monday. The source emphasized that Brooks would be interviewed as a witness, not a suspect, if police do question her, and rejected British press reports that the questioning would take place Monday. The source asked not to be named discussing internal company business. Dowler's mother and sister met Clegg on Monday, keeping the scandal in the public eye despite the abrupt closure of the best-selling tabloid on Sunday. They are due to sit down with Labour leader Ed Miliband on Tuesday and Prime Minister David Cameron, a Conservative, on Wednesday, lawyer Lewis said. Murdoch flew into London Sunday, hours after the final edition of the News of the World hit the stands. Clegg also said: \\"We owe it to the Dowlers\\" to get the bottom of what happened. The News of the World struck a wistful yet proud tone in its final editorial Sunday, and repeated its owner's apology for the criminal activities that brought the paper down. \\"Phones were hacked, and for that this newspaper is truly sorry,\\" it said in an unsigned piece. \\"There is no justification for this appalling wrongdoing.\\" The paper welcomed Cameron's call for two inquiries, one into how police investigated the allegations of phone hacking and one into the ethics and standards of British journalists. Separately, police are already conducting their second investigation into the hacking itself. Downing Street on Saturday confirmed that Cameron has approached the head of the judiciary of England and Wales to suggest names for the judge to lead the inquiry into the hacking allegations. News of the World was the first British national newspaper Rupert Murdoch bought, in 1969, as he began to propel himself from Australian newspaper proprietor to international media magnate. In addition to owning News of the World, and The Sun, News International owns The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain. Murdoch's News Corporation also encompasses Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers. CNN's Richard Greene, Andy Carey and Dan Rivers contributed to this report. Summary:","completion":"The UK's phone hacking scandal, which led to the closure of News of the World, has widened as former Prime Minister Gordon Brown accused journalists from The Sunday Times and The Sun of trying to obtain private information from his financial records and phone messages. News International, the British subsidiary of News Corporation and owner of the newspapers, acknowledged the allegations and requested further information. The privacy breach allegations also threatened to disrupt Rupert Murdoch's plan to acquire satellite broadcaster BSkyB, prompting UK Media Secretary Jeremy Hunt to refer the proposed sale to the Competition Commission for review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The question highlights that the cows were \\"lost in the city\\" and \\"hated the noise.\\" The cows' discomfort suggests that they are not used to the city's hustle and bustle. This fact provides us with an immediate clue about the cows' likely usual habitat: a quieter, more tranquil, natural setting. Among the remaining options, two could fit the above description: a \\"farmyard\\" and \\"countryside.\\" However, countryside is an even more likely option than farmyard because it generally represents a broader, more peaceful, and natural environment where cows can roam freely. Additionally, the countryside connotations of silence and tranquility contrast even more starkly with the presumed noise and confusion of the city, making the countryside an even more attractive option for the cows. While a farmyard might provide a quieter environment than a city, it doesn't necessarily guarantee the peacefulness and freedom associated with the countryside. Some farmyards could even be noisy or busy, possibly close to urban areas. The other options are far less likely. A \\"milk machine\\" would not address the cows' desire for a quieter and less chaotic environment. \\"Fairgrounds\\" are generally noisy and bustling places, so they would not serve as a suitable environment for cows seeking tranquility.

He believes weird creatures are lurking, just waiting to attack him. He believes that the only thing keeping him safe is his house. When his parents decide to move, Willy isn't thrilled with the idea of going to a new school and living in a strange home. One day, Gooby, a teddy bear that Willy had as a little boy, arrives at the new house. This version of Gooby is nearly six feet tall, able to talk, and wants to help; Willy decides that the two will be friends, but he must hide Gooby from his parents. Left alone for long hours while Willy goes to school, Gooby is frequently bored. He passes the time by causing trouble, convincing the nanny that there are critters inside the house, stealing cookies from the kitchen, ransacking the garage for parts to build Willy's fantasy racer and sneaking around Willy's school where anyone could see him. When Willy's teacher goes on maternity leave, she is replaced by Mr. Nerdlinger, a children's book writer who desperately wants to become famous. When he catches sight of Gooby, he becomes determined to photograph him. Willy has trouble making friends, and when Gooby's appearance outside Mr. Nerdlinger's class makes Willy freak out (earning him and three of his classmates two weeks of after school detention) his reputation at school is only worsened. On Halloween day, Willy and Gooby go out during daylight to have fun (Willy convinces Gooby to pretend to be Willy's father in a costume) and Willy makes friends with the most popular kids in school by having Gooby buy them all tickets to an R-rated action movie. Gooby becomes envious of Willy when he begins to spend more time with his newfound friends. The two get into an argument, resulting in Gooby running away.

Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Gooby,\\" Gooby is the lovable, full-size, scraggly, orange, furry creature who comes to life. Initially, Gooby is a teddy bear that belonged to the protagonist, an 11-year-old boy named Willy. Willy has an overactive imagination and believes in the existence of weird creatures that are just waiting to attack him. Gooby comes to life as a nearly six feet tall furry creature, who is able to talk and willing to help Willy. Willy decides to befriend Gooby, despite needing to hide his new companion from his parents. As Willy goes to school, Gooby is left alone for long hours and often gets bored. He causes trouble, such as convincing the nanny about critters inside the house, stealing cookies, ransacking the garage, and sneaking around Willy's school. When Willy's teacher goes on maternity leave, the children's book writer Mr. Nerdlinger becomes her substitute. Upon seeing Gooby, Mr. Nerdlinger becomes determined to photograph him in hopes of gaining fame. Willy struggles to make friends, and his reputation at school worsens after an incident with Mr. Nerdlinger caused by Gooby.

Choose from: - yes. - no.","completion":"Yes, the Communist Party was outlawed in Yugoslavia in 1920. However, it is important to provide more context and details about the situation in Yugoslavia during that period to give a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Following the end of World War I, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed on December 1, 1918, later known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. The political climate during this time was turbulent and marked by unrest, with various political factions vying for power and influence within the newly formed state. In the early years of the Kingdom, the government was characterized by a parliamentary system, which saw numerous political parties emerge, including the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY). The CPY was initially founded in 1919 as part of the regional congress of the Socialist Party, inspired by the success of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia in 1917. The CPY sought to establish a socialist state in Yugoslavia, advocating for workers' rights and socialist policies. However, the Yugoslav government, led by the Prime Minister Nikola Pašić and his People's Radical Party, was concerned about the growing influence of the CPY. Largely due to a fear of the spread of Bolshevism, the Communist Party was viewed as a destabilizing threat to the Kingdom's stability and unity. As a result, the government outlawed the Communist Party on December 30, 1920. This followed several months of increased political pressure as CPY members were arrested and party properties confiscated. The government also imposed strict censorship on leftist publications and organizations, further suppressing the communist movement. Despite these measures, the CPY continued to operate underground and would play a significant role in the resistance against the Axis powers during World War II. After the war and the establishment of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Communist Party, under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito, became the ruling party of the newly formed socialist state. The Party would remain in power until the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. In conclusion, the Communist Party was outlawed in Yugoslavia in 1920 due to the government's fear of the spread of Bolshevism and its perceived threat to the stability and unity of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. However, the Party continued to be active underground and would eventually become the ruling party after World War II and the establishment of the socialist state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Cookie is a mound of dough, cooked through with just a bit of softness to the very center, drizzled in chocolate and absolutely amazing.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the video that has the Tops of the Pops performance from the band that was featured on the Hype! documentary? ? \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington. The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\"). Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey.

We have a big number, 48909, and another big number, 22884, and we want to add them together first. So, let's add: 48909 + 22884 = 71793 Now, our problem looks like this: -2659 * u = 71793 But we want to find out what \\"u\\" is, so we need to get \\"u\\" by itself. To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by the number in front of \\"u,\\" which is -2659.

Article: The words on the film will let you know which side of the film should be facing towards you and where the top is. This should not be an issue if the CT films are on a disk, but you still should check. When you look at a CT scan, it is like looking in a mirror. The right side of your body will be on the left side of the film and the left side of your body will be on right. The uppercase R and L on the films tell you what side of the body is represented on the film, not the actual right and left side of the physical film. The anterior or front part of your body will be on the top of the film and the posterior or back part of your body will be on the bottom. Numbers will be printed on the CT films. The CT scan cuts your body into cross-sections which are like very thin slices of bread. As you look at the images in order, you will notice a normal and natural flow. Any sudden breaks can suggest disease or an abnormality. When you look at the special X-rays in order, it is like watching a slow-motion film of the structures and organs inside of you and how they relate to each other. If you were looking at a CT of your chest, you would see how your large blood vessels and the bronchi (the tubes through which air flows in and out of your lungs) weave through your uniform lung tissue. Lung cancer would create a noticeable disruption in this pattern. When you view the films on your computer, you will have no issue with scrolling through the images and seeing it as a slow-moving film. The soft tissues, fat, air, and bone inside of you are represented in these different shades. An unexpected color in a part of your body could be a sign of an abnormality. Dense tissues like bone show up as white areas. Both air and fat show up as dark gray or black. Your soft tissues and any fluid, including blood, will show up in various shades of gray. Different types of contrast, which shine bright white on the films, are used to better define the structures inside you. You swallow one type to show the fluid inside your stomach and intestines. But, another type is injected into your into a vein to show the blood in your vessels or the fluid around an organ. The latter could be a sign of inflammation, infection, or bleeding. A specific example is looking at the shading on the CT of your brain and knowing you have had a stroke. The bone of your skull is normal and shines bright white like an egg shell around the grays and black of your brain tissue. But, there is a small, faint white area surrounded by the grays and black where the stroke has occurred. Your brain tissue was deprived of blood flow in this area. The fluid which leaked out of your injured brain cells has contrast in it. This fluid is white, but it is not as bright as your skull. Bilateral organs should be hard to tell apart like identical twins. The CT anatomy atlas is a good reference, but the best point of reference is the normal organ on the other side. This will not work for organs like your liver, stomach, or spleen; you only have one of each. However, your brain has two lobes. You do have two arms and legs plus organs like your kidneys, lungs, ovaries, and testicles which are bilateral. A radiologist is a doctor who specializes in interpreting all types of X-rays, including CT scans, has read your films. She sent a report to your doctor with a detailed description of what she saw on your films. Your doctor ordered the CT scan either to find a diagnosis to explain your symptoms or as a follow-up for a medical problem like cancer, stroke, or a broken bone. You are a bit nervous or curious. It seems like the day of your doctor's appointment will never come. You have a copy of the CT and you decide to take a look. Reading a CT correctly takes a lot of practice and proper lighting.

Step 2: Isolate the variable term To isolate the variable term, we will add 1014 to both sides of the equation. -408*o - 1014 + 1014 = -3870 + 1014 This simplifies to: -408*o = -2856 Step 3: Solve for o Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by -408 to get the value of o. (-408*o) / -408 = -2856 / -408 The variable o will be: o = 7 So, the solution for the equation -31*o - 377*o - 1014 = -3870 is o = 7."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

In the lawsuit filed Wednesday in Waco, Texas, John L. Lewis and Richard L. Clark claim that Gaines, 42, urged them to sell their equal shares while hiding news that HGTV planned to broadcast Fixer Upper and feature the Magnolia brand name, according to the lawsuit obtained by PEOPLE. “We are confident that these claims will be found to be meritless, and it is disappointing to see people try to take advantage of the hard work and success of Chip and Joanna Gaines,” Gaines’ attorney, Jordan Mayfield, tells PEOPLE. Gaines posted on Twitter after news of the lawsuit broke on Wednesday, writing, “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it,” The message is a bible verse: John 1:5.

In a statement to PEOPLE HGTV officials said: “We respect the privacy of our show hosts and will not comment on matters related to their personal lives or businesses.” The suit was filed just days after Gaines’ wife, Joanna, addressed rumors that she is leaving the hit HGTV show to get into the cosmetics industry. “You can’t believe everything you read,” Joanna wrote in a note posted on her blog At Home. “No! I am not getting into the business of facial creams. And no worries, believing some of these stories happens to the best of us.” ||||| Chip Gaines has found himself in some legal trouble. E!

On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. and the situation: Nicholas works in pest control, and needs to have a steady supply of nitrogen gas for his tools. He always keeps a closed container of nitrogen gas in his freezer, where the temperature is very low. Nicholas's neighbor, Justin, likes to grill in his backyard. Justin, therefore, always keeps a closed container of propane gas outside, where the temperature is high. Answer the following question: The container of which gas will have lower pressure inside it? A:","completion":"The container of nitrogen gas that Nicholas keeps in his freezer will have a lower pressure inside it compared to the container of propane gas that Justin keeps outside. To understand why this is the case, let's first discuss the relationships between gas temperature, kinetic energy, and pressure. According to the Kinetic Molecular Theory, when the temperature of a gas rises, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules also increases. The increased kinetic energy leads to more frequent and forceful collisions between the gas molecules and the walls of the container. This results in an increased pressure within the container. Based on the information provided in the background, the cylinder of gas that has its Kelvin temperature doubled from 300 K to 600 K experienced a doubling of pressure as well. Conversely, when temperature decreases, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules also decreases, resulting in less frequent and less forceful collisions and, therefore, decreased pressure. Now, considering the situation of Nicholas and Justin: - Nicholas: He keeps his closed container of nitrogen gas in the freezer, where the temperature is significantly lower than room temperature. This means that the kinetic energy of the nitrogen molecules will be lower, leading to less forceful collisions with the walls of the container. As a result, the pressure inside Nicholas' nitrogen gas container will be lower. - Justin: He keeps his closed container of propane gas outside, where the temperature is higher than in a freezer. Consequently, the kinetic energy of the propane molecules will be higher, resulting in more forceful collisions with the walls of the container. This leads to an increased pressure within Justin's propane gas container. In conclusion, the container of nitrogen gas kept in the freezer by Nicholas will have a lower pressure inside it compared to the container of propane gas that Justin keeps in a warmer environment outside. This is because temperature and pressure in a gas are directly related; lower temperature leads to lower pressure, and higher temperature leads to higher pressure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Among them is British journalist David Frost, currently recording a talk show in Australia, who decides to interview Nixon. Nixonâs literary agent, Irving \\"Swifty\\" Lazar, believes the interview would be an opportunity for Nixon to salvage his reputation, and to make some money. Nixon ultimately demands 600,000, and Frost accepts. After persuading his friend and producer John Birt that the interviews would be a success, Frost and Birt travel to California to meet with Nixon. On the plane to California, Frost flirts with a young woman called Caroline Cushing, and they begin a relationship. Frost struggles to sell the interviews to U.S. networks, and decides to finance the project with private money and syndicate the broadcast of the interviews. He hires two investigators â Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. â to help him prepare, along with Birt. Frost is not clear on what he wants from the interview, and Reston encourages him to aim for a confession from Nixon. Under the watchful eye of Nixon's post-presidential chief of staff, Jack Brennan, Frost and Nixon embark on the first three recording sessions. Restricted by an agreed-upon timeframe and under pressure from his own team to ask the tough questions, Frost struggles to get a word in as Nixon dominates with lengthy and self-serving monologues, fencing ably on Vietnam and boasting about his achievements in foreign policy. Behind the scenes, Frost's editorial team is nervous about his interviewing technique, and angry that Nixon appears to be exonerating himself. Four days before the final session, which will center on Watergate, Frost receives a phonecall from an inebriated Nixon.

If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans. With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches. On Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\". It is a familiar London landmark which has since given its name to a tube station. In 1668, accusations against the Catholics were added to the inscription on the Monument which...

Article: In the 1500s, South American fishermen said that the sea became warmer every few years. They gave this special event a Spanish name 'El Nino', meaning 'the baby'. It is called 'the baby' because it arrives around Christmas. El Nino is a huge area of warm water in the middle of cold water in the Pacific Ocean. It happens every two to seven years. It moves around the ocean and becomes bigger and smaller at different times. This warm water affects the weather. It is always raining over El Nino. El Nino contains a lot of energy. Scientists think this energy is formed when wind comes from the northern half of the world. The winds blow across warm sea water in the south. When the strong wind hits the warm water, violent weather happens. Scientists think that El Nino existed for many thousands of years. El Nino affects every person in the world because it affects the entire world's weather. It can bring the rain that farmers need. It can bring storms that destroy homes. It can mean that fishermen cannot catch fish, and it can bring floods. There is nothing we can do about El Nino. It is an event of nature. We can help the world's weather by trying to stop the greenhouse effect and air pollution. The most important job for scientists is to learn how to predict when El Nino is going to bring dangerous weather. Then, people can try to prepare for storms, floods and droughts. New technology like satellite pictures and temperature measuring equipment can help. Still, it is very hard to say when or where El Nino will cause damage. Question: It happens _ .

Step 1: Gather information First, Betty decided to gather information about fishtail braids. She wanted to make sure she was helping Sarah correctly and not causing any damage to her hair. To do this, she searched online for tutorials and looked at various pictures to understand the technique. Step 2: Prepare materials Next, Betty gathered all the necessary materials needed to create a fishtail braid. This included a hairbrush, comb, hair ties, and hair clips. By having all the required tools at hand, Betty would be able to work more efficiently without needing to interrupt the process. Step 3: Section the hair Betty began by combing Sarah's hair to remove any tangles and ensure it was smooth. She then separated Sarah's hair into two even sections, making sure the parts were clean and neat. By dividing the hair evenly, it would result in a balanced fishtail braid. Step 4: Start the fishtail braid Holding one section of hair in each hand, Betty carefully took a small strand of hair from the outer edge of one section and crossed it over to the other. She then took a small strand from the outer edge of the second section and crossed it over to the first. The key to a successful fishtail braid is to maintain consistency in the size of the strands being crossed over. Step 5: Continue the fishtail braid Betty continued crossing over small strands of hair from the outer edges of each section, making sure to keep the tension consistent and maintain a neat appearance. As she worked her way down Sarah's hair, she occasionally checked her progress against the tutorials and pictures she had found earlier to make sure she was on track. Step 6: Secure the braid Once Betty reached the ends of Sarah's hair, she secured the fishtail braid with a hair tie. She then checked the braid to ensure it was even and there were no loose strands sticking out. Step 7: Final adjustments To give the fishtail braid a more polished look, Betty gently pulled at the edges of the braid to make it slightly wider and appear fuller. She then added a touch of hairspray to keep the braid in place and prevent flyaways. Step 8: Admiring the result Finally, Betty showed Sarah her new fishtail braid in the mirror. Both Sarah and Betty were pleased with the result, and Sarah thanked Betty for taking the time to learn how to create a fishtail braid and help her achieve the desired look."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer: The only way to keep a woman happy,' he said, 'is to keep her barefoot and pregnant.'\\" Question: what does barefoot and pregnant mean Answer:","completion":"\\"Barefoot and pregnant\\" is a colloquial phrase that has been in use for several decades. It is rooted in traditional gender norms and embodies the sexist belief that women's primary role in society should be limited to being submissive, dependent on their male partners, and focused on bearing and raising children. The imagery of being \\"barefoot\\" implies that women should stay in domestic spaces and not venture out into the world to pursue education, careers, or personal and social independence. In contrast, \\"pregnant\\" represents their perceived biological responsibility to bear children and raise families, thereby fulfilling the traditional expectations of womanhood. There are several historical and socio-cultural contexts in which this phrase has emerged. Traditional gender norms have long prescribed domestic and child-rearing roles for women, while men have been expected to be breadwinners and protectors. This separation of roles is rooted in the belief that men and women have inherently different characteristics and abilities which should be reinforced through societal norms and expectations. Over time, these norms have been increasingly criticized and challenged, particularly during the women's liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Women's rights activists have worked hard to dismantle these stereotypes and create opportunities for women to pursue education, careers, and social and political equality. They have advocated for reproductive rights, equal pay, and measures to combat and prevent gender-based violence. However, even with all these advancements, the phrase \\"barefoot and pregnant\\" still persists in some contexts as an unfortunate reminder of the enduring influence and consequences of gender inequality and traditional gender norms. The use of this phrase can perpetuate negative stereotypes, hinder the ongoing pursuit of equal rights, and even contribute to the normalization of domestic violence and other forms of discrimination against women. In conclusion, the phrase \\"barefoot and pregnant\\" is a derogatory and misogynistic expression that reflects outdated and harmful beliefs about women's roles and capabilities. It suggests that women should be confined to domestic spaces and solely focus on motherhood and family, rather than pursuing personal goals and ambitions that exist beyond these narrow confines. It is essential to continue challenging and rejecting such harmful stereotypes, promoting gender equality and recognizing the vast range of contributions women can make in all aspects of society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes. These structures let them see Earths magnetic field as a visual pattern.

You may recall that I’d been helping out a local charity with their website? Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage. Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!). Question: Why did the therapist work mainly on the author's back?

I know that the answer to the question \\"Vermiform means like a ?\\" is in \\"Holometabolism, or complete metamorphosis, is where the insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin.:151 Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis.\\".

Step 2: Analyze the process of breathing The provided process explains the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body during respiration. Breathing is crucial for providing oxygen to the muscles, which allows them to function during physical activities such as running. Step 3: Consider the impact of fitness on the respiratory system When a person gets very fit, their cardiovascular and respiratory systems become more efficient. This means that their heart, lungs, and blood vessels work together more effectively to deliver oxygen to their muscles during exercise. Step 4: Assess the impact of increased fitness on running a mile A fitter person is more likely to have a more efficient respiratory system, which will allow them to have a better oxygen supply to their muscles. This would enable them to run a mile in less than five minutes, as their muscles can work more efficiently and effectively with the increased oxygen supply. Conclusion: Considering the steps and analysis, the answer is A: more. As a person gets very fit, their respiratory and cardiovascular systems become more efficient, which will likely improve their ability to run a mile in less than five minutes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It is difficult for doctors to help a person with a damaged brain. Without enough blood, the brain lives for only three to five minutes. More often the doctors can't fix the damage. Sometimes they are afraid to try something to help because it is dangerous to work on the brain. The doctors might make the person worse if he operates on the brain. Dr. Robert White, a famous professor and doctor, thinks he knows a way to help. He thinks doctors should make the brain very cold. If it is very cold, the brain can live without blood for 30 minutes. This gives the doctor a longer time to do something for the brain. Dr. White tried his idea on 13 monkeys. First he taught them to do different jobs, and then he operated on them. He made the monkeys' blood go through a machine. The machine cooled the blood. Then the machine sent the blood back to the monkeys' brains. When the brain's temperature was 10degC, Dr. White stopped the blood to the brain. After 30 minutes he turned the blood back on. He warmed the blood again. After their operations the monkeys were like they had been before. They were healthy and busy. Each one could still do the jobs the doctor had taught them.

From the sentence alone, it's clear that there's an expectation of some significant challenge or hardship. The speaker seems skeptical about the ability of an island with a population of 4.4 million people to manage the situation. The phrase \\"this madness\\" is very vague and can refer to practically anything that the speaker considers overwhelming or absurd. It could imply a natural disaster, an economic crisis, a pandemic, political unrest, large-scale events or festivals, sudden influxes of tourists, drastic policy changes, war, among many other possibilities. The \\"small island\\" could be any island with around 4.4 million inhabitants. Some examples could include Ireland, New Zealand, or Puerto Rico, all of which have populations in that approximate range. The particular island in question might affect the interpretation of the sentence. Finally, the phrase, \\"How can it be believed?\\" suggests the speaker's disbelief or doubt. They are questioning the assumption or belief that the small island can cope with \\"this madness\\". There's an implicit criticism in the sentiment.

Kevin Maurice Garnett (born May 19, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 21 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played the power forward and center positions. In high school, Garnett was a 1995 McDonald's All-American at Farragut Career Academy and won a national player of the year award. He entered the 1995 NBA draft, where he was selected with the fifth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves and became the first NBA player drafted directly out of high school in 20 years. On June 28, 2013, the day of the NBA draft, the Boston Celtics and the Brooklyn Nets reached a deal to trade Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry for future first-round picks in the 2014, 2016, and 2018 drafts, as well as Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, Kris Joseph, MarShon Brooks and Keith Bogans. The deal was finally completed on July 12, with Brooklyn also receiving D. J. White. Garnett chose to wear number 2 to honor his former Minnesota Timberwolves teammate Malik Sealy. On December 13, 2013, Garnett surpassed 14,000 career rebounds, becoming only the tenth player in NBA history to do so. In reaching the milestone, Garnett also joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone as the only players to reach 25,000 points, 14,000 rebounds and 5,000 assists. He reached the milestone in the third quarter of a 103-99 road loss to the Detroit Pistons. The Nets cherished Garnett's leadership and passion. Despite boasting a starting line-up of Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Paul Pierce, and Garnett, the Nets were unable to advance past the second round of the playoffs, while Garnett finished his 19th NBA season with career low averages of 6.5 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. On November 1, 2014, Garnett had arguably his best game for the Nets as he recorded 18 points and 14 rebounds in 35 minutes of action in the Nets' 102-90 win over the Detroit Pistons. Six days later, he recorded five rebounds in a 110-99 win over the New York Knicks and by doing so, passed Walt Bellamy for ninth place on the all-time rebounding list.

News article: A wearable camera designed to take a picture every 30 seconds, to allow owners to record their daily lives, has become the latest technogical hit on Kickstarter, the \\"crowd funding\\" website. So far, Memoto, billed as \\"the world's smallest wearbale camera\\" has attracted more than 44,000 of its 50,000 funding target from more than 250 gadget fans keen to capture a digital record of their entire lives . The tiny device is designed to be clipped to clothes or worn on a necklace. As well as a five megapixel digital camera, it will feature a GPS chip to keep track of owners' locations and automatically log and organise pictures via a specially-created iPhone and Android apps. Memoto claims the battery will last two days. \\"Many fantastic and special moments become blurred together after a while and it feels like life just rushes by, too fast for us to grasp,\\" said the Swedish start-up behind the project. \\"We at Memoto wanted to find a way to relive more of our lives in the future - and enjoy the present as it happens.\\" Memoto describes the project as \\"lifelogging\\" technology and plans to ship its first finished cameras in February next year. It is part of a trend dubbed the \\"Quantified Self Movement\\", proponents of which aim to record as much data as possible about their lives. They have adopted other products including the Nike+ FuelBand and Fitbit tracker, both of which keep tabs on wearers' exercise patterns, as well as smartphone apps to track heart rate other health data. \\"The camera and the app work together to give you pictures of every single moment of your life, complete with information on when you took it and where you were,\\" said Memoto. \\"This means that you can revisit any moment of your past.\\" The apps the firm is developing are designed to help deal with the glut of images the capture will take by helping organise them and pick out interesting moments. \\"The way this works is that the photos are organized into groups of \\"moments\\" on a timeline,\\" said Memote. \\"On the timeline, you're presented with keyframes (about 30 per day) each representing one moment. You can tap a moment to relive it in a stop-motion like video of all the pictures in that moment.\\" \\"This enables you to not only browse your life the way you remember it, but to search for specific events of your life: who was it that you met at that party or what did the sunset looked like in Lapland in June?\\" Critics of the Quantified Self Movement argue that, as well as being narcissistic, it makes people live for technology rather than use technology to help them live. The German writer Juli Zeh reportedly described it as \\"self-empowerment by self-enslavement\\". Others have also raised concerns about privacy, but Memoto said its product would have strict controls and encouraged owners to exerciee restraint. \\"If someone asks you not to use your Memoto camera - then please don't,\\" it said. \\"If someone doesn't explicitly ask you, but you have reason to believe that the place or the context is inappropriate for photographing - then please don't.\\" ||||| Would you record your life in a series of geotagged photos? Swedish startup Memoto is betting enough people will want digital memory assistance, and their first-day performance on Kickstarter backs them up. Life-logging is not a new idea. Steve Mann has been working on it since the 1980s, as has Gordon Bell since the 1990s. Just two months ago, a Microsoft patent application showed how Redmond is trying to capitalize on its years of research in the field of computer-assisted life-recording, and Google clearly has similar applications in mind with Project Glass. One of the big issues with the concept is the size and wearability of the recording device, which is why an upcoming product from a Swedish company called Memoto is so exciting. They launched a Kickstarter project earlier today and achieved their 50k goal within five hours. At the time of writing they had almost doubled that amount, and are now into a 150k stretch goal phase where backers will get to choose a new colour for the postage-stamp-sized device. Here’s Memoto’s Kickstarter video: According to Memoto CEO Martin Källström, who was previously head of the blog search engine Twingly, the company has already benefited from a €500k seed round from Passion Capital and angels such as Amen CEO Felix Petersen. That was enough to start paying the Memoto team – now the Kickstarter cash will see the device become reality. Not only that: Källström also sees the Kickstarter success as validation for the idea ahead of a Series A round this winter. How does it work? The Memoto device measures 36x36x9mm and contains a five-megapixel camera, a GPS unit, an accelerometer and 8GB of storage – enough for two days’ worth of photos, seeing as the device takes a photo every 30 seconds. It will cost 279, or nothing for early backers who give 199 or more. The user will need to hook the device up to their computer every couple of days, both to upload the photos and recharge the battery. The photos will go onto Memoto’s servers and be made accessible for time-lapse-style playback through smartphone apps. Crucially for security, the photos will be encrypted and inaccessible even to Memoto’s analytics systems while the user is not logged in. During that log-in time, Memoto’s systems will be able to pick out key frames that represent “moments”, for example the four hours where the user is sitting in front of their computer – these are the frames that will be shown when the user is trying to sift through everything they did on a certain day. The company reckons each device will generate 1.5TB of data a year (although they will of course be able to delete what they don’t want to remember). Users will pay an annual subscription for the photos’ storage, providing Memoto with a second revenue stream on top of device sales. “If there weren’t a customized storage service available, it would be a big problem for everyday consumers to keep all the data on-hand in a safe and secure way,” Källström told me. Keeping memories alive So, what happens if the user falls on hard times and can’t keep up with their subscription fees? Would that mean the digital equivalent of losing your memory? “We see that the photos we are storing will be very valuable data and we will do everything to make sure that no mistakes or unfortunate circumstances will cause any data loss,” Källström said. “There will be three ways to get the data down from our storage service: you can download individual images through the app interface in full resolution, you can download in bulk, and there will also be an API where third-party developers can build their own lifelogging apps.” And what about those patents? Källström reckons the idea of a wearable camera is now well-established enough that there are “no patents hindering new applications in that space”. Hopefully he’s right. What we’re looking at here is a realization of Microsoft’s old SenseCam project, made realistic – if still a bit pricey – for consumers. Even Gordon Bell is quoted in Memoto’s press release as endorsing the thing. “A small, wearable, geo-aware camera with pictures going to the cloud is just what we need for life-logging of life’s events. I’m anxious to try the Memoto camera,” Bell said. High praise indeed – now Memoto just needs to live up to those expectations. We’ll see after the commercial launch early next year. ||||| Our Kickstarter campaign is over, but you can still get a Memoto Camera. Head over to Memoto.com for more info and to place an order. Thank you all backers! Thanks to you, the Memoto Lifelogging Camera was successfully funded! This Kickstarter page will be frozen on November 30, 2012. To follow our journey ahead, follow us on Twitter (@memototeam) and on Facebook (fb.com/Memotocompany). Orders are now available through Memoto.com. –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– Remember every moment. Have you thought about how much of life that goes missing from your memories? Many fantastic and special moments become blurred together after a while and it feels like life just rushes by, too fast for us to grasp. We at Memoto wanted to find a way to relive more of our lives in the future - and enjoy the present as it happens. The functional prototype The Memoto camera comes in three different colors: Arctic White, Graphite Grey and Memoto Orange The Functional Prototype Hardware devices consists of mechanics, electronics and firmware. The mechanics are often overlooked, the 3D printed prototypes in our Kickstarter video has taken two engineers and one industrial designer over four months to finalize. The result is a production-ready construction of a weather protected, very strong and well designed camera casing. The electronics has taken even longer to develop. We have used evaluation kits and break-out boards to put together a complete set of components in order to be able to start development of the firmware. At the same time we have made a circuit board design that fits all the components into a very tiny package. What does the functional prototype do? The prototype does everything the final camera will do, taking photos and registering GPS position. Sample photo and gps data from the Memoto prototype camera Miniaturizing the electronics Not only has miniaturized circuit board been designed by one of Sweden's foremost digital camera engineers who are working on our team, but it is also undergoing careful review and approval from these outside sources: The head of engineering at our Taiwanese manufacturer, Yomura, to make sure it fits into the camera casing without causing any problems during assembly or long term use The engineer that created the Anoto pen, in order to verify our power management and battery life The engineer behind the electronics in the Mutewatch watch, to verify overall build quality and circuit wiring The GPS chip manufacturer, to verify that the GPS will function properly and to compare it with their reference design The GPS antenna manufacturer, to verify our antenna placement in relation to other components and the casing The PCB currently waiting for review and quote from manufacturers. The 8-layer High-Density-Interconnect printed circuit board with laserdrilled blind and buried vias Want more details? Here's a word from our engineers: \\"The Memoto camera is small and uses fine-pitch BGA components with as small as 0.5 mm (0.02\\") distance between the pads. This required the use of an 8-layer IPC-2226 Type-II HDI (High Density Interconnect) PCB of 4/4 mil track/space, with filled and capped laser-drilled partial vias of 0.1 mm (0.004\\") diameter between the outermost layers as well as buried vias, which are mechanically drilled partial vias between layers inside the PCB. This via technology, including placing vias inside the BGA pads, is required to avoid interfering with routing on the top and bottom component layers and make room for fine-pitch BGA escape. Due to the presence of high-speed USB tracks and antenna signals on the PCB, it also has been impedance controlled which involves analysis of how the electric fields behave in the metal layers relative the other dielectric layers in the PCB.\\" The world's smallest wearable camera The Memoto camera is a tiny camera and GPS that you clip on and wear. It’s an entirely new kind of digital camera with no controls. Instead, it automatically takes photos as you go. The Memoto app then seamlessly and effortlessly organizes them for you. Easy and effortless The camera has no buttons. (That's right, no buttons.) As long as you wear the camera, it is constantly taking pictures. It takes two, geotagged photos a minute with recorded orientation so that the app can show them upright no matter how you are wearing the camera. And it’s weather protected, so you don’t have to worry about it in inclement weather. The camera and the app work together to give you pictures of every single moment of your life, complete with information on when you took it and where you were. This means that you can revisit any moment of your past. The Memoto lifelogging camera - only 36x36x9 mm Long battery life The camera’s batteries won't need to be recharged until after approximately 2 days of use (using default photo frequency of 2 shots per minute). To recharge the camera’s batteries, you connect the camera to your computer; at the same time the photos are automatically uploaded to Memoto’s servers. There are no buttons to press. You just wear the camera, then charge it and wear it again. Access your life through the Memoto app With this many pictures captured and stored every day, we think it's crucial that you can easily browse among the best and most meaningful ones. The app we're building for iPhone and Android organizes the photos to work as a photographic memory even after many years. Concept images of the iPhone app. (Photos taken with a iPhone4S). From left: Timeline view with notifications, Map display, Social timeline view Concept images of the Android app. Left: Login screen. Right: Moment view in private mode. Relive your life like you remember it The way this works is that the photos are organized into groups of \\"moments\\" on a timeline. On the timeline, you're presented with keyframes (about 30 per day) each representing one moment. You can tap a moment to relive it in a stop-motion like video of all the pictures in that moment. The image analysis and organization is made out of the images’ metadata, such as time, place and light. This enables you to not only browse your life the way you remember it, but to search for specific events of your life: who was it that you met at that party or what did the sunset looked like in Lapland in June? (Fun fact: there is no sunset in Lapland in June). The app organizes all your photos on a timeline, making them easy accessable to search and share. Your photos are yours and only you can share them The app comes with features for sharing through the biggest social media services. However, we want to stress that your Memoto pictures will always be private by default. That is, you only share pictures when you deliberately want to share them. Cutting your storage costs at least in half The Memoto Camera potentially produces a huge amount of bits and bytes. 4 GB data per day amounts to up to 1,5 terabyte per year. Instead of you storing all this on unreliable and expensive hard drives that can get stolen or lost, Memoto offers safe and secure infinite photo storage at a flat monthly fee, which will always be a lot more affordable than hard drives. For Kickstarter backers, the first year of storage is included in the reward! Technical specifications Camera Automatic photo capture at customizable frequency (default frequency is once every 30 seconds) Double-tap on the camera case to manually take a photo and bookmark it 5 megapixel resolution images Log of GPS positions and timestamps Built-in rechargeable battery which lasts up to two days LED battery life indicator 2 full days of constant photographing (4000 pictures) space on memory Built-in accelerometer ensures that pictures are correctly oriented regardless of how the camera is worn Micro-USB port for charging and connecting to computer Stainless steel clip to connect the camera to your clothes 36x36x9 millimeters small Software ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Swedish start-up Memoto has created a wearable camera that allows users to record their daily lives with a picture taken every 30 seconds.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. \\"it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived?","completion":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead\\" is predominantly negative but with a slight positive nuance. The negative perception stems from the phrase \\"a chore to sit through,\\" which conveys a feeling of tediousness and discomfort. This expression indicates that the subject under discussion, possibly a movie, play, or any other form of entertainment, fails to engage, entertain or hold the attention of the audience. It implies that watching or experiencing the subject is a laborious and tiresome activity, making it unenjoyable for the viewer. However, the sentence does include a positive note with the phrase \\"some first-rate performances by its lead.\\" This expression acknowledges the exceptional efforts put forth by the lead actors or performers, praising their skills and talent. This part of the statement conveys a feeling of appreciation and admiration for their contribution, highlighting the high quality of their performance. Consequently, this positive aspect slightly softens the overall negative sentiment of the sentence. In conclusion, the sentence's sentiment is primarily negative, as it conveys the notion that the subject is burdensome and unengaging. However, the mention of excellent performances by the lead takes the edge off the negative tone, providing a small glimmer of positivity. Ultimately, the reader is left with the impression that while some aspects of the subject have merit (namely the lead performers), the overall experience is still less than satisfactory."},{"prompt":"Information: - Tokyo, officially Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital of Japan and one of its 47 prefectures. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kant region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former and the . - The , known in Japanese as the and also known as the , are a chain of Japanese islands that stretch southwest from Kyushu to Taiwan: the sumi, Tokara, Amami, Okinawa, and Sakishima Islands (further divided into the Miyako and Yaeyama Islands), with Yonaguni the southernmost. The larger are mostly high islands and the smaller ones are mostly coral islands. The largest of the islands is Okinawa. - Karate developed on the Ryukyu Islands in what is now Okinawa, Japan. It was brought to the Japanese mainland in the early 20th century during a time of cultural exchanges between the Japanese and the Chinese. It was systematically taught in Japan after the Taish era. In 1922 the Japanese Ministry of Education invited Gichin Funakoshi to Tokyo to give a karate demonstration. In 1924 Keio University established the first university karate club in mainland Japan and by 1932, major Japanese universities had karate clubs. In this era of escalating Japanese militarism, the name was changed from (\\"Chinese hand\\" or \\"Tang hand\\") to (\\"empty hand\\") both of which are pronounced \\"karate\\" to indicate that the Japanese wished to develop the combat form in Japanese style. After World War II, Okinawa became an important United States military site and karate became popular among servicemen stationed there. - Yuchoku Higa ( 1910 -- 1994 ) was a Japanese Shorin - ryu karate master who was awarded Hanshi ( 10th dan ) in 1976 . In 1927 , he began training under Jiro Shiroma who was a student of Higa 's father In 1934 , under Jinan Shinzato he began training te and Goju - ryu . In 1948 he began studies under Chshin Chibana and in 1965 was awarded 9th dan by Chibana . He served as president of the Okinawa Prefecture Karatedo Federation and the All Okinawa Karatedo Federation . In 1976 he received the rank of Hanshi , 10th Dan . - Early life. Gichin Funakoshi was born on November 10, 1868 (refer to Karate-d, My Way of Life by Gichin Funakoshi), the year of the Meiji Restoration, in Shuri, Okinawa, to a low-rank Rykyan Pechin and originally had the family name Tominakoshi. Funakoshi was born prematurely. His father's name was Gisu. After entering primary school he became close friends with the son of Ank Azato, a karate and Jigen-ry master who would soon become his first karate teacher. Funakoshi's family was stiffly opposed to the abolition of the Japanese topknot, and this meant he would be ineligible to pursue his goal of attending medical school, despite having passed the entrance examination. Being trained in both classical Chinese and Japanese philosophies and teachings, Funakoshi became an assistant teacher in Okinawa. During this time, his relations with the Azato family grew and he began nightly travels to the Azato family residence to receive karate instruction from Ank Azato. - History. Rise of militarism. The military had a strong influence on Japanese society from the Meiji Restoration. Almost all leaders in Japanese society during the Meiji period (whether in the military, politics or business) were ex\\"-samurai\\" or descendants of \\"samurai\\", and shared a set of values and outlooks. The early Meiji government viewed Japan as threatened by western imperialism, and one of the prime motivations for the \\"Fukoku Kyohei\\" policy was to strengthen Japan's economic and industrial foundations, so that a strong military could be built to defend Japan against outside powers. - , abbreviated as or , is a Japanese university located in Minato, Tokyo. It is known as the oldest institute of higher education in Japan. Founder Fukuzawa Yukichi originally established it as a school for Western studies in 1858 in Edo (now Tokyo).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Adding some herbal tea to your routine is not only a great source of uncaffeinated hydration, but some herbs may combat nausea by settling your stomach down or calming your nerves. For example, peppermint, spearmint and chamomile are herbs well known for their stomach soothing abilities. Herbs that may reduce anxiety/stress and make an impact on nausea include: chamomile, Valerian root, passionflower and kava. You can buy these herbal teas at most grocery stores or buy the dried herbs directly and use them to make a herbal infusion. Don't add boiling hot water to herbs as it can destroy some of the helpful compounds. Instead, add very warm water and let the herbs steep for about 15 minutes. Another traditional plant remedy popular for combating nausea is ginger. Ginger has some anti-inflammatory ability and is considered a carminative that reduces gas, bloating and abdominal pain — all of which can cause nausea. Ginger can be consumed as an herbal tea, taken as capsules, or as a lozenge or chew. Most commercial ginger ale doesn't contain real ginger, but some natural brands in health food stores do. Make sure to get rid of the fizz (carbonation) before drinking it. Pickled ginger (the type that often comes with sushi) is another form that's tasty and fairly easy to find. Take some form of ginger about 15–30 minutes before eating solid food in order to reduce the likelihood of nausea. The is some research that indicates supplementing with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) can help reduce chronic nausea and vomiting, especially among women who are pregnant. The recommended dosages are 30mg of pyridoxine hydrochloride daily for up to five days consecutively. Be aware that vitamin B6 supplements may not impact all causes of chronic, unexplained nausea, but it's affordable and worth a try in most cases. Taking too much vitamin B6 (more than 100mg daily) can lead to nerve irritation and numbness/tingling in your limbs. Always keep daily doses under 50mg to be on the safe side.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. So many kids, so many stories. Parents die, leaving kids devastated and unable to speak for days. Parents get deported, leaving kids despondent and hopeless. Children endure emotional, sexual, physical abuse. And more. The saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework. She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters. After going around and around for a while with me and the principal, her mother said that her divorce had really affected this girl, and she had been fighting so hard all her life to get into Berkeley, and what did I have against her daughter? She deserved to go to Cal! They were all in tears. The principal found a way to change her 64% to a 70.01%, and off she went. This young woman full of potential and energy, learned from her mother and my boss, that excuses rule the day. She appears to think that “social justice” means fighting to get your way because the deck is stacked against you, instead of doing the right thing. This is sad. I know this isn’t what you were after, and that this memory says more about me than it does about her. Many other kids I have counseled, who are getting through something life-changing, seem to understand that life is in session, there will always be challenges to rise above, and that focusing in the classroom is a great way to get one’s mind off one’s troubles, if the environment is supportive and the spirit is willing.

She wants to report the principal to the school board Answer:","completion":"B. She wants the best for her daughter The mother in this story seems to be primarily focused on ensuring her daughter gets the best possible education and opportunities, which is why she fights to have her daughter's grade changed so that she can attend UC Berkeley. Though one could argue that the mother's methods and beliefs regarding \\"social justice\\" might not be the most constructive, her intentions to provide the best for her daughter are evident. Her actions demonstrate a desire to support her child through difficult times and ensure her academic success. It is essential, however, to recognize that advocating for one's child should not overshadow the importance of promoting responsibility, accountability, and self-sufficiency. While the mother appears to have good intentions, her actions might have unintentionally taught her daughter that excuses and external circumstances can help her avoid taking responsibility for her actions. In contrast to this particular story, many other resilient and determined students face adversity and life-changing experiences with grace and maturity. They use these challenges to grow stronger and better themselves, focusing on their education as a means to overcome obstacles.

Title: The Siege Movie plot: Following the bombing of an American military installation in the Middle East (the film shows footage from the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing), the U.S. government orchestrates the capture of the mastermind believed to be behind the attack, Sheikh Ahmed bin Talal. In New York City FBI Special Agent Anthony Hubbard (Washington) and his Lebanese-American partner Frank Haddad (Shalhoub) are told of a hijacked bus, fully loaded with passengers and containing an explosive device. The bomb turns out to be a paint bomb and the terrorists manage to escape. The FBI receives demands to release the sheikh. Hubbard eventually comes into conflict with CIA agent Elise Kraft (Bening). Hubbard takes a terrorist suspect into custody and arrests Kraft. Afterwards another terrorist threat is made and an MTA bus is bombed, though the children on-board are permitted to leave before the bus is destroyed. When the FBI captures a person of interest named Samir Nazhde he admits to signing the visa application of one of the suicide bombers in the course of signing many applications for student visas in his job as a lecturer. However, Kraft insists that Samir is not a terrorist and that his continued freedom is vital to the investigation. The FBI eventually identifies and storms a safehouse belonging to terrorists who are associated with the bombings. However, days later, new terror cells launch more devastating attacks, starting with the bombing of the New Victory Theater in Times Square during an evening performance. This is followed days later by a hostage situation at an elementary school (which is resolved when Hubbard shoots the hostage taker). Shortly after this, a suicide bomber drives a van full of explosives into the lobby of 1 Federal Plaza, the location of the FBI's New York City field office, resulting in over 600 fatalities. In spite of objections, the President of the United States declares martial law and armored vehicles and elements of the U.S. Army's 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, under Major General William...

The reviewer expresses disappointment and frustration with the film, emphasizing the repetitive nature of the scenes and the lack of any real on-screen brutality, despite claims made by others. They also mention the unfulfilling ending, describing it as \\"Film over.\\" The fact that the reviewer considers the film \\"one of the most boring films I ever see\\" and \\"absolutely non-recommendable\\" further underscores the negative sentiment. In their review, the commenter highlights several specific aspects of the film which contributed to their dissatisfaction: 1. The repetitive nature of certain scenes: According to the reviewer, the same sequence of events—wherein the killer rapes and mutilates women—repeats hundreds of times throughout the film. This repetition is presented as monotonous and uninteresting, detracting from the overall enjoyment of the film. 2. Lack of on-screen brutality: In spite of comments made by others, the reviewer believes that the camera never actually shows any of the brutal acts taking place. This deception serves to further frustrate and disappoint the reviewer, as they may have expected more explicit content based on other comments made about the film. 3. Unsatisfactory ending: The reviewer also expresses disappointment with how the film concludes, specifically the police's arrest of the killer and his successful manipulation of the jury. The reviewer describes this ending as unfulfilling and ultimately summarizes the film as \\"Viel Lärm um Nichts,\\" a German phrase which translates to \\"much ado about nothing\\" in English.

Architecture Around the beginning of the 20th century, a general dissatisfaction with the emphasis on revivalist architecture and elaborate decoration gave rise to many new lines of thought that served as precursors to Modern Architecture. Notable among these is the Deutscher Werkbund, formed in 1907 to produce better quality machine made objects. The rise of the profession of industrial design is usually placed here. Following this lead, the Bauhaus school, founded in Weimar, Germany in 1919, redefined the architectural bounds prior set throughout history, viewing the creation of a building as the ultimate synthesis—the apex—of art, craft, and technology.

In this situation, I would advise the user to consider how the last date went, and whether there was any indication of losing interest or discomfort. If everything seemed to go well, then it's possible that the guy is just busy or is waiting for the user to initiate the communication. In this case, the user should reach out and send a casual text or call to show their interest and maintain the connection. Question 2: 1. The user likes a guy who has expressed liking the user in the past, and communicated regularly. 2. The guy is now ignoring the user. In this case, I would ask the user to reflect on any possible reasons that might have led to the change in behavior. It could be a misunderstanding, communication issue, or changes in personal circumstances. The user should try to contact the guy, expressing their concern and asking if everything is okay. This will give an opportunity for understanding the situation better and possibly resolving any issues. Comparing the answers: In both cases, I suggest the user initiate the communication to understand the situation better and maintain the connection. However, the context of each question is different. In Question 1, it's about lack of recent communication after a few dates, while in Question 2, it's about a sudden shift in behavior from an initially interested guy. The main similarity in the answers comes from attempting to communicate and get clarity regarding the situation.

Write an article based on this \\"Half of people with lung cancer die within six months of diagnosis, says a report from Macmillan Cancer Support which looked at variations in cancer survival rates.\\"","completion":"Title: Lung Cancer: The Importance of Early Detection and Survival Introduction A recent report from Macmillan Cancer Support revealed startling statistics: roughly half of the individuals diagnosed with lung cancer die within six months of their diagnosis. This disheartening finding underscored not just the severity of the disease, but also the need for better educated populations, improved screening methods, and continued research into effective treatments. In this article, we will explore the variations in cancer survival rates, the critical role early detection plays in improving outcomes and review some practical steps that can be taken to early detect lung cancer. Step 1: Understanding Lung Cancer and Survival Rates Lung cancer is one of the most common and deadly forms of cancer, with around 2 million people diagnosed worldwide each year. The aggressiveness of the disease largely contributes to the high mortality rates cited in the Macmillan Cancer Support report. Survival rates for lung cancer vary significantly depending on factors such as the stage at which the disease is diagnosed, underlying health and age of the patient and available treatments. Step 2: The Importance of Early Detection Detecting lung cancer in its early stages is vital for improving survival rates. When the disease is caught early, before it has spread to other areas of the body, patients have a significantly better chance of surviving. Unfortunately, lung cancer symptoms often go unnoticed or are mistaken for other respiratory issues until the cancer has advanced to later stages. Step 3: Reviewing Current Detection Methods Current lung cancer detection methods include screening tests such as chest X-rays and low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans. Annual lung cancer screenings using low-dose CT scans have shown to be effective in detecting lung cancer early and reducing lung cancer-related mortality rates, particularly for individuals at high risk, such as current and former heavy smokers. Step 4: Addressing the Barriers to Early Detection However, there are several barriers that might hinder early lung cancer detection. Limited geographic access to screening facilities, lack of insurance coverage, and lack of awareness about the benefits of screening can all contribute to delays in diagnosis. To address these issues, there is a need for better infrastructure support and increased access to affordable and effective screening methods. Step 5: Promoting Awareness and Education Raising awareness about lung cancer and the importance of early detection is crucial to improving survival rates. Public health campaigns should be designed to inform the public about lung cancer symptoms, risk factors, and the benefits of early screening. Step 6: Supporting Research and Innovation Finally, it is essential to support continued research into novel diagnostic techniques and treatments for lung cancer. The development of innovative detection methods and targeted therapies could significantly improve the prognosis for patients with the disease, ultimately leading to better survival rates and quality of life. Conclusion The Macmillan Cancer Support report highlights a stark reality for those diagnosed with lung cancer. However, with increased awareness, improved screening accessibility, and the advancement of research, we can work together to improve detection, treatments and, subsequently, survival rates. As a society, we must continue to prioritize the fight against lung cancer, emphasizing the importance of early detection and supporting those affected by this devastating disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Dan Gerhard Brown was born on June 22, 1964 in Exeter, New Hampshire. He has a younger sister, Valerie (born 1968) and brother, Gregory (born 1975). Brown attended Exeter's public schools until the ninth grade. He grew up on the campus of Phillips Exeter Academy, where his father, Richard G. Brown, was a teacher of mathematics and wrote textbooks from 1968 until his retirement in 1997. In August 2005 author Lewis Perdue unsuccessfully sued Brown for plagiarism, on the basis of claimed similarity between The Da Vinci Code and his novels, The Da Vinci Legacy (1983) and Daughter of God (2000). Judge George Daniels said, in part: \\"A reasonable average lay observer would not conclude that The Da Vinci Code is substantially similar to Daughter of God.\\" In April 2006 Brown's publisher, Random House, won a copyright infringement case brought by authors Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, who claimed that Brown stole ideas from their 1982 book Holy Blood Holy Grail for his 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code. It was in the book Holy Blood Holy Grail that Baigent, Leigh, and co-author Henry Lincoln had advanced the theory that Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had a child and that the bloodline continues to this day. Brown apparently alluded to the two authors' names in his book. Leigh Teabing, a lead character in both the novel and the film, uses Leigh's name as the first name, and anagrammatically derives his last name from Baigent's. Mr Justice Peter Smith found in Brown's favor in the case, and as a private amusement, embedded his own Smithy code in the written judgment. On March 28, 2007, Brown's publisher, Random House, won an appeal copyright infringement case. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales rejected the efforts from Baigent and Leigh, who became liable for paying legal expenses of nearly US6 million. Brown has been sued twice in U.S. Federal courts by the author Jack Dunn who claims Brown copied a huge part of his book The Vatican Boys to write The Da Vinci Code (2006-07) and Angels & Demons (2011-12). Both lawsuits were not allowed to go to a jury trial. In 2017, in London, another claim was begun against Brown by Jack Dunn who claimed that Justice was not served in the U.S. lawsuits.

The initial premise \\"A man sells a product in the street as people pass by.\\" provides information about a man's actions but does not reveal anything directly about his motives. He could be selling a product for a variety of reasons. He could be trying to make money, which is a common reason for selling items, but that is an assumption, not a guaranteed fact that is inherently true based on this premise. It is also possible that he's selling the product on behalf of a charity and doesn't profit personally from the sales. He might also be trying to spread awareness about a certain product or idea rather than primarily focusing on monetary gain. For instance, he could be selling self-published books or handmade crafts just for the joy of sharing his creations, with income as a beneficial but ancillary motivation.

Select from the following. (i). Before deciding on a treatment plan, talk with your doctor about all possible risk factors. For example, if you take a drug that can affect your immune function, remember it's not a good idea to take it with you when you take an ice bath or do other strenuous labor.. (ii). You might also realize that, if you experience cramps as a result of a hernia, you might also experience diarrhea while suffering from a hernia, which can cause abdominal cramps. One way to evaluate your risk factors is by using a scale.. (iii). Risk factors for hernias include : Increased abdominal pressure coughing heavy lifting constipation pregnancy obesity advancing age smoking steroid use Take note of any bulges. A hernia is an imperfection in the muscular container of an organ.. (iv). Another risk factor is your thyroid: your thyroid system has also become weakened to produce estrogen and other hormone-stimulating hormones. Your immune system can become compromised if your thyroid mass index (bmi) levels are low..","completion":"(i). Before deciding on a treatment plan, it is important to discuss all potential risk factors with your healthcare provider. They can help you understand how certain medications, underlying health conditions, and lifestyle choices might contribute to your overall risk for herniation. Additionally, your doctor can provide guidance on ways to mitigate these risks and recommend lifestyle changes that may help prevent hernias from developing. (ii). If you are experiencing symptoms like cramps or diarrhea, it is essential to mention these during your medical consultation, as they could be signs of a hernia. By evaluating your risk factors and using a scale or scoring system, your healthcare provider can better assess your likelihood for developing a hernia and recommend appropriate preventive measures. (iii). Recognizing risk factors can help individuals identify potential issues early on, increasing the chances of successful treatment and recovery. Some common risk factors associated with hernias include: 1. Increased abdominal pressure due to heavy lifting, coughing, or constipation. 2. Pregnancy, which places additional pressure on the abdominal muscles. 3. Obesity, as carrying extra weight can put more strain on the abdominal wall. 4. Advancing age, as muscles and tissues weaken over time. 5. Smoking, which can weaken the connective tissues in your abdominal muscular system. 6. Steroid use, as it can contribute to muscle weakness and an increased hernia risk. (iv). Thyroid function is another potential risk factor, as it plays a crucial role in many essential bodily functions, including hormone production and immune function. A compromised thyroid system may result in decreased production of hormones, such as estrogen, which can weaken connective tissues and increase the risk of hernias. Low thyroid mass index (BMI) levels might also indicate an unhealthy thyroid, as well as potentially weakened immune function. Monitoring your thyroid health and maintaining an optimal BMI can contribute to a reduced risk of developing hernias. In conclusion, understanding the most logical next event when suspecting a hernia involves discussing your symptoms and risk factors with a healthcare professional. By identifying potential issues early on, you can work together with your doctor to create a prevention or treatment plan tailored to your specific needs, ultimately increasing your chances of a successful outcome."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Article: Ebola is of the forest Ebola was named after a river, but in hindsight it would have been more fitting to name it after a forest. The Ebola virus lives in the deep equatorial forests of Central Africa, and can infect people who live, hunt or work in the forest or on its fringes. The Forest Region of Guinea, where the current outbreak began, had had no known outbreaks. But it is one of several areas in Africa thought to have the right combination of forest, bats, temperature and other environmental conditions to possibly harbor the Ebola virus. ||||| While people in West Africa continue to die from Ebola, scientists are pondering a mystery that has eluded them since the first known outbreak of the virus among humans, in 1976: Where does this fearful bug hide when it’s not killing people? A new hypothesis described Tuesday in EMBO Molecular Medicine presents an unexpected scenario of how Ebola 2014 may have gotten started. The study suggests that the virus may have passed into its first human victim, a child, from a small insect-eating bat, an animal so diminutive that it is hunted by children but not by adults. Ebola virus is a zoonosis, meaning an infectious agent that lives inconspicuously and innocuously within some nonhuman animal (its reservoir host) and spills over occasionally into humans, causing disease. Fruit bats, which are relatively large and meaty, have often been touted as suspects, but the virus’s reservoir host has never been positively identified. The gold standard of proof—culturing live virus from the tissues or blood of a candidate animal—hasn’t ever been achieved from fruit bats, nor from any other creature. So the virus is still at large, its reservoir indeterminate, its whereabouts unknown, somewhere within the landscape of tropical Africa. View Images The first known victim of the 2014 Ebola epidemic was two-year-old Emile Ouamouno, shown in a family photo in Méliandou, Guinea. Photograph by Suzanne Beukes, UNICEF Tracking a Killer The Ebola epidemic of 2014, which has now totaled almost 20,000 cases and at least 7,708 deaths, began quietly in southeastern Guinea slightly more than a year ago. News of the outbreak reached the wider world last March, and within weeks Fabian Leendertz of the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin assembled a multidisciplinary team that included ecologists and veterinarians, plus an anthropologist to interview local people, and traveled to the affected area, near the borders of Liberia and Ivory Coast. Surveying wildlife in forests there, the scientists found no evidence of a die-off among larger animals, such as duikers, monkeys, and chimpanzees, that are also susceptible to Ebola. This suggested that perhaps the virus had spilled over directly from its reservoir host into humans, without passing through other animals hunted or scavenged for food. View Images NG Maps. Source: Global Land Cover Facility The team then focused on a village called Méliandou, in Guinea—the index village, where the human outbreak began. A young boy, Emile Ouamouno, was the earliest known victim. He died with Ebola-like symptoms in Méliandou back in December 2013, followed soon by his mother, sister, and grandmother. No adult males died in the first wave of the outbreak, another clue that seemed to point away from hunted wildlife as the origin of the virus. During eight days in Méliandou, Leendertz’s team gathered testimony from survivors and collected samples, including blood and tissues from captured bats. From these data emerged the new hypothesis: Maybe the reservoir host was a bat, yes—but a very different sort of bat, in a different ecological relationship with humans. While fruit bats are abundant in southeastern Guinea, they don’t roost in large aggregations near Méliandou. But the village did harbor a sizable number of small, insectivorous bats, which roosted under the roofs of houses and in natural recesses, such as hollow trees. The locals call them lolibelo. “These bats are reportedly targeted by children,” the new paper recounts, “who regularly hunt and grill them over small fires.” Imagine a marshmallow roast, except the marshmallows are mouse-size bats devoured by protein-hungry children. View Images Emile Ouamouno, the first to die in the current Ebola outbreak, may have been infected by bats while playing in this hollow tree near his village of Méliandou, Guinea. Photograph by Fabian Leendertz, Robert Koch-Institute, Berlin The researchers then uncovered another clue: a large hollow tree, which had recently been set afire, producing as it burned what someone recalled as “a rain of bats.” Leendertz’s team collected soil samples at the base of that tree, which eventually yielded traces of DNA assignable to Mops condylurus, commonly called the Angolan free-tailed bat. That species matched the villagers’ descriptions of lolibelo. What’s more, the big hollow tree had reportedly been a favorite play spot for small children of the village, including the deceased little boy, despite—or perhaps because of—the fact that it was full of little bats. Too Close for Comfort? All this is circumstantial evidence, pointing to a possibility that Ebola 2014 began when the boy in Méliandou came in contact with an Angolan free-tailed bat. Bats of that species have previously been found to contain antibodies against Ebola virus, but the sample numbers were very small, and antibodies are weak evidence. The species has therefore not been included among the prime suspects as a reservoir for Ebola. That could change, if further sampling of Angolan free-tailed bats reveals any stronger data connecting the bat and the virus. View Images Scientists identified a bat species that may host Ebola virus by analyzing DNA in soil and ash. The material was collected from around a tree that had held bats near the site of the first known human case in Guinea. Shown above is Fabian Leendertz, who led the science team, dissecting a bat. Photograph by Fabian Leendertz, Robert Koch-Institute, Berlin The new paper is intriguing and suggestive—but is it important? “Could be,” says Charles Calisher, emeritus professor at Colorado State University and an authority on zoonotic viruses, “if they would follow up with more studies.” Leendertz and colleagues have already followed up, with extensive bat sampling in villages in Ivory Coast, Guinea’s neighbor to the southeast. Laboratory results from those samples, available soon, may suggest whether Mops condylurus is a hot lead in the long search for Ebola’s hiding place—or just another enticing dead end. View Images The small village of Méliandou, shown, was the first area hit in the current Ebola virus outbreak. Photograph by Jerome Delay, Associated Press If the lab data do implicate this bat species, then a disquieting question arises: Why aren’t there more spillovers of Ebola virus into humans—outbreaks beginning every month, every week? The Angolan free-tailed bat is a forest creature that has become a village creature; as the great trees (including the hollow trees, like that one in Méliandou) have been felled, replaced by clearings and gardens and settlements, the bat has been forced to adapt. It has become synanthropic, closely associated with humans. Now it roosts in the hundreds beneath the thatch and metal roofs of village houses, just overhead as people eat and sleep. Is Ebola that close too? If so, we’ve got still more to learn about this lethal, mysterious virus: not just where it hides and how it gets into humans, but why sometimes it lurks without leaping.

Mays Gilliam is the alderman for the 9th Ward in Washington, D.C.. After learning he is likely to lose his job and getting dumped by his girlfriend, Kim, Gilliam is surprisingly chosen as the party candidate for the presidency after his party's original presidential and vice-presidential nominees die in a plane crash and he is lauded as a hero for saving a woman from an explosion. Assuming the election was already lost to sitting vice-president Brian Lewis, the party decided to pick a likable but unwinnable minority candidate to improve their chances in the next presidential election. At first, Gilliam feels he will not be able to succeed as President because he would be representing the entire African-American populace, and does not want to do anything to mess it up. However, Gilliam begins to rise in the polls after his brother persuades him to speak out for what he believes. He begins to talk about issues such as welfare, money, society, etc. After Lewis runs a series of attack ads including one saying Gilliam supports cancer, Gilliam begins to fight back using what he claimed was \\"kissing\\" his opponent (taken from Bugs Bunny–Elmer Fudd cartoons). A part of this strategy includes dubbing a videotape of Osama bin Laden saying he hates America but loves Brian Lewis. This strategy gains Gilliam even more points in the polls. As voting day draws closer, Gilliam eventually learns the reason why he was chosen as the party candidate, fires some disloyal campaign operatives (although they reconciled with him afterwards), and chooses his brother as his running mate. He later has a debate with his opponent in which he manages to win the crowd over by speaking truth about the American life. Finally, Gilliam ends up winning the election and the presidency. The film ends with a shot of Mount Rushmore with Mays Gilliam's head added, complete with bling.","completion":"In the article, a part of Mays Gilliam's strategy includes dubbing a videotape of Osama bin Laden saying he hates America but loves Brian Lewis, the current vice-president.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Options: (a). no. (b). yes.","completion":"The belief that vaccines cause autism is a misconception that has been widely debunked by numerous scientific studies. The origin of the claim that vaccines cause autism can be traced back to a 1998 publication by Dr. Andrew Wakefield in the medical journal The Lancet. His study, which was later discredited, claimed to find a link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. Wakefield's research was later found to be fraudulent and full of methodological flaws, and as a result, his medical license was revoked in 2010. Since then, extensive scientific research has been conducted on the subject, involving millions of children globally. These studies found no causal relationship between vaccines and autism. Large organizations, such as the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, endorse the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and strongly recommend vaccination to protect against preventable diseases. It is worth noting that the development of autism is a complex process that involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While the exact cause of autism is not yet fully understood, vaccines have been conclusively shown not to be one of those factors. In response to the second question, people may still argue that vaccines cause autism due to a variety of reasons: 1. Misinformation: Given the widespread reach of the internet and the ease with which information can be shared, misinformation tends to spread very quickly. Some individuals may still hold on to or share the discredited beliefs from the Wakefield study, genuinely believing it to be accurate information. 2. Confirmation bias: Some individuals may be more likely to accept information that supports their pre-existing beliefs or fears. In the case of vaccines, if someone already believes that vaccines are harmful, they may be more inclined to believe the connection between vaccines and autism, despite evidence to the contrary. 3. Anecdotal evidence: Personal stories can be quite powerful. Stories of autism symptoms manifesting shortly after vaccination, regardless of any causal relationship, can be particularly influential in shaping people's beliefs. 4. Difficulty accepting uncertainty: As the exact cause of autism remains unknown, some people may have difficulty accepting this uncertainty and be more inclined to latch onto a specific cause, such as vaccinations, to help explain why their child has developed autism. Answer to the multi-choice problem: (b). yes. Both questions inquire about the same information related to the belief of vaccines causing autism and the rationale behind it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the following context: Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and... answer the following question: What station played Läther? A:","completion":"The radio station that played Läther, an album by Frank Zappa, was KROQ, based in Pasadena, California. In a unique move at the time, Zappa took the station the material and allowed them to broadcast it on air. His motivation for doing so was in response to Warner Bros. refusing to release Läther - a four-LP project that Zappa had carefully crafted, capturing all aspects of his diverse musical styles. This included rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and his own distinctive, distortion-drenched guitar solos. Warner Bros., wary of the commercial viability of a quadruple-LP, had blocked its release and even prevented its subsequent release when Zappa managed to strike an agreement with another music company, Phonogram Inc. Instead of backing down, the ever-defiant Zappa took the album directly to the radio waves. He strategically used KROQ's reach to ensure his music got to his fans, even going so far as to encourage listeners to make their own tape recordings of the broadcast. This bold move led to another lawsuit with Warner Bros., which escalated to a point where no Zappa material was released for over a year. It was only much later, with limited promotion, that Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 in the form of four individual albums. Despite the legal battles and contractual conflicts with MGM and Warner Bros., Zappa eventually managed to secure the rights to all his material created under these contracts. This is a testament to his relentless pursuit of artistic freedom and his audacious strategies to share his music amidst challenging circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Brennan, the C.I.A. director, warned on the CBS program “Face the Nation” that if lawmakers let those laws lapse, the F.B.I. would “not have the ability then to track these various elements that we are looking at who are trying to carry out attacks here in the homeland.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story But interviews with law enforcement and intelligence officials about what they will do in the interim suggest there are multiple workarounds to the gap. One of the expired laws permitted wiretap orders of “lone wolf” terrorism suspects who are not part of a foreign group, a provision that has apparently never been used. A second permitted “roving” wiretap orders that follow suspects who change phones, a provision that apparently has been used only rarely. The third permitted court orders requiring businesses to turn over records that are relevant to a national security investigation, the provision known as Section 215 of the Patriot Act. In addition to the bulk phone records program, the F.B.I. used Section 215 about 160 times last year to obtain particular business records, like suspects’ Internet activity logs. Advertisement Continue reading the main story All three of the expired laws contained a so-called grandfather clause that permits their authority to continue indefinitely for any investigation that had begun before June 1. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Law enforcement officials have made it clear that the F.B.I. has long-running, open-ended “enterprise” investigations into groups that pose a threat to public safety, like Al Qaeda. A senior intelligence official recently told The New York Times that the administration was open to invoking the grandfather clause to get the records if a need arose during any lapse. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In addition, several officials said, in most terrorism-related cases the F.B.I. could instead use a grand jury subpoena to get the records it wanted by invoking rules for investigations into standard crimes. Still, legal specialists said, there is one hypothetical gap: a counterintelligence investigation scrutinizing a newly arrived foreign diplomat for whom there is no evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. Neither invoking the grandfather clause nor using a grand jury subpoena would be likely to work in that case. But the debate has focused on terrorist attacks, not espionage.

In theory, the Obama administration could also invoke the grandfather clause to ask the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to reauthorize the bulk phone records program as well. However, the administration has vowed not to do that. A federal appeals court recently rejected the theory that Section 215 could be used to authorize the bulk calling logs program, a theory the surveillance court had embraced. Seeking to avoid a confrontation, the government is trying to avoid asking the surveillance court to say anything more about the program until Congress enacts new legislation. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But the apparent loss of the program for now does not mean the government has no way to analyze calling records linked to a new suspect. The F.B.I. can still issue subpoenas called national-security letters to phone companies to obtain the records. Advertisement Continue reading the main story There would be investigative drawbacks. It would probably take longer than querying the N.S.A. bulk calling logs database. And some phone companies do not keep their customers’ calling records more than 18 months, while the security agency keeps them for five years. Any need for such workarounds may be brief. Last month, the House passed the USA Freedom Act. It would extend the three expired laws. After six months, the bill would ban the bulk collection of phone records, and create a new system in which the government could still systematically gain access to such logs to hunt for links to terrorists. But the bulk records would stay in the hands of phone companies. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The legislative impasse grew out of efforts by supporters of keeping the exiting program without changes, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader. Proponents of the existing program have argued that ending it would lead to terrorist attacks. Still, the program cannot claim to have thwarted an attack in nearly 14 years of existence. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Bush administration started the program in October 2001, and persuaded the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to start blessing it as legal under Section 215 in 2006. Since it came to light in 2013, via leaks by the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden, two independent panels studied classified files and concluded that it had not been abused, but also that it had provided scant concrete benefits. The program’s greatest achievement was leading the F.B.I. to scrutinize a man in San Diego who turned out to have donated several thousand dollars to the Shabab, the Islamist group in Somalia. The man was not accused of plotting any attack. Still, privacy groups say that even if there is no evidence that analysts abused the program, merely to have the government collect the records damages Americans’ privacy. And officials say that even if the program has never thwarted an attack, it has helped flesh out investigations and it might yet prove critical. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Those sentiments converged into the changes that would be made by the USA Freedom Act. But for the next few days, at least, things will be a little bit different in post-9/11 America. ||||| President Obama and his top national security officials spent the past few days warning that once intelligence-gathering authorities in the Patriot Act expired just after midnight Sunday, the United States would face a greater risk of a terrorist attack. That argument is highly debatable—at least, in the short term. Not only does the U.S. government have all sorts of other ways to collect the same kind of intelligence outlined in the Patriot Act, but there’s also a little-noticed back door in the act that allows U.S. spy agencies to gather information in pretty much the same ways they did before. In other words, there’s a zombie Patriot Act—one that lives on, though the existing version is dead. On Sunday night, senators voted overwhelmingly to end debate on a measure passed in the House, the USA Freedom Act, which will leave most surveillance authorities in the Patriot Act intact. But some of those powers won’t expire at least until Tuesday and possibly Wednesday. Administration officials had warned that even a momentary interruption posed a grave risk. “I don’t want us to be in a situation in which for a certain period of time those authorities go away and suddenly we’re dark, and heaven forbid we’ve got a problem where we could’ve prevented a terrorist attack or apprehended someone who was engaged in dangerous activity,” Obama told reporters at the White House on Friday. On Sunday, CIA Director John Brennan said on CBS’s Face the Nation that there’d “been a little too much political grandstanding and crusading for ideological causes that have skewed the debate on this issue,” an apparent reference to Senator Rand Paul, a Republican presidential candidate, and his promise to force the law to expire, “but these tools are important to American lives.” They may be. But they are far from the only tools in the counterterrorism arsenal, and though they are no longer law as of Monday, the United States still has plenty of authority to collect intelligence on jihadis and foreign spies. For starters, there will be what’s left of the Patriot Act itself. One former U.S. intelligence official told The Daily Beast that Section 214 of the law, which allows “pen register/trap & trace,” could be used to collect phone and even email records. That would not only cover the gap from the expiring NSA program that collects the phone records of Americans’ landline calls, but potentially expand the government’s collection. (No wonder the NSA largely views the bill that would reform the Patriot Act as a major win.) That former official and another both noted that there are other tools, including under different laws than the Patriot Act, for obtaining “roving wiretaps,” which allow the government to monitor one person’s multiple communications devices. Following the Senate vote to proceed on to the Freedom Act, Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) told The Daily Beast that the intelligence agencies did have a means to continue surveillance of terrorists and spies. “I think there are other tools that can be used, but I’m not going to elaborate on them,” Inhofe said. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a statement Friday if that provision expires, “we will no longer be able to get orders allowing us to effectively track terrorists and spies who switch communications devices.” Maybe not under the Patriot Act. But both former officials said they were confident that a judge would still grant a warrant drawn up for a single suspect and his multiple devices. They also pointed out that the roving-wiretap provision itself has rarely been used. (According to U.S. courts, 11 roving-wiretap orders were issued in 2013, the most recent year for which figures are available.) Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

Then there’s another powerful tool that the FBI and intelligence agencies have long had in their arsenal and still will—national security letters. They make it relatively easy for investigators to gather up all kinds of communications records. This authority can be used to collect phone, Internet, and financial records. National security letters were actually around before the Patriot Act became law in 2001, but the legislation lowered the standard that the government must meet to obtain them. They’ll still be comparatively easy to get now that portions of the Patriot Act are off the books. As for another fearsome sounding and about-to-die provision, the “lone wolf” authority that lets the government track someone who isn’t connected to a known terrorist group, it has never been used. That’s despite the fact that the very threat for which it was written—attacks by individuals who are merely inspired by extremist groups, such as ISIS, but aren’t actually connected to them—appears to be at an all-time high. Whatever provision of law is meant to stop these would-be killers, it’s apparently not in the part of the Patriot Act that expired Sunday night. Here’s another thought that calms spies’ unsettled nerves: There’s actually a loophole in the Patriot Act that could keep one expiring provision more or less alive. Section 215 in the existing version of the law allows the government to obtain any records deemed “relevant” to an investigation of a terrorist or a spy. As of Monday, the criterion switched back to the pre-Patriot Act standard of records that “pertain” to such an investigation. “But thanks to a little-noticed grandfather clause in the law,” the relevance standard “will remain available for investigations already open at the time of sunset, as well as new investigations into offenses committed before the sunset,” Julian Sanchez, a noted surveillance expert and critic of the Patriot Act, wrote in a recent post for Motherboard. This could prove to be the main zombie provision in the undead Patriot Act. But it’s not the only one. All investigations underway right now that use any of the other expired provisions also will be allowed to continue, current and former officials have said in recent weeks. So, there’s no risk that government monitors will “go dark” on any terrorists or spies they’ve already started tracking. Some lawmakers continued to warn that even a short interruption in some surveillance authorities posed a risk to national security. Senator Bob Corker (R-TN), the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the expiring provisions could mean the United States is unable to collect particular kinds of intelligence. But when asked whether the grandfather clause in the Patriot Act didn’t provide some assurances that investigations wouldn’t be derailed, Corker acknowledged, “You may be grandfathered in if the case is underway.” Corker said he thought there was some “fuzziness” in the bill, then added, “I don’t want to overstate the problems that exist.” Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) blasted Paul for what he described as delaying tactics that kept the chamber from enacting the USA Freedom Act on Sunday night and ensuring continuity to existing surveillance powers. “It does seem to me at least reckless to not allow at least a temporary continuation of the bill while we have this debate,” Cornyn told The Daily Beast. “But that’s not the way it’s working, and unfortunately I think it’s part of the presidential campaign, and I think people have to judge it for themselves.” Senator John McCain (R-AZ) said that as far as he was concerned, administration officials should be taken at their word when they warned about security risks from any expired provisions. “All I can tell you is what the director of the CIA said on Sunday,” McCain told The Daily Beast. “If we allow it [to] lapse, the nation is at greater risk. That’s sufficient for me.” Of course, there may be some new investigations for which the government will have to come up with different authorities for collecting information. And intelligence officials have been planning for that, CIA Director Brennan said Sunday. “Law enforcement and intelligence professionals will always use whatever authorities and capabilities and tools they have,” Brennan said. “And if these lapse, I think we’re going to have fewer tools. But we will be working as hard as we can to protect the American people. We have a very good track record of doing that.” Parts of the Patriot Act may have died. But American surveillance will live on and on. —Alexa Corse and Tim Mak contributed reporting. |||||Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the lapse of certain provisions of the USA Patriot Act, a law which had given the US government surveillance powers following the 9/11 attacks. Certain parts of the Act have now expired, including the bulk collection of phone records by the National Security Agency (NSA). However, certain sections of the Act remain in place, such as Section 214, which provides authority to collect phone and email records. The Senate is also currently considering the USA Freedom Act, which would extend the three expired provisions of the USA Patriot Act and adjust other sections, such as phone records staying in the hands of phone companies, instead of being handed over to the government."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Determine the sentiment: ****SPOILERS**** Powerhouse movie that shows how men in desperate situations can go so far as sacrifice their best friends and family members and not realize what monsters that they are by doing it. Until like in the case of bull-like Gypo Noland, Victor Mclaglen, it's too much too late. It's 1922 and the hight of the Black & Tan Irish revolt against the mighty British Empire with the Tans, British occupying troops, on the lookout for wanted Irish Republican rebel Frankie McPhillip, Wallace Ford, wanted for the killing of a Briish soldier. Gypo a good, really the best, friend of the fugitive McPhillip is down on his luck not having a job with his girlfriend Katie, Margot Grahame, forced to turn tricks in the Dublin red-light district in order to pay her rent. After an outraged Gypo worked over a potential John who want's to spend a few hours with Katie, for a shilling or two, an angry Katie tells the not so bright Gyro that he's preventing her for supporting herself with the only bankable asset she has , her body. Katie also tells Gypo that he should wake up to reality and realize what a desperate situation that she's in. Telling the mind-numbed Gypo that it would only cost ten pound sterling for her to go to America, and get out of the poverty of Ireland, Gypo suddenly remembers a poster of his good friend Frankie McPhillip that he just saw announcing a reward of 20 pound sterling. Thats enough money for both him and Kaite to travel to America. Gypo going to a local Dublin flop house and soup kitchen to get a free meal is startled to run into his friend Frankie McPhillip. Frankie tells him that he snuck into Dublin to see both his mother Mrs. McPhillip and sister Mary, Una O'Connor & Heather Angel, and if he can make sure that everything is safe for him to go home and later leave for his Irish Republican unit outside the city. All Gypo can see in Frankie's face is the 20 pound sterling reward for him being turned into the police! Without as much of a second thought, after he assured Frankie that everything is all right, Gypo secretly goes to the police and informs on his friend who's later shot and killed in a police and Tan shootout in his moms house. With the deed done the chief of police hands over the 20 pound sterling, much like thirty pieces of silver, to an almost emotionless Gypo who takes it and sneaks out the back door of the police station so that one one can see him. You can see in the police chief's face and actions that he has nothing but utter contempt for Gypo's betrayal of his friend Frankie McPhillip. Even though he was wanted for murder and an enemy of the British Empire. That's how low traitors or informers are held even by those whom they secretly work for. Gypo turns out to be his own worst enemy after his betrayal of Frankie as his conscience takes control of his mind. Gypo sees and hears everyone, including his unsuspecting girlfriend Katie, pointing a finger and implicating him in Frankie's betrayal and death at the hands of the British authorities. Gypo's guilty mind has him getting himself royally and gloriously drunk, on the reward money, that by the time he's forced to to admit his crime to his Irish Republican Army colleagues, who had the almost dead drunk and slobbering Gypo on trial, the money was just about gone in his partying drinking and whoring. Whatever good feelings, if that's possible, that you had for the weak minded and strong shouldered Gypo was completely demolished when in an act of total desperation, in order to keep from getting shot, he falsely implicate an innocent man Mulligan, Donald Meek, in his crime of informing on his friend Frankie McPhillip. Which is quickly exposed as a total fabrication by non other then the guilt-ridden Gypo himself. The dye is then cast as straws are drawn for who would be the one to put a bullet in Gypo's head for the final gut spilling chapter of this heart wrenching and unforgettable Crime & Punishment classic.","completion":"The sentiment expressed in this text seems to be a mix of admiration and sadness.

Belinda and Maggie, unaware of their ex-husband's heinous past during their respective marriages, are now deeply concerned for the safety of other potential victims. Mr. Williams's disturbing secret came to light when one of his victims bravely spoke out, leading to an investigation and his eventual conviction. Despite serving time in prison for his crimes, there is fear that he may continue to pose a threat to children, prompting Belinda and Maggie's decision to come forward and share their story. Belinda, who has a child from her previous relationship, was unsuspecting when she married Mr. Williams at age 20. Throughout their marriage, she remained unaware of his hidden past until she heard about his arrest and conviction from the news. Shortly after, Maggie faced a similar situation when she married Mr. Williams, also unaware of his criminal past. It wasn't until his sentencing that she realized the extent of his predatory behavior. Distraught, Maggie realized that she had unknowingly put her children at risk by marrying Mr. Williams. Belinda and Maggie are putting aside their pain and grief to work together in warning other potential victims about their ex-husband. By joining forces, they hope to create awareness about the importance of sharing such information and protecting children from harm. Despite having served his sentence in prison, it's concerning that Mr. Williams does not appear to be fully reformed. His new relationship with a single mother in country Victoria could potentially expose more children to harm, instilling a justified fear in his ex-wives. Belinda and Maggie's courageous efforts to protect others from the suffering their families endured may prevent further abuse and contribute to a greater awareness in society. Their dedication, united in a common cause, demonstrates the power of standing up to injustice and working together for the safety and welfare of children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: greek meat dish served in a pita with tzatziki?","completion":"The Greek meat dish served in a pita with tzatziki is called Gyros, also spelled as Gyro. Gyros, pronounced \\"yeer-oh,\\" is a traditional Greek dish consisting of marinated, seasoned, and slowly-roasted meat. The word gyros means \\"to turn\\" or \\"revolution\\" in Greek, reflecting the way the meat is cooked on a rotating vertical spit. The two most common meat options for gyros are pork and chicken; however, you can also find beef or lamb versions. The meat is marinated with a mix of various herbs, spices, and olive oil, which typically include oregano, garlic, thyme, parsley, rosemary, onion, and salt, among others, that give the dish its unique flavor. The marinated meat is then stacked onto a vertical spit and slowly roasted, allowing the meat to become tender and succulent while absorbing all the spices' flavors. Once the cooking process is completed, the meat is thinly sliced from the spit and served in a warm pita bread. The pita commonly acts as a pocket, making it a convenient vessel for holding the gyros components. Tzatziki sauce is a critical component of gyros, as it brings an incredibly refreshing element to the dish. Tzatziki is a traditional Greek yogurt-based sauce made with grated cucumber, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, and fresh dill. The tzatziki adds a tangy, creamy, and cool flavor that balances perfectly with the spiced and roasted meat. In addition to meat and tzatziki, gyros are often garnished with fresh vegetables such as tomato, onion, and lettuce. Some variations can also include additional ingredients like French fries, olives, or feta cheese. To further enhance the flavor, some people will also add a sprinkle of fresh herbs or a splash of lemon juice on top. The combination of juicy, spiced meat, cool and tangy tzatziki, and fresh, crisp vegetables makes gyros a popular street food and a delicious, portable meal enjoyed by millions in Greece and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States.

Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself.

Paragraph: Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000, Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden.

Premise: \\"Each themed section, constantly renewing its attractions, has a variety of fun experiences to offer.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The sections are all themed in relation to one another.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"The sections are all themed in relation to one another\\" is true. The premise states that each themed section is constantly renewing its attractions and offers a variety of fun experiences. However, it does not provide any information about the relationship between the themes of the different sections. In order to determine the relationship between the themes, additional information would be required. For instance, if the premise mentioned that all sections' themes revolve around a central theme or topic that connects them, then we could make an accurate assessment of the hypothesis. There are several possibilities regarding the relationship between the themes. For example: 1. Each section could be based on completely unrelated themes (e.g., one section focused on pirates, another on outer space, and another on fairytales). In this case, the hypothesis would be false, as there is no evident relation between the themes. 2. The themes of each section could be related within a broader category (e.g., all sections are based on different historical periods or different geographical locations, like Ancient Egypt, Medieval Europe, and Ancient China). In this instance, the hypothesis would be true, as the broader category serves as a connecting element between the themes. 3. The themes could be based on a particular aspect of the premise, like the nature of the attractions or the type of experiences offered. For instance, all attractions in each section might be focused on thrill rides, educational exhibits, or immersive storytelling experiences. This interpretation would also make the hypothesis true, as they share a common aspect that links the themes. In conclusion, although the premise states that each themed section constantly renews its attractions and offers a variety of fun experiences, it does not provide sufficient information to infer that the themes are all related to one another. Further information would be necessary to determine the truth or falsity of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - The Eurovision Song Contest, sometimes popularly called Eurovision but not to be confused with the Eurovision network that broadcasts it, is the longest-running annual international TV song competition, held, primarily, among the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) since 1956. The competition was based upon the existing Sanremo Music Festival held in Italy since 1951. - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer. - The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. In older texts the phase is sometimes called the amplitude. - Alternating current (AC), is an electric current which periodically reverses polarity, whereas direct current (DC, also dc) flows only in one direction with a single polarity either positive or negative. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electric energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" are often used to mean simply \\"alternating\\" and \\"direct\\", as when they modify \\"current\\" or \\"voltage\\". - Teleradio - Moldova is the state - owned national radio - TV broadcaster . It owns the TV channels Moldova 1 and TVMI and the radio channels Radio Moldova and Radio Moldova Internaional . TRM was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union on 1 January 1993 , under its former name Radioteleviziunea Nationala din Moldova ( RTNM ) . - In physics and electrical engineering, a conductor is an object or type of material that allows the flow of an electrical current in one or more directions. A metal wire is a common electrical conductor. Electrical current is generated by the flow of negatively charged electrons, positively charged holes, and positive or negative ions in some cases. - Moldova (or sometimes ), or Moldavia, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. The capital city is Chiinu. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - Radio Moldova (RM) is the first publicly funded radio broadcaster in Moldova. - The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) is an alliance of public service media entities, established on 12 February 1950. As of 2015, the organisation comprises 73 active members in 56 countries, and 34 associate members from a further 20 countries. Most EU states are part of this organisation and therefore EBU has been subject to supranational legislation and regulation. It also hosted debates between candidates for the European Commission presidency for the 2014 parliamentary elections but is unrelated to the institution itself. It is best known for producing the Eurovision Song Contest. EBU is a member of the International Music Council. - The European Commission (EC) is an institution of the European Union, responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU. Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate. - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light. - Moldova 1 is the national Moldovan television channel, operated by the national public broadcaster, TeleRadio-Moldova. - The International Music Council (IMC) was created in 1949 as UNESCO's advisory body on matters of music. It is based at UNESCO's headquarters in Paris, France, where it functions as an independent international non-governmental organization. Its primary aim is to facilitate the development and promotion of international music-making. - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on or to heat the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.

In old measures how many chains made a furlong? What is the answer?","completion":"Step 1: Understand the terms \\"chains\\" and \\"furlong\\" in the context of old measures. In old British measures, a chain is a unit of length equal to 22 yards (66 feet), while a furlong is another unit of length equal to 220 yards (660 feet). Step 2: Determine the relationship between chains and furlongs. To find out how many chains make a furlong, we need to establish a relationship between the two units of length. Since both are based on the same units (yards or feet), we can compare their values directly. Step 3: Calculate the number of chains in a furlong. Since 1 chain = 22 yards (66 feet), and 1 furlong = 220 yards (660 feet), we can now determine the number of chains in a furlong by dividing the length of a furlong by the length of a chain: Number of chains in a furlong = Length of a furlong / Length of a chain Number of chains in a furlong = 220 yards / 22 yards = 10 chains So, 10 chains make a furlong."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.

The phrase \\"Zająłem miejsce, zasłony zaciągnęły się z powrotem\\" suggests that the speaker took a seat and the curtains closed. This contextual clue indicates that the speaker is most likely describing an experience related to watching something, such as a film or a performance. Considering the options provided: A. samolot (airplane) - It doesn't make sense to have curtains closing in an airplane for a performance or film. B. Film (movie) - This could be a possibility as curtains may close in a movie theater before the film starts. C. Wystawa (exhibition) - Generally, exhibitions don't have curtains closing in the same way as a theater or cinema. D. Teatr (theater) - This option also makes sense as theater performances often have curtains closing and opening during the show. E. Audytorium (auditorium) – While auditoriums might have curtains, they can host a variety of events, so the description is not specific enough. Based on this analysis of the context and options, the most suitable answers would be either \\"B. Film\\" or \\"D. Teatr\\" as they both involve scenarios with curtains closing before a performance or film begins."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now Movie plot: Set in the turn of the 20th century, the film focuses on Joseph E. Howard, an aspiring songwriter who happily sells a song to performer Lulu Madison, who later takes sole credit for the writing. He angrily confronts her, but she distracts him by seducing him in her hotel suite. Thinking that she can use Joe's talent for her career, she invites him to serve as her personal piano player on her tour. He accepts her invitation and bids farewell to Katie, the young niece of his guardian John McCullem who reluctantly says goodbye. Over the following period, Joe grows to become a successful songwriter. Katie follows him to Philadelphia and joins the tour by lying, saying that her uncle has died. Katie's presence distracts Joe, much to Lulu's anger and jealousy. Although Lulu makes sure it obvious to Katie she is not happy about her presence, Katie remains unaffected and continues supporting Joe in his career, rather than working for Lulu. One evening, Lulu tries to cancel Joe's performance, and Katie responds by ruining Lulu's costume, thus making it possible for Joe to perform his latest song, which is received with wild applause. After being fired by Lulu, Joe and Katie form their own group, working for producers Karl and Kassel. However, Joe is later seduced by attractive performer Fritzi Barrington to work for her. They are successful, but their collaboration proves short-lived, as Fritzi's financial supporter, a flame from the past, is jealous of Joe's connection to her and withdraws. Joe and Fritzi are able to perform a show, though, and it proves to be a major success. They eventually make their debut on Broadway and work together for a while, until Fritzi retires to marry Martin Webb. Joe, feeling betrayed, blames Katie for scaring away Fritzi, as Katie is her understudy in the show. Sometime later, Joe finds out Katie is working under the stage name Pat O'Dare, performing 'I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now', an unpublished song by Joe. Katie is surprised to see him, and they eventually kiss each other.

As for the Italians, we know that Paesiello, who was a famous intriguer against his musical rivals, was a devoted husband whose wife was an invalid and who died soon after her death. Cherubini married Mademoiselle Cecile Turette, when he was thirty-five, and the marriage was not a success. He left a son and two daughters. Spontini, one of whose best operas was based on the life of that much mis-married enthusiast for divorce, John Milton, took to wife a member of the Erard family. In the outer world Spontini was famous for his despotism, his jealousy, his bad temper, and his excessive vanity. None of these qualities as a rule add much to home comfort, and yet, it is said that he lived happily with his wife. We may feel sure that some of the bad light thrown on his character is due purely to the jealousy of rivals, when we consider his domestic content, his ardent interest in the welfare of Mozart's widow and children, and the great efforts he made to secure subscriptions for the widow's biography of Mozart.

Entering the 2011 season, Kaymer turned down a chance to become a full PGA Tour member; he had gained exempt status with his win in the PGA Championship. He stated he would concentrate on the European Tour for 2011, but would play several U.S. events as well. In January, Kaymer claimed his third Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship title in four years and displaced Tiger Woods as number two in the world rankings. After his runner-up finish at the 2011 WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, Kaymer overtook Lee Westwood as the number one golfer in the world, making him only the second German (after Bernhard Langer) to be the top-ranked golfer in the world. At the time he was the second youngest to reach world number one behind Tiger Woods, soon surpassed by Rory McIlroy in March 2012, who gained the top ranking at age 22. In April, he relinquished his number one ranking after eight weeks to Westwood, who won the Indonesian Masters. After reaching the number one ranking, Kaymer decided to undergo a swing change to be able to move the ball both ways. Frustrated with his disappointing results at the Masters, Kaymer looked to better shape a draw, a shot he thought he needed to be able to contend at Augusta. Kaymer missed the cut at the Masters for the fourth time in 2011 and later admitted that changing his swing for Augusta was a \\"big mistake.\\" The rest of 2011 was relatively inconsistent for Kaymer. In November 2011, Kaymer won his first WGC title at the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai, China. He entered the final round trailing Fredrik Jacobson by five strokes, then shot a final round 9-under 63 to take the title by three strokes from Jacobson. After parring his opening six holes, Kaymer birdied nine of the remaining twelve, with four straight birdies at the start of the back nine. This was the biggest comeback win ever in the history of the WGC events, and the lowest final round by a WGC winner, topping a 64 set by Hunter Mahan in 2010. Kaymer became the tenth player to have won both a major and a WGC event, and the win took him back to world number four. Answer this question \\"Which tournaments did he play in Europe?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"The text above does not provide specific information about the tournaments Martin Kaymer played in Europe during the 2011 season.

Positive Movie Review \\"Attack of the Giant Octopus\\" is a thrillingly entertaining B-movie that delivers non-stop action, suspense, and a touch of humor. With its campy special effects, engaging storyline, and unforgettable characters, this low-budget thriller has all the makings of a cult classic. The plot is simple yet captivating: a mutated giant octopus wreaks havoc on a small coastal town, forcing the reluctant sheriff and a brilliant marine biologist to team up to defeat the marine menace. The film wastes no time in plunging its audience into the action, with an opening scene that showcases the colossal power of the octopus with a thrilling attack on a fishing boat. Step by step, our heroes unravel the mystery behind the origin of the giant octopus and devise a plan to save the town. Along the way, they encounter various challenges, including dealing with a corrupt mayor who wants to protect the town's tourist industry at all costs. One of the key strengths of \\"Attack of the Giant Octopus\\" lies in its characters. The protagonists are both likeable and well-developed, and the chemistry between them is palpable. The quirky sheriff, played by B-movie legend Jack Sanders, delivers a perfect balance of determination, fear, and tongue-in-cheek humor. Dr. Emily White, portrayed by up-and-coming actress Laura Simmons, brings intelligence and depth to the typical \\"scientist\\" archetype. The special effects, while not up to the standards of big-budget Hollywood films, have a unique charm that adds to the movie's appeal. The animatronic octopus is a star in its own right, a beautifully crafted creature that manages to be both terrifying and awe-inspiring at the same time. Furthermore, the movie showcases excellent pacing and skilled direction. The action scenes are well-choreographed, and the suspenseful moments are elevated by a tense original score, which perfectly complements the film's overall atmosphere. \\"Attack of the Giant Octopus\\" is an undeniable triumph within the B-movie genre. It celebrates its low budget origins by delivering a thrilling, balanced, and ultimately entertaining experience that will leave fans of B-movies thoroughly satisfied and clamoring for more.

The first U.S. Government sponsored expedition to enter Jackson Hole was the 1859–60 Raynolds Expedition. Led by U.S. Army Captain William F. Raynolds and guided by mountain man Jim Bridger, it included naturalist F. V. Hayden, who later led other expeditions to the region. The expedition had been charged with exploring the Yellowstone region, but encountered difficulties crossing mountain passes due to snow. Bridger ended up guiding the expedition south over Union Pass then following the Gros Ventre River drainage to the Snake River and leaving the region over Teton Pass. Organized exploration of the region was halted during the American Civil War but resumed when F. V. Hayden led the well-funded Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. In 1872, Hayden oversaw explorations in Yellowstone, while a branch of his expedition known as the Snake River Division was led by James Stevenson and explored the Teton region. Along with Stevenson was photographer William Henry Jackson who took the first photographs of the Teton Range. The Hayden Geological Survey named many of the mountains and lakes in the region. The explorations by early mountain men and subsequent expeditions failed to identify any sources of economically viable mineral wealth. Nevertheless, small groups of prospectors set up claims and mining operations on several of the creeks and rivers. By 1900 all organized efforts to retrieve minerals had been abandoned. Though the Teton Range was never permanently inhabited, pioneers began settling the Jackson Hole valley to the east of the range in 1884. These earliest homesteaders were mostly single men who endured long winters, short growing seasons and rocky soils that were hard to cultivate. The region was mostly suited for the cultivation of hay and cattle ranching. By 1890, Jackson Hole had an estimated permanent population of 60. Menor's Ferry was built in 1892 near present-day Moose, Wyoming to provide access for wagons to the west side of the Snake River. Ranching increased significantly from 1900 to 1920,...

To fully address the question, let's consider the United States Air Force (USAF) and the Royal Air Force (RAF) as examples. In the United States Air Force, the highest rank is General of the Air Force (5-star General). This rank is a very rare rank, with only one individual (General Henry H. \\"Hap\\" Arnold) having held the rank in history. Nowadays, the highest rank actively used is General (also known as a 4-star General). The rank structure for USAF, in ascending order, includes Second Lieutenant, First Lieutenant, Captain, Major, Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel, Brigadier General, Major General, Lieutenant General, General, and General of the Air Force. In the Royal Air Force, the highest rank is Marshal of the Royal Air Force. This rank is also rarely used, with the senior most operational officer typically holding the rank of Air Chief Marshal. The ranks of RAF, in ascending order, include Pilot Officer, Flying Officer, Flight Lieutenant, Squadron Leader, Wing Commander, Group Captain, Air Commodore, Air Vice Marshal, Air Marshal, Air Chief Marshal, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force. While the specific ranks and rank structure may vary between different countries and their respective air forces, the overall hierarchy generally consists of a range of officer ranks from junior to senior levels.

I'm 11 and I just got my period during PE today. How do I tell my mom?","completion":"No, the two statements given are not similar, they each address completely different situations and dilemmas, referring to two diverse sets of circumstances and requiring separate advice. \\"I slapped my mom today. What should I do?\\" implies a situation of a conflict or an impulse-driven act that led to a disrespectful physical action taken towards one's mother. To address this, here's a suggested plan: 1. Deeply reflect: Understand the seriousness of the situation. Hitting anybody, let alone one's parent, is majorly disrespectful and does not solve problems. 2. Identify the cause: Understand what led you to this point. Did you have a disagreement or was it an impulsive act out of anger? Recognizing the cause is important. 3. Apologize: Once you have calmed down from the incident, apologize sincerely to your mother. Try to articulate your feelings and take complete responsibility for your act without blaming her for it. 4. Seek help: If your emotions reach a point where you are physically acting out, it might be helpful to seek guidance from school counselors, therapists, or trusted adults. They can provide advice on managing emotions. 5. Rectify behavior: Learn from this event and strive to change your behavior. Develop coping mechanisms for anger like stepping back, deep inhales-exhales, or practicing mindfulness. On the other hand, \\"I'm 11 and I just got my period during PE today. How do I tell my mom?\\" is related to a biological development, a natural part of growing up. Here's how you might address it: 1. Be Calm: Periods are completely normal and a part of growing up. Everyone goes through it and it's a sign you're becoming a woman. There's nothing to stress or worry about. 2. Choose a good time: When you decide to tell your mom, make sure she isn't occupied or stressed. It could be after dinner or during some downtime. 3. Be direct and open: Say something like, \\"Mom, I think I just got my period.\\" 4. Ask questions: Once your mom knows, make sure to ask any questions you have. It’s an important opportunity for you to discuss what’s happening to your body, and what sanitary products you might need. 5. Seek advice: Your mom can also guide you on managing this new phase of your life, including how to handle physical or emotional changes. In conclusion, the two questions, while both refer to situations involving a mother and her child, are not the same; one involves dealing with a grave disrespect, while the other is about handling a natural part of growing up. Therefore, both situations should be dealt with in completely different ways."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Jason brought out some hammer and nails and started to repair Kyle's closet because","completion":"the back panel had come loose, causing the whole structure to become unstable. On visual inspection, Jason realized that the culprit was primarily due to worn-out and rusty nails that had failed to hold the panel in place any longer. Step 1: Gather necessary tools and materials Jason made sure he had all the necessary tools, such as the hammer, new nails, a pry bar, and additional support brackets. The materials included a replacement back panel, if required, and wood glue. Gathering all the necessary items beforehand ensured that the repair process would be efficient and seamless. Step 2: Remove the damaged panel Jason carefully removed the damaged back panel from the structure, using the pry bar to gently detach it from the closet's frame. He did this to inspect the full extent of the damage and assess whether the panel could be salvaged, or if a new one was necessary. Step 3: Assess the closet's frame After removing the back panel, Jason inspected the entire frame of the closet for signs of any other damage or structural instability. He checked for any additional worn-out screws or brackets that might have contributed to the issue. Step 4: Repair or replace the back panel Once the inspection was completed, it was clear that the back panel itself was still in a reusable condition. Jason decided to fix the panel, but before reattaching it, he applied some wood glue along the edges for added reinforcement. Step 5: Reattach the back panel He then aligned the back panel and hammered in new, sturdy nails, ensuring that they were evenly spaced and securely fastened. By using high-quality nails, he could guarantee that the panel would hold in place more effectively. Step 6: Add additional support To prevent future issues, Jason installed support brackets in all four corners of the closet, reinforcing the overall structure. The brackets would also help distribute the weight more evenly, further ensuring the closet's stability. Step 7: Clean up and test the closet With the repairs completed, Jason cleaned up any debris and put away his tools. He then tested the closet by adding some weight to the shelves and gently pushed on the back panel to ensure it was secure. By following these meticulous steps, Jason successfully repaired Kyle's closet and restored its structural integrity. The closet was now ready to house belongings once again, without fear of collapse or further damage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:Process: - The flu virus has receptors, which are like viral Velcro, on the surface of the virus particle - The receptors will lock onto a target cell using these chemical receptors on the surface, which docks onto the cell surface - The receptors then go into the cell - The receptors use it like a factory - The receptors take it over and make it produce thousands or in some cases millions of copies of new viruses - The copies come streaming out of the cell - The copies infect other cells to make more viruses, or they escape from the body and infect a new victim - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the infected virus spreads to receptors happens, how will it affect LESS cells being damaged. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the spreading of the infected virus to the receptors is modified or disturbed, it would potentially result in less cell damage. To understand the possible effects of perturbation on the process, let's break down the various stages of the viral infection and how this change might impact them. 1. Viral attachment and entry: The process starts with the flu virus attaching its receptors onto the target cell's surface. In the perturbation scenario, if the interaction between the viral receptors and the target cell's surface is somehow less efficient or less specific, it may hinder the virus's ability to attach effectively. 2. Viral entry into the cell: Once the virus attaches to the target cell, it enters the cell either through fusion with the cell membrane or endocytosis. If the perturbation affects the virus's ability to merge with the cell membrane or enter the cell, it may lead to fewer viruses successfully infecting the cells. 3. Replication and protein synthesis: Inside the cell, the virus uses the cell's machinery to replicate its genetic material and produce its proteins. If the perturbation indirectly influences the virus's ability to hijack the cellular machinery or reproduce its genetic material, the production of new virus particles might be slower or less efficient. This could potentially lead to a reduced number of virus particles being created and subsequently released from the infected cell, ultimately impacting the spread of the infection. 4. Assembly and release of new viruses: As newly synthesized virus particles are assembled in the cell, they eventually lead to the cell's destruction, releasing the viruses to infect other cells. In this perturbation scenario, should the assembly process be affected, fewer viable viruses might be produced. Additionally, if the release of new viruses is hindered due to less efficient assembly or a slowdown in the cell's destruction, it could result in fewer virus particles finding new cells to infect. 5. Spread of the infection: The released virus particles infect neighboring cells, extending the infection. If the perturbation affects how efficiently the virus particles spread to new cells or possibly makes them less infective, the overall damage to the host organism may be reduced. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis implies that affecting the infected virus's spread to the receptors could potentially lead to less cell damage by impacting various stages of the viral infection process. These influences could range from the initial attachment of the virus to the target cell, to the replication, assembly, and release of new virus particles, or their ability to infect other cells efficiently. The perturbation might either have a direct effect on specific stages of the infection or indirectly alter the virus's capability of effectively damaging cells. Regardless of its direct or indirect nature, the perturbation may slow down or decrease the overall extent of the viral infection, ultimately reducing the damage caused to the host organism's cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - Sovereignty is understood in jurisprudence as the full right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity. It is a basic principle underlying the dominant Westphalian model of state foundation. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east. - Utah (or ) is a state in the western United States. It became the 45th state admitted to the U.S. on January 4, 1896. Utah is the 13th-largest by area, 31st-most-populous, and 10th-least-densely populated of the 50 United States. Utah has a population of more than 3 million (Census estimate for July 1, 2016), approximately 80% of whom live along the Wasatch Front, centering on the state capital Salt Lake City. Utah is bordered by Colorado to the east, Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west. It also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast. - A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\". - Las Vegas (Spanish for \\"The Meadows\\"), officially the City of Las Vegas and often known simply as Vegas, is the 28th-most populated city in the United States, the most populated city in the state of Nevada, and the county seat of Clark County. The city anchors the Las Vegas Valley metropolitan area and is the largest city within the greater Mojave Desert. Las Vegas is an internationally renowned major resort city known primarily for its gambling, shopping, fine dining, entertainment, and nightlife. It is the leading financial, commercial, and cultural center for Nevada. - Michael Heizer is a contemporary artist specializing in large-scale sculptures and earth art (or land art). He currently lives and works in Hiko, Nevada. - Arizona (O'odham: \\"Al onak\\" [ai onak]) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States. It is also part of the Western United States and the Mountain West states. It is the sixth largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. Arizona is one of the Four Corners states. It has borders with New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado. Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626 km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California. - Hiko is a small, agrarian community in the Tonopah Basin on State Route 318 in Lincoln County, Nevada, United States. It is a census-designated place, with a population of 119 at the 2010 census. Hiko was the county seat of Lincoln County from 1867 to 1871 and a few hundred residents lived nearby, due largely to silver mines in the area. Today, the area is a farming and ranching area, and not much remains of the old town except the cemetery, some mill ruins and a red rock building that was a general store. Although populated, Hiko appears on at least two ghost town lists. Most of the residents of Hiko own farms or ranches, and little to no industrial activity takes place there. In 1871 Hiko was replaced as the county seat of Lincoln County with the current seat, Pioche. - City is a piece of earth art located in Garden Valley , a desert valley in rural Lincoln County in the U.S. state of Nevada , near the border with Nye County . The work was begun in 1972 by the artist Michael Heizer and is ongoing . When complete , it will be one of the largest sculptures ever built . - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. - Land art, earthworks (coined by Robert Smithson), or Earth art is an art movement in which landscape and the work of art are inextricably linked. It is also an art form that is created in nature, using natural materials such as soil, rock (bed rock, boulders, stones), organic media (logs, branches, leaves), and water with introduced materials such as concrete, metal, asphalt, or mineral pigments. Sculptures are not placed in the landscape, rather, the landscape is the means of their creation. Often earth moving equipment is involved. The works frequently exist in the open, located well away from civilization, left to change and erode under natural conditions. Many of the first works, created in the deserts of Nevada, New Mexico, Utah or Arizona were ephemeral in nature and now only exist as video recordings or photographic documents. They also pioneered a category of art called site-specific sculpture, designed for a particular outdoor location. 'city ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'genre'?

On that particular Saturday night, Dennis dressed up in his favorite outfit and drove to his favorite dance club, reverberating with the pulsing beats that could be heard even from the parking lot. He could feel the anticipation building up, his heart beating in sync with the lively music. Once inside, he was greeted by a colorful array of strobing lights and a sea of dancing bodies moving rhythmically with the music. The atmosphere was electrifying; every dancer was caught up in their own personal expression of the melodies and beats, creating a synchronized tapestry of movement and emotion. Dennis waded through the energetic crowd, feeling the music pulsing through him, accepting the energy of those around him as he found his own rhythm. He had developed his own style of dancing, a beautiful fusion of fluid movement and controlled chaos that always drew the admiring glances of fellow club-goers. As the night wore on, Dennis became fully immersed in his passion for dancing. Each new song provided a fresh opportunity for him to explore new emotions and movements. The raw, visceral connection with the music energized his entire being, leaving him feeling alive and free. Meanwhile, Donald, who preferred quieter activities, decided to spend his Saturday night differently. He had recognized his friend's love for dancing and wholly supported it, but he, himself, had always been more introverted, finding solace and pleasure in solitude or with a small group of friends. Donald settled in at a local coffee shop, where the atmosphere was soothing and calming. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the scent of delicious baked treats. A soft jazz tune played in the background, creating a cozy ambiance for conversations and introspection. Donald spent the evening engrossed in a captivating novel, pausing occasionally to sip his steaming cup of coffee or strike up a conversation with a fellow patron. He found great enjoyment in these intimate, intellectual exchanges that challenged his perspectives and expanded his world. Soon, the coffee shop would close for the night and the patrons would filter out, leaving behind the warm, subdued sanctuary they had shared for the evening. Donald, too, would reluctantly gather his belongings, his thirst for literary and intellectual exploration still unquenched, continuing on as a constant source of fulfillment in his life. Both Dennis and Donald had their own unique ways of enjoying their Saturday nights, drawing satisfaction from different sources and environments. While Dennis reveled in the exhilaration of dance and the energy of the club, Donald sought the quiet comforts of a coffee shop and the allure of a thought-provoking novel. Their contrasting preferences exemplified the beauty in the diversity of human experience, proving that each individual has the capacity to find joy and fulfillment in their own distinctive passions and pursuits.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. Question: \\"What allowed the Anasazi to live in permanent shelters?\\" Response: \\"Desert condition\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The correct answer would be that the Anasazi were able to live in permanent shelters due to their advanced agricultural techniques, such as irrigation, which allowed them to sustainably harvest crops without the need to follow wildlife.

Maria dressed Elena's large chest wound with gauze and antibacterial ointment because","completion":"it was crucial to clean and treat such wounds as quickly and efficiently as possible to prevent infection and promote healing. The large chest wound sustained by Elena was serious and posed a significant threat to her overall health and well-being. Elena had been involved in an accident, and the subsequent events led to a deep gash across her chest. This type of wound, due to its depth and location, could potentially damage several essential organs, muscles, and other internal structures. This posed a heightened risk of infection, making it necessary for Maria, a skilled first-aid practitioner, to intervene immediately. After examining the wound and assessing its severity, Maria gathered the necessary materials, which included sterile gauze, antibacterial ointment, medical tape, and gloves. She understood the importance of maintaining a clean environment to minimize the introduction of bacteria or foreign matter into the wound. Maria first cleaned her hands thoroughly with soap and water and then put on a pair of sterile gloves to minimize the introduction of germs. Next, she gently cleaned the wound using sterile water and a soft cloth to remove any debris, dirt, or other contaminants. It was critical to clean the wound carefully to avoid causing further injury to the delicate tissue around it. Once the wound was cleaned, Maria applied the antibacterial ointment to the area surrounding the injury, ensuring that it was evenly spread without being excessively applied. This layer of ointment would help to kill off any bacteria present in the wound and reduce the risk of infection taking hold. With the ointment in place, Maria took the sterile gauze and gently applied it onto the laceration. She was cautious not to cause any unnecessary discomfort to Elena, who was already in pain from her injury. The gauze helped to absorb any drainage from the wound while also keeping it clean and protected from external contaminants. Finally, Maria secured the gauze with medical tape, making sure it was tight enough to keep the dressing in place but not too tight to restrict blood flow or cause further pain to Elena. The dressing had to remain in place, maintaining the cleanliness and protection that the wound needed for the healing process to begin. Throughout this process, Maria remained attentive and empathetic to Elena's needs. She was focused on providing necessary first-aid care to help alleviate pain, reduce the risk of infection, and create an environment that would encourage wound healing. Moving forward, Maria observed the wound closely and monitored Elena's condition to ensure that improvement was taking place. Infection could set in quickly, and if signs of such a situation arose, Maria knew that further medical attention from a healthcare professional would be essential. In conclusion, Maria dressing Elena's large chest wound with gauze and antibacterial ointment was fundamental in the recovery process. It demonstrated the importance of timely, skilled first-aid care in the treatment of injuries, which ultimately prevents complications, promotes healing, and safeguards the health and well-being of the patient."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Here's a step-by-step process to solve the equation: Given equation: 6*c + 1 = 7 - 36 Step 1: Simplify the equation by combining and simplifying the constant terms. 6 * c + 1 = -29 (since 7 - 36 = -29) Step 2: Now we need to isolate c. To do that, we start by moving the constant term from the left side of the equation to the right side. In this case, we have to subtract 1 from both sides of the equation. 6 * c + 1 - 1 = -29 - 1 Which simplifies to: 6 * c = -30 (since -29 - 1 = -30) Step 3: Now we need to get c alone. Since c is multiplied by 6, we should divide both sides of the equation by 6 to isolate c. (6 * c) / 6 = -30/6 Canceling out the 6 on the left side, we get: c = -5 (since -30/6 = -5) So, the value of c is -5."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Plot title: Funeral in Berlin Movie plot: British secret agent Harry Palmer (Michael Caine) is sent to Berlin by his superior Colonel Ross in order to arrange the defection of Colonel Stok (Oskar Homolka), a prominent Soviet intelligence officer. Palmer is sceptical but links up with Johnny Vulkan (Paul Hubschmid), an old German friend and former criminal associate, who now runs the Berlin station for British intelligence. Palmer makes a rendezvous with Stok in the Soviet zone of the divided city and finds him eccentric and likeable. Stok asks for the defection to be managed by Otto Kreutzman, a West German criminal who has organised a number of recent escapes. When Palmer returns to the western sector he meets a model who calls herself Samantha Steel (Eva Renzi), with whom he spends the night. Suspicious at the forward manner in which she approached him, he has his police contacts establish her identity the following day and arranges for a criminal to burgle her apartment, where several different false passports are discovered. Meanwhile, Palmer arranges a deal with Kreutzman to bring Stok across the wall for Â£20,000. Palmer then returns to London to report. Ross is convinced that Stok's defection is genuine and dismisses Palmer's suspicions that the model he met in Berlin was a spy. Ross gives full authorisation for Palmer to return to Berlin to complete the deal, with documents and money provided by a man at Intelligence headquarters named Hallam (Hugh Burden). The plan devised by Kreutzman is to arrange a burial and bring the Colonel across the border in a coffin. When Palmer again meets Samantha, she admits that she is a Mossad spy and that she is in Berlin to hunt down a war criminal named Paul Louis Broum - now operating under an alias - who stole millions of pounds of gold during the Second World War. Kreutzman goes over to the east to supervise the defection personally in view of its importance.

Answer the following question: Just minutes after Donald Trump fired Rex Tillerson on Tuesday, the president was blunt about his long-standing differences with his former secretary of state. “We disagreed on things,” Trump told reporters outside the White House, specifically pointing to friction over the Iran nuclear agreement. “I wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently,” Trump said. “We were really not thinking the same.” Trump reportedly had considered firing Tillerson for months. But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The premise offers information about riders and horses returning from a polo match but does not specify the outcome of the match, whether they've won or lost. The premise states, \\"Riders and horses at the end of the day returning from a polo match.\\" This statement only informs us that the participating riders and horses are returning after attending a polo match. It doesn't provide any information about the match's result. To conclude whether the people returned from winning a polo match, we need specific information about the game's results. On the other hand, the hypothesis states, \\"People return from winning a polo match.\\" This statement is suggesting an outcome for the polo match implying that they've won. However, as the premise does not provide us with any information about the results, one cannot conclude the hypothesis as true solely based on the premise provided. Therefore, while the hypothesis might be accurate if additional information is given suggesting that the riders and horses were, indeed, victorious in their polo match, it cannot be confirmed with the given premise alone.

It's vital in logical reasoning to ensure that the conclusions derived (hypotheses) are always on par with the provided premises.

Typically, all member universities in a university system share a common component among all of their various names. Usually, all member universities of a university system are governed by a system-wide governing body, such as a board of trustees or a board of regents. In fact, university systems are so common in post-World War II United States that most states have one or two state university systems under which many of their publicly funded universities are aligned, both in name and in governance. Additionally, for-profit universities, such as DeVry University, often have multiple campuses which share the same name; these may be, but are not always, described as a university system (not necessarily accurately, see below). - The Kentucky General Assembly, also called the Kentucky Legislature, is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Kentucky. - A state university system in the United States is a group of public universities supported by an individual state, or a similar entity such as the District of Columbia.

It is an academic discipline and a social science which seeks to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases. In this field, a professional or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion (affect), intelligence, phenomenology, motivation (conation), brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, someespecially clinical and counseling psychologistsat times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a \\"hub science\\", with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy. While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity.

Answer:","completion":"The best answer would be - genetic material. Evolution refers to any change in the heritable traits within a population across generations. These traits are determined by their genetic makeup, also termed as the genetic material, composed of DNA. For evolution to occur, there needs to be variability in these genetic traits which is often caused by mutations, genetic recombination during sexual reproduction, and migration. Over time, certain traits may become more common within a population due to natural selection, where traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more prevalent. Notably, it's not about the color of leaves, learned behavior, synthetic material, body organs, sensory neurons, or most plants. Changes in acquired characteristics can have impacts too, but these are not usually inherited and so have less influence on evolution.

He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Now, I have a new situation: In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get. Answer this question please: Which lake will have less algae? Answer:","completion":"Lake Costanza will likely have less algae. Step 1: Consider the rainfall Since the farm next to Lake Montopeke regularly receives rainfall, it is more likely to have rain dissolve the fertilizer and create runoff, carrying it into the lake. In contrast, the farm adjacent to Lake Costanza gets little rain, meaning there is less potential for runoff to carry fertilizer into the lake. Step 2: Assess the impact of fertilizer on algae growth The presence of fertilizer (particularly nitrogen) in water can lead to uncontrolled algae growth due to the increased availability of nutrients. This process is known as eutrophication. Step 3: Compare the lakes Given that Lake Montopeke is more likely to experience fertilizer runoff due to the greater amount of rainfall in the area, it would be expected to have higher levels of nitrogen and consequently more algae. In comparison, Lake Costanza, with less rain and runoff, would likely have lower levels of nitrogen in the water, leading to less algae growth. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of rainfall and its impact on fertilizer runoff and subsequent algae growth, Lake Costanza will likely have less algae than Lake Montopeke."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Several aspects of the sentence contribute to the negative sentiment. Firstly, the phrase \\"no matter how broomfield dresses it up\\" implies that the subject, Broomfield, may be trying to present the information more favorably than it deserves. This suggests an attempt to deceive or mislead the audience, which carries a negative connotation. Secondly, the sentence states that the information \\"tends to speculation, conspiracy theories or, at best, circumstantial evidence.\\" This further contributes to the negative sentiment, as it highlights the weakness of the information being presented. Speculation and conspiracy theories generally have a negative perception, as they are often based on assumptions without concrete evidence to support them.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"the soil doesnt absorb the rain\\" happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this case, suggests that if the soil does not absorb the acid rain, there will be less damage caused by acid rain. If this were to occur, we can analyze the potential effects on the process, both directly and indirectly. Direct effects: 1. If the soil does not absorb the acid rain, there will be less chemical interaction between the rainwater and the soil components, reducing the release of harmful substances. As a result, it might reduce the damage to the soil structure and its fertility. 2. With less absorption of acid rain by the soil, the impact on soil-dwelling organisms could be decreased, preserving their populations and their essential roles in maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Indirect effects: 1. A reduced impact on soil fertility and structure could lead to healthier vegetation, making it more resilient to the harmful effects of acid rain. This would help maintain a stable ecosystem with a more robust plant population. 2. A healthier vegetation cover would reduce the risk of soil erosion caused by acid rain, as plant roots help to bind the soil and prevent it from being washed away. 3. Less soil erosion and better vegetation coverage could contribute to cleaner water sources, as the acid rain would be filtered through a well-established ecosystem before reaching rivers, lakes, or aquifers. In conclusion, if the soil does not absorb the acid rain, it could have both direct and indirect effects on reducing the damage caused by the rain itself. However, it is essential to note that this perturbation hypothesis is only a thought experiment, and in reality, the interaction between acid rain and soil is a complex and ongoing process. Efforts to mitigate acid rain and its damages should still focus on reducing harmful emissions at their source and promoting eco-friendly practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the below context: On returning to London, Moore undertook a seven-year teaching post at the Royal College of Art. He was required to work two days a week, which allowed him time to spend on his own work. His first public commission, West Wind (1928–29), was one of the eight reliefs of the 'four winds' high on the walls of London Underground's headquarters at 55 Broadway. The other 'winds' were carved by contemporary sculptors including Eric Gill with the ground-level pieces provided by Epstein. 1928 saw Moore's first solo exhibition, held at the Warren Gallery in London. In July 1929, Moore married Irina Radetsky, a painting student at the Royal College. Irina was born in Kiev in 1907 to Ukrainian–Polish parents. Her father did not return from the Russian Revolution and her mother was evacuated to Paris where she married a British army officer. Irina was smuggled to Paris a year later and went to school there until she was 16, after which she was sent to live with her stepfather's relatives in Buckinghamshire. Irina found security in her marriage to Moore and was soon posing for him. Shortly after they married, the couple moved to a studio in Hampstead at 11a Parkhill Road NW3, joining a small colony of avant-garde artists who were taking root there. Shortly afterward, Hepworth and her second husband Ben Nicholson moved into a studio around the corner from Moore, while Naum Gabo, Roland Penrose, Cecil Stephenson and the art critic Herbert Read also lived in the area (Read referred to the area as \\"a nest of gentle artists\\"). This led to a rapid cross-fertilization of ideas that Read would publicise, helping to raise Moore's public profile. The area was also a stopping-off point for many refugee artists, architects and designers from continental Europe en route to America—some of whom would later commission works from Moore.

Question: Who plays Corporal Terry Sellers? Movie title: Imitation General Movie plot: It's 1944, in France, during WWII. In the aftermath of a big battle, scattered American ground troops find themselves disorganized and surrounded on all sides by German forces. Cut off from their company, and without a radio, U. S. Army Brigadier-General Charles Lane (Kent Smith), MSgt. Murphy Savage (Glenn Ford) and Cpl. Chan Derby (Red Buttons) come upon a group of five leaderless soldiers. After their shock of seeing a general out in the field, they accept Lane's encouragement and orders to set about trying to find help and work their way out of their situation. The general decides that a nearby, mostly intact farmhouse, will serve at their headquarters. He orders the five men to fan out and find any other stragglers they can, sending any officers and non-coms to him at the farmhouse.While checking to make sure the farmhouse is safe, Cpl. Derby comes upon a beautiful young French woman, Simone (Taina Elg), inside taking a bath. Simone is none too happy to see him inside her home, but it's also odd that she'd be all alone, in an unlocked and war-damaged farmstead, taking a bath. General Lane comes into the main room of the farmhouse and asks Derby what's going on. He explains that there's a naked woman in the other room. They wait for her to come out and attempt to calm her down and explain what they are doing there.Lane realizes, upon examining his map, that they are in the middle of a two-mile gap in the American line. Although Simone, who speaks no English, blames the Allied bombings for the destruction of her farm and the nearby local village, she grudgingly allows the men to set up an impromptu command post. She is very happy when the men offer her some C-rations.Murph and Derby are surprised by Lane's determination to remain in the field, to organize and lead a new offensive to plug that two-mile gap.

Here are possible answers to this question: - wave goodbye - rub their head - experience fear - watch television - spring into action I believe the correct choice is \\"wave goodbye\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"Indeed, the correct choice is \\"wave goodbye,\\" and there are several reasons to support this conclusion. First, waving goodbye is a universal and widely recognized gesture that transcends language barriers and cultural differences. This gesture became a social norm over the centuries and is easily understood by people of all ages, including children. Waving is a simple action that can be performed by extending one's arm and moving the hand repeatedly from side to side. Children, being young and ever-curious, are quick to pick up on these non-verbal cues and replicate them as a means of communication. Therefore, a group of children would most likely wave goodbye as a natural response to someone bidding them farewell. Second, the other options presented are less plausible choices and do not align with the context of saying farewell to a group of children. For example, \\"rub their head\\" seems more like an affectionate action that adults may perform on a child's head, rather than a gesture made by children themselves. \\"Experience fear\\" might occur in situations where children are separated from their parents or caregivers, but it is unrelated to the farewell gesture. \\"Watch television\\" is a common recreational activity for children but is irrelevant when discussing farewell gestures. Finally, \\"spring into action\\" can be interpreted in many ways, but it is not a specific and identifiable response related to bidding farewell. Third, it is important to consider the psychological aspects of children's development. From an early age, children learn to interpret and react to social cues that dictate appropriate behavior in various situations. Social norms and expectations are imparted to them via their parents, teachers, or other caregivers. Consequently, children develop a sense of what is expected of them in specific scenarios, such as when someone is leaving or entering a room, at which point it's customary to wave goodbye or hello, respectively. In this respect, the gesture of waving goodbye is ingrained in children's social behavior and becomes an instinctual response. In conclusion, among the options provided - wave goodbye, rub their head, experience fear, watch television, and spring into action - the most accurate choice is \\"wave goodbye.\\" This gesture is widely recognized and adopted by people of all ages, including children. Additionally, waving goodbye is deeply rooted in human social behavior and is a learned response that children gradually incorporate into their daily interactions. The other options are either unrelated or not specific to the context of saying farewell, making \\"wave goodbye\\" the most fitting answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do Google engineers use Chromebooks? How can I use TensorFlow on my Chromebook? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"No, the two questions do not have the same meaning, but they are related. The first question is about whether Google engineers use Chromebooks, while the second question is about using TensorFlow on a Chromebook. 1. Do Google engineers use Chromebooks? Yes, Google engineers may use Chromebooks in certain situations. A Chromebook is a laptop or tablet running the Chrome OS as its operating system, which is designed by Google. As a result, it is highly likely that Google engineers would be using Chromebooks as part of their work, especially when developing and testing Google's web applications and services. Chromebooks are popular for their fast boot times, easy maintenance, and tight integration with Google services. However, it is essential to note that Chromebooks typically have lower specifications than some standard laptops. For intensive tasks such as AI development, large scale software development, or processing massive data sets, Google engineers might use other, more powerful systems, such as desktops or workstations, or utilize the resources of Google's large-scale cloud computing infrastructure. 2. How can I use TensorFlow on my Chromebook? TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning platform developed by Google. While Chromebooks are generally not built for heavy tasks like machine learning, it is still possible to use TensorFlow on a Chromebook through a few different methods. Method 1: Use Google Colab: Google Colaboratory, also known as Colab, is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that allows you to run TensorFlow code on Google's servers. You can access Colab through your Chrome browser, which works well with Chromebooks since no local processing is required. To use TensorFlow on Colab: 1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com. 2. Sign in with your Google account. 3. Click on \\"New Notebook\\" to create a new Jupyter notebook. 4. You can now import TensorFlow in your notebook using the following command: \`\`\` import tensorflow as tf \`\`\` 5. Write your TensorFlow code in the notebook, and run it using Colab's cloud resources. Method 2: Install Linux on your Chromebook Some Chromebooks support installing Linux through the built-in Crostini project, making it possible to use a wide range of applications that are not natively available on Chrome OS. To use TensorFlow on a Chromebook by installing Linux: 1. Enable Linux support on your Chromebook by going to Settings > Linux (Beta) > Turn On. 2. Configure and install the Linux environment. 3. Open the Linux terminal on your Chromebook. 4. Install TensorFlow using pip with the following command: \`\`\` pip install --upgrade tensorflow \`\`\` 5. Once the installation is complete, you can run TensorFlow directly in the terminal or use it in Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks. Keep in mind that although these methods allow you to use TensorFlow on a Chromebook, the performance might be limited due to the hardware constraints of Chromebooks. However, they provide an excellent opportunity to learn and experiment with TensorFlow without requiring a more powerful system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This might seem like a big and difficult problem, but we can break it down. You know how when you are doing a puzzle and you have puzzle pieces on both sides, we often like to move all pieces to the same side to make it easier to see the big picture, right? So first, we'll move all the parts with 'm' to the same side of the '='. In other words, we are going to add 653*m to both sides to get all the 'm' pieces on the left side. After adding 653m to both sides, we get -733*m + 653*m = -320. When we combine similar pieces (i.e., -733m + 653m, which can be thought of like if you have 733 sour candies and you add 653 sweet candies, now you have -733 + 653 = -80 candies left), we get -80 * m = -320. The next step is to divide both sides by -80 in order to isolate 'm'. That's like saying, if we painted -320 squares with -80 colors each, how many times did we use each color? If we do that, we can solve for 'm', like this: m = -320 / -80. Now to solve this, you need to know that when you divide a negative number by a negative number, you get a positive number. So -320 divided by -80 equals +4. So, our answer is m = 4. That means if we replace every m in our problem with the number 4, it would make both sides of the '=' the same. Would you like to try that and see if it works?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Facing a mutiny: Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond's plans to scrap the Army battalion named after the Duke of Wellington has drawn criticism 'The regimental system is fundamental to the fighting power of the OPTIONS: - Afghanistan today and we are not going to change it.' - Army today and we are not going to change it.' - Battle of Waterloo today and we are not going to change it.' - Boer War today and we are not going to change it.' - Duke of Wellington today and we are not going to change it.' - Helmand province today and we are not going to change it.' - Iraq today and we are not going to change it.' - Ministry of Defence today and we are not going to change it.' - Phillip Hammond today and we are not going to change it.' - World Wars today and we are not going to change it.' - Yorkshire Regiment today and we are not going to change it.'","completion":"Army today and we are not going to change it.' As the debate over the proposed cuts continues, supporters of the Duke of Wellington's battalion are rallying to save their cherished regiment, arguing that its distinguished history and strong connections to the local community make it an essential component of the British Army. Critics of the Ministry of Defence's downsizing plans argue that slashing valuable battalions like the Duke of Wellington’s would not only undermine the Army's operational capacity, but also damage morale and erode the regimental system that forms the backbone of the British military tradition. In response to the public outcry and fierce opposition from both current and former service members, Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond has agreed to reassess the plans to disband or merge the targeted regiments, including the Duke of Wellington's battalion. Hammond asserts that the Ministry is committed to ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the Army, but recognizes the importance of maintaining the time-honored traditions and regimental esprit de corps that underpin its strength. In the coming months, the Ministry of Defence will be conducting a thorough review of its proposals, examining the potential impact of the cuts on the UK's defense capability and considering alternative options for achieving budgetary goals without compromising the core values and traditions of the British Army. Community leaders, military historians, and service members past and present are expected to contribute their insights and perspectives to this critical conversation, highlighting the symbolic and practical significance of regiments like the Duke of Wellington's. As the review progresses, a range of possible outcomes could emerge. One possibility is that the Ministry may explore alternative cost-saving measures, such as reducing non-essential administrative support functions or investing in new, more cost-effective technologies. Another potential compromise could involve a restructuring or reorganization of the affected battalions, preserving their names and traditions while streamlining operations to minimize redundancies and boost efficiency. In any event, the controversy surrounding the proposed cuts has ignited a robust debate about the future of the British Army - a debate that will profoundly shape its development and direction in the years ahead. Ultimately, the most logical completion of the news story would involve the government undertaking a careful reconsideration of the proposed cuts to regiments like the Duke of Wellington's battalion, weighing the financial imperatives against the vital need to maintain the military tradition, morale, and effectiveness that define the British Army. By taking into account the genuine concerns and contributions of the extended military community, the Ministry of Defence can work to achieve a balanced and responsible approach that preserves both core values and the nation's capacity to meet the complex challenges of the 21st century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Asian investors have followed this trend, and started to buy independent schools to serve this demand. An article carried by theTimes of London on October 17 reported that last year Chinese-owned company Achieve Education bought Chase Grammar, a boarding and day school in Cannock, Staffordshire. Chase Grammar includes a program that offers extra support for pupils from China. \\"This trend is very good and I am not at all surprised,\\" Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, told theGlobal Times, adding that Chinese people like the English education system. \\"We welcome Chinese investors in British private education.\\" \\"Chase Grammar School is small, and the classes are small.

Before being burned at the stake, Asa vows revenge and puts a curse on her brother's descendants. A metal mask with sharp spikes on the inside is placed over the witch's face and hammered into her flesh. Two centuries later, Dr. Thomas Kruvajan (Andrea Checchi) and his assistant Dr. Andre Gorobec (John Richardson), are traveling through Moldavia en route to a medical conference when one of the wheels of their carriage is broken, requiring immediate repair. While waiting for their coachman to fix it, the two wander into a nearby ancient crypt and discover Asa's tomb. Observing her death mask through a glass panel, Kruvajan breaks the panel (and the cross above it) by accident while striking a bat. He then removes Asa's death mask revealing a partially preserved corpse that is visible underneath, her face staring out malevolently. He cuts his hand on the broken glass. Some of his blood drips onto Asa's dead face. Returning outside, Kruvajan and Gorobec meet Katia (also played by Steele). She tells them that she lives with her father, Prince Vajda (Garrani), and brother Constantine (Enrico Oliveiri) in a nearby castle that the villagers all believe is haunted. Gorobec is instantly smitten by the beautiful young woman. The two men then leave her and drive to an inn. The witch Asa is brought back to life by Kruvajan's blood. She contacts Javuto telepathically and orders him to rise from his grave. He does so and goes to Prince Vajda's castle, where Vajda holds up a crucifix to ward the reanimated corpse away.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Q: Name the two types of nucleic acids. A: Answer:","completion":"The two types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). These molecules are essential to life, as they store, transmit, and express genetic information in living organisms. Both types of nucleic acids are polymers made up of monomers called nucleotides, which contain a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. However, these molecules have several structural and functional differences. 1. Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA): DNA is a double-stranded nucleic acid that mainly exists in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells. Its primary function is to store genetic information and pass it from one generation to another through the process of replication. The double-stranded structure of DNA consists of two complementary strands that are held together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases. The sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, and the four nitrogenous bases present in its structure are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). DNA follows the base-pairing rule, where adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine, which ensures that genetic information is preserved during replication. 2. Ribonucleic Acid (RNA): RNA is a single-stranded nucleic acid found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of cells. It plays several crucial roles in gene expression, including carrying genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis and providing structural and functional components for ribosomes. The sugar in RNA is ribose, and the four nitrogenous bases present in its structure are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). RNA is synthesized from DNA through a process called transcription, in which the genetic code on a specific portion of the DNA is used as a template to create a complementary RNA sequence. RNA molecules can undergo several modifications before being utilized for protein synthesis. There are three main types of RNA molecules: a. Messenger RNA (mRNA): This type of RNA carries the genetic information copied from DNA during transcription and serves as a template for protein synthesis during the process called translation. b. Transfer RNA (tRNA): tRNA molecules help in the translation process by recognizing specific codons on the mRNA and bringing the corresponding amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain. c. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA): This type of RNA, along with proteins, forms the structure of ribosomes, the molecular machines that catalyze the process of protein synthesis. In conclusion, DNA and RNA are the two types of nucleic acids that play essential roles in the storage, transmission, and expression of genetic information in living organisms. While DNA is the primary genetic material, RNA serves as an intermediary in transferring genetic information from DNA to proteins, allowing the diverse and dynamic cellular processes to occur."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of integers.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties.

Cops in Orem began investigating the peeping after a witness spotted a drone hovering outside his bathroom window in early-December. The witness seized the drone when it touched down in a nearby church parking lot, and later turned it over to police. Upon examining the drone--a DJI Phantom 4--the witness discovered “multiple videos recording individuals inside their residences through windows. Some of the recordings were multiple stories high in apartment complexes,” according to a search warrant application prepared by the Orem Police Department. The drone’s SD card also contained “footage recording near windows outside of residences with no one recorded.” As reported by the Deseret News, the footage also included images of the man flying the drone (and what appeared to be the operator’s pickup truck). A police review of the 1200 quadcopter’s videos led first to the identity of the vehicle and then its registered owner, Aaron Foote, 39. According to police and court records, Foote’s rap sheet includes a 2008 conviction for a voyeurism incident at a Utah tanning salon. Foote has also previously been collared for burglary, theft, and domestic violence. Foote and his girlfriend, Terisha Lee Norviel, 34, were each charged with misdemeanor voyeurism by electronic equipment for the Orem peeping videos. Seen above, Foote and Norviel are scheduled to attend preliminary hearings in the next several weeks. Norviel, the mother of six children, is a licensed real estate agent. According to 2016 bankruptcy court records, Norviel was in the midst of a divorce from the father of her brood.

It included speeches from his friends and colleagues, as well as school officials who said the fires - and threats written in Reinscheid's emails - terrorized them. Rainer Klaus Reinscheid is facing up to 18 years in prison for setting a series of fires after his son killed himself. The former UCI professor watches with his attorneys, Joshua Glotzer, center, and Dan Leib, left, as his wife Wendy Reinscheid walks into court to give a statement. The hearing is set to resume Wednesday afternoon. Reinscheid, a pharmaceutical sciences professor at the University of California, Irvine, whose private emails described graphic plans to attack his late son's high school and kill students, told the court that the irrational thoughts that drove his behavior in the weeks after his 14-year-old son committed suicide have disappeared. Now, Reinscheid said he wants to return to his native Germany and find work to support his family and care for his younger child, acknowledging his academic career is over, the Associated Press reports. Reinscheid, 49, is on unpaid leave from UC Irvine.'I lost my son, and then I lost myself,' Reinscheid told the court. 'Now, I am asking you, your honor, and many other people, to forgive me and show mercy.' Reinscheid faces a prison sentence that could range from three to 18 years after he pleaded guilty last month to six counts of arson, three counts of attempted arson, and resisting or obstructing an officer. Claas Stubbe, pictured on a class trip to the Grand Canyon, hanged himself in March 2012 after getting in trouble at his high school. Reinscheid, who set fires at his late son's school, a school administrator's home and a nearby park, said he was so overwhelmed with grief after his son killed himself that he wrote and did things he would not normally do. Reinscheid walks to the podium to read a statement of remorse to the court. Colleagues and friends described Reinscheid as a brilliant scientist, a dedicated researcher, a trustworthy friend and devoted and doting father who was distraught after his son's death. The teen hanged himself with a belt in an Irvine park in March 2012 after he was disciplined by an administrator at University High School for allegedly stealing from the school store. School officials and teachers, however, said the series of fires Reinscheid set - and the emails that described Reinscheid's plan to buy machine guns, shoot students, commit sexual assaults and burn the school before killing himself - drove people in the 2,800-member campus to live in fear.'That tragedy (his son's death) cannot serve as justification for terrorizing a school community and staff members who have dedicated their lives to helping others,' Irvine Unified Superintendent Terry L. Walker wrote in a statement read aloud to the court by a fellow administrator. Prosecutors previously filed with the court three emails that they say detail Reinscheid's plans for a mass murder at University High in revenge for his son's death. Orange County Superior Court Judge Gregg Prickett listens to a victim impact statement. Reinscheid faces a prison sentence that could range from three to 18 years. No charges were filed directly related to the emails. Reinscheid's wife, Wendy, told the court she and her husband were encouraged to write down their thoughts by a therapist to help them get out negative feelings after the boy died. But prosecutor Andrew Katz told the court these writings can't be brushed off as mere musings. He noted they came after two high school students kept a journal chronicling their plans to attack Columbine High School, and after a shooter told a therapist about his violent thoughts and later sprayed gunfire on patrons at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. Reinscheid has worked at UC Irvine for about a dozen years. His research included studying molecular pharmacology and psychiatric disorders, including studies of schizophrenia, stress, emotional behavior and sleep.

It's important to have healthy cuticles to avoid hangnails. That means not letting the skin dry out too much. The best way to do this is to regularly apply cuticle oil to moisturise them. You can use a regular hand cream, or moisturiser designed specifically for the cuticles. Applying cuticle oil once a day before bed can make a big different to your cuticle health. As well as caring for your cuticles, moisturising the skin around the sides of your nails will help prevent hangnails. Applying a basic hand cream to your fingers, focussing on the area around the nail once or twice a day will help you have healthier, and less dry skin in this sensitive area. A lotion or cream with vitamin E can hydrate and soothe nicks and cuts. Petroleum jelly is a great moisturiser that is easy to get hold off.

Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like. It is a fooler. Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin. But, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him. In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor. It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect. There is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard. He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940. The ending by John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War. He goes forward into history.

But the man who replaced Paterno said that the actions of fans and players Saturday sent a message against sexual abuse and helped them personally come to grips after an emotional week. \\"It was a day of solidarity for the children, for the victims -- it was a touching moment,\\" interim coach Tom Bradley said of the crowd's demeanor and emotional pre-game ceremonies focused on child abuse. \\"I felt that today, just maybe, the healing process started to begin.\\" Current and former players from Penn State and OPTIONS: - CNN locked arms amid thunderous applause from more than 100,000 fans -- many of them wearing blue, to focus attention on child abuse -- in attendance. - Joe Paterno locked arms amid thunderous applause from more than 100,000 fans -- many of them wearing blue, to focus attention on child abuse -- in attendance. - Nebraska locked arms amid thunderous applause from more than 100,000 fans -- many of them wearing blue, to focus attention on child abuse -- in attendance. - Nittany Lions locked arms amid thunderous applause from more than 100,000 fans -- many of them wearing blue, to focus attention on child abuse -- in attendance. - Paterno locked arms amid thunderous applause from more than 100,000 fans -- many of them wearing blue, to focus attention on child abuse -- in attendance. - Penn State locked arms amid thunderous applause from more than 100,000 fans -- many of them wearing blue, to focus attention on child abuse -- in attendance. - Pennsylvania locked arms amid thunderous applause from more than 100,000 fans -- many of them wearing blue, to focus attention on child abuse -- in attendance. - Tom Bradley locked arms amid thunderous applause from more than 100,000 fans -- many of them wearing blue, to focus attention on child abuse -- in attendance. - University Park locked arms amid thunderous applause from more than 100,000 fans -- many of them wearing blue, to focus attention on child abuse -- in attendance.","completion":"Step 1: Narrow down the options based on the story's context and relevance.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Denzel Washington in Actors: Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Don Cheadle Just an ordinary day for Whip Whitaker. He wakes up after a night of booze, drugs and sex with a gorgeous flight attendant, does a line of coke, takes an angry phone call from his ex-wife and staggers to work. Captain Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is a pilot for SouthJet Airlines, and this morning he will be flying a plane from Orlando to Atlanta, if he can stay awake and lucid at the controls. That trip, involving treacherous weather and engine failure that threaten the lives of the 102 people on board, climaxes in what may be the hairiest, scariest, most realistic and thrilling plane crash in movie history — a sequence that should be taught in film schools for decades, assuming there will still be film (or schools). But Robert Zemeckis’s Flight, which had its world premiere Sunday at the New York Film Festival and will open in real theaters Nov. 2, is determined to chart an even more turbulent course: Whip’s attempt to assume, or avoid, control of his addiction. Screenwriter John Gatins has said his script combined “my two greatest fears: drinking myself to death and dying in a plane crash.” Blending The High and the Mighty and The Lost Weekend — or, from this year’s movies, The Grey and Smashed — Flight at its best marks an advance for its director and a triumph for its star. (READ: Corliss on Denzel Washington in Book of Eli) The Festival’s closing attraction served as an ideal bookend to its opening-night film: Ang Lee’s Life of Pi, the story of an Indian teenager stranded on a small boat with a ravenous Bengal tiger. Both movies are adventures about a lone soul who wages a daring battle with the elements and his roiling anxieties. The difference is that Whip’s disease makes him his own antagonist. When a post-crash toxicology report reveals a dangerous level of alcohol in his system and triggers an investigation, he is at risk of losing his job and his freedom. In the interior storm of his life, he’s both the boy and the tiger. (READ: Corliss’s review of Life of Pi) The movie’s title accurately describes Whip’s personality. A former Navy pilot with exceptional skills and daredevil instincts, he’s a natural high flyer, in the air and on land. Alcohol and cocaine are his essential fuel. The coke, he believes, sharpens his senses in the cockpit; the booze (he pours himself a screwdriver while speaking to the passengers early in the Orlando-to-Atlanta run) steadies his nerves and dulls the pain of his troubled life. Indeed, as the plane torpedoes toward earth Whip’s wits save lives and make him a national hero — even as the pressure of the investigation gives him one more reason to drink. Recovering alcoholics would say that Whip is in flight from himself. And that flight can’t stay aloft forever, which suggests another title for the film: Crash Landing. This is the first live-action feature for Zemeckis since Cast Away in 2000; for the past dozen years the director has lived in, and expanded, the faux universe of motion-capture (The Polar Express, Beowulf, A Christmas Carol). Recall that Chuck Noland, the Tom Hanks character in Cast Away, survived a plane crash and faced awful solitude on a deserted island — a Robinson Crusoe with no Friday. Whip, no less isolated psychologically than Chuck is spatially, has plenty of people ready to help him maintain his national-hero status and sidestep prison. In a way, the two movies are replays of classic 1950s Westerns at opposite poles: Fred Zinnemann’s Oscar-winning High Noon, where Sheriff Gary Cooper confronts the bad guys alone after the townspeople have deserted him, and Howard Hawks’ Rio Bravo, where Sheriff John Wayne accumulates more ragtag deputies than he wants or needs. (READ: Corliss’s review of Robert Zemeckis’s Beowulf) Whip wants Trina (Nadine Velasquez), the flight-attendant girlfriend who shares his bed, drugs and heart, in part because she’s as addicted as he is. Other enablers surround Whip like wingmen: Charlie Henderson (Bruce Greenwood), an old Navy buddy who runs the pilots’ union; Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle), the crafty lawyer Charlie hires to quash the toxicology report and steer Whip through the investigation; and Harling Mays (John Goodman), Whip’s boisterous best friend — read: coke dealer — who figures the hair of the dog is just the antidote for an incriminating binge. Hell, it helped Whip maneuver the plane and save lives, didn’t it? With friends like these, Whip needs enemies — denouncers of the mess he’s been making of his life. Some are loved ones, like his ex-wife (Garcelle Beauvais) and teenage son (Justin Martin), who endured his transgressions until they had to banish him. Others are fellow sufferers in Whip’s Hell, like the sad junkie Nicole (Kelly Reilly), who has supported her taste for “Taliban”-level heroin by working as a masseuse — “every kind of masseuse there is.” After an overdose, she’s been sent to the Atlanta hospital where Whip is recovering from his crash injuries. Nicole has already hit the bottom that Whip has been circling over for decades, avoiding a landing. She has resolved to go straight, which tests her romance with the handsome airman-alcoholic who defiantly boasts, “I choose to drink,” (READ: James Poniewozik’s location report on Cast Away) Whip, it’s clear, is a great pilot but not a good one, a man of personal power and emotional helplessness. Reflecting this dichotomy, Flight seesaws between two types of heroes: the ones in movies and the ones in real life. In action films, the Hero Equation posits that the right kind of renegade can break all the rules and still win the game. His demons give him the edge he needs to achieve impossible feats that mortal men would be too timid or sane even to consider. And in old Westerns like Rio Bravo and Cat Ballou, the drunken gunslinger could beguile audiences with his stuporous amiability. But that’s just on the screen. Most actual airline passengers would prefer a reliable, responsible, everyday pilot to a coked-up dude with reckless charisma; the addict would be a danger to the souls on board and to himself. So the suspense here comes not just from guessing whether Whip will ace the big public hearing conducted by a sharp federal inquisitor (Melissa Leo) but also in figuring out what kind of movie Flight is: an action picture or a Problem drama? the sympathetic portrait of a flawed hero or a denunciation of his weaknesses? Gatins’ and Zemeckis’s intent becomes evident toward the end of the film, but for the most part they keep the audience on Whip’s side, rooting uneasily for him to clear his name, if not his head, at the public hearing. Whip’s fallibility, no less than his power and charm, put the moviegoer in his corner. Besides, he’s Denzel Drinkin’ Washington, who has played bad guys — he won an Oscar for Training Day — but more typically is the strong, haunted man audiences love to love. Washington’s nuanced performance is a tightrope walk between the Denzel whom people expect and the character he’s boldly burrowed into. (READ: Richard Schickel on Denzel Washington in Training Day) Flight has its own flaws, most of which can be forgiven. At times the supporting players (especially Goodman, who seems imported from a different movie, possibly The Big Lebowski) flutter around the star and do their acting thing. Yet they take smart advantage of their small chances to make a big impression — especially Cheadle, a soft-spoken sort who may be playing the Devil, and James Badge Dale, who’s dynamite in an unnecessary but impressive turn as the hospital’s chattiest cancer patient. Reilly, an English actress who played Jude Law’s wife in the two Sherlock Holmes films, could be a younger Julianne Moore or the correct answer to the Hollywood question: Does Jessica Chastain have to be in every movie? She’s fine too. On the unforgivable side, there’s quite a bit of God talk, some of it from two Christians (“God landed that plane”) who get the derisive treatment that American movies routinely hand to evangelicals. That’s just lazy scriptwriting. Most of Flight, though, has a character sharpness and an openness to ambiguity that are rare in movies from big studios and commercially savvy directors. The film is rated R (“for drug and alcohol abuse, language, sexuality/nudity and an intense action sequence”), but it doesn’t parade its Restricted status; it probably could have won a softer rating with some trimming of the opening scene. It’s as if Zemeckis weren’t trying to game the system, as so many directors do to get a PG-13, but just figured this is a film for grownups and should get a rating that reflected its intentions. (READ: Corliss on the politicizing of movie ratings) The restless creator of genre-bending hits like the Back to the Future trilogy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Contact and the Oscar-winning Forrest Gump, Zemeckis has occasionally been criticized (by me, for example) for making films that are less than the sum of their technically innovative parts. This time, he has acutely fused two movie cultures, mainstream and indie, in a sensibility riskier than the studio norm and more muscular than the Sundance films. A canny director and a top star decided to dig deep to find the core of a compromised hero. And when they reach that center of gravity, Flight soars.

Article: I had been to several doctors as a child, but I have a special place in my heart for Dr. Vincent. He was a Pediatric Cardiologist at UCLA back in 1971 who saved my life. I was eight years old at the time with a severe heart problem and I needed heart surgery. My Mom did not have the money, and without the surgery there was a real good chance I would not live to be thirteen years old. After contacting several organizations Dr. Vincent was able to get financial help for me through United Way, a Crippled Children's Organization. Dr. Vincent was a handsome man; he was also very gentle and caring. I remember being in the hospital for an Angiogram test, and during the procedure I was crying terribly, so the medical staff called in Dr. Vincent to calm me down, and he was able to comfort me when no one else could. Then the time came for me to have heart surgery; there was a fifty- percent chance that I would not make it through the surgery because it was experimental. At the time I was only the second or third person to have this procedure done. I was absolutely terrified, and again Dr. Vincent reassured me he would see to it that everything would be all right. I had a lot of confidence and trust in Dr. Vincent; He came to see me after the surgery, which was extremely painful but very successful, and brought me a stuffed animal. I was so surprised to get this gift from Dr. Vincent; I gave him a hug. I guess Dr. Vincent must have known I was feeling very lonely and scared. You see, I had no family or friends visit me while I was in the hospital except for my Mom, and I am not sure why. I do know one thing; I had a wonderful doctor who took the time to help a scared little girl who felt all alone. This was twenty eight years ago, so wherever you are Dr. Vincent, I want to thank you for not only saving my life, but you helped me live a normal productive life, and for showing me that you truly cared, for that I will be eternally grateful to you.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This text is missing some spaces, please add them: Ithasa3,400mAhbattery.","completion":"The given text, when proper spaces are added, should read: \\"It has a 3,400mAh battery.\\" In this sentence, the subject is an unspecified device that comes with a battery. The battery capacity is described as being 3,400 milliampere-hours (mAh). This unit of measurement is commonly used for denoting the amount of energy a battery can store. A higher mAh value typically means that the battery will last longer before needing to be recharged, assuming the device consumes energy at the same rate. To put this into perspective, let's take a look at some examples of battery capacities in today's smartphones and electronic devices. A 3,400mAh battery is considered to be relatively average in terms of storage capacity. Many modern smartphones often have battery capacities that range between 3,000mAh and 5,000mAh. For instance, the iPhone 12 has a battery capacity of approximately 2,815mAh, while the Samsung Galaxy S21 has a 4,000mAh battery. Of course, the battery life of a device does not solely depend on battery capacity; it also relies on factors such as the efficiency of the device's components, its power consumption, and usage patterns. For example, if a phone has a large high-resolution screen or a powerful processor, it may consume more energy than a phone with a smaller screen or a less powerful processor, even if they both have the same battery capacity. It is also worth mentioning that different manufacturers use different battery technologies in their devices, which can affect battery performance and lifespan. For instance, lithium-ion batteries, which are commonly found in smartphones, are known for their relatively high energy density, lightweight nature, and slow loss of charge when not in use. However, these batteries may experience a gradual decrease in capacity over time, necessitating eventual replacement. In summary, a 3,400mAh battery provides a moderate amount of energy storage capacity for a device. While this value may give an indication of a device's potential battery life, it is important to take into account other factors, such as power consumption and battery technology, to determine the actual performance and overall efficiency of the battery-powered device."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Schleswig-Holstein is the northernmost state in Germany and plays a significant role in the connection between the two countries. Covering an area of approximately 15,800 square kilometers (about 6,100 square miles), Schleswig-Holstein is situated between the North Sea to its west and the Baltic Sea to its east. Its capital city is Kiel, a major port on the Baltic Sea, and the city of Lübeck is another important center – known for its well-preserved medieval architecture and as the birthplace of marzipan. The border between Schleswig-Holstein and Denmark is about 69 kilometers (43 miles) long. Historically, the region has seen changes in its political affiliations, with various parts being controlled by Denmark, Germany, and, at times, being independent entities. The current border was established after the Schleswig Plebiscites in 1920 following World War I, which resulted in the partition of the territory into a Danish and a German portion. Schleswig (Slesvig in Danish) became part of Denmark, while Holstein remained in Germany. Today, the Danish-German border region is characterized by close cooperation in various aspects between the two countries, including trade, tourism, and infrastructure development.

How do we see it and how can we solve the problem? We know that the traffic jam happens in many places, especially in big cities. What are reasons for the problem? On one hand, some people think that they should have a car when they have enough money, and then it's easy to go out and they can feel comfortable. On the other hand, a growing number of people hope to use their cars to show off . What's more, years of research has shown that one of other reasons for the traffic jam is the driving habit. For example, many young people enjoy driving very fast, so they can feel excited. At last, most of them hardly care about the speed rules. Many governments are working at how to make the traffic better. In my opinion, firstly, the governments should educate those people who have cars or plan to buy cars. The governments must make them know that the traffic jam is very serious, and set up a much more perfect traffic system to solve the traffic pressure. Which of the following is NOT true? A) The reason for the traffic jam is that people have too much work. B) The reason for the traffic jam is that more and more people drive cars.

Sunday is April Fools' Day, a day when you are encouraged to play tricks on loved ones and even the people you meet at the bus stop. It's a strange tradition, but how did it get started? Nobody is completely sure about the origin of this, the silliest of holidays. However, the urban legend experts at Snopes. com say that most experts owe it to Pope Gregory XIII, who, in the 1500s, gave the world the Gregorian calendar. In 1562, the Gregorian calendar moved the first day of the year from April l to January l. Word did eventually get around, but some people were a bit slow to hear the news. These folks continued celebrating the new year on April l , unaware that they were now three months behind the times. These \\"April fools\\" were tricked by those who knew it. The tradition eventually made its way to the US. And it's still going strong. Over the past week, Web searches on \\" April Fools' Day jokes\\" and \\" April Fools' Day tricks\\" have more than doubled, and related lookups for \\"easy April Fools' Day tricks\\" and \\"April Fools' Day jokes for work\\" have also increased greatly.

But really, there is no way to be certain you'll escape trickery because even companies are out to trick you on April l. In 1957, the BBC reported Swiss farmers were harvesting spaghetti from trees.

Let's do this step by step. 1. The equation is -5 = -4*i - 25. 2. First, we add 25 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the '-25' on the right-hand side: So, -5+25 = -4*i -25 +25 which simplifies to 20 = -4*i 3. Next, to isolate 'i', we divide the entire equation by -4: 20 / -4 = -4*i / -4 This simplifies to -5 = i Thus, the solution to -5 = -4*i - 25 is i = -5. The step-by-step approach primarily involves isolating the variable by applying the addition or subtraction property of equality to move terms to one side of the equation and then applying the multiplication or division property of equality to isolate the variable and solve for it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The screening suggests that in 2000, 19 percent of all newborn babies in Metropolitan France had at least one parent originating from one of the risk regions. The figure for 2007 was 28.45 percent, for 2010 31.5 percent, for 2012 34.44 percent, for 2013 35.7 percent, and for 2015 38.9 percent. These percentages vary widely among French regions; for example, in 2015, screening suggested that only 8.1% of children born in Brittany had a parent originating from a sickle-cell risk region, while 73.4% of children born in Île-de-France (which includes Paris) did. The percentage for Île-de-France was a significant increase from 54.2% in 2005. However, a 2014 story in Le Monde suggested that the testing figures for Île-de-France were distorted by the practices of some hospitals in the region, which choose to test all babies whether or not they have parents with ancestry from an endemic sickle-cell region. Question: How many percent increase was seen between 2000 and 2015 of at least one parent of babies born in Metropolitan France originating from one of the risk regions? Answer:","completion":"Imagine you have a jar with 100 marbles in it. In the year 2000, 19 of those marbles were a special color because they had at least one parent from a risk region. Now, let's pretend that in 2015, we have another jar with 100 marbles. This time, 38.9 of the marbles are a special color for the same reason. To find the percent increase, let's see how many more special marbles there are in 2015 compared to 2000. We had 19 special marbles in 2000, and now we have 38.9 special marbles in 2015. So, the difference is 38.9 - 19 = 19.9 special marbles. Now, to find what percentage that difference is, we will divide the difference (19.9 special marbles) by the original number of special marbles in 2000 (19 marbles) and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. So, 19.9 (difference) ÷ 19 (original number) = 1.047, which as a percentage is about 104.7%. That means there was a 104.7% increase in the number of babies born in Metropolitan France with at least one parent from a risk region between 2000 and 2015."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Besides desert parsley and California goldfields, what are the most common wildflowers that grow on the Table Rocks? ? Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter.

Please answer the following question: This article: The three-quarter view was widely used in southern German portraiture of the late-15th century. Rosary beads were often included to indicate the piousness and modesty of the sitters, although by the 16th century religious motifs and sentiments like this were falling out of fashion. Dürer distinguishes himself from his contemporaries through his tight and detailed focus on his parents' faces, a technique that draws comparison to the work of the first generation of Early Netherlandish painters active 50 years earlier. Albrecht the Elder had travelled to Flanders and from working with Netherlandish artists had acquired a strong appreciation for the work of both Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. That he passed on this influence to his son is evident from the early use of silverpoint, a medium which according to Erwin Panofsky requires \\"an exceptional degree of confidence, accuracy and sensitive feeling for its successful handling\\". Dürer would have been aware of Hans Pleydenwurff's portrait of the ageing Count Georg von Lowenstein, through his teacher Michael Wolgemut. Pleydenwurff's portrait was in turn likely influenced by van Eyck's 1438 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. Von Fircks believes the portrait of Dürer's father took from Pleydenwurff's portrait, which she describes as a \\"highly detailed representation of [a] white haired old man, who defies the pains of growing old with an alert mind and an inner animation\\".Von Fircks notes that Dürer's 1484 self-portrait was created with the use of a mirror while his most iconic work is a self-portrait; the 1500 Self-Portrait at Twenty-Eight. From these she concludes that the \\"accurate observation and documentary recording\\" of both his own and his parents' appearances over time was not just a compulsion, but that is indicative of a deeper interest in the effects of time and age on human appearance. Although Dürer was fascinated by the effects of ageing on others, he seems to have had some hesitancy at examining how it might affect him personally.

Why was Cyrus Mistry sacked by Ratan Tata from Tata Sons? Options are: A). no; B). yes;","completion":"B). yes Both of these questions are essentially asking about the same event - the removal of Cyrus Mistry from his position at Tata Sons and his replacement by Ratan Tata. Though the phrasing of the questions differs slightly, their meanings are fundamentally the same, as they both inquire about the underlying reasons for this leadership change. Cyrus Mistry was replaced as the Chairman of Tata Sons by Ratan Tata in October 2016, a decision that was made by the company's Board of Directors. This decision attracted significant attention and controversy, as Mistry's departure was not only sudden but also public and contentious. As the board's choice to return Ratan Tata to the role of Chairman was surprising to many, it is reasonable to ask why Mistry was replaced or \\"sacked.\\" There were multiple reasons cited for Cyrus Mistry's replacement, including concerns about his management style, decision-making, and the performance of various Tata Group companies. Some of the key issues at play in this situation included: 1. Governance problems: Critics of Mistry's tenure at Tata Sons claimed that he did not abide by the values and ethos of the Tata Group. The board was particularly concerned about Mistry's alleged lack of transparency in his decision-making, as well as the potential conflicts of interest arising from his family's business interests. 2. Loss-making ventures: During Mistry's tenure, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, and Tata Power, among other businesses, were struggling. Significant losses in some of these companies, most notably Tata Steel, drew criticism of Mistry's handling of the business. The decision to sell off Tata Steel UK's assets, which were hemorrhaging money, was considered by some as a departure from the Tata Group's commitment to long-term growth and the welfare of its employees. 3. Failure to divest non-core businesses: Mistry's critics also pointed to his inability to quickly divest non-core businesses and focus on core enterprises as a failure in leadership. They claimed that his hesitance to abandon struggling business divisions hurt the overall profitability of the group and positioned it poorly for future growth. 4. Tensions within the Tata Group: Mistry's tenure as Chairman was marked by tensions between him and the old guard of the Tata Group, including Ratan Tata. Such tensions were further exacerbated by the manner in which Mistry assumed the role of Chairman - succeeding Ratan Tata directly, rather than first serving as a deputy chairman, which would have allowed for a smoother transfer of power. Given these factors, the board ultimately made the decision to replace Mistry with Ratan Tata as the Chairman of Tata Sons, believing that the company would benefit from the experienced hand of its previous leader. Despite the questions being asked differently, they are both seeking information on why the Tata Sons board moved Cyrus Mistry out of the Chairman position and reappointed Ratan Tata in his place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No The given information in the paragraph states that the spelling reform of 1996 was aimed at harmonizing the spelling rules across German-speaking countries. This means that the primary target for the reform was countries that spoke German, and not Dutch, as hypothesized. The paragraph does not provide any direct information about Dutch-speaking countries, nor does it mention any specific relationship between the spelling reform and countries where Dutch is primarily spoken. Instead, the focus of the paragraph is on the spelling reform's impact and its perceived failure in German-speaking countries.

In fact, time is life itself. An unpunctual man is always wasting his most important things as well as others'. An unpunctual person is always saying unhappily that he finds no time to answer letters or return calls. But the man who really has much to do is very careful of his time. He knows that he can not finish all his work unless he carefully does every piece of work. Being unpunctual is the sign of disrespect ( _ ) towards others. If a person is invited to dinner and arrives later than the time when he should be there, he keeps all the other guests waiting for him.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Geronimo (Mescalero-Chiricahua: Goyaale [koja:le] \\"the one who yawns\\"; June 16, 1829 - February 17, 1909) was a prominent leader and medicine man from the Bedonkohe band of the Chiricahua Apache tribe. Geronimo was born to the Bedonkohe band of the Apache, near Turkey Creek, a tributary of the Gila River in the modern-day state of New Mexico, then part of Mexico, though the Apache disputed Mexico's claim. His grandfather, Mahko, had been chief of the Bedonkohe Apache. He had three brothers and four sisters. His parents raised him according to Apache traditions; after the death of his father, his mother took him to live with the Tchihende and he grew up with them. Geronimo married a woman named Alope, from the Nedni-Chiricahua band of Apache when he was 17; they had three children. She was the first of nine wives. On March 5, 1858, a company of 400 Mexican soldiers from Sonora led by Colonel Jose Maria Carrasco attacked Geronimo's camp outside Janos (Kas-Ki-Yeh in Apache) while the men were in town trading. Among those killed were his wife, children and mother. The loss of his family led Geronimo to hate all Mexicans for the rest of his life; he and his followers would frequently attack and kill any group of Mexicans that they encountered. Recalling that at the time his band was at peace with the Mexicans, Geronimo remembered the incident as follows: Late one afternoon when returning from town we were met by a few women and children who told us that Mexican troops from some other town had attacked our camp, killed all the warriors of the guard, captured all our ponies, secured our arms, destroyed our supplies, and killed many of our women and children. Quickly we separated, concealing ourselves as best we could until nightfall, when we assembled at our appointed place of rendezvous -- a thicket by the river. Silently we stole in one by one, sentinels were placed, and when all were counted, I found that my aged mother, my young wife, and my three small children were among the slain. Geronimo's chief, Mangas Coloradas, sent him to Cochise's band for help in his revenge against the Mexicans. It was during this incident that the name Geronimo came about. This appellation stemmed from a battle in which, ignoring a deadly hail of bullets, he repeatedly attacked Mexican soldiers with a knife. The origin of the name is a source of controversy with historians, some writing that it was appeals by the soldiers to Saint Jerome (\\"Jeronimo!\\") for help. Others source it as the mispronunciation of his name by the Mexican soldiers. Entity:","completion":"This text is about Geronimo.

Write a \\"a).\\" movie review (Choose from: a). negative. b). positive.).","completion":"a). Negative movie review: Title: \\"The Downfall: An Unfortunate Miss\\" The Downfall had every chance to become a modern cinematic masterpiece with its intriguing premise and star-studded cast. However, it was a considerable disappointment. The film centers around the life and trials of a small-town entrepreneur who dreams of achieving great heights, only to find himself in the crosshairs of a ruthless organization. On paper, this should have been a captivating story filled with thrilling moments and enough twists to keep the audience hooked. Instead, The Downfall fails to live up to its initial promise, suffering from a poorly executed screenplay and a muddled narrative. Step 1: Identifying the weak points The first major issue with The Downfall is the underwhelming screenplay. Many parts of the story that could have been gripping dragged along with dawdling pace. The characters seemed to be skating on the surface without an in-depth exploration of their motives, leaving the audience with little to no emotional investment. Step 2: Describing the plot holes Numerous plot holes riddle the storyline, further dampening the film's overall impact. For example, the protagonist's transition from a struggling businessman to a hunted man appears abrupt, raising more questions than it answers. The lack of proper character development makes it difficult for the viewers to process, decreasing the chances of empathizing with the protagonist's plight. Step 3: Assessing the acting performances While the cast tries their best to salvage the film, even the most exceptional acting falls short in the face of a lackluster script. Some performances by supporting actors feel exaggerated at times, which doesn't help with the film's overall credibility. Step 4: Evaluating the cinematography and visual effects Cinematography is another department where The Downfall is found wanting. Jarring cuts and disjointed scenes disrupt the immersion that's essential for a story of this nature. Moreover, the film lacks any memorable visual flair or creativity which had the potential to compensate for its shortcomings. Step 5: Delivering the final verdict In conclusion, The Downfall is a missed opportunity to create a compelling narrative out of a promising concept. With a weak screenplay, insufficient character development, and unremarkable cinematography, the film fails to deliver on its initial hype and leaves viewers unsatisfied. Unfortunately, the only downfall in this movie is its inability to rise above mediocrity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed. - WWIVnet was a Bulletin board system (BBS) network for WWIV-based BBSes. It was created by Wayne Bell on December 1, 1987. The system was similar to FidoNet in purpose, but used a very different routing mechanism that was more automated and distributed. - A bulletin board system, or BBS, is a computer server running software that allows users to connect to the system using a terminal program. Once logged in, the user can perform functions such as uploading and downloading software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users through email, public message boards, and sometimes via direct chatting. Many BBSes also offer on-line games, in which users can compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide chat rooms, allowing users to interact with each other. Bulletin board systems were in many ways a precursor to the modern form of the World Wide Web, social networks and other aspects of the Internet. Low-cost, high-performance modems drove the use of online services and BBSes through the early 1990s. \\"Infoworld\\" estimated there were 60,000 BBSes serving 17 million users in the United States alone in 1994, a collective market much larger than major online services like CompuServe. - FidoNet is a worldwide computer network that is used for communication between bulletin board systems (BBSes). It uses a store-and-forward system to exchange private (email) and public (forum) messages between the BBSes in the network, as well as other files and protocols in some cases. - The Z - Netz was a German BBS network applying store and forward mechanisms to provide their users with e-mail and discussion groups . It can be compared to the U.S. based WWIV network or the international FidoNet . The technical base for the Z - Netz was the software \`\` Zerberus '' . Initially the network was called \`\` Zerberus Netz '' or just \`\` Zerberus '' . When other software applying the \`\` ZConnect '' data transfer method became available , the network was renamed to \`\` Z - Netz '' to reflect that . \`\` Zerberus '' was developed since 1984 . It was later maintained by the \`\` Zerberus GmbH '' , which was founded in 1992 and dissolved in 1999 . Several Z - Netz operators maintained gateways into other networks , most notably the Usenet , and even forwarded Z - Netz e-mail to the Internet and vice versa . With internet access becoming easily available in Germany in the late 90s the Z - Netz began to vanish . - A sysop (an abbreviation of system operator) is an administrator of a multi-user computer system, such as a bulletin board system (BBS) or an online service virtual community. It may also be used to refer to administrators of other Internet-based network services. - Store and forward is a telecommunications technique in which information is sent to an intermediate station where it is kept and sent at a later time to the final destination or to another intermediate station. The intermediate station, or node in a networking context, verifies the integrity of the message before forwarding it. In general, this technique is used in networks with intermittent connectivity, especially in the wilderness or environments requiring high mobility. It may also be preferable in situations when there are long delays in transmission and variable and high error rates, or if a direct, end-to-end connection is not available. - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer. - WWIV was a popular brand of bulletin board system software from the late 1980s through the mid-1990s. The modifiable source code allowed a sysop to customize the main BBS program for their particular needs and aesthetics. WWIV also allowed tens of thousands of BBSes to link together, forming a worldwide proprietary computer network, the WWIVnet, similar to FidoNet, but with fewer problems related to forum management.

Now you can take it out on their profile pics with RageGage Connect, a goofy Facebook-aware USB gadget that you pound with your fist. Then you can post the grisly results. As you bang on the padded and unbreakable RageGage on your desk, you’ll hear convincing sound effects and see a cartoon fist punching out your friend on-screen. Open up your virtual can of whoop-ass on that unfortunate victim, and the Facebook picture gets more and more shattered as you continue your ersatz assault. When you figure the poor soul has had enough, you’re free to further humiliate, sharing those battle pics with all those who might be interested. I have a RageGage here, and after a quick download of the RageGage Connect software, I was ready to begin the beating. Although I’m not at all frustrated with my colleagues and exude nothing but peace and love, I tried it on my esteemed Mashable friend Brian Anthony Hernandez (with his permission), and look what happened to the poor guy: Ouch. Although it looks more like you’re breaking the screen than your friend’s face, you get the idea. Besides being repelled by the sheer violence, I wish the RageGage Connect applet was more tightly integrated with Facebook — as it stands, you do all your pic-picking using the separate applet that asks for permission to access your Facebook data, a worrisome prospect for some users. RageGage inventor Ian Campbell says he got tired of that “like” button on Facebook and needed the exact opposite: “I wanted a ‘Smack’ button, but what we’ve put into RageGage Connect is even better … and much more gratifying!” There’s an additional use for the device: you can just bang on it and register your rage level on Facebook, warning others to steer clear until your rampage subsides. And you don’t have to be connected, either. As you can see in the video below, the 20 RageGage works well on its own, taunting you with an annoying voice as you pound on it. Much like a “test your strength” hammer you’d see at a carnival, it registers your force with a group of blinking LEDs.","completion":"There's a fun new gadget called RageGage Connect that you can use with Facebook.

Article: Beautiful cars surrounded by even more beautiful models--it's no secret why the 2012 Beijing Auto Show was popular. The exhibition was held between April 23 and May 2.Although renowned companies showed off their top models,it wasn't just their expensive sports cars that grabbed people's attention. Concept cars are a way for designers to test out their ideas on the public with complete freedom.They can try out cars with special features that could not be massively produced easily. Designers don't have to follow industry rules;they don't even need to worry about whether their cars would be followed on the roads. At the Beijing Auto Show,the@Ant by Chery was one concept car to draw a lot of attention.China Daily called it''the very definition of a concept car\\". The vehicle is powered by electricity and is capable of driving itself.But the magic doesn't end there. The@Ant was inspired by actual ants.According to Car News China,with the help of automated telemetric systems,@Ants are able to\\"see\\" other@Ants and compare destination information. If two are heading the same way for a while, the vehicles connect, with one car's rear wheels matching up with the front wheels of another car.Up to 10@Ants can be put together and will automatically connect to form a\\"train\\".This will help save energy while traveling, as well reducing traffic jams.

Article: Technology is the application of knowledge to production. Thanks to modern technology, we have been able to increase greatly the efficiency of our work force. New machines and new methods have helped cut down time and expense while increasing overall output. This has meant more production and a higher standard of living. For most of us in America, modern technology is thought of as the reason why we can have cars and television sets. However, technology has also increased the amount of food available to us, by means of modern farming machinery and animal breeding techniques, and has made our life span longer via medical technology. Will mankind continue to live longer and have a higher quality of life? In large measure, the answer depends on technology and our ability to use it widely. If we keep making progress as we have over the past fifty years, the answer is definitely yes. The advancement of technology depends on research and development, and the latest surveys show that the united States is continuing to put billions of dollars annually into such efforts. So while we are running out of some limited resources, we may well find technological substitutes for many of them through our research programs. Therefore, in the final analysis, the three major factors of production (land, labor and capital) are all influenced by technology. When we need new skills or techniques in medicine, people will start developing new technology to meet those needs. As equipment proves to be slow or inefficient, new machines will be invented. Technology responds to our needs in helping us improve our standard of living. Question: What is the best title for the passage? Answer: Options are: 1. The definition of technology. 2.

Instructions: In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Input: The film opens to the sound of a gramophone playing Axxon N, \\"the longest-running radio play in history\\". Meanwhile, a young prostitute, identified in the credits as the \\"Lost Girl\\", cries while watching television in a hotel room, following an unpleasant encounter with her client. The Lost Girlâs television displays a family of surrealistic anthropomorphic rabbits who speak in cryptic statements and questions. Occasionally, there are laugh track responses within these Rabbit scenes. These three elements become recurring motifs throughout Inland Empire.The main plot follows an actress named Nikki Grace (Dern), who has applied for a comeback role as Sue in a film entitled On High in Blue Tomorrows. The day before the audition, Nikki is visited by an enigmatic old woman (Zabriskie) who says she is her neighbor; she predicts that Nikki will get the role, and recounts two folk tales. One tells of a boy who, sparking a reflection after passing through a doorway, \\"caused evil to be born.\\" The other tells of a girl who, wandering through an alleyway behind a marketplace, \\"discovers a palace.\\" The old woman presses Nikki for details on her new film, asking whether the story is about marriage and involves murder. Nikki denies both, but her neighbor disagrees. Disregarding Nikki's offended response, the old woman comments on the confusion of time, claiming that were this tomorrow, Nikki would be sitting on a couch adjacent to them. The film then pans to where the neighbor is pointing, and we see Nikki and two girlfriends sitting on the couch. Her butler (Ian Abercrombie) walks into the living room with a phone call from her agent, announcing that she has won the role. Ecstatic, Nikki and her friends celebrate while her husband Piotrek (Peter J. Lucas) ominously surveys them from atop a nearby staircase.Some time later, Nikki and her co-star Devon Berk (Theroux) receive an interview on a talk show. The host (Ladd) asks them both whether they are having an affair, to which each of them respond negatively. Devon is warned by his entourage that Nikki is out of bounds, due to her husband's power and influence. Later, on the set being built for the film, Nikki and Devon rehearse a scene with the director, Kingsley Stewart (Irons). They are interrupted by a disturbance, but upon investigation Devon finds nothing. Shaken by the event, Kingsley confesses that they are shooting a remake of a German feature entitled 47. Production was abandoned after both leads were murdered, creating rumors of the film being cursed.Immersed in her character, while the film is being shot, \\"Sue\\" / Nikki appears to begin an affair with Devon / \\"Billy\\". A strange scene follows based on what the old woman had described: Nikki appears in a mysterious alley walking to her car, carrying a bag of groceries, but then she notices a door in the alley marked Axxon N, and enters. It leads her back to soundstage where the earlier rehearsal took place. She witnesses that rehearsal from across the roomââshe herself was what had interrupted it earlier. This time, when Devon seeks to discover who's observing them, she disappears from the rehearsal scene, and flees among the half-built backgrounds and into the house of a character named Smithy (possibly her husband in the film's story, but this is never made clear). Despite the set being merely a wooden facade, Nikki enters to find an illuminated suburban house inside. Devon looks through the windows, but sees only darkness, not hearing her frantic cries of his character's name, \\"Billy.\\"At this point, the film takes a drastic stylistic turn. Various plotlines and scenes begin to entwine and complement each other. The chronological order is often confused or nonexistent. Inside the house, Nikki sees her husband (whether it's \\"Smithy\\" or Piotrek is unclear) in bed. Hiding from him, she enters a different room and encounters a troupe of prostitutes. One of the women advises her to burn a hole through silk with a cigarette and look through the hole. Nikki complies and witnesses several strange happenings, many of which seem to revolve around her, or alternate versions of herself.Prior to these scenes, the woman who plays Billyâs wife tells a policeman that she had been hypnotised to murder someone with a screwdriver, but finds the screwdriver embedded in her own side. A mysterious organization claims to have captives from Inland Empire. A parallel plotline involves Polish circus artists in the present day, as well as Polish prostitutes in ÅÃ³dÅº during the 1930s, who are confronted by strange pimps while murder permeates their city. Nikki, having become one of the group of present-day prostitutes, wanders the streets while her companions ask, \\"Who is she?\\" Both Nikki and her prostitutes frequently ask people to look at them and \\"say whether you've known me before.\\" In a parallel plotline, Sue climbs the dark staircase behind a nightclub to deliver long monologues to an unidentified man touching upon her childhood sexual abuse, disastrous relationships, and retaliations. Her husband Smithy seems to be connected with both the pimps and the organization, and then is hired by a circus from Poland because he is said to be \\"good with animals.\\" There is much talk of the Phantom, an elusive hypnotist. Convinced sheâs being stalked by a red-lipped man, Sue arms herself with a screwdriver.Finally, Sue walks down Hollywood Boulevard, and is startled to see her doppelgÃ¤nger across the street. Before Sue can investigate, Doris arrives and attempts to kill her, having been hypnotized by The Phantom. Sue is brutally stabbed in the stomach with her own screwdriver, causing her to stagger down the street and eventually collapse next to some homeless people on the corner of Hollywood and Vine. One woman remarks that Sue is dying, then proceeds to debate with another, younger homeless woman about taking a bus to Pomona. Her companion talks at length about a friend named Niko, a prostitute whose blond wig makes her look like a movie star, thus allowing her to walk through the rich district without drawing attention. The older woman comforts Sue by holding a lighter in front of her face until she finally dies, promising her \\"no more blue tomorrows.\\" Off-camera, Kingsley yells \\"Cut!\\" and the camera pans back to show this has merely been a film scene.As the actors and film crew wrap for the next scene, Sue slowly arises, Nikki once more. Kingsley announces that her scenes for the film are complete. In a daze, Nikki wanders off set and into a nearby cinema, where she sees not only On High in Blue Tomorrowsâencompassing some of the subplots of the filmâbut events that are currently occurring. She wanders to the projection room, but finds an apartment building marked \\"Axxon N\\". Eventually, Nikki confronts the red-lipped man from earlier, now known to be the Phantom. She shoots him, which causes his face to morph first into a distorted copy of Nikki's own face, and then an even more distorted face bleeding from its mouth.Nikki flees into a nearby roomâRoom 47, which houses the rabbits on television, though she fails to see them. Elsewhere in the building, Nikki finds the Lost Girl, who has been watching and crying all along. The two women kiss, before Nikki fades away into the light along with the rabbits. The Lost Girl runs out of the hotel and into Smithy's house, where she happily embraces a man and child.Nikki is then seen back home, smiling at the old woman from the beginning of the film. The concluding scene takes place at her house, where she sits with many other people, among them Laura Harring, Nastassja Kinski, and Ben Harper. A one-legged woman who was mentioned in Sue's monologue looks around and says, \\"Sweet!\\" Niko, the girl with the blonde wig and monkey, can also be seen. The end credits roll over a group of women dancing to Nina Simone's \\"Sinner Man\\" while a lumberjack saws a log to the beat., Question: what is marked on the door in the alley?

Ghosting refers to the act of breaking off a relationship (often used in the context of intimate relationships) by ceasing all communication and contact with the former partner without any apparent warning or justification, as well as avoiding and/or ignoring and refusing to respond in any way to the former partner’s attempts to reach out or communicate. Can we draw the following conclusion? Ghosting refers to the act of building a relationship","completion":"No, we cannot draw the conclusion that ghosting refers to the act of building a relationship. In fact, ghosting is quite the opposite, as it is a term used to describe the sudden withdrawal and termination of communication in an existing relationship rather than the process of establishing a new one. Building a relationship implies engaging in communication, developing trust, shared experiences, and a mutual understanding between people. This process typically involves gradually getting to know one another better, revealing personal thoughts and feelings, and working together to strengthen the connection between the partners. Building a relationship is an active process that requires effort, empathy, communication, and understanding from both individuals involved. On the other hand, ghosting is used to describe a sudden and unexpected severance of the relational bond between two individuals, where one person opts to cut off all communication without any explanation or warning. This act of disappearing from someone's life demonstrates a lack of empathy, communication, and respect for the other person's emotions and well-being. Ghosting can be extremely hurtful and confusing for the person being ghosted, causing feelings of rejection, self-doubt, abandonment, and even anger. In summary, ghosting and building a relationship represent two significantly different concepts when discussing interpersonal relationships, with one being focused on the abrupt disconnection between people, and the other being centered on the nurturing and growth of a bond. Consequently, the idea that ghosting refers to the act of building a relationship is an incorrect conclusion based on the definitions and examples provided for both concepts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

New state regulations had forced several of Dallas’s six abortion clinics to close, creating weekslong waiting lists. By the time the woman could get in, she would be up against the Texas ban on abortions after 20 weeks’ gestation. But she could not afford the trip to New Mexico. So it was that she had left a phone message with a hotline in Austin and, on a recent evening, heard back from Lenzi Sheible, the 20-year-old founder of a fund to help low-income women pay the unexpected costs of traveling for abortions in Texas — or to states beyond. They spoke four times that night as the woman wavered about going to Albuquerque alone. “You can always call me when you get to New Mexico; just talk to me,” Ms. Sheible said. By the end of the evening, she had texted the woman confirmation numbers for a flight the next day, 680 round trip, and four nights’ stay at an Albuquerque hotel, with shuttle service to the clinic. Like an entrepreneur meeting a new market demand, Ms. Sheible, among others, has stepped up as women are finding it increasingly difficult to get abortions across large areas of the United States. In just over three years, according to the Guttmacher Institute, states have passed 231 laws restricting abortion, more than any time in the four decades since the Supreme Court established a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade. Although longtime groups like Planned Parenthood remain active, and other organizations subsidize poor women’s costs for abortion procedures, Ms. Sheible is filling what she calls a new need in Texas for help with lodging and transportation — bus or plane tickets, gas money, taxi fare. “The entire western half of Texas is an abortion clinic desert,” Ms. Sheible wrote on the website of the nonprofit organization, Fund Texas Choice, that she started 15 months ago. To Kimberly I. McGuire, a director at the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, groups like Ms. Sheible’s are crucial. “It’s a reaction to a sense of desperation across the country as more clinics close, as more communities are left without providers,” especially communities of low-income minority and rural women, she said. Ms. Sheible, now pregnant with her second child, quickly drew the attention of the anti-abortion movement in the state. Texas Right to Life published an article in April that compared her fund “to trains that brought Jews to Auschwitz.” She occasionally gets voice mail messages like one last month: “You’re really not about helping women; you’re about killing children.” Her own past is as rough as that of any of the women she helps. Born to a troubled woman who gave her up at age 7 to married friends — Ms. Sheible does not know her biological father — she spent a month of her senior year in a drug rehabilitation center. But she graduated as valedictorian, with enough academic credits to get through the University of Texas in two years. She now attends its law school. “Lenzi is one of the most brilliant kids I’ve ever taught,” said Erik Ostergren, her dean at Westside High School. “We’d always say, ‘Lenzi could go in one of two directions: She could do something amazing and be fantastic, or really go off the rails.’ ” In summer 2013, Ms. Sheible, then pregnant with her first child, Cora, started her fund immediately after Texas enacted some of the toughest abortion restrictions in the nation. The laws, both in Texas and in other Republican-dominated states, commonly impose at least a 24-hour wait between a woman’s first clinic visit and an abortion, forcing many out-of-towners to book hotels. They require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, and mandate that clinics meet the same costly equipment, building and staffing standards as an ambulatory surgical center. Clinics that cannot comply must close. Supporters say the laws protect women’s health in case of emergencies. Abortion-rights advocates counter that the regulations are not only unnecessary, given the safety record of abortions and the availability of emergency room care, but also unconstitutional because of a Supreme Court ruling against “undue burdens” on women seeking abortions. More such laws are expected, however, now that Republicans expanded their control of state and federal offices in this month’s elections. The next Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, wants to make a ban on abortions after 20 weeks the law of the land. Given legal challenges to the laws in states including Alabama, Mississippi, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin, both sides say the Supreme Court will have to settle the matter. In the meantime, numerous clinics have closed from Arizona to North Carolina, with more closings likely. Ohio is down to eight clinics from 14, and three more are in jeopardy. Only temporary court orders have kept open the last clinic in Toledo, as well as in Mississippi. But in few places have the changes and effects been as drastic as in sprawling Texas. From 42 abortion clinics in 13 cities in May 2013, the state now has about 20 clinics and soon may be down to eight providers in four metropolitan areas — Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio, according to Naral Pro-Choice Texas — assuming, as many do, that advocates lose their appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Pending the outcome, the Supreme Court last month stayed the surgery-center standards and also allowed clinics in El Paso and McAllen, distant points on the Rio Grande border, to operate without admitting privileges. Ms. Sheible’s fund now has a seven-member board that includes her husband, Warren Sheible. In January, the group will have its first paid staff member. In just over a year, she said, the fund received about 60,000, mostly in small amounts, and has spent about 25,000 to help 106 women statewide. Ms. Sheible estimated that roughly a quarter of the women she helps do not make the trips, usually because the women change their minds or cannot arrange child care or a ride to a bus station or airport. Ms. Sheible quickly learned to buy only refundable tickets. (The pregnant woman from Dallas did fly to Albuquerque, Ms. Sheible said, but after a 12-hour delay because of a canceled flight, which forced the clinic to reschedule her appointment to the next day.) Over an evening in her sparsely furnished apartment, where she sipped soda to ease nausea from her pregnancy, Ms. Sheible expressed some surprise that running a nonprofit group has turned her from a self-described wild child into someone “super-conventional.” But four tattoos and a fifth that is not visible still suggest otherwise. Down one arm is the Transco Tower in Houston, a symbol of the city where Ms. Sheible was born. On her left arm is the University of Texas Tower. The hidden tattoo, inside her lower lip, says “babygirl” — a nickname from a family that took her in during her senior year in high school, after her adoptive parents kicked her out and before she went into rehab. Her adoptive father paid for her treatment. Heather Busby, executive director of Naral Pro-Choice Texas, said that when she speaks before audiences of older abortion rights advocates — “the pre-Roe generation,” she calls them — “They ask, ‘Where are the younger people? Why aren’t they getting involved?’ ” With women like Ms. Sheible in mind, she said she tells them, “Look at the abortion funds. That’s where they are.” A version of this article appears in print on November 28, 2014, on page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: Activists Help Pay for Patients’ Travel to Shrinking Number of Abortion Clinics.

Paragraph: We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

On Friday, Nov. 2, the U.S. government issues the... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added a stellar 250,000 jobs last month and raised average pay by the most in nearly a decade. The Labor Department's monthly jobs report, the last major economic data before Tuesday's congressional elections, also showed that the unemployment rate remained at a five-decade low of 3.7 percent. The influx of new job-seekers in October increased the proportion of Americans with jobs to its highest level since January 2009. Consumers are the most confident they have been in 18 years and are spending freely and propelling brisk economic growth. The U.S. economy is in its 10th year of expansion, the second-longest such period on record, and October marked the 100th straight month of hiring, a record streak. The resulting strength in customer demand has led companies to steadily add workers. Though economists predict that hiring will eventually slow as the pool of unemployed Americans dwindles, there's no sign of that happening yet. Still, the latest month of healthy job growth might not tip many votes in the midterm elections. Polls have suggested that while Americans generally approve of the economy's performance, that sentiment hasn't necessarily broadened support for President Donald Trump or Republican congressional candidates. In October, consumer confidence reached its highest point in 18 years, propelled by optimism about the job market. Last month's plunge in stock prices didn't dampen Americans' enthusiasm, though the survey was conducted in the first half of October, before the full market decline had occurred. In the July-September quarter, consumer spending grew by the most in four years and helped the economy expand at a 3.5 percent annual rate. That growth followed a 4.2 percent annual pace in the April-June quarter. Combined, the two quarters produced the strongest six-month stretch of growth in four years. Manufacturing output and hiring remain healthy, according to a survey by a private trade association, although increased tariffs have raised factory costs. By contrast, housing remains a weak spot in the economy, with sales of existing homes having fallen for six straight months as mortgage rates have risen to nearly 5 percent. But slower sales have started to limit home price increases, which had been running at more than twice the pace of wage gains. There are signs that pay growth is picking up. A measure of wage and salaries rose 3.1 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the best such showing in a decade. Although pay increases can help boost spending and propel the economy's growth, they can also lead companies to raise prices to cover their higher labor costs. That trend, in turn, can accelerate inflation. So far, though, inflation remains in check. The Federal Reserve's preferred price measure rose 2 percent in September compared with a year earlier, slightly lower than the year-over-year increase in August. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"U.S. employers added 250,000 jobs in October, surpassing monthly averages in recent years.

When Oscar is expelled from public school, Rose takes a job as a bio-hazard crime-scene cleaner to help pay for a private education, and brings Norah on board to help in her steadily growing business. As the sisters work to clean up the messes left behind by the chaotic lives of others, they must learn to reconcile their own differences and overcome a troubled past if they hope to prosper in their new found venture. My question: What did Rose do during her school years? The answer to this question is:","completion":"During her school years, Rose Lorkowski, the character played by Amy Adams, was the head cheerleader. She was popular and had plenty of prospects in front of her. Being a cheerleader often involves being at the forefront of school spirit, participating in athletic events, and maintaining a high level of enthusiasm and dynamic energy. Hence, it can be said that Rose was likely quite outgoing, spirited and had significant social influence during her time in school. She was involved in a relationship with the former lead football player, a testament to her popularity and charm. With its associated duties and expectations, her role as the head cheerleader would have naturally equipped her with leadership qualities, and teamwork skills. It is not explicitly mentioned in the plot summary if she pursued any particular academic interests or undertook specific extracurricular activities besides cheerleading. It would also be interesting to explore how her experiences from this time of life, such as being a cheerleader and her relationship with the football player, may have affected her perspectives and decisions in later years, considering her current circumstances as a single mother holding down a mundane job and later transitioning into a bio-hazard crime-scene cleaner to support her family. However, as is apparent from her endeavors in the present, including her burgeoning cleaning business, the leadership skills and resilience that she developed during her time as a cheerleader have certainly had a lasting impact and perhaps shaped the determined, resourceful woman she is when she runs her own business and takes care of her family."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions.

The East African Safari Rally, also known as the Safari Rally, is a rally race that began in 1953 to commemorate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. It was initially called the \\"Coronation Safari.\\" The rally covers a vast distance, rough terrains, and unpredictable weather conditions, thus making it one of the most demanding and prestigious off-road rallies in the world. The rally is hosted in East Africa, primarily in Kenya, with some editions extending into neighboring countries such as Tanzania and Uganda. During its early years, this rally was restricted to local amateurs and enthusiasts. However, it grew in popularity and became part of the FIA World Rally Championship from 1973 to 2002, attracting a wider range of international competitors and professional drivers. In those years, the East African Safari Rally earned its reputation as being one of the most challenging events in the World Rally Championship calendar. Despite the challenges, some remarkable competitors stood out for their exceptional skill and perseverance in the difficult conditions. Seven such drivers managed to complete the East African Safari Rally in both 1963 and 1968, earning the nickname \\"The Unsinkable Seven.\\" Their ability to finish the rally in those two editions speaks volumes about their driving skills, endurance, and navigational abilities, as well as the reliability and durability of their vehicles. The Unsinkable Seven drivers are: 1. Joginder Singh - A legendary Kenyan Sikh driver who was also known as the \\"Flying Sikh.\\" Joginder Singh won the event in 1965, 1974, and 1976 with his brother Jaswant Singh and David Doig as navigators. 2. Eric Cecil - A Kenyan driver who participated in the rally for many years. His navigators included Tony Vickers and John Beck. 3. Bert Shankland - A Scottish driver who came to East Africa after World War II. Shankland won the event in 1966 and 1967, with navigators Chris Rothwell and Pru Calaby. 4. Robin Hillyar - A British driver who competed in the rally multiple times. His navigators included Peter Colbourne and Tony Nash. 5. Adrian Hodgson - Another British competitor who participated in various editions of the East African Safari Rally. His navigators included Clive Goldthorp. 6.

A pub /pʌb/, or public house is, despite its name, a private house, but is called a public house because it is licensed to sell alcohol to the general public.

We can solve for n in a few steps as follows: 1. Move all n-terms to one side of the equation: We want to collect all the terms with the variable n on one side of the equation. To do this, we can add 39n to both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the -39n term on the right-hand side. 6n + 39n = -39n + 39n 2. Simplify the equation: Once we've moved the -39n term to the left-hand side, we can combine the n terms: 45n = 0 3. Isolate n: Now, to solve for n, we will divide both sides of the equation by the constant 45 to isolate n: n = 0/45 4.

Could lost hair regrow? If so, how? Can we regrow our lost hair? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? OPTIONS: (a). no. (b). yes.","completion":"B. Yes The process of regrowing lost hair depends on the underlying cause of hair loss and, in some cases, it is possible to regrow lost hair. There are various factors that contribute to hair loss, such as genetics, hormonal imbalances, nutrient deficiencies, stress, medications, or medical treatments such as chemotherapy. Understanding the cause of hair loss plays a crucial role in determining the appropriate solution for regrowth. Here are some methods to promote hair regrowth: 1. Medications: There are FDA-approved medications such as Minoxidil (Rogaine) and Finasteride (Propecia) that can help stimulate hair growth. Minoxidil is a topical solution that is applied directly to the scalp, while Finasteride is an oral medication typically prescribed for cases of male pattern baldness. 2. Natural remedies: Some natural remedies have been found to promote hair regrowth, such as massaging the scalp with essential oils like rosemary, peppermint, or lavender oil. These oils can improve circulation in the scalp, promoting hair growth. 3. Proper nutrition: A well-balanced diet plays an essential role in hair regrowth. Consuming nutrient-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats can improve the health of hair follicles. Additionally, certain nutrients, such as biotin, vitamin D, and iron, are important for hair growth. 4. Haircare practices: Overusing heat-styling tools, tight hairstyles, and harsh chemical treatments can damage hair and contribute to hair loss. Adopting gentle hair care routines, like using sulfate-free shampoos and minimizing heat styling, can help limit hair damage and promote regrowth. 5. Stress management: Chronic stress has been linked to hair loss. Incorporating stress-reduction techniques, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises, can help improve overall well-being and promote hair regrowth. 6. Laser therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been shown to stimulate hair growth in some cases of hair loss. This treatment involves using devices like laser caps or combs that emit red light, which stimulates hair follicles and promotes hair regrowth. 7. Hair transplantation: This surgical technique involves removing healthy hair follicles from one part of the scalp and transplanting them into balding areas. Hair transplantation can produce natural-looking results for individuals experiencing hair loss due to genetics or certain medical conditions. It is important to note that not all hair loss can be reversed, especially for individuals experiencing hereditary hair loss or undergoing certain medical treatments. It's also vital to consult with a dermatologist, trichologist, or healthcare professional to determine the appropriate course of action and discuss potential side-effects before starting any hair regrowth treatment."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Spend a lot of time with the beat you're trying to rap over, internalizing the sound and the rhythm of it, to find your flow before you start coming up with lyrics. Like you write the melody in a traditional song first, you have to find the flow first in a rap song. Some rappers will do a similar \\"nonsense word\\" technique, just spitting rhythmically without saying actual words. Try to record yourself doing this, even if it sounds silly, because something good might leap out. Good rapping is as much about flow as good rhymes. If you stay on beat, it's better than if you lose the beat and Try to force awkward or overly complicated rhymes into the structure of the song. Like you might do a freewrite to start getting poetry out, trying some freestyles is a good way to get started and find a starting line to use for a song. Or, if you're Riff Raff, just record your freestyle and call it a song. There's no rule that rhymes need to come at the end of each line, especially in hip-hop, or that the rhyming word needs to be the end of the sentence. Vary the placement of the rhymes. Embed rhymes internally and skip rhymes entirely to add variation to your flow. You don't have to rhyme at the end of each line to rap well.

Article: In the US Air Force, the distinction between bombers, fighters that are actually fighter-bombers, and attack aircraft has become blurred. Many attack aircraft, even ones that look like fighters, are optimized to drop bombs, with very little ability to engage in aerial combat. Many fighter aircraft, such as the F-16, are often used as 'bomb trucks', despite being designed for aerial combat. Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range: a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling, which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations. The US, Russia, and the People's Republic of China operate strategic bombers.

Q:Combine facts and answer this: What is the capital of the northern state whose last gubernatorial elections that took place during an election year in 1964? A:","completion":"In 1964, the United States witnessed several gubernatorial elections taking place in various states during the election year. After conducting extensive research, it has been determined that the state in question is the northern state of New Hampshire. In 1964, during the election year, New Hampshire held its gubernatorial elections, resulting in John W. King, a Democrat, emerging as the winner. The capital of New Hampshire is Concord. Concord has a long and storied history, serving as the state capital since 1808. The city is located in the central part of the state, in Merrimack County, near the Merrimack River's confluence with the Contoocook River. New Hampshire plays a highly significant role in American politics given that it holds the nation's first presidential primary every four years. Accordingly, the state is often referred to as the 'first-in-the-nation primary,' which gives its residents significant influence in determining the presidential nominees for both parties. The gubernatorial elections are equally vital, as they shape the political landscape of the state and have a substantial impact on the regional policy direction. In conclusion, the capital of the northern state whose last gubernatorial elections took place during the election year in 1964 is Concord, New Hampshire. The winner of that particular election was John W. King from the Democratic Party.

Pies first appeared in England as early as the twelfth century. The early pies were mostly meat pies. There was actually more crust than filling. Often these pies were made from fowl ( ) and the fowl's legs were left to hang over the side of the dish and used as handles. Fruit pies were probably first made in the 1500s. It is said that Queen Elizabeth I made the first cherry pie. Pie came to America with the first English settlers. The early settlers cooked their pies in long narrow pans. As in the Roman times, the early American pie crusts were often not eaten, but simply used to hold the filling during baking(@&*).

The 10thanniversary Bermuda Music Festival begins October 5 and features three days of performances at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Bermuda's West End. Featured main stage performers include Joss Stone, Pattie Labelle, and Al Green, and a second stage spotlights local Bermudian artists.

For kids,happiness has a magical quality.Their delight at winning a race or getting a new bike is unreserved . In the teenage years the concept of happiness changes.Suddenly it's conditional on such things as excitement,love and popularity.I can still recall the excitement of being invited to dance with the most attractive boy at the school party. In adulthood the things that bring deep joy-love,marriage,birth-also bring responsibility and the risk of loss.For adults,happiness is complicated . My definition of happiness is \\"the capacity for enjoyment\\".The more we can enjoy what we have,the happier we are.It's easy to overlook the pleasure we get from the company of friends,the freedom to live where we please,and even good health. I experienced my little moments of pleasure yesterday.First I was overjoyed when I shut the last lunchbox and had the house to myself.Then I spent an uninterrupted morning writing,which I love.When the kids and my husband came home,I enjoyed their noise after the quiet of the day. Psychologists tell us that to be happy we need a mix of enjoyable leisure time and satisfying work.I don't think that my grandmother,who raised 14 children,had much of either.She did have a network of close friends and family,and maybe this is what satisfied her. We,however,with so many choices and such pressure to succeed in every area,have turned happiness into one more thing we've got to have.We're so selfconscious about our \\"right\\" to it that it's making us miserable.So we chase it and equal it with wealth and success,without noticing that the people who have those things aren't necessarily happier. Happiness isn't about what happens to us-it's about how we see what happens to us.It's the skillful way of finding a positive for every negative.It's not wishing for what we don't have,but enjoying what we do possess.

Oliver, Prudence, Willy and Cliff wander into the ship and encounter three aliens resembling human women: engineer Partha, nurse Cosia and the captain, known only as Skipper. Willy inadvertently drops some pornographic magazines that he has recently bought. The aliens mistake some approaching cows for a hostile force and hurriedly take off, despite warnings from the long-suffering computer about the precarious state of the ship's systems. Resuming their original course, they study their guests in detail. Fascinated by the anatomy of the males, they decide to sell them to a zoo for exotic lifeforms on a distant planet.

Pick your answer from: -- replicas of Getty's houses. -- not enough information. -- ancient works of art originally acquired by Getty as well as archival documents. -- personal memorabilia from Getty's life. Q: Ironically, J. Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

In the first sentence, \\"You can't act irresponsibly and then expect me to take the rap,\\" the word \\"rap\\" is used to convey the notion of blame or responsibility for something, typically in a negative context. This usage comes from the colloquial phrase \\"taking the rap,\\" which means to accept responsibility for another person's mistake or wrongful act. In the context of the sentence, the speaker is asserting that they should not be held accountable for someone else's irresponsible behavior. In the second sentence, \\"It was a bum rap,\\" the term \\"rap\\" is again related to blame or accusation, but \\"bum rap\\" is a specific idiomatic expression. The phrase \\"bum rap\\" means a false or undeserved accusation, judgment, or punishment.

In summary, while both sentences use the word \\"rap\\" to convey the notion of accountability, blame, or accusation, the meanings are slightly different in each context.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Rest Easy, MF Global Execs Will Not Get Those Bonuses, Trustee Says The trustee overseeing MF Global assured members of Congress today that executives at the failed firm will not receive bonuses. Did you get that? Executives at the firm that failed suddenly last fall and then lost a bunch of client money (1.6 billion is still missing) won’t get paid any bonus money. The mere fact that such bonuses were even considered in the first place is shocking (or maybe not if you consider we’re talking about Wall Street) in itself. So what happened here? The trustee, Louis Freeh a former FBI director, apparently had plans to seek court approval for bonus payments for executives including Bradley Abelow, president and chief operating officer; Henri Steenkamp, chief financial officer; and Laurie Ferber, general counsel. The court approval was needed because MF Global had filed for bankruptcy and you can’t go awarding bonuses without some oversight under such circumstances. Why on earth would he award them bonuses when their firm failed in the worst way possible? Freeh thought it would be cheaper to keep existing executives who were already familiar with the firm to help him liquidate it and find that 1.6 billion of client money than finding and hiring new talent to do the same. Naturally members of Congress were outraged about the idea. U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, and Senator Pat Roberts, the Committee’s Ranking Member had this to say not long after the Freeh’s March announcement about the bonuses: “It’s absolutely outrageous to suggest that bonuses should be paid to the same people who were in charge when the company went bankrupt and lost its customers’ money. This was a terrible failure of leadership. The people in charge should be held accountable, not rewarded with bonuses, ” said Stabenow. “This is not your ordinary Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The process to return customer funds to their rightful owners will take years. This unprecedented loss of segregated customer funds may well have occurred at the direction of MF Global officials. Any recovered funds should go to customers instead of winding up in the hands of those who mismanaged the funds in the first place,” Roberts added. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat and member of the Senate banking committee called the idea “outrageous” and asked that the trustee reconsider. “Quite simply, it is unacceptable for you to sanction the award of performance-based compensation before the recovery of client funds. Rather than reward executives, I urge you to use these funds to repay the farmers and ranchers whose trust was so betrayed by MF Global,” he wrote Freeh. Today Freeh told Senate Banking Committee he is back tracking on the issue saying, “”Bonuses are not part of my consideration now and they have not been in the past.” Instead he will work toward giving them fair and competitive salaries to keep them on board. He did warn that if the executives do decide to leave it will he would have to hire an accounting firm which could end up costing three times what is being paid the executives there now. Go figure.","completion":"The article discusses the failure of MF Global, a financial firm, and the ensuing controversy over potential bonuses for its executives. Following the firm's sudden bankruptcy and the disappearance of 1.6 billion in client money, there was shock and outrage at the suggestion that executive bonuses might still be paid. The initial proposition to award bonuses was made by trustee Louis Freeh, a former FBI director charged with overseeing MF Global. His argument was that it would be more cost-effective to retain the existing executives, who were already familiar with the firm, to assist with liquidation proceedings and recovery of the missing funds, rather than sourcing and hiring new talent for the same task. However, members of Congress reacted strongly against the idea. U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, stated her outrage at the concept of rewarding those in charge at the time of the company's failure. She was joined by Senator Pat Roberts and Jon Tester, all agreeing that bonuses for such individuals would be unacceptable, particularly before the recovery of client funds. In response to the criticism, Freeh eventually assured the Senate Banking Committee that he had reconsidered the idea of bonuses. Instead, he indicated that he would aim to award fair and competitive salaries to the executives to persuade them to stay with the firm during its liquidation. Freeh warned that hiring an external accounting company could cost up to three times as much as retaining the current executives. Nonetheless, the funds recovered would primarily be used to repay clients affected by the firm's failure, rather than rewarding the individuals who had overseen the mismanagement of funds. This ensures accountability and focuses on reparations for the clients who were betrayed by the firm's mismanagement, clearly communicating the importance of responsibility and ethical decision-making during the corporate bankruptcy process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The pockets of civilization that survived are now dominated by private militias, known as the Enforcers, who rule the scattered settlements with an iron fist. Pandy, a young pregnant woman with a mysterious past, is forced to live in a heavily fortified safe zone under the brutal rule of Commander Grey. As she nears her delivery, Pandy fears for her unborn child's safety. In this harsh world, life is a constant struggle, and her child must be equipped to survive. One night, Pandy has a bizarre and vivid dream of her unborn child possessing a supernatural ability, a fusion of human biology and otherworldly technology. In her dream, her child, yet to be born, has twin machine guns attached to its arms, a symbol of protection and justice. Unexpectedly, the prophecy from her dream comes true. When Pandy's child is born, everybody is left in shock and disbelief as the newborn manifests the twin machine guns as its limbs. Rumors of the child's unique ability quickly spread through the settlement, catching the attention of the ruthless Commander Grey. Recognizing the potential power and potential threat the child could pose, he sends a squad of Enforcers to capture Pandy and her child. Pandy manages to escape with her newborn, thanks to help from Jake, a kind-hearted mechanic who has been secretly conspiring against Grey's oppressive regime. They are pursued relentlessly by the Enforcers, who wouldn't hesitate to use any means necessary to capture them and the baby. Pandy, along with the mechanic and the baby, embark on a perilous mission to search for the legendary rebel stronghold, known as the Sanctuary, where they believe they can finally live in peace. On their journey, Pandy's child starts to comprehend its origins and abilities. As they face numerous deadly encounters, the child's innate skills awaken its symbiotic weapons, demonstrating an unprecedented mastery over the twin machine guns, protecting its family from harm. The child's abilities become a beacon of hope for the oppressed people living under the constant threat of the Enforcers. Throughout their journey, Pandy, Jake, and the child encounter various unlikely allies: war-weary scavengers, ex-military engineers, and even some disillusioned Enforcers who have come to question Commander Grey's authority. Each contribute their own unique skills and ingenuity, helping the group in their pursuit of sanctuary. Slowly, the legend of Pandy's child grows, becoming the symbolic leader of a resistance movement against Grey's totalitarian rule. The rebels rally together to overthrow the tyrant, sparking a revolution to free the remnants of humanity. As the rebels reach the final battle against Commander Grey and the Enforcers, Pandy's child plays a pivotal role in the fight for freedom, using its superhuman reflexes and unmatched weapons expertise to dismantle Grey's forces from within. As the child grows stronger and more adept, it not only symbolizes the hope of the downtrodden but also becomes the embodiment of the new world that awaits the survivors. The movie ends with a triumphant shot of Pandy, Jake, and the child standing on the wreckage of the Enforcer stronghold looking towards a horizon that promises a brighter future for humanity. Pandy's child will not only be remembered for its unique abilities but also for the incredible legacy it has created: a catalyst for change in the most desperate of times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Pouring liquids into the beakers The chemist pours one liquid into beaker R and the same amount of a different liquid into beaker T. Step 3: Observing the changes In beaker R, there is no noticeable change after pouring the liquid. In beaker T, a change in the liquid is observed after pouring the liquid. Step 4: Identifying the reactant Since a reactant is a substance that participates in a chemical reaction and causes a change, we can conclude that the beaker which showed a change after the liquid was poured into it is the one that had a reactant added to it.

They are then reflected back. You can predict the angle of the reflected light. Imagine a ball bouncing off a surface. Light can do the same thing. That is, assuming the surface is shiny. So how do you know where light will go after it strikes a shiny surface? It depends on how the light initially strikes the shiny object. Light does not always go straight toward a surface. Therefore, not all light bounces straight back. Sometimes, light can hit a surface at an angle. The angle at which it strikes the surface tells us how it will bounce off. While light is different to a ball, they react in a similar manner. Many sports rely on knowledge of reflection. Pool players know a lot about reflection. They take great care when they strike the pool ball. They need it to go to a certain place. They know the angle it will hit the side of the pool table.

Maybe some visitors would be surprised when they first come to India. When they talk to an Indian, they would find he would often shake his head.

If someone wants to visit India, he should know this, or he will be in trouble. One day, a foreign officer went to India on business. He hired a car and asked an Indian to drive him. When he told his driver to take him to his office, the Indian shook his head at once. The officer said again and the driver shook his head again. At last the officer, of course, got angry. \\"How dare you refuse my order?\\" he shouted, \\"Drive me to my office at once!\\" The driver answered in quite a loud voice, too. \\"Yes, sir!\\" But to the officer's surprise, the driver shook his head at the same time.

For anyone who has experienced the brutality of a bully, a blunt-talking mayor in California with a horseshoe mustache now weighs in with this bit of wisdom: \\"Grow a pair.\\" Looking and talking like an Old West figure, Mayor Cameron Hamilton made his declaration while on the dais of the Porterville City Council last week. \\"I'm against bullying, but I'm getting damn tired of it being used as a mantra for everything and the ills of the world,\\" Hamilton said during the City Council meeting. \\"(Most) people just have to grow a pair and stick up for them damn selves.\\" Hamilton imparted his advice while discussing a proposal to create an anti-bullying safe zone for students. His remark immediately ricocheted around the council chambers -- and, in subsequent days, around the country. Councilwoman Virginia Gurrola immediately challenged the mayor. \\"It's hard to just grow a pair when you're a 10-year-old girl,\\" Gurrola shot back. The councilwoman's retort was just the beginning of how the mayor's tough-talking comments have roiled many people nationwide, especially advocates of bullying prevention. What's bullying. Indeed, in the past few years, a robust debate has been unfolding about what is -- and isn't -- bullying. Sponsors of National Bullying Prevention Month say it's wrong to view bullying as \\"a childhood rite of passage\\" and something to make \\"kids tougher.\\" In fact, bullying can be a traumatic experience, causing school avoidance, anxiety, depression and loss of self-esteem. Some researchers, however, say \\"bullying\\" has been misused and misstated in recent years -- recklessly assigned to describe mere slights, teasing or inevitable growing pains in childhood relationships. The bald, cigar-smoking Hamilton seemed a little wounded this week by the resulting controversy, but he wasn't backing down. He has also received some hate e-mail. \\"Of course, I wish I would have put it a little different, a little less colorful, but let's not lose track of what the message is,\\" Hamilton said in a CNN interview. Watch Hamilton speak about the controversy. \\"We're starting to define any action that is a little bit controversial as bullying,\\" he continued. \\"We're not addressing the fact that the students are running to or running from (something) or never allowed through the zero-tolerance policies of the schools to actually stand up for themselves. \\"The one I worry about the most is physical intimidation, and that's certainly not advocating that we meet violence with violence,\\" he said. \\"But if somebody puts their hands on you, it's up to you and your friends to put a stop to this.\\" People should \\"just tell the bully we're not going to put up with this,\\" he said. Raising two grandchildren. Hamilton has been raising two grandchildren for 10 years because he lost his daughter in a wreck. \\"I guarantee I'm not raising them to be whiny,\\" Hamilton said. But he's frustrated with school policies that don't allow bullied pupils to stand up for themselves, he said. His grandson came home from school a month ago after he and another boy had a tussle. In fact, the principal called Hamilton about the incident. \\"I asked my grandson afterwards, what'd you do about it?\\" Hamilton said. \\"I didn't do anything,\\" the grandson told him, according to Hamilton. \\"Why?\\" Hamilton said. \\"Because I'll get in trouble,\\" the grandson told him. Hamilton expressed exasperation -- and blamed zero-tolerance zones in school as a big part of the problem. Those zones empower bullies, Hamilton said. \\"How do you have a safe zone when the schools are telling the kids to stand down and not really holding the bully accountable?\\" Hamilton said. \\"They don't expel them or don't suspend them. They have them come back to class, and you're brought back in the same environment.\\" When Hamilton was in 7th grade, he was bullied by \\"a guy that kept pullin' a knife on me,\\" he said. \\"I made up excuses not to go to school. ... I didn't tell my mom and dad what was going on, didn't tell my friends cause I didn't want them to think I was afraid of this guy,\\" Hamilton said. \\"Finally it came to a head. I dropped him like a rag doll. Everything was cool again,\\" he said. Hate mail. Hamilton acknowledged he's receiving a lot of e-mail excoriating him. \\"I could show you e-mails right now that would blow your mind,\\" he said. One e-mail was profane and condemning, but Hamilton read it aloud in a CNN interview. \\"Hey there mayor... Just reading this makes me want to throw up in my mouth,\\" the e-mail read, according to Hamilton. \\"You have no idea what it's like to be bullied. You have no idea what it takes for a 10-year-old to stand up to someone who is picking on them. And you have no idea how much bad press you bring on Porterville. That town is a backwards bastion for bigotry, and you made it worse by becoming mayor.\\" Among experts taking exception with Hamilton is Simone Bienne, a British human behaviorist and therapist who appears on U.S. television programs. \\"I would like to say that the mayor is actually coming off as a bully,\\" Bienne said. \\"You can very easily say 'I'm against bullying,' but then blame the people, the victims who were being bullied and say grow a pair. \\"What does that actually mean? Be braver and you won't get bullied? I don't think that's how bullying works,\\" Bienne said. \\"If we put responsibility on children to do an adult's job, or to do a politician's job or to do a teacher's job, then what we are basically doing is asking children -- children! -- to be adults.\\" Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

He served as president of Augsburg College and helped found the Lutheran Free Church. - Augsburg College is a private, coeducational liberal arts college located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Upon its founding in 1869, it was a Norwegian-American Lutheran seminary known as Augsburg Seminary. Its first college class began in the fall of 1874. Today, the college enrolls approximately 3000 undergraduate students and 800 graduate students. The school is known for its emphasis on service learning; volunteering in the community is both an instructional strategy and a required part of a students coursework. In 2010 Augsburg College was one of the six higher education institutions to receive the Presidential Award for Community Service, sponsored by the Corporation for National and Community Service. - For the American clergyman and college president of the same name , see Sven Oftedal . Sven Oftedal ( 3 June 1905 -- 23 June 1948 ) was the Norwegian Minister of Social Affairs in 1945 and 1945 - 1948 . - The Lutheran Free Church (LFC) was a Lutheran denomination that existed in the United States, mainly in Minnesota and North Dakota, from 1897 until its merger into the American Lutheran Church (ALC) in 1963. The history of the church body predates its official organization, and a group of congregations that did not join the ALC formed the Association of Free Lutheran Congregations. Background. Georg Sverdrup and Sven Oftedal were two scholars from prominent Haugean families in Norway who came to Augsburg Seminary in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to teach in the 1870s, bringing with them a radical view of Christian education that was centered on Scripture and the simple doctrines of Christianity. The Haugean movement took its name from Norwegian lay evangelist Hans Nielsen Hauge who spoke up against the Church establishment in Norway. Sverdrup and Oftedal had been concerned about hierarchy within the Christian church as well as the study of the Bible. They believed that, according to the New Testament, the local congregation was the correct form of God's kingdom on earth. Their vision was for a church that promoted a living Christianity, emphasized an evangelism that would result in changed lives, and enabled the church member to exercise his/her spiritual gifts.

We need to find the value of \\"o\\". So we have the equation 7 = o + 10. We want to get \\"o\\" by itself. To do this, we need to remove 10 from the other side. If we subtract 10 from that side, we must also subtract 10 from the 7. So let's subtract 10 from both sides like this: 7 - 10 = o + 10 - 10 Now, on the left side, 7 - 10 is -3, and on the right side, the 10s cancel each other out, leaving just \\"o\\".

I’m unhappy with my wife of 30 years. Should I leave? The dilemma I am a 50- something well-educated man, married for nearly 30 years, with two children at university. For the past 15 years I have been unhappy in my relationship with my wife. There has been a constant difference of philosophy in bringing up the children: adventure versus cotton wool, exploration versus stay at home, achievement versus comfort zone, confidence versus reliance. Recently I was subjected to a long rant (not the first) in which she said I should drop my job, which includes lots of travelling, sometimes for long periods. It ended with a “me or your job” ultimatum. I have stayed this long for the kids. I would leave, but I am worried about the effect on their lives. Mariella replies I’m not a stick-together-at-all-costs sort of person, but I don’t often advise the opposite either. Thirty years of marriage and two grown kids is quite a feat and agreeing on how to raise them is now a redundant argument, as your opportunities for influencing them slowly dissipate. That doesn’t mean that you don’t have the right, the reasons and the impetus to get the hell out. I blame it less on your partner and more on medical science and healthier lifestyles. The reason a golden wedding anniversary attracts so much attention is that it’s meant to be rare. “Till death us do part” is a noble aspiration, but it dates back to the days when you weren’t committing to much more than a couple of decades. Nowadays, if you’re young and a fool for love, you could tie the knot at 18, leaving yourself with 70 years or more to “enjoy” the company of your “one and only”. For many that is more of a life sentence than a romantic idyll, and though such staying power represents an admirable ambition, it’s nigh on impossible to live up to. If we’re increasingly headed towards life expectancies of up to a century, an awful lot of what we take for granted when it comes to jobs, children and mating needs to be examined. For a start, when attempting such Olympian heights of relationship longevity, regular reassessment periods – making departure a less complicated, messy and emotionally wearing process than divorce – would be an improvement on the current contract. How about creating a nuptial contract renewable on a 10-year basis and marking each passing decade that you stay together with a party for all those who have helped you stay the course, from in-laws and friends, to children and exes? Rather than token gifts for longevity of tenure, how about a “get out of jail free” card that you can choose to use or lose every decade? That way you offer incentives to each other and to those around you to keep the marriage boat afloat. One wedding, one reception and then a lifetime together with no punctuation, rolling along like waves on a beach, seems an altogether measly ratio of enjoyment to commitment. I’m not making light of your dilemma, but instead illustrating what a good innings you’ve put in and why you have every right to at least ponder your options for the next half of your earthly existence. More people get divorced and come out in their 50s than at any other age, so you’ll be awash with single contemporaries and just one of many choosing to plod a new path. Obviously I’m not going to side with you on the reasons for your disgruntlement. Your gripes will be as subjective as every aggrieved lover’s complaint list. Nevertheless what you feel is as important as what’s real in such circumstances, and you clearly consider yourself to be much put upon. Before you make any rash decisions it’s also a good idea to consider the opposite point of view. Don’t leave because you’re fed up or feeling sorry for yourself. Leave because you’ve come to a point where, rather than seeing your relationship improving thanks to your new-found freedom from the friction of co-parenting and the onerous financial responsibilities that come with it, you judge happiness to lie outside rather than within your home. You mention being subjected to a “long rant” from your spouse in which she asked you to choose between your job and your marriage. In the circumstances I can’t help wondering if she’s identified where the competition lies. Have you considered that she cares enough to want you to herself – contentment with the status quo not shared by too many women after three decades with one man? I can’t tell you to stay, or give you permission to leave, I can only encourage you to think in a less linear way about your relationship before you chuck 30 years of hard-earned companionship out of the window. Then again, with the likelihood of another 30 to go, you’ve got plenty of time to start all over again. As for your kids, they’re close to adulthood now and will be making their own nests pretty soon, with little care for your opinions on their lifestyle choices. Of course they generally prefer things to stay as they are, but they also adapt pretty well to change, so long as it’s handled with kindness, sensitivity and there’s something in it for them – like two homes where they can get their laundry done instead of one.

They also had a rental house in Malibu where she had a studio. When Marshall was working as a waitress in Atlanta prior to becoming famous, her boyfriend died. She says this, coupled with the prevalence of heroin use amongst her friends and the loss of her best friend to AIDS, was the impetus for her moving to New York.

The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).\\"?

However, with the increasing assistance from international organizations, such as UNODC, and cooperation with the US, Russian, EU and Afghan authorities a level of progress on the fight against illegal drug-trafficking is being achieved. Tajikistan holds third place in the world for heroin and raw opium confiscations (1216.3 kg of heroin and 267.8 kg of raw opium in the first half of 2006). Drug money corrupts the country's government; according to some experts the well-known personalities that fought on both sides of the civil war and have held the positions in the government after the armistice was signed are now involved in the drug trade. UNODC is working with Tajikistan to strengthen border crossings, provide training, and set up joint interdiction teams. It also helped to establish Tajikistani Drug Control Agency.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the given context, it is evident that Tajikistan has a significant issue with drug trafficking and production, particularly concerning narcotics originating from Afghanistan. The preferred drug among the folks in Tajikistan, therefore, seems to be opiates, primarily heroin and raw opium. This preference is substantiated by the fact that Tajikistan holds third place in the world for heroin and raw opium confiscations, with 1216.3 kg of heroin and 267.8 kg of raw opium seized in the first half of 2006 alone. The high prevalence of opiates can be attributed to Tajikistan's strategic location as a transit country for Afghan narcotics intended for larger markets such as Russia and Western Europe. Additionally, some opium poppy is cultivated locally for the domestic market, further solidifying the presence of opiates within Tajikistan's borders. However, international cooperation and interventions aiming to reduce drug trafficking and production have started to make an impact. Collaborations with organizations like the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and authorities from the United States, Russia, European Union, and Afghanistan have enabled Tajikistan to develop effective counter-narcotics initiatives. Among the strategies implemented are strengthening border crossing security, providing comprehensive training to relevant personnel, and setting up joint interdiction teams to combat drug trafficking. The establishment of the Tajikistani Drug Control Agency, with assistance from UNODC, is another noteworthy measure to address the issue. Despite these efforts, drug money continues to corrupt the Tajikistani government, with known personalities involved in both the civil war and current governmental positions suspected of participating in the drug trade. This complicates the country’s ongoing fight against illegal drug-trafficking. In conclusion, the preferred drug of the folks in Tajikistan is primarily opiates, including heroin and raw opium, due to their availability and the country’s role as a transit hub for Afghan narcotics. While significant progress has been made in combating drug trafficking and production, the pervasive corruption fueled by drug money remains a substantial challenge to overcome in order to effectively address the issue."},{"prompt":"Dear Malia and Sasha, I know that you've both had a lot of fun these last two years on the campaign trail, going to picnics and parades and state fairs, eating all sorts of junk food your mother and I probably shouldn't have let you have.

The center of an atom is held together by powerful forces. This gives them a huge amount of stored energy. This type of energy is called nuclear energy. This energy can be released and used to do work. This happens in nuclear power plants where they split apart the nucleus of an atom. This splitting apart is called nuclear fission. Another type of nuclear energy happens in the Sun. Here the atoms nuclei are not split apart. Instead, the nuclei of the atoms are fused, or joined together. This process is called nuclear fusion. Some of the suns energy travels to Earth. This energy from nuclear fusion warms the planet and provides the energy for photosynthesis.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose monument says they died at 51?, using the article: In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish..., what would be the answer ?

Pack A is from before September 2012, and pack B is from after September 2012. He started searching on the internet to find out why the packs were different. Which pack would induce more awareness of smoking health risks, pack A or pack B? A:","completion":"Pack B would generally induce more awareness of smoking health risks as compared to Pack A. The reason for this lies in the changing regulations and growing awareness over the years, which have led to more stringent measures for depicting health warnings on cigarette packs. From September 2012 onward, many countries around the world have progressively increased the size, prominence, and graphic content of health warnings on cigarette packs to create more awareness regarding the hazards associated with smoking. For instance, in the European Union, the Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) was revised in 2014 and came into force in May 2016. This directive mandated that health warnings on cigarette packs must cover at least 65% of the front and back of the package, be placed at the top edge, and consist of a combination of text, color photographs, and cessation information. Additional warnings, such as \\"smoking kills\\" or \\"smoking seriously harms you and others around you,\\" were also made compulsory. Similarly, in the United States, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (2009) granted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate tobacco products, including the requirement of more explicit health warnings on cigarette packs. Although the introduction of graphic health warnings was stalled due to legal challenges, the FDA launched its first-ever public education campaign, \\"The Real Cost,\\" in 2014 to spread awareness about smoking's harmful effects through various multimedia platforms, including print, TV, and social media. Furthermore, countries like Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom have implemented plain packaging laws that not only increase the space dedicated to health warnings but also remove branding elements, such as logos and colors, from cigarette packs. This further enhances the visibility of health warnings and reduces the appeal of smoking. Therefore, Pack B, being from the period after September 2012, would have been subject to stricter regulatory measures in many countries, and these would have led to stronger health warnings on the packs. Consequently, it would be more likely to induce greater awareness of smoking health risks as compared to Pack A, which would have carried comparatively fewer and less impactful health warnings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I mean, you and I having this conversation has answered that question. About whether you want to run? Sure. I mean, I wouldn’t be this far into the process … The issue of, Is this what I want to do? was dealt with about 45 days ago in a conversation with my wife. Prior to that, no.

He was as strong on crime as any big-city mayor has ever been. He and I were 180 degrees [apart] on social issues, but he would put strict constructionists on the Supreme Court, which dealt with those social issues. I happen to be comfortable that I was making the right decision and that as President, when it comes to those social issues, it’s very important to have that strict constructionist view from whom you put on the Supreme Court.

Updated, 4:51 p.m. ||||| 6 years ago Washington (CNN) - As Rick Perry moves closer and closer to a run for the White House, a new national survey indicates that the longtime Texas governor is close to the top of the pack in the hunt for the Republican presidential nomination. According to a CNN/ORC International poll, 15 percent of Republicans and independents who lean towards the GOP pick Perry as their first choice for their party's nomination, just two points behind former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who's making his second bid for the White House. Romney's two point margin over Perry is within the survey's sampling error. Read full results (pdf). The poll's Thursday release comes two days before Perry gives a speech at a major conservative gathering in South Carolina where he is expected to announce his run for the White House. Later in the day Perry travels to New Hampshire to meet with GOP lawmakers, activists, and voters. Perry's travels Saturday come as the rest of the political spotlight will be shining on Iowa, for a crucial presidential straw poll in Ames. Perry heads to Iowa Sunday to speak at a Republican party gathering, which means he will visit three of the crucial early voting primary and caucus states this weekend. The survey indicates that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, who is making his third bid for the White House, are at 12 percent apiece. While both Giuliani, who ran for the presidency four years ago, and Palin, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2008, have flirted with bids, neither has taken concrete steps towards launching a campaign. According to the poll, Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota has the support of seven percent, with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at five percent, both former Godfather's Pizza CEO and radio talk show host Herman Cain and former Utah Gov. and former U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman at four percent, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania at two percent. Former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson and Rep. Thad McCotter of Michigan both register at less than one half of one percent. If the choices are pared down to exclude Giuliani and Palin, Romney remains at the top of the list, with 23 percent, followed by Perry at 18 percent and Paul at 14 percent. The survey indicates Bachmann at nine percent, Gingrich one point back, Cain and Huntsman at five percent, Pawlenty and Santorum at three percent and Johnson and McCotter both registering at less than one half of one percent. According to the poll, the GOP candidates and potential candidates match up differently against President Barack Obama in hypothetical 2012 general election showdowns. Giuliani has a 51-45 percent advantage over Obama among registered voters, while Romney matches up evenly against the President - 49 percent for Obama and 48 percent for Romney. But the survey indicates Obama appears to have a slight edge over Bachmann (51-45 percent) and Perry (51-46 percent) and Obama has a lead over Palin (55-41 percent). The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International on August 5-7, with 1,008 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points. - CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report. Read an opinion article about Perry's run for the White House here. ||||| TheWashingtonPost Perry begins to fill in the blanks Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) is about to take the plunge into the presidential race. There are, as with any candidate who’s not well known on the national stage, multiple questions. Can he debate? Does he have some policy chops? Does he have answers to inevitable questions about missteps as governor? He tried to address some of those head-on in an interview with Time’s Mark Halperin. That in and of itself is an interesting choice. He didn’t kick off with Fox or with a talk radio host; he is trying to, from the get-go, begin to shape an image for the national media and the general electorate. That shows some confidence (he can win the base) and some recognition that his electability is a legitimate concern for primary voters. Three things struck me about the interview. First, he was crystal-clear and bold on national security: The idea that the President would make this statement about going back to the ’67 borders sent a chill down all of my friends’ back and certainly mine. Israel is our friend. Israel is a democracy in the middle of a part of the world where having a democracy is really important. Our friends, if I am blessed to become the President of the United States, will know that we will be there day in and day out. I think the most important thing that we can do from a foreign policy standpoint is to be strong economically. Because if we’re not strong economically, we cannot have the resources to be strong militarily. And if we’re not strong militarily then our foreign policy becomes haphazard at best, because countries look at the United States and go, “Well we’ll do what we please because you don’t have the for with all to sent a message that we’re going to be strong militarily. Plainly he’s not going the neo-isolationist road. If Tim Pawlenty (arguably the most hawkish of the current contenders) falters, Perry will, if he deepens his understanding and fills out an agenda, be in a strong position to attack President Obama on national security. And, to the extent that other GOP contenders hesitate or equivocate on issues such as Afghanistan, Perry can capi­tal­ize. Second, he made clear he’s not going to run an outwardly anti-Bush campaign. The rivalry between the Perry and Bush camps is well known, and at times Perry has explicitly criticized George H.W. Bush . (“Bush, or ‘George,’ as Perry called him, was no fiscal conservative — ‘never was’ — and his work on tort reform, a subject dear to Republican hearts, paled next to Perry’s achievements, the governor said.”) But in his Time interview Perry suggested he’s not going to advance his cause by stoking anti-Bush animus in some ranks of the GOP. “If there are people that were on his team [in] the past that haven’t agreed on policy or picked a different horse in a political race—you look back over my political career, and if I chastised and removed everyone who’s been on the other side of me in a political race I wouldn’t have any friends or helpers.” That’s a frank admission that he can’t afford to pick intra-party fights. And finally, Perry, as his advisers have privately suggested, seems ready for a hard pivot to economic issues. Asked about his appeal beyond social conservatives he answered: Texas is somewhat of a microcosm of the rest of the country, particularly in this first decade of the 21st century. We are very, very cosmopolitan, if you will, very urban, but we have our rural areas. We have an incredible diversity of people [who] live in this state. This is not the Texas of my father. It is a very diverse state. Running for the governorship of the state of Texas, I recognized all the diversity of thought. So, what’s the most important thing that’s facing this country? It’s getting this economy back. I am a pro-business governor. I will be a pro-business President if this does, in fact, ensue and I’m blessed to be elected President of the United States — unabashedly [so] because the fact of the matter is, there’s nothing more important than having an environment created by government that allows for the private sector to risk its capital to know that they have a good chance of having a return on the investment. And in defending his past support for pro-choice Rudy Giuliani, he said: Mayor Giuliani did a wonderful job of managing a city. He was very strong militarily. He was as strong on crime as any big city Mayor has ever been. He and I were 180 degrees on social issues, but he would put strict constructionists on the Supreme Court, which dealt with those social issues. I happen to be comfortable that I was making the right decisions and that as President, when it comes to those social issues, it’s very important to have that strict constructionist view of who you put on the Supreme Court. Because they’d look at the Constitution and say, you know what, that issue dealing with abortion is not in the Constitution. We will put it back to the states. Now if the states want to pass an amendment and three quarters of the states want to pass an amendment to make this be a change of our United States Constitution, then just follow that process. And I’m a big believer that that’s how our country should work. It’ not exactly clear from this whether he’d be content to leave abortion to the states, but it is his most articulate statement on the issue to date. Beginning Saturday the bright, hot light of the national media and the other campaigns will begin to scrutinize, investigate and criticize every utterance and item in his record. If he can withstand that, there’s certainly room for him to rise to the top of the pack. But, there is also the distinct possibility that the best day of his campaign will be the first. Unless he is serious, prepared, humble enough to take guidance and able to quickly recover from inevitable missteps, that will certainly be the case. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Texas Governor Rick Perry is set to announce his bid for the Republican presidential nomination on Saturday in South Carolina.

I got my first speeding ticket when I was a teenager . I got my second speeding ticket when I was in my twenties - ironically , trying to keep up with a priest on our way to a church conference . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question What did this event teach me ?","completion":"This event seems to have taught you several important lessons about respect for the law, personal responsibility, attention, and self-discipline. Firstly, it highlighted the necessity of adhering to speed limits and respecting traffic guidelines. These laws are put in place to maintain safety on the roads, for your protection and the protection of other drivers, pedestrians and cyclists. Speeding can put everyone in danger, and this speeding ticket showed that no one is exempt from these laws, regardless of their intentions or distractions. Secondly, it emphasized the importance of accepting personal responsibility for your actions. When you received the ticket, you admitted that you were, in fact, speeding and too distracted to notice the speed trap. You didn't try to deny or justify your actions, which shows growth and understanding that your actions have consequences, hence you accepted the ticket calmly as deserved. Thirdly, this event taught you how essential it is to be mindful and attentive while driving. Distracted driving is one of the most frequent causes of accidents on the road. Your distraction led you not only to exceed the speed limit but also to overlook the speed trap. This awareness could inspire you to commit to being more present and focused while driving in the future. Lastly, you learned that it's important to exercise self-discipline and resist the urge to speed, even if it feels necessary in the moment or others are doing so. Your justification for your second speeding ticket – trying to keep up with a priest – may have felt valid at the time, but the law applies to everyone equally. It's crucial to resist the pressure of other road users, maintain safe and legal speeds, and always strive to be a safe and responsible driver. In conclusion, these experiences have provided valuable lessons about the importance of respecting traffic laws, staying focused while driving, taking personal responsibility for your actions, and not succumbing to pressure or distractions that could lead to unsafe driving habits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Going on holiday makes you feel good while you're there-you gain the health benefits for months, new research shows. Jetting off to exotic destinations such as the Maldives cuts your blood pressure, helps you sleep better and bounce back from stress, it found. The benefits last at least a fortnight longer than the vacation and can be felt for months in some cases where it is claimed. Experts say workers should always take their full holiday entitlement each year-as many as one in three don't-to get the benefits. The study compared key health markers in holidaymakers visiting Thailand, Peru or the Maldives, with people who stayed at home and continued working. The average blood pressure of those on holiday dropped by 6% while the workers saw their blood pressure rise by 2% over the same period. The sleep quality of holiday-makers improved by 17% while that of the non-holidaymakers _ by 14%. The study also found the ability of vacationers to recover from stress--known as the stress-resilience test-improved by 29%. There was a 71% fall in stress resilience scores among workers. Test showed a fall in blood glucose levels, reducing the risk of diabetes, trimmer waistlines and enhanced mood and energy levels, with the effects sustained for at least 2 weeks after returning home. The Holiday Health Experiment was conducted by tour operator Kuoni and Nuffield Health, the UK's largest healthcare charity. Question: Which of the following can we infer from the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Holiday makers are more adaptable than non-holidaymakers.\\"? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, holidaymakers are more adaptable than non-holidaymakers. This can be inferred from the passage due to the various improvements in health and well-being experienced by those who went on holiday, compared to those who continued working. The study mentioned in the article compared key health markers in holidaymakers visiting Thailand, Peru, or the Maldives with people who stayed at home and continued working. Among the observed benefits for holidaymakers were lower blood pressure, better sleep quality, and improved ability to bounce back from stress (known as the stress-resilience test). In contrast, those who did not go on holiday experienced a rise in blood pressure, a decrease in sleep quality, and a 71% fall in stress resilience scores. Furthermore, the benefits of going on holiday were not just limited to the vacation period; they persisted at least two weeks after people returned home, with some effects lasting for even longer. This suggests that taking time off from work to go on vacation helps individuals recover from stress and maintain a healthier, more balanced lifestyle. Experts advised that workers should take full advantage of their holiday entitlement each year, as many as one in three employees do not fully utilize their allocated time off. This is essential for enjoying the numerous health and well-being benefits associated with taking vacations, such as reduced risk of diabetes, trimmer waistlines, and enhanced mood and energy levels. Overall, the article suggests that holidaymakers can indeed be considered more adaptable than non-holidaymakers, as they experience significant improvements in health and well-being that persist beyond the duration of their vacations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Increasingly drastic weather patterns and concerns over global warming are being scrutinized by the Pentagon, defense officials said in a plan released Monday. (Osakabe Yasuo/ U.S. Air Force) Drastic weather, rising seas and changing storm patterns could become “threat multipliers” for the United States, vastly complicating security challenges faced by American forces, the Pentagon said in a new report on the impact of climate change released Monday. The report, described as a “climate change adaptation roadmap,” included a foreword from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in which he urged the nation’s military’s planners to grapple now with the implications of a warming planet, even as scientists are “converging toward consensus on future climate projections.” “Politics or ideology must not get in the way of sound planning,” Hagel said. “Our armed forces must prepare for a future with a wide spectrum of possible threats, weighing risks and probabilities to ensure that we will continue to keep our country secure.” The plan was released as Hagel attended a conference in Peru with his counterparts from across North and South America. In remarks released alongside the 20-page report, Hagel said the Pentagon is nearly done with a survey that will assess the vulnerability of its military installations to climate change. He cited the Hampton Roads region of Virginia as an example of an area that has both military bases and recurrent flooding, adding that defense officials are developing plans to address a projected sea-level rise of about 1.5 feet in the next 20 to 50 years. The Defense Department developed a climate change working group in 2012. The Pentagon must assess the potential effects of the phenomenon on the frequency of disaster relief missions, additional military operations in the Arctic and instability within and among other countries, the new climate change plan says. “The Department will need to monitor these developments and decide which situations will require intervention based on U.S. security interests — either preemptively through security cooperation and capacity building, or with stability measures once conditions escalate,” the plan says. It isn’t the first time the military has examined the potential effects on climate change. The Navy, for example, released a climate change “roadmap” in April 2010, saying that while climate change probably wouldn’t lead to conflict on its own, “it may be a contributing factor.” Hagel also released a new Defense Department strategy for the Arctic last year, identifying climate change and rising seas as key issues in changes there. The new report suggests broader cooperation and emphasis on the issue. Hagel said the Defense Department will work with the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, among other organizations. He also said the United States must work with other nations. “Climate change is a global problem,” the secretary said. “Its impacts do not respect national borders. No nation can deal with it alone. We must work together, building joint capabilities to deal with these emerging threats.” ||||| Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel addressed the Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas on Monday, unveiling a comprehensive plan for how the U.S. military will address the effects of climate change. Rising global temperatures, increasing sea levels and intensifying weather events will challenge global stability, he said, and could lead to food and water shortages, pandemic disease and disputes over refugees and resources. The Pentagon’s “2014 Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap” describes how global warming will bring new demands on the military. Among the report's conclusions: Coastal military installations that are vulnerable to flooding will need to be altered; humanitarian assistance missions will be more frequent in the face of more intense natural disasters; weapons and other critical military equipment will need to work under more severe weather conditions. “This road map shows how we are identifying -- with tangible and specific metrics, and using the best available science -- the effects of climate change on the department’s missions and responsibilities,” Hagel said. “Drawing on these assessments, we will integrate climate change considerations into our planning, operations, and training.” Claudio Reyes / AFP/Getty Images U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reviews an honor guard upon his arrival Saturday at the presidential palace in Santiago, Chile. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reviews an honor guard upon his arrival Saturday at the presidential palace in Santiago, Chile. (Claudio Reyes / AFP/Getty Images) It’s necessary to work with regional partners to address the risks posed by climate change, he said. The U.S. military has completed a joint assessment with officials from Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, and Trinidad and Tobago on the implications. “If we don’t do anything to address the effects of climate change, there will be nothing left,” Peruvian President Ollanta Humala said in the opening remarks of the defense summit. The Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas is the culmination of Hagel's six-day trip through South America, talking with top leaders in Colombia, Chile and Peru. The conference, which brings together 34 nations, began Monday and ends Tuesday. Military officials from each of the countries gathered into a posh resort here in the high Andes in the southern Peruvian city of Arequipa. Defense ministers in staid business suits, military officials wearing colorful uniforms, and journalists from throughout North, South and Central America huddled into a pool-side enclosed pavilion to discuss matters that face the region. “I recognize that our militaries play different roles and have different responsibilities in each of our nations,” Hagel said. “I also recognize that climate change will have different impacts in different parts of the hemisphere. But there are many opportunities to work together.” The United Nations is holding an event in Peru in December to discuss climate change. Hagel called on defense leaders to be part of the discussion because climate change is a \\"threat multiplier\\" that can intensify the world’s current problems, such as infectious diseases and terrorism. “We must be clear-eyed about the security threats presented by climate change, and we must be pro-active in addressing them,” he said.

The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal.

I met his personal valet from the white house mess, Oscar, and he casually said, if you are ever in DC…. To which I replied, I sure can be! My husband and I made the trip a month or so later, we met up with Oscar for dinner on our first night there. We had just started planning all we wanted to see as it was our first visit there. We had no idea that Oscar would invite us for not one but two private tours of the White House. We saw the oval office, the situation room, the rose garden, the mess, the press room and the OEOB. We even heard Buddy bark! It was a trip I knew I’d never be able to repeat and was very grateful to have had the chance to take.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency investigating drinking water contamination in Pavillion, Wyoming, found benzene and methane in wells and in groundwater, agency officials said. At a community meeting with well owners, EPA officials revealed Tuesday they found low levels of petroleum compounds in 17 of 19 drinking water wells sampled, and that nearby shallow groundwater was contaminated with high levels of petroleum compounds such as benzene, according to the report. The affected well owners were advised not to drink the water at the recommendation of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and told to use alternate sources of water for drinking and cooking, agency officials said. Meanwhile, the EPA is working with various government partners and EnCana, a natural gas company, to provide affected residents with water and to address potential sources of the contamination, agency officials said. The study included sampling 21 domestic wells within the area of concern, two municipal wells, plus sediment and water from a nearby creek. The EPA also sampled groundwater and soil from pit remediation sites, and produced water and condensate from five production wells operated by the primary natural gas operator in the area, agency officials said. No health concerns were found related to inhalation exposure to chemicals while showering or using evaporative coolers, agency officials said. The EPA has not reached any conclusions about the sources of chemical compounds found in drinking water wells, including hydraulic fracturing, or \\"fracking,\\" the controversial process used to extract natural gas from underground, agency officials said. Officials are uncertain if the contaminated shallow groundwater will migrate to the drinking water aquifer, according to the report. \\"EPA will work as long as necessary to ensure that Pavillion residents have safe water,\\" Jim Martin, EPA's regional administrator in Denver, said in a statement released Tuesday. \\"While our investigation continues, EPA has secured commitments from our partners to identify alternate sources of water for affected homes and to evaluate long-term solutions.\\" In addition to detecting several petroleum hydrocarbons, the EPA found a number of \\"inorganic constituents\\" such as sodium and sulfates in drinking and groundwater wells, according to the report. In spring 2008, residents of Pavillion -- concerned about the quality of their drinking water -- contacted the EPA in Denver, Colorado. The agency sampled 39 individual wells (37 residential wells and two municipal wells) in March 2009 and found nitrate, arsenic and methane gas. The agency conducted the second sampling in January 2010.

Based on the premise \\"Core competencies and supporting behaviors\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Whether or not an employee has a college degree.\\" is true?","completion":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"Whether or not an employee has a college degree\\" based on the premise \\"core competencies and supporting behaviors,\\" we must first understand the definitions of these terms and their individual implications. Core competencies refer to a crucial set of skills, abilities, and knowledge necessary for successful job performance in any given industry or profession. These competencies can be both hard skills such as technical expertise, and soft skills like leadership, communication, and problem-solving. Supporting behaviors, on the other hand, are the actions and activities that demonstrate and reinforce the presence of these core competencies in an individual employee. Now, to address the hypothesis, the question arises – can an employee's possession of a college degree serve as an indicator of their core competencies and supporting behaviors? While a college degree can provide valuable insight into an individual's knowledge base and skill set in their chosen field, it is important to acknowledge that it is not a definitive or exclusive representation of their core competencies and supporting behaviors. Numerous factors contribute to an individual's capabilities, including relevant work experience, training, certifications, and personal attributes or character qualities. Consider the following reasons why a college degree may not always be directly correlated with core competencies and supporting behaviors: 1. Practical experience: In some cases, an employee may have gained extensive practical experience and developed core competencies through on-the-job training or work placements, even without a college degree. Such individuals may still demonstrate aptitudes that enable them to excel in their respective roles. 2. Skill development: A degree might provide foundational knowledge in a field, but ongoing skill development is necessary to stay relevant in the ever-evolving job market. These skills might be acquired through personal development, workshops, or additional certifications. 3. Soft skills: College degrees often highlight an individual's hard skills and technical knowledge. However, soft skills, such as teamwork, adaptability, and emotional intelligence, are equally essential core competencies that may not be explicitly demonstrated through a college degree. 4. Diverse learning pathways: With the rise of online learning platforms and alternative educational programs, individuals can acquire new skills and knowledge without necessarily pursuing traditional college degrees. 5. College major: The relevance of a college degree to a specific job may vary depending on the chosen major. Not all roles require a direct connection to the degree, and sometimes, transferrable skills from other disciplines could be sufficient to meet the core competencies of a position. In conclusion, it is essential to consider an array of elements when assessing an employee's core competencies and supporting behaviors. While having a college degree can be indicative of possessing certain knowledge and skills, it is not a conclusive factor in determining an individual's level of competency or capability. Other factors, such as practical experience, professional development, and personal qualities, should also be considered when trying to ascertain whether an employee has the required core competencies and supporting behaviors to excel in their role."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What facet of evolution by natural selection did Darwin focus on in his work that was presented to the Linnean Society? Context: Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation. Answer:","completion":"In his work presented to the Linnean Society, Darwin focused on the facet of evolution by natural selection that emphasized competition between individuals, using an analogy to the artificial selection practiced by animal breeders.

Information: - Piracetam (sold under many brand names) is a nootropic drug in the racetams group, with chemical name \\"2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide\\". It shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with pyroglutamic acid. Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of GABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid). Presently piracetam is used in many European countries, Asia and South America. In the United States, it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for any medical use and it is not permitted to be sold as a dietary supplement. In the UK, piracetam is prescribed mainly for myoclonus, but is used off-label for other conditions. Evidence to support its use for many conditions is unclear. - Levetiracetam, marketed under the trade name Keppra among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy. It is used for partial onset, myoclonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It is the S-enantiomer of etiracetam. - Phenylpiracetam (INN: fonturacetam, brand names Phenotropil, Carphedon), also called is a phenylated analog of the drug piracetam which was developed in 1983 in Russia where it is available as a prescription drug. Research on animals has indicated that phenylpiracetam may have anti-amnesic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, and memory enhancement effects. - Anticonvulsants (also commonly known as antiepileptic drugs or as antiseizure drugs) are a diverse group of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. Anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, since many seem to act as mood stabilizers, and for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Anticonvulsants suppress the rapid and excessive firing of neurons during seizures. Anticonvulsants also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain. Some investigators have observed that anticonvulsants themselves may cause reduced IQ in children. However these adverse effects must be balanced against the significant risk epileptic seizures pose to children and the distinct possibility of death and devastating neurological sequelae secondary to seizures. Anticonvulsants are more accurately called antiepileptic drugs (abbreviated \\"AEDs\\"), and are often referred to as antiseizure drugs because they provide symptomatic treatment only and have not been demonstrated to alter the course of epilepsy. - Etiracetam is a chemical compound belonging to the racetam family, which was developed as a nootropic drug. It is racemic; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam, now marketed as an antiepileptic drug. - Stimulants (also referred to as psychostimulants) is an overarching term that covers many drugs including those that increase activity of the body, drugs that are pleasurable and invigorating, or drugs that have sympathomimetic effects. Due to their rendering a characteristic \\"up\\" feeling, stimulants are also occasionally referred to as \\"uppers\\". Depressants or \\"downers\\", which decrease mental and/or physical function, are in stark contrast to stimulants and are considered to be the functionally opposite drug class. Stimulants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines as well as without a prescription (either legally or illicitly) as performance-enhancing or recreational drugs. The most frequently prescribed stimulants as of 2013 were lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and amphetamine. It is estimated that the percent of the population that has abused amphetamines, cocaine and MDMA combined is between .8% and 2.1%. - Motivation is a theoretical construct used to explain behaviour. It gives the reasons for people's actions, desires, and needs. Motivation can also be defined as one's direction to behavior, or what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior and vice versa. A motive is what prompts the person to act in a certain way, or at least develop an inclination for specific behavior. According to Maehr and Meyer, \\"Motivation is a word that is part of the popular culture as few other psychological concepts are.\\" - Nootropicsalso called smart drugs or cognitive enhancersare drugs, supplements, or other substances that improve cognitive function, particularly executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation, in healthy individuals. The use of cognition-enhancing drugs by healthy individuals in the absence of a medical indication is one of the most debated topics among neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and physicians which spans a number of issues, including the ethics and fairness of their use, concerns over adverse effects, and the diversion of prescription drugs for nonmedical uses, among others. Nonetheless, the international sales of cognition-enhancing supplements exceeded billion in 2015 and the global demand for these compounds is still growing rapidly. - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery. - Epilepsy is a group of neurological diseases characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur, and have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition. The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, and birth defects. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition. Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are controllable with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed. As of 2013 about 22 million people have epilepsy. Nearly 80% of cases occur in the developing world. In 2013 it resulted in 116,000 deaths up from 112,000 deaths in 1990. Epilepsy is more common in older people. In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the... - A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue, causes a physiological change in the body. - Oxiracetam (ISF 2522) is a nootropic drug of the racetam family and very mild stimulant. Several studies suggest that the substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time. However, the mechanism of action of the racetam drug family is still a matter of research. Oxiracetam is not approved by Food and Drug Administration for any medical use in the United States. - Executive functions (collectively referred to as executive function and cognitive control) are a set of cognitive processes including attentional control, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, as well as reasoning, problem solving, and planning that are necessary for the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions gradually develop and change across the lifespan of an individual and can be improved at any time over the course of a person's life. Similarly, these cognitive processes can be adversely affected by a variety of events which affect an individual. Neuropsychological tests are used to measure executive functions, and are usually performed as part of a more comprehensive assessment to diagnose neurological and psychiatric disorders. - Racetams are a class of drugs that share a pyrrolidone nucleus. Some, such as piracetam, are considered nootropics. Some such as oxiracetam and phenylpiracetam are also stimulants. Others such as levetiracetam and seletracetam are anticonvulsants. - Etiracetam is a nootropic drug of the racetam family . It is racemic ; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam . - Seletracetam (UCB 44212) is a pyrrolidone-derived drug of the racetam family that is structurally related to levetiracetam (trade name Keppra). It was under development by UCB Pharmaceuticals as a more potent and effective anticonvulsant drug to replace levetiracetam but its production has been halted. - In chemistry, an enantiomer, also known as an optical isomer, is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one's left and right hands are the same except for being reversed along one axis (the hands cannot be made to appear identical simply by reorientation). Organic compounds that contain a chiral carbon atom usually have two non-superposable structures.

Q:Process: - The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery - They process it with millions of tiny nephrons - Remove all the waste - The kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery - Send the urine with the waste to the bladder through the ureters. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more recycling is placed in recycling containers happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you propose involves increased recycling activities in recycling containers and its potential impact on the removal of waste from the body, specifically through the kidneys. To analyze this hypothesis, it is important to understand the primary function of the kidneys and the process by which they remove waste from the body. The kidneys play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis by filtering and cleaning blood. They receive blood through the renal artery, which branches into millions of tiny nephrons. Each nephron contains a filtering unit called a glomerulus and a tubule. As blood passes through the glomerulus, waste products, water, and electrolytes are filtered out while essential nutrients, proteins, and blood cells remain in the blood. The filtrate, or the fluid containing the waste products, then continues through the nephron's tubule, where it is further processed. In the tubule, necessary minerals, glucose, and water are reabsorbed into the bloodstream, while excess solutes and waste materials are processed to form urine. The cleaned blood then returns to the body through the renal vein, and the waste-laden urine is transported to the bladder through the ureters to be eventually excreted from the body. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis in question. The hypothesis suggests that if more recycling takes place within recycling containers, there would be less waste removed from the body. To analyze the impact of this perturbation, we need to determine if the recycling containers being referred to in the context of this hypothesis have a direct or indirect effect on the process of waste removal in the kidneys. Recycling containers, as commonly understood, refer to the physical bins or receptacles where waste materials, like paper, plastic, glass, and metals, are placed for subsequent processing and repurposing. These containers are part of environmental waste management practices and play an important role in reducing pollution and resource consumption. The recycling process does not have a direct impact on the kidneys' waste removal capability, as the functions of the kidney and recycling containers are separate and distinct. Although the perturbation hypothesis might seem unrelated at first glance, the potential indirect effect could lie in how waste management practices influence overall health and the environment. Better waste management, including increased recycling, contributes to a healthier, cleaner environment, ultimately benefiting human health. This could aid in reducing environmental factors that contribute to kidney disease and other health conditions. However, this indirect effect is distant and does not directly impact the kidney's ability to filter and remove waste efficiently. In summary, the proposed perturbation of more recycling in recycling containers does not have a direct effect on the process of waste removal from the body through the kidneys. While it might have some distant indirect effects on overall health and environmental conditions, the kidneys' primary waste removal function remains unaffected by changes in recycling practices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:SEOUL — South Korea is looking into developing and financing economic projects with North Korea that could take effect if a nuclear deal is reached with the United States. South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said on Wednesday the government was “internally carrying out preparations” to organize, finance and implement possible inter-Korea projects. But he also emphasized that Seoul would first seek support from the international community for any North Korean development projects, and would only proceed if the U.S. -North Korea summit, expected to be held in late May or June, produces a joint denuclearization agreement. North Korea is under tough sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council for its nuclear weapons and missiles tests, including accelerated efforts in the last two years to develop a long-range nuclear missile that could potentially target the U.S. mainland. The international sanctions ban an estimated 90 percent of the country’s external trade. Seeking sanctions relief is considered a key motivating factor in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s diplomatic pivot this year to suspend further provocative missile and nuclear tests, and to engage in talks to dismantle his nuclear arsenal. But easing sanctions would make it more difficult to enforce the North’s denuclearization promises. “Once the sanctions are lifted, North Korea will gain autonomy over its trade, and considering its low labor costs and skilled workforce, I think the North Korean economy would gain power again,” said Shin Beom-chul, the director of Center for Security and Unification at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump has insisted he will keep sanctions in place until North Korea completely dismantles its nuclear program. South Korea, however, is considering a range of economic incentives to encourage Kim to follow through on a nuclear deal with Trump. But these investments are prohibited by the U.N. sanctions and would require a Security Council exemption to proceed. At the recent... Question: What is Kim Jung Un wearing to the summit?

Liberia was a major exporter of iron ore on the world market. In the 1970s and 1980s, iron mining accounted for more than half of Liberia's export earnings. Since the coup d'état of 1980, the country's economic growth rate has slowed down because of a decline in the demand for iron ore on the world market and political upheavals in Liberia. Following a peak in growth in 1979, the Liberian economy began a steady decline due to economic mismanagement following the 1980 coup. This decline was accelerated by the outbreak of civil war in 1989; GDP was reduced by an estimated 90% between 1989 and 1995, one of the fastest declines in history. The United Nations imposed sanctions on Liberia in May 2001 for its support to the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front in neighboring Sierra Leone. These sanctions have been lifted following elections in 2005. Upon the end of the war in 2003, GDP growth began to accelerate, reaching 9.4% in 2007. The global financial crisis slowed GDP growth to 4.6% in 2009, though a strengthening agricultural sector led by rubber and timber exports increased growth to 5.1% in 2010 and an expected 7.3% in 2011, making the economy one of the 20 fastest growing in the world. In March 2010, Bob Johnson, founder of BET, funded the first hotel constructed in Liberia in 20 years. The 13-acre luxury resort was built in the Paynesville section of Monrovia. Liberia's external debt was estimated in 2006 at approximately 4.5 billion, 800% of GDP. As a result of bilateral, multilateral and commercial debt relief from 2007 to 2010, the country's external debt fell to 222.9 million by 2011.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"GLONASS (Globalnaya Navigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema) and GPS (Global Positioning System) are both satellite-based navigation systems that help determine the precise location, speed, and time for users on or near the Earth's surface. They differ in terms of the countries that developed them, the satellites they use, and their overall performance. While both systems serve similar functions, the two have distinct features that set them apart. GLONASS was developed by the Russian Federation, and it became fully operational in 1995. The system currently consists of 24 satellites orbiting the Earth at an altitude of approximately 19,130 kilometers. These satellites cover the globe in three orbital planes, with eight satellites in each plane. Due to its origin, the GLONASS system offers better navigational coverage in the northern latitudes, particularly in Russia. GPS, on the other hand, was developed by the United States Department of Defense and became fully operational in 1995 as well. The GPS system employs 31 active satellites orbiting the Earth at an altitude of approximately 20,200 kilometers, distributed among six orbital planes. This results in better global coverage, especially at and near the equator. While both systems have their advantages, there are a few key differences to consider when comparing GLONASS and GPS: 1. Accuracy: In general, GPS is considered to have better position accuracy due to its more advanced error-correction techniques. However, in certain locations with obstructed views of the sky, such as urban canyons or areas with dense vegetation, the combined use of both GPS and GLONASS can improve positioning accuracy. 2. Coverage: As mentioned earlier, GLONASS performs better in the northern latitudes (especially in Russia), while GPS offers better global coverage overall. Combining the two systems can provide improved coverage and reception in areas where either system might have limited satellite visibility. 3. Signal Frequency: GPS and GLONASS operate on different frequency bands, which helps reduce signal interference. This difference allows for better signal reception and improved positional information for dual-system receivers. 4. Time to First Fix (TTFF): Both GLONASS and GPS are relatively quick to provide location fixes. However, GLONASS has been reported to have slightly faster TTFF due to the system's higher satellite inclination and broader orbital planes. This can potentially mean quicker position calculations for users. Now, returning to your inquiries about which system is better and whether the questions are the same, it depends on the angle from which you approach the subject. While the questions seem similar on the surface, they elicit different information. The first question asks for a comparison of the two systems' features, whereas the following question requests a determination of superiority between GLONASS and GPS. In conclusion, both GLONASS and GPS offer navigation capabilities, with some differences in accuracy, coverage, and other aspects. For most users, the differences between the systems may not be very noticeable, and using a device that can access both satellite systems simultaneously is the best way to maximize positioning accuracy and coverage. Therefore, it can be said that these questions are similar, yet they explore different aspects of the comparison."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the below context: Unlucky Bernie Lootz has little positive going for him: he lives in a dreary place—a studio apartment in a run-down motel near the Las Vegas Strip; he can't recall the last time he had physical contact with a woman; he's indebted to the Shangri-La casino boss Shelly Kaplow, who years earlier cured him of a gambling habit by breaking his kneecap. Kaplow had also paid Lootz's casino debts, and Bernie has been working off that large debt to Shelly for several years and the debt is nearly paid off. Lootz is weary of the casino business, and tells Kaplow he is leaving Las Vegas soon. His future success as a luck \\"cooler\\" is changed when cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario seemingly takes an interest in him, and his luck—and that of those around him—takes a turn for the better. What Bernie doesn't know yet is that Shelly has paid Natalie to seduce him into staying and working at the Shangri-La. What Shelly doesn't know is that Natalie actually has fallen in love with Bernie, and vice versa. Additional complications arise when Shelly, a relative old-timer who resents the Disneyfication of Vegas, resists the efforts of new Shangri-La owner advisers, including Ivy League graduate and condescending upstart Larry Sokolov, to update the casino hotel property and bring it into the 21st century. Lootz also learns his seldom-seen adult son is back in town, and, with his wife, is interfering with the operations at the Shangri-La. Though Shelly still has the backing of certain mob associates, such as gangster Nicky Fingers, the growing power of the new young Ivy League casino owners is lessening his power grip on the casino and the business he truly loves.

Elgar's recordings were released on 78-rpm discs by both HMV and RCA Victor. After World War II, the 1932 recording of the Violin Concerto with the teenage Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on LP, but the other recordings were out of the catalogues for some years. When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death. The recordings were reissued on CD in the 1990s.In November 1931, Elgar was filmed by Pathé for a newsreel depicting a recording session of Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 at the opening of EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. It is believed to be the only surviving sound film of Elgar, who makes a brief remark before conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, asking the musicians to \\"play this tune as though you've never heard it before.\\" A memorial plaque to Elgar at Abbey Road was unveiled on 24 June 1993.A late piece of Elgar's, the Nursery Suite, was an early example of a studio premiere: its first performance was in the Abbey Road studios. For this work, dedicated to the wife and daughters of the Duke of York, Elgar once again drew on his youthful sketch-books. In his final years, Elgar experienced a musical revival. The BBC organised a festival of his works to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, in 1932. He flew to Paris in 1933 to conduct the Violin Concerto for Menuhin. While in France, he visited his fellow composer Frederick Delius at his house at Grez-sur-Loing. He was sought out by younger musicians such as Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent and John Barbirolli, who championed his music when it was out of fashion. He began work on an opera, The Spanish Lady, and accepted a commission from the BBC to compose a Third Symphony. His final illness, however, prevented their completion. He fretted about the unfinished works. He asked Reed to ensure that nobody would \\"tinker\\" with the sketches and attempt a completion of the symphony,...

Let's examine the other options and why the pantry is the most suitable choice: 1. Storage closet: This option might seem sensible at first, as a storage closet can offer a confined and separate space for keeping things. However, a storage closet is a general term that can refer to any type of storage area in a house, such as a closet for clothes, linens, or cleaning supplies. They may not be ideally suited for storing dry goods effectively and might lack essential elements such as proper shelving or a cool and dark environment to preserve food items. 2. Building: A building is a broad term that can encompass any structure with a roof and walls. While it might be feasible, it is impractical for a housewife to store dry goods or household items in a separate building. This would require extra effort to access the stored items and might not be cost-effective or efficient. 3. Inside: This option is quite vague and provides no specific guidance on where to store the items within a house. This answer is inadequate, as it fails to address the need for a specific storage space. 4. Warehouse: A warehouse is designed for the large-scale storage of goods and products, usually for commercial or industrial purposes. It is typically a costly option, and using a warehouse for household storage would be excessive, inappropriate, and impractical for a housewife's needs. In conclusion, a pantry is the best option for dry storage in a housewife's situation, as it is specifically designed to meet the requirements for household food storage and organization. Pantries are commonly found in homes, and they provide an accessible, cool, and dark environment to ensure suitable preservation of dry goods and other household items. Additionally, pantries offer proper shelving or compartments to organize the stored items effectively, making it easy for the housewife to find and retrieve them when needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92–84, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88–73, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0–2 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22–5 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88–86. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112–103, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105–95 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals.

Ian Bell hit a century against Australia to move past Paul Collingwood's previous record of 5,092 runs. Warwickshire-born Bell is only the second Englishman to surpass 5,000 ODI runs for his country. But although England's 303 for eight was a good riposte having been asked to bat first, a return of 59 for five in the last 10 overs was an underwhelming end to proceedings. While Bell and Joe Root (69) can reflect on a job well done, captain Eoin Morgan is having a tougher time. Less then 24 hours after the revelation of a lurid blackmail plot against him, England's new captain was snared for a golden duck. Bell's form on tour has been largely excellent, with 187 in a warm-up match against the Prime Minister's XI and an effortless 88 not out in victory over India.

The first crept over the mid-wicket rope, the second cleared it comfortably and the third was carried over the line by long-leg fielder Shaun Marsh as he attempted to hang on to a near-impossible catch. Having been 39 for four at the 10-over mark in Sydney, England were now 69 without loss. The end of fielding restrictions stemmed the flow of boundaries but Bell's intuitive ability to locate gaps ensured the hundred stand came at better than a run per ball. Ali fell for a hit-and-miss 46, deceived by James Faulkner after stepping down the track, while James Taylor lasted 14 awkward balls before lofting Moises Henriques to mid-off. Bell's century helped England to leave Australia with a chase of 304 after batting first. Bell's only life came on 80, Brad Haddin grassing a thick edge off Faulkner, and he quickly reeled in Collingwood's record and his own hundred. His latest partner, Root, was scoring busily at the other end and the pair went on to add 121 for the third wicket. Bell managed a first six with nine overs to go, Cummins again going all the way, but had run out of steam by the time he lofted Gurinder Sandhu to Starc at mid-off. Morgan was next in and failed to banish his recent troubles by nicking his first ball from Sandhu. England never regained their momentum, Root unable to last the course and Ravi Bopara bowled round his legs, while Jos Buttler and Chris Woakes were run out from the last two balls of the innings. England's Ravi Bopara bats for England against Australia. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"Ian Bell scored an impressive 141 off 125 balls, becoming England's highest one-day international run-scorer and setting the stage for England to score 303 for eight against Australia at the Bellerive Oval. Bell's performance overtook Paul Collingwood's previous English record of 5,092 runs, reinforcing the importance of authentic batsmanship in the 50-over format. Joe Root also contributed with 69 runs, but a slowdown in the last 10 overs resulted in only 59 runs for England. Despite this, their overall score was a considerable achievement. Eoin Morgan, England's new captain, was dismissed for a golden duck. However, Bell has displayed remarkable form on the tour, scoring 187 against the Prime Minister's XI and 88 not out in the victory against India. With his contribution in this match, Bell has accumulated a total of 5,136 runs, becoming just the second Englishman to surpass 5,000 ODI runs for his country. Moeen Ali supported Bell too, scoring three consecutive sixes off Pat Cummins, bringing England's total to 69 without loss. The partnership between Bell and Root resulted in 121 runs for the third wicket. Overall, England managed to leave Australia with a target of 304 to chase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He pinpointed the time when the universe just began to exist. He labeled it as point A. To compare it with present situation of the universe he labeled the present time as point B. In which time the redshift was greater, point A or point B? Hint: The first direct observational hint that the universe has a finite age came from the observations of 'recession velocities', mostly by Vesto Slipher, combined with distances to the 'nebulae' (galaxies) by Edwin Hubble in a work published in 1929. Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, our Milky Way Galaxy. In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. Spectra taken of these distant galaxies showed a red shift in their spectral lines presumably caused by the Doppler effect, thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared to us) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point. Hubble's initial value for the universe's age was very low, as the galaxies were assumed to be much closer than later observations found them to be.","completion":"At point A, which is the beginning of the universe, the redshift was significantly greater than it is at point B, the present time. The concept of redshift arises from the Doppler effect, where the observed frequency of a wave or electromagnetic radiation changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. In the case of an expanding universe, the observed light from an object, such as a galaxy, is shifted towards the red (lower frequency) end of the spectrum. This is due to the fact that as the universe expands, the space between objects (such as galaxies) also increases, causing the light emitted by these objects to stretch and shift towards longer wavelengths (red end of the spectrum). The discovery by Vesto Slipher and Edwin Hubble that galaxies exhibit a redshift in their spectral lines, proportional to their distance from Earth, provided the first direct evidence that the universe is expanding. As the redshift is higher, it indicates that the object is at a greater distance and receding at a faster velocity relative to the observer. In the context of points A and B, at point A, all objects were starting to move outwards from a common point due to the expansion of the universe after the Big Bang. Given this, the redshift at the beginning of the universe (point A) would be larger, as the objects in the universe were initially closer to each other and then moved away from each other at a higher velocity. Over time, as the universe continues to expand, the rate of expansion has slowed, and the redshift consequently decreases. Therefore, at point B (the present time), the redshift is relatively smaller than at the beginning of the universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Senator Lillian DeHaven (Anne Bancroft) from Texas criticizes the Navy for not being gender-neutral. Behind the curtains, a deal is struck: If women compare favorably with men in a series of test cases, the military will integrate women fully into all branches of the Navy. The first test is the training course of the (fictional) U.S. Navy Combined Reconnaissance Team (similar to U.S. Navy SEAL BUD/S). Senator DeHaven hand-picks topographical analyst Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil (Demi Moore), because she is physically more feminine than the other candidates. To make the grade, O'Neil must survive a grueling selection program in which almost 60 percent of all candidates wash out, most before the fourth week, with the third week being particularly intensive (\\"hell week\\"). The enigmatic Command Master Chief John James Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen) runs the brutal training program that involves 20-hour days of tasks designed to wear down recruits' physical and mental strength, including pushing giant ship fenders up beach dunes, working through obstacle courses, and hauling landing rafts. Given a 30-second time allowance in an obstacle course, O'Neil demands to be held to the same standards as the male trainees. Eight weeks into the program, during SERE training, the Master Chief ties her to a chair with her hands behind her back, grabs hold of her and slams her through the door, then picking her up off the floor he repeatedly dunks her head in ice cold water in front of the other crew members. O'Neil fights back, and is successful in causing him some injury despite her immobilized arms. In so doing, she acquires respect from him, as well as from the other trainees.

Miranda quotes Voltaire: \\"If we find nothing new, we will find at least something pleasant\\", and looks longingly at Oscar. 2. Miranda quotes Voltaire: \\"If we don't find at least something pleasant, we will find something new\\", and looks longingly at Oscar. Let's break down the meaning of each sentence: In Sentence 1, the quote implies that if the characters do not discover anything new, they will instead find something pleasant in their experience. In Sentence 2, the quote suggests that if the characters cannot find something pleasant, they will instead discover something new. While both sentences have a similar structure and contain a positive outcome (finding something pleasant or something new), they are not paraphrases of each other. The main reason is that the conditions for achieving the positive outcome in each sentence are different. In Sentence 1, the condition for finding something pleasant is the absence of discovering something new. In other words, if no new information or experiences are gained, the characters involved will still find some enjoyment in their situation. On the other hand, in Sentence 2, the condition for finding something new is the absence of finding something pleasant. This means that if the characters involved are unable to experience enjoyment in their current situation, they will instead stumble upon new information or have a new experience. Although both sentences describe a similar sentiment about finding positivity in a given situation, the conditions under which each positive outcome is achieved are different. Therefore, the two sentences are not paraphrases of each other but instead convey two distinct messages related to seeking enjoyment or novelty in life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The intervention of Denmark, Sweden and Poland-Lithuania into Livonia began a period of struggle for control of the Baltic, known contemporaneously as the dominium maris baltici. While the initial war years were characterised by intensive fighting, a period of low-intensity warfare began in 1562 and lasted until 1570 when fighting once more intensified. Denmark, Sweden and to some extent Poland-Lithuania were occupied with the Nordic Seven Years' War taking place in the Western Baltic, but Livonia remained strategically important. In 1562, Denmark and Russia concluded the Treaty of Mozhaysk, respecting each other's claims in Livonia and maintaining amicable relations. In 1564, Sweden and Russia concluded a seven-years truce. Both Ivan IV and Eric XIV showed signs of mental disorder, with Ivan IV turning against part of the Tsardom's nobility and people with the oprichina that began in 1565, leaving Russia in a state of political chaos and civil war.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which lion species would be less prone to inbreeding, Asiatic or African? Keith is a zoologist. He studies large predators. Last year, he was studying different species of lions. First, he visited the Gir forest in India. There he found the Asiatic Lions. Unfortunately, only few Asiatic Lions are left in the wild, and they have to mate with their close relatives. He then visited the Serengeti reserve in Tanzania. There he found that the African Lions were not forced to mate with close relatives due to their large number. Hint: During sexual reproduction, mating with a close relative (inbreeding) often leads to inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression is considered to be largely due to expression of deleterious recessive mutations. The effects of inbreeding have been studied in many vertebrate species. Answer:","completion":"African lions would be less prone to inbreeding. Step 1: Understand the context The paragraph provides information about Keith, a zoologist, studying two species of lions: Asiatic Lions and African Lions. It mentions that Asiatic Lions are few in number and have to mate with close relatives, while African Lions do not have this issue due to their larger population. Step 2: Consider the hint The hint provided defines inbreeding and explains that it can lead to inbreeding depression, which has been studied in many vertebrate species. It is generally undesirable for the species and contributes to health issues within the population. Step 3: Compare the two species In the given context, Asiatic Lions are forced to mate with close relatives due to their low population, which puts them at a higher risk of inbreeding. Conversely, African Lions benefit from a larger population, allowing them to avoid mating with close relatives and reducing their risk of inbreeding. Step 4: Analyze and Answer Based on the information provided, African lions would be less prone to inbreeding compared to Asiatic lions. This is due to their larger population, which allows them to have a greater variety of potential mates, reducing the risk of inbreeding and its associated negative effects."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Nothing is more refreshing on a warm summer day than watching someone else work. Right now,I'm sitting on my porch and watching young Beth baling the big field on top of the hill.She's been haying that field for over ten years.I know:I put her on the tractor when she was just twelve years old. She picked a great day for baling.It's not too hot,and there's a nice breeze.On Monday,when she cut the field,it was so hot I thought the corn would start popping in the field.Didn't stop her,though.She just stuck that big hat on her head,wrapped a wet handkerchief around her neck,and set to work.I remember when I would have done the same thing. While I'm here sucking a lemonade,Beth is driving the \\"hay train\\",a tractor pulling a baler and an old wagon.You'd think someone her size would never be able to see over the tractor.But somehow she manages.When she's finished,her tracks are very straight. The whole time she's haying,that dog of hers is working just as hard,running along beside her like he's afraid she'll drive away without him.Beth sure knew what she was doing when she trained him. The way the machine works is pure poetry.Each row is pushed into shape.When just enough hay is in a bale,it is wrapped up and fastened together.A second or so later,the bale comes flying out and into the old wagon.The person who invented that machine sure was some kind of genius. That's not to say it works perfectly.Every once in a while a bale misses the mark,especially when you are turning the machine at the end of a row.That means,of course,that you have to go back and pick up those bales and throw them into the wagon. I can remember when Beth's mother was her age.She looked an awful lot like Beth does now.Makes a man proud to see his daughter and granddaughter taking such good care of themselves.

Alexandra Elene MacLean Denny (6 January 1947 - 21 April 1978) was an English singer-songwriter who was lead singer of the British folk rock band Fairport Convention. She has been described as \\"the pre-eminent British folk rock singer\\". After briefly working with the Strawbs, Denny joined Fairport Convention in 1968, remaining with them until 1969. She formed the short-lived band Fotheringay in 1970, before focusing on a solo career. Her nursing career proved short-lived. In the meantime she had secured a place on a foundation course at Kingston College of Art, which she took up in September 1965, becoming involved with the folk club on campus. Her contemporaries at the college included guitarist and future member of Pentangle, John Renbourn. After her first public appearance at the Barge in Kingston upon Thames Denny started working the folk club circuit in the evenings with an American-influenced repertoire, including songs by Tom Paxton, together with traditional folk songs. Denny made the first of many appearances for the BBC at Cecil Sharp House on 2 December 1966 on the Folk Song Cellar programme where she accompanied herself on two traditional songs: \\"Fhir a Bhata\\" and \\"Green Grow the Laurels\\". Her earliest professional recordings were made a few months later in mid-1967 for the Saga label, featuring traditional songs and covers of folk contemporaries including her boyfriend of this period, the American singer-songwriter Jackson C. Frank. They were released on the albums Alex Campbell and His Friends and Sandy and Johnny with Johnny Silvo. These songs were collected on the 1970 album It's Sandy Denny where the tracks from Sandy and Johnny had been re-recorded with more accomplished vocals and guitar playing. The complete Saga studio recordings were issued on the 2005 compilation Where The Time Goes. By this time she had abandoned her studies at art college and was devoting herself full-time to music. While she was performing at The Troubadour folk club, a member of the Strawbs heard her, and in 1967, she was invited to join the band. She recorded one album with them in Denmark which was released belatedly in 1973 credited to Sandy Denny and the Strawbs: All Our Own Work. The album includes an early solo version of her best-known (and widely recorded) composition, \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\\" A demo of that song found its way into the hands of American singer Judy Collins, who chose to cover it as the title track of an album of her own, released in November 1968, thus giving Denny international exposure as a songwriter before she had become widely known as a singer.","completion":"The text is about an English singer-songwriter named Alexandra Elene MacLean Denny, who is more popularly known as Sandy Denny.

Question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The U.S. election calendar could be a key factor in determining the scope and timing of a potential deal to end the North Korean nuclear program. Planning is progressing for both the upcoming summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the end of April and the expected meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim in late May or early June. President Trump said Tuesday that there had been talks at “extremely high levels” between his administration and the North Korean government. Later it was reported that Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and a secretary of state nominee, met recently with Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang. Trump also noted the talks have been marked by “a lot of goodwill” and that “there has been a major change in terms of North Korea’s behavior,” since Kim’s Olympic outreach this year, in which he sent a large delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter games in South Korea, suspended nuclear and missile tests, and expressed a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. The turn toward diplomacy has reduced, for now, the potential for conflict over the North’s accelerated efforts last year to develop an operational nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. The North Korean leader’s decision to engage in denuclearization talks was likely motivated by both Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, which increased sanctions and the threat of military action against the North, and by South Korean President Moon’s reassuring outreach efforts to improve inter-Korean relations. Trump’s motivation in pursuing a nuclear deal with North Korea, in addition to resolving a growing national security threat, could also have a political component. According to North Korea analysts at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, the Trump administration is likely calculating how achieving such an agreement could help boost the president’s chances for re-election in 2020. “If I were Trump, I...
