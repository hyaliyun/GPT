A:","completion":"The South gulf experiences higher swells. The reason behind this lies in the differences in the geographical features of the two neighboring gulfs. The South gulf has shallow water and is wider, while the North gulf is quite deep. Both gulfs are exposed to intense wave activity throughout the year. When waves travel into areas of shallow water, such as the South gulf, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. The free orbital motion of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position. This causes the waves to become higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. On the other hand, the North gulf is deep, which means that the waves traveling in its waters are less likely to be affected by the ocean floor and maintain their free orbital motion. This results in the waves maintaining their original shape and not turning into sharp-crested waves. As the water becomes shallower, such as in the South gulf, the swells become higher and steeper. Since the ocean bottom affects the waves more in the shallow waters, this disruption leads to larger swells. Additionally, after the wave breaks in the shallow waters, it becomes a wave of translation and the erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies. In conclusion, the South gulf, with its shallow water, experiences higher swells due to the waves being more affected by the ocean bottom. The geographical features contribute to the swell's size and shape and ultimately result in larger swells in the South gulf compared to the North gulf with its deeper waters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(AP) — Hornets owner Michael Jordan is donating 7 million to launch medical clinics that he hopes will help at-risk communities in Charlotte. It's the largest philanthropic donation ever by the former NBA champion. The donation will fund two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics, which are projected to open in 2020. \\"Through my years of working with Novant Health, I have been impressed with their approach and their commitment to the community,\\" Jordan, a North Carolina native, said in a release Monday. \\"It is my hope that these clinics will help provide a brighter and healthier future for the children and families they serve.\\" Jordan's spokesperson Estee Portnoy told The Associated Press Monday that the Hornets owner \\"feels so great about being able to impact the Charlotte community and help people who really deserve it. Michael and Novant are really excited about this project.\\" Portnoy said Jordan, 54, was motivated by a study that found poor children in Charlotte have the worst odds of those of any of the top 50 cities in the United States to lift themselves out of poverty. A release from Novant stated the clinics will provide an avenue to affordable, high-quality care — including behavioral health, physical therapy, social work, oral health and family planning — to individuals in the community who have little or no health care. The clinics have the potential to decrease emergency room utilization by 68 percent and decrease hospitalization by 37 percent for the residents of these neighborhoods, according to Novant. Novant added that the clinics are projected to care for nearly 35,000 children and adults who do not currently have access to primary and preventive care or who use the emergency room for non-urgent medical needs. \\"This gift will transform the lives of thousands of families and children living in poverty-stricken communities,\\" said Carl Armato, president and CEO of Novant Health said. \\"We are thankful to Michael for his generosity.

Understand the context of the sentence and what it describes. 2. Identify nouns, verbs, and critical terms that give details about vital elements in the sentence. Let's do this: The sentence 'Two transit trains are pulled up at a station with passengers walking alongside.' primarily directs attention to the following elements: 1. Two - This quantifier is important as it designates the number of transit trains. 2. Transit Trains - This is the main subject of the sentence. 3.

Summarize: For addicts who have been consuming drugs for a long period of time, it is extra difficult for them to get over the bad habit, so they often seek medical help. There are different drugs that help in giving the same feel of weed but cause less harm to the body. These drugs help in minimizing the cravings and eventually help the person become completely sober. Nicotine medicines, patches and gums are available in stores and can be bought without prescription. Nicotine helps in making the cravings less severe and reduces feelings of irritability and headache that you might face during withdrawal. Chewing a gum after every 2 hours when you’re awake helps in minimizing the cravings. If you are using 4 mg gums, make sure you don’t chew more than 20 gums per day or if using 3 mg, then not more than 30 pieces of gum per day. A patch should be changed after every 16 or 24 hours and the dosage you need depends on your level of addiction. It can be taken off while sleeping and put right back as soon as you wake up. It does cause a little soreness on the area it was patched so it is advisable to change areas every time. Make sure you do not completely rely on these medications (and other substances, like alcohol) as they are addictive in nature, too. The doses should be cut back with time, which will serve the right purpose of using them in the first place! These nicotine replacements should not be used if you have not completely quit smoking as the combination comes with serious problems. There are other non-nicotine medicines that are gained by prescription of a doctor. These are usually Xanax, Zyban, Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR and Wellbutrin XL and Varenicline. These medicines tell the brain to stop craving for the drug if taken in the right amount. However, they do require a prescription from your doctor. Most of these help with depression symptoms and may cause agitation, frustration and unusual behavior at times. If you think there is a negative change (more than just a normal feeling that you might be feeling temporarily) then it is best to talk to your doctor as the dosage might not be suiting you. The process of quitting drugs comes hand in hand with major mood swings, depression and frustration. Don’t let these temporary mood disorders get you! Having low self-esteem and recoiling on yourself is normal as you have been trying to struggle against your desires. Have faith and make sure you keep reminding yourself that you are better than this. Because you are! Talk to yourself out loud in front of the mirror and tell that image in front of you that you are a beautiful, strong person who has the strength to overcome this obstacle. And if you think you are less of a talker and more of a writer, grab a diary and start writing it all down. In fact, keep a diary of your entire process. Keep that journal someplace visible, so that you are constantly reminded of how well you are doing and thus are positively motivated to keep up the good work. One day when you will able to come over your addiction, you will read that diary and think of all the sufferings that you have overcome with your strength. That will be one beautiful moment of pure contentment for your moral later in life or upcoming crises.","completion":"Long-term drug addicts often seek medical help to combat their addiction. To minimize cravings and detoxify their bodies, they may use nicotine-based products like patches, gums, and medications that provide a similar sensation but cause less harm. It's essential to follow the recommended dosing guidelines, avoid combining these products with smoking, and gradually reduce usage over time. Additionally, non-nicotine prescription medications like Xanax, Zyban, and Wellbutrin can help rewire the brain to stop drug cravings. It's important to monitor mood changes and communicate with a doctor about potential medication side effects. Maintaining a positive mindset, practicing self-affirmation, and journaling can also help in overcoming addiction and achieving long-term success."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.\\", answer the following question.

Sentence 2: - The alliance is with the greengrocer's girl.

Marchbank recalls that her mother was \\"amazingly optimistic\\" and reassuring about the outcome, but by by April the following year the cancer was confirmed as terminal. \\"While I was trying to come to terms with the fact she was dying, I decided I wanted, or maybe needed, to document the time she had left,\\" says Marchbank. But there was always that question as to whether it was the right thing to do. \\"I didn't want to create a graphic portrayal of her death - it would have been impossible and wrong to focus only on the dying part - but rather I wanted to photograph our last months together. \\"I looked at the things that made her uniquely her, the details in her house I thought I knew so well, the things that would also be gone when she was.\\" This is a very personal thing. Others have documented such moments, each in their own way. For some the very idea of picking up a camera at such a time would seem taboo, for others a most natural response. Marchbank feels that the few seconds spent taking pictures each day gave her a way to record the moments that would come to mean so much. \\"Her love of flowers was a beautiful part of her personality; the house was always full of them, and as I photographed them I realised they were symbolic of what was happening - they represented happiness, love, kindness and generosity, but also isolation, decay, and finally death.\\" The work is called Tulip, after her mother's favourite flower, and it is these small, often overlooked parts of her mother's life that form the narrative of the work. Marchbank found the editing process after her mother's death cathartic, and only now, five years on, is she ready to share the work with a wider audience through the publication of a book.

Problem:Article: NEW YORK---One in five U.S. workers regularly attends after-work drinks with coworkers, where the most common mishaps range from badmouthing another worker to drinking too much, according to a study released on Tuesday. Most workers attend so-called happy hours to bond with colleagues, although 15 percent go to hear the latest office gossip and 13 percent go because they feel necessary, said the survey conducted for CareerBuilder. com, an online job site. As to what happens when the after-work drinks flow, 16 percent reported bad-mouthing a colleague, 10 percent shared a secret about a colleague and 8 percent said they drank too much and acted unprofessionally. Five percent said they had shared a secret about the company, and 4 percent confessed to singing karaoke. While 21 percent of those who attended said happy hours were good for networking, 85 percent said attending had not helped them get closer to someone higher up or get a better position. An equal number of men and women said they attended happy hours with co-workers, with younger workers aged 25 to 34 most likely and workers over 55 least likely to attend. Overall, 21 percent of workers attend happy hours with co-workers and of those nearly a quarter go at least once a month. The survey was conducted online by Harris Interactive on behalf of CareerBuilder. Com among 6,987 full-time employees between February 11 and March 13. Harris Interactive said the results had a sampling error of plus or minus 1.2 percentage points.

Answer:","completion":"[+] Look at how many miles you must fly before you can redeem them for a free flight. Choose an airline that doesn't require flying more miles than other airlines. The correct answer is to look at how many miles you need to fly before you can redeem them for free flights and choose an airline that doesn't require flying more miles than others. This helps you get free flights more easily and quickly because you won't need as many miles. The other answers are wrong because: Visiting the website of your nearest airline for an easy fee doesn't have anything to do with finding an airline with a good frequent flier program. Asking your attendant for a ticket based on opportunity doesn't help you choose a good frequent flier program. You want to choose an airline with a good program so you earn miles quickly and can redeem them easily.

Very good\\" A:","completion":"★★★★★"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If the interviewer uses your name throughout the interview, this can be a positive sign. Not only does this show that the interviewer has taken the time to learn your name, but it also indicates a friendly and positive rapport. If you notice that the interviewer is not using your name, you may find ways to remind them. For instance, if you are asked a question concerning one of your personal shortcomings, you can say something like: \\"My former supervisor would always say, 'Katie, your perfectionism is both a blessing and a curse.\\" Reminding them of your name may help the memory of you to stick. One great sign that they’d like to bring you on board is if they show you around the office and introduce you to the team. They wouldn’t waste their employees' time by introducing them to someone who wasn’t a serious contender. At the same time, they may be looking to get the employees’ opinions on you. So know that this is a great sign, but keep your game face on. Aim for a jovial, yet professional tone. It is a very good sign to be meeting the team; go ahead and let your excitement show. Does it feel as if your interviewer is just robotically moving down a list of questions? Does this interview feel entirely scripted? Although most interviews will have an underlying script, if an interview is going well, it is likely you’ll move off the grid. If an interview feels very scripted, or if it seems like your interviewer is simply going through the motions, this can be a negative sign. If your interviewer is going through the motions, try to engage them and help snap them into the moment. Keep in mind that interviews can be performed by a variety of different people, some of whom may not be comfortable in doing interviews, so they rely heavily on the script. Some methods for achieving this include: making a tasteful joke, engaging in direct eye contact, and calling your interviewer by name. Any of these (or other methods you may come up with) might break the monotony for your interviewer and cause you to stand out. Examples of good body language include things like nodding the head or leaning in towards you slightly. A nice strong handshake can also be a good sign. Look for instances of positive body language from your interviewer, as this can indicate how they feel about you. Be aware of your own body language! People tend to mirror each other so smile, speak softly and clearly, and project enthusiasm. Keep eye contact even if the interviewer turns away. Use positive body language toward your interviewer to indicate that you like them, and that you are truly interested in the job. Most interviews will involve some form of \\"Q and A\\" section, where they ask invite you to ask any questions you have, and then answer them. If your interviewer spends a lot of time and energy on this section (and if they seem invested), this indicates that they want to sell you on the job. This can be a good sign. Of course, in order for this work, you must have plenty of questions! Spend some time preparing questions before you head to your interview. You will want to ask questions about the job, the requirements and expectations, the company, the atmosphere and people, and finally, when they will be making a decision. Through your questions, show that you are already know a thing or two about the job and company, as well as the fact that you are invested in making sure this is a good fit.

Question: How are members chosen for the US Congress? Context: In 1864, Andrew Johnson (a War Democrat from Tennessee) was elected Vice President under Abraham Lincoln. He became President after Lincoln's assassination in 1865. Under Johnson's lenient re-admission policy, Tennessee was the first of the seceding states to have its elected members readmitted to the U.S. Congress, on July 24, 1866. Because Tennessee had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, it was the only one of the formerly secessionist states that did not have a military governor during the Reconstruction period. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Members for the US Congress are chosen through elections.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? - no - yes","completion":"The rate of diffusion is the measure of how quickly particles or substances move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This process tends to occur spontaneously in nature and plays a crucial role in various fields like biology, chemistry, and physics. The rate of molecular diffusion is typically quantified through the diffusion coefficient, which is a proportionality constant that depends on the properties of the substance and the environment it is in, like temperature and viscosity. The units of the diffusion coefficient are generally expressed in square centimeters per second (cm²/s) or square meters per second (m²/s). Fick's first law is commonly used to model the diffusion process, with the equation: J = -D * (dC/dx), where J represents the rate of diffusion (flux), D is the diffusion coefficient, and (dC/dx) refers to the concentration gradient, Several factors influence the rate of diffusion, including: 1. Concentration gradient: The steeper the concentration gradient, the faster the rate of diffusion. 2. Temperature: Higher temperatures lead to increased kinetic energy in the particles, thereby increasing the rate of diffusion. 3. Molecular size: Smaller molecules tend to diffuse more rapidly than larger molecules because they can move through tighter spaces at a faster rate. 4. Medium in which diffusion occurs: The rate of diffusion is generally faster in gases than in liquids due to the greater distances between gas particles, allowing them to move more freely. 5. Viscosity: The greater the viscosity of a substance, the slower the rate of diffusion. 6. Surface area: Larger surfaces facilitate faster diffusion rates. 7. Diffusion and solubility properties of interacting substances: Some substances diffuse more readily within specific media or with other specific substances. The rate of molecular diffusion is considered low because it is an inherently slow process compared to other methods of substance transport. Since it depends on the random and passive movement of individual molecules, it does not involve any additional energy input or external forces, making it rely solely on molecular collisions and the concentration gradient. Diffusion is generally best-suited for short distances and smaller systems; in larger systems, other transportation mechanisms may come into play, such as active transport and bulk flow, to facilitate movement across more considerable distances. Regarding the multi-choice problem: the two questions are inquiring about related but distinct aspects of the same topic. The first question seeks to define the rate of diffusion, while the second question aims to understand why the rate of molecular diffusion is low. So, the answer is \\"no\\" - they are not inquiring about the same information, although they are closely connected."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The small-statured pony, with his speckled coat, somehow found a kindred spirit in the large and imposing canine, Joker, who too sported a similar patchy pattern on his body. And it was not just their black and white markings that were identical, their personalities shared the same playful energy too. The two animals who are both incredibly boisterous and lively have since become inseparable. They gambol, trot, run around together and shares naps under the warm Cornwall sun, a picture of pure joy and harmony. So much so that it often becomes difficult to identify where Tigger ends and Joker begins and vice versa, their markings sometimes creating an illusion of continuity. Their odd friendship took everyone by surprise but the bond was unmistakable. Despite the difference in species, the heartening sight resembles close-knit siblings, never leaving each other's side. Tigger, who is older and wiser, has taken it upon himself to guide Joker, teaching him the ways of the animal kingdom. Joker, on the other hand, brings to Tigger a youthful exuberance and together, they balance each other's idiosyncrasies perfectly. Their relationship never goes unnoticed by visitors at the stables. People from the surrounding areas traveling to see the unusual pair are usually filled with amusement and surprise. Their bond seems to transcend the conventional understanding of friendship, it's their unique language of love and bond that only the two seem to understand. \\"Joker and Tigger are the best mates.

The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,etc. - Tina Hirsch ( born 1943 ) also known as Bettina Kugel Hirsch , Bettina Hirsch and Bettina Kugel is an Emmy - nominated American film editor and an adjunct professor of editing at the University of Southern California ( USC ) .

Heartbroken, the child rushes up to the attic and cuts his hand with a shard of glass from a shattered snow globe. Thirty-three years later, an adult Harry (Brandon Maggart) now works in a low-level position at the Jolly Dreams toy factory. At home, he has taken it upon himself to become the next true Santa: he sleeps in costume, and his apartment is resplendent with Christmas toys and dÃ©cor. From the roof of his building, he uses binoculars to spy on neighborhood children to see if they are being \\"bad or good\\". He sees two \\"good\\" children doing household chores and playing with their dolls, but finds a third child, Moss Garcia, rifling through a Penthouse magazine and cutting out a nude photograph. Harry runs back home and writes Moss's name in his \\"Bad Boys &amp; Girls\\" book. On his way home, Harry peeps into the window of a local bar and sees coworker Frank Stoller, who earlier that day had phoned in sick, requiring Harry to take his place on the assembly line. Harry becomes angry and rushes home, hums a Christmas tune, and breaks one of his male dollhouse figures. The following morning he phones his younger brother Phil (Jeffrey DeMunn) and cancels Thanksgiving dinner. At the company Christmas party, the owner of Jolly Dreams announces that, if production increases sufficiently, the company will be able to donate toys to the disadvantaged children at Willowy Springs State Hospital. Afterwards, Harry is greeted by coworkers Ben, who thanks him for taking Frank's place at the warehouse, and Frank, who introduces him to new employee George.

But the move has led to allegations of moral policing. The BBC's Vikas Pandey spent a day with the squad in Allahabad city. In a public park, a young couple try to hide as they spot the squad. \\"Please come out. We are here for your safety,\\" Niraj Kumar Jadaun, assistant superintendent of police and head of the squad, tells them. The boy emerges and asks for forgiveness, only to be reassured by Mr Jadaun that he has done nothing wrong. After a brief conversation, the couple manage a faint smile before disappearing into the park. \\"Some people are scared of cops. And that's the perception we have to fight against,\\" he says. \\"But eve teasing is another reality that we need to fight against.\\" Police in Uttar Pradesh established the squad due to rising reports of sexual harassment. There are no reliable statistics and police say that in most cases women don't report harassment. But most women have a story, or several, to tell about inappropriate or abusive groping, language or behaviour. A total of 1,400 officers have been deployed to anti-harassment squads across the state. Each squad includes three uniformed officers and a female officer in plain clothes. They patrol in cars and on foot, targeting areas where they get most complaints about harassment. So far there have been mixed results. Some squads have made headlines for \\"moral policing\\" and there have been reports of couples being harassed and even beaten up. But Rahul Srivastava, chief spokesperson of the police, said that only \\"a handful\\" of officers were making mistakes. \\"We are repeatedly training our staff about the dos and don'ts,\\" he said. \\"We have suspended nine officials so far for violations. Our instruction is clear that consenting adults should not be disturbed.\\" Mr Jadaun says upbringing can be to blame. \\"In some cultures it's still a taboo for a boy and a girl to sit together in public places. So some cops who think on similar lines end up indulging in moral policing,\\" he says. \\"But their number is very small.\\" Back in the park, Mr Jadaun is stopped by a young man who wants to talk. \\"My name is Abhilash Denis and I want to thank you for this initiative. But I also have some issues,\\" he says. Mr Denis says that he likes to go to public parks with his girlfriend. \\"But it's always a risk. Eve teasers are always around. They make nasty remarks and make rude gestures. The squad's presence has made sure that such people are less visible in public places,\\" he says. \\"But that doesn't mean that cops have a right to disturb us any time.\\" Mr Jadaun assures him that police will only disturb him to ask about their safety. Elsewhere in the park a woman, who didn't want to be identified, seems angry with the police. \\"It's the police's responsibility to make us feel safe. But I don't want random police to question me just because I am sitting in a public place with my male friend,\\" she says. \\"Yes, I agree that eve teasing is a problem. And I am happy the police are doing something about it. But they need to get better at what they do.\\" In another part of the city, police approach two couples sitting on a bench. Kritika Singh says she appreciates the work the police are doing, and didn't mind having a conversation with them. \\"You have to know how big a problem eve teasing is in this state. Every girl can tell you horrific incidents they have faced in public places,\\" she says. \\"Abuse, filthy gestures from men are very common. Sometimes they also end up touching us inappropriately in public places.\\" Her friend Sadhna Maurya agrees. \\"I have seen reports about moral policing and that must stop. But the squad should not be shut. I have seen it making a difference. We feel a bit safer now, though not 100%.\\" She says she has grown up accepting harassment as a reality. \\"For the first time something is being done, I am willing to accept it despite its imperfections.\\" I witnessed similar conversations between the squad and people across the city. We stopped at schools, malls and shopping districts. The squad questions many men, but nobody is detained. \\"Our purpose is not to arrest people. We want eve teasers to know that the police are out there to catch them. We want them to change,\\" Mr Jadaun says. As the day finishes, the jury still seems to be out on whether the initiative is a success. In some places people, mostly women, appreciated the squad's work. But some still have doubts about its methods. I put this question to the state's top police official, Javeed Ahmed. \\"Eve teasing is a reality,\\" he said. \\"We needed to send a signal that women would be protected and people who harassed them would be dealt with in a strict manner.\\" He acknowledges that there is a long way to go. \\"But I am glad we have made a start,\\" he says. \\"We can't become a progressive state if women don't feel safe here.\\" Back at base, the squad hold a briefing to go over the day's events. Superintendent of Police Vipin Tada says it is a chance to identify mistakes. \\"They are learning fast. Just remember it's a new initiative for them as well,\\" he says. Allahabad's top police officer Shalabh Kumar Mathur says he does not regret putting resources into this initiative. \\"Eve teasing is a menace. If the choice is between doing nothing and doing something with scope for improvement, I would pick the latter,\\" he says.","completion":"Police in Uttar Pradesh have established a special squad to address the issue of eve teasing, a local term for sexual harassment.

Black hole jets recycle matter and energy into space and can affect when and where a galaxy forms stars. “Jets from supermassive black holes help determine a galaxy’s fate — how it evolves,” said Tasso Tzioumis from CSIRO in Australia. “So we want to understand better the impact jets have on their environment.” Astronomers have known for decades that black hole jets contain electrons, which are low-mass particles. But using the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton space telescope and CSIRO’s Compact Array radio telescope in eastern Australia, the research team found the first evidence of heavy atoms — iron and nickel — in the jets from a typical black hole known as 4U1630-47. An iron atom is about 100,000 times more massive than an electron. When a massive particle is moving, it carries more energy than a lighter particle moving at the same speed. “Heavy atoms have been seen in jets from one other system, SS433, but that’s a very unusual system, an oddball, whereas this system is quite typical, much more likely to represent black holes in general,” Tzioumis said. While 4U1630-47 is a small black hole, a few times the mass of the Sun, the physics of black holes is scalable, he said, meaning that the finding would apply to larger black holes. The discovery suggests that jets are powered by the black hole’s accretion disk — a belt of hot gas swirling around the black hole — and not by the spin of the black hole itself, which would be more likely to produce jets containing only light particles. The jets from 4U1630-47 are traveling fast, at two-thirds the speed of light. When such fast-moving jets containing heavy particles smash into matter in space, they could generate gamma rays and neutrinos, which might be detectable with current and future telescopes. ||||| Has a black hole mystery just been solved? Writing in the journal Nature, a team of scientists said it found traces of nickel and iron in the powerful jets shooting out of black hole candidate 4U 1630-47, a small black hole just a few times the mass of our sun. It may help solve a scientific puzzle that has lingered for decades. Astronomers have known for years that hyper-dense black holes shoot matter into the universe in high-speed streams known as relativistic jets. However, nobody knew exactly what type of material the jets were spewing. \\"It was one of the unsolved questions about relativistic jets produced in the vicinity of black holes,\\" said Avi Loeb, chair of the department of astronomy at Harvard University, who was not involved with the study. \\"What is their composition?\\" Everyone was in agreement that the jets would contain electrons, which have a negative charge. But the jets did not have a negative charge overall. That suggested there was something else in there with a positive charge that canceled it out. In addition, some models of the jets suggested they were shooting lightweight electrons and positrons away from the black hole and into the universe. Others thought the jets were made of much heavier normal matter. \\"Until now, it wasn't clear whether the positive charge came from positrons, the antimatter 'opposite' of electrons, or positively charged atoms,\\" study coauthor James Miller-Jones of the International Center for Radio Astronomy Research said in a statement. \\"Since our results found nickel and iron in these jets, we now know that ordinary matter must be providing the positive charge.\\" Because it takes a lot more energy to move normal matter than it would to move the lightweight electrons and positrons, the authors suggests that the high-speed jets are carrying more energy away from the black hole than was previously known. The study also sheds light on another scientific debate - exactly where the jets emerge from. It has been unclear whether the jets are caused by the spin of the rotating black hole, or if they originate from the disk of matter that surrounds the black hole. \\"Our results suggest it's more likely the disk is responsible for channeling the matter into the jets, and we are planning further observations to try and confirm this,\\" Miller-Jones said in the statement. To come to these conclusions, the researchers looked at both radio waves and X-rays that were emitted by black hole 4U 1630-47. The first time they looked, the radio wave spectrum suggested the jets were not on, and the X-ray spectrum did not reveal anything unusual. \\"The jets are not always on,\\" Miller-Jones told the Los Angeles Times. \\"It depends a little bit on how fast the black hole is feeding.\\" But the second time the team looked, the radio waves seemed to indicate the jets were on. At the same time, the X-ray spectrum picked up the characteristic signature of iron and nickel that was off just a bit. The scientists believe the signatures were slightly skewed because of a Doppler-like effect in space. \\"Just like a sound wave gets higher as it moves toward you and lower as it moves away from you, we saw the same effect,\\" Miller-Jones said. \\"The energy was shifted a little bit to higher energies when it was moving toward us, and lower when it was moving away from us.\\" One especially cool result of this effect is that it allowed the researchers to determine how fast the material in the jets were moving. Their finding? A whopping 123,000 miles per second, or about 66% of the speed of light. You read to the end? You are awesome! Follow me on Twitter for more like this.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Who hires American private detective Alvin MacCarron to investigate Dickie's disappearance? Title: The Talented Mr. Ripley Movie plot: Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure.

Q:Article: Many cities have subways and underground public transportation to take locals and tourists alike rapidly around the city.However, there's something different about riding a London subway.It may not look different, but the historical value of one of England's most popular forms of transportation is enough to make riding the subway a must when visiting London.With a little under 300 different stations, the subway can take you almost anywhere you need to go. Riding a London subway, a person from other countries will notice one major difference: in London, people do not look at each other.In fact, eye contact is avoided at all times.That's not rudeness --people are just too busy to bother looking. Busy doing what, you ask? Well, they're certainly not using the time for a moment of quiet thinking.Nor are they reading a book.New technology has replaced quiet habits.Today the only acceptable form of book on the London underground is an e-book.

Write some highlights for the following article: The Spanish League will decide Tuesday afternoon if they are going to take action against Barcelona supporters singing ‘Ronaldo is a drunk’ at the Camp Nou on Sunday night. The League have officials at every La Liga match and the one at Barcelona’s meeting with Levante at the weekend included hearing the song in their report. If the Spanish League reports it to the Antiviolence Committee Barcelona could be fined or even have a part of the Nou Camp closed. The steps being considered are a result of Spanish football’s intention of cutting out all forms of crowd trouble or incitement to crowd trouble since a Deportivo supporter was killed in a pitched battle before a match at Atletico Madrid’s Vicente Calderon stadium in November. Barcelona fans chanted 'Ronaldo is a drunk' about Real Madrid star Cristiano at the Nou Camp. Barcelona could now face disciplinary action from the Spanish league. Pictured is their star man Lionel Messi. Despite what some might term 'terrace banter' appearing to have little to do with the organised violence that ended with a supporter being beaten to death outside a stadium last year, the football authorities have included chants and songs in their crackdown on trouble. Barca fan taunts followed Ronaldo’s 30th birthday party when he was videoed and photographed celebrating after a 4-0 defeat by Atletico Madrid. The league threatened similar action for sections of the Bernabeu chanting ‘Messi is retarded’ in December but none was taken. Real Madrid, however, were reported to have identified the 17 supporters who started the chant and expelled them. Ronaldo (right) sings alongside Colombian singer Kevin Roldan at his 30th birthday party. James Rodriguez, Roldan and Ronaldo celebrates the Portuguese's 30th birthday earlier this month. In the past abuse of a racist nature aimed at players has gone unpunished in Spain with Dani Alves, Samuel Eto’o and Ashley Cole on international duty for England at the Bernabeu in 2004 all victims. The apparently frivolous nature of the song aimed at Ronaldo mean any serious punishment is likely to be met with ridicule outside of Spain. But with the Real Madrid v Barcelona rivalry colouring all La Liga debate there will be no shortage of Real Madrid supporters keen for the League to carry through on its threat.

Here is a news article: A woman whose car flipped 500 yards down a remote ravine in northern California was rescued today after her family reported her missing. And her rescue was enabled in part thanks to a quick-thinking police officer. Melissa Vasquez was ejected from her vehicle after she crashed in the mountains near San Jose, about twenty miles from where she lives in Campbell, California, police said. Campbell police were alerted of a possible crash on Monday by the car's on-board OnStar security system, but couldn't locate the woman's vehicle, police said. \\"During the investigation, one of our officers asked her stepmom about her iPhone,\\" Sgt. Gary Berg told ABC News today. \\"So the officer logged on to the Find My iPhone app and unbelievably he was able to guess her password and log into her account. And at that point, he located the address where her phone was showing on GPS.\\" California Highway Patrol brought in a helicopter and pulled the woman to safety today. She had been ejected from her car and was laying face down in the ravine, police said. It's not yet clear how the accident happened, and police are investigating. Vasquez, 28, is being treated for injuries at a hospital, police said. \\"It's pretty remarkable,\\" Berg said. \\"I would hate to think of the outcome had we not been able to log on.\\" OnStar told ABC News it is aware of the incident and looking into what happened. \\"We are saddened by this incident involving one of our subscribers,\\" the company said in a statement. \\"Our subscribers' safety and security is OnStar's utmost concern. We are currently conducting a complete investigation, including information we have received from our call centers, our cellular network provider, our engineering team and the local authorities to better understand what occurred.\\" ||||| A California car crash victim was impossible to find until a tech-savvy police officer made a crucial decision to track her down using an iPhone.California Highway Patrol officers located the missing woman's Chevy Cruze at about 5:30 Tuesday morning. The missing car was 500 feet down a ravine off Mt. Hamilton Road in South Bay.A Coast Guard helicopter was called while officers walked down the embankment through heavy shrubbery. They found 28-year-old Melissa Vasquez, who had been ejected from the car, and had been missing for 17 hours.\\"The officers on the scene said she was face down. She was awake, coherent, and she was speaking to officers,\\" explained CHP Officer Ross Lee.Rescuers put Vasquez into an airlift basket and the chopper hoisted her out of the ravine. She was in the ICU after suffering injuries to her legs and her abdomen.The CHP says they're still investigating the incident and they don't know why the car ended up in the ravine. Drugs and alcohol, they say, do not appear to be a factor.But the real detective work began sometime after 2 p.m. on Monday, when the car's OnStar program detected a crash after two of the tires were ripped off the car. OnStar monitors told Campbell police the car was at Highway 17 and Camden Avenue, near Vasquez' home. Officers responded, but police heard and saw nothing. OnStar later updated the location to downtown San Jose. Again, police found nothing.At 3 a.m. Tuesday, Vasquez's stepmother called police, saying her daughter was missing.The officer credited with finding her is back on the job after a very busy morning.\\"I'm kind of known around the department as kind of a tech geek,\\" Campbell police Officer David Cameron said.Cameron is a shy and humble man. He spoke for the first time on Tuesday about his crucial role in finding Vasquez.It wasn't until 3 a.m. Tuesday when Cameron went to Vasquez's house and found her iPad that he realized he could use Apple's Find My iPhone app to track her. But first, he had to crack all of her pass codes.\\"I made an educated guess based on a series of common numbers people use for passwords and on the third attempt I was able to get in,\\" Cameron said.Then he remotely turned on her phone's location finder. Vasquez meantime, was miles away, thrown from her car, lying face down and hurt. In just minutes, Cameron had a read on her location and just 20 minutes later rescuers were lifting her into a U.S. Coast Guard chopper.\\"I think somebody was looking out for her. Things fell in place and had those things not fallen in place, it could have been a totally different story,\\" Cameron said.At Regional Medical Center, Vasquez family rushed to her side and made an emotional plea.\\"We would ask for prayers and ask that you respect the family's privacy,\\" Stephanie Valdez, Melissa's cousin, said.Cameron plans to visit Melissa in a few days.Meantime, OnStar says its investigating why the system failed.Apple does not market the find my iPhone feature to police, but it has been used hundreds of times by officers to find stolen devices and this may be the first time it's been used to save someone's life.If you have an apple device -- an iPhone, iPad or a Mac -- you can use the Find My iPhone feature to locate your device on a map. It'll even play a sound so you can track it down. And if you think your phone was stolen or lost, you can lock it and then track it. Or just erase all the information on the phone. All you have to do is log into your iCloud account and activate the app. ||||| A 28-year-old woman from Campbell whose car tumbled hundreds of feet down an embankment on Mount Hamilton east of San Jose was rescued and taken to a hospital Tuesday morning after she spent more than 12 hours stuck and injured, officials said. In the end, police said, the search for where the car crashed was both complicated and aided by location-based technology. On Monday afternoon, just after 2 p.m., Campbell police officers received a report from General Motors’ OnStar system saying there had been a rollover accident involving Melissa Vasquez’s Chevrolet Cruze in the area of White Oaks Road and Shelley Avenue in Campbell, said Capt. Gary Berg. That was just a couple of blocks from the woman’s home. Officers spent two hours searching the area, Berg said. But the pegged location wasn’t right. Police had OnStar honk the car horn remotely, to no avail. A second strategy — having officers run sirens in different locations to see if they could be heard over the OnStar system — also failed. A knock on Vasquez’s door got no response. And the car wasn’t there. Officers then contacted Vasquez’s cell company, which provided a location of her phone within a 7-mile radius of downtown San Jose, Berg said. Authorities were still unable to locate the car. Campbell police officers broadcast the vehicle’s description to all agencies in the county, he said. Then, just before 3 a.m. Tuesday, Campbell police officers received a missing person’s report from Vasquez’s stepmother, with whom she lives, officials said. She said she hadn’t heard from her. Officer Dave Cameron met with the stepmother and asked if Vasquez had Find My iPhone, an app that allows you to locate your misplaced iPhone using cell signals. The stepmother responded that Vasquez owned an iPad — but she didn’t know where it was. So Cameron called the cell company, which could tell the iPad was in the Campbell home. Soon, the stepmother found the tablet computer — but it was locked. “So I made an educated guess, based on a series of common numbers people use for passwords,�? Cameron told reporters. Cameron is a SWAT team member and accident reconstruction specialist but acknowledged that he’s known within the department as “kind of a tech geek.�? “Amazingly, Officer Cameron was able to guess the correct password after only 3-4 tries using his knowledge of commonly used password combinations,�? officials said. The Find my iPhone app was also locked. But the same password opened it up. Cameron activated the “lost phone�? feature and saw a map of the location of Vasquez’s iPhone — 14555 Mount Hamilton Rd. “It gave a very small search area,�? Cameron said. He noticed that Vasquez’s cell phone only had 12 percent battery life left. “You think about it. If we didn’t have that specific location I would hate to think what the outcome would be without him logging into that account,�? Berg said. Officers from San Jose and deputies from Santa Clara County responded to the area soon after receiving the information from Campbell police. Less than 20 minutes later, at around 5:30 a.m., officers located Vasquez on Mount Hamilton. The car, which had plummeted about 500 yards off an embankment, was on its roof, said California Highway Patrol Officer Ross Lee. The victim was outside the car, face-down but conscious. A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter responded and airlifted Vasquez to Regional Medical Center of San Jose with major injuries, including to her abdomen and legs. She is expected to survive, Ross said. Relieved family members met with Vasquez at the hospital and thanked rescuers. General Motors said in a statement Tuesday that it was looking into what happened with the OnStar system and was “saddened by this incident involving one of our subscribers.�? “Our subscribers’ safety and security is OnStar’s utmost concern. We are currently conducting a complete investigation, including information we have received from our call centers, our cellular network provider, our engineering team and the local authorities to better understand what occurred,�? the company said. Cameron said he was heartened that the technology that was available helped save Vasquez. “Sixteen years ago, that wouldn’t have happened,�? he said. “It would have been phone calls and guesses and maps.�?

Lee and Demian Bulwa contributed to this blog post. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Melissa Vasquez, a 28-year-old woman from California, was rescued after her car flipped 500 yards down a remote ravine in northern California.

The statement refers to the fact that certain substances can pose significant dangers to both human health and the environment. The Greens, in this case, are a political party focusing on environmental and social issues, advocating for a more sustainable, ecologically responsible approach to governance. The individual expressing this opinion agrees with the Greens' goal of accelerating efforts to address the risks associated with hazardous substances. These substances can include chemicals used in various industries, such as agriculture, manufacturing, or pharmaceuticals. The dangers associated with these substances can range widely from being toxic, causing illness, or leading to other negative impacts on the environment and human health. To move forward more quickly on tackling this issue, it is essential to consider various approaches, such as: 1. Stricter regulations: Implementing tighter regulations on the production, use, and disposal of hazardous substances can help reduce their negative impact. This can include requiring companies to undergo comprehensive risk assessments and establishing limitations on the amounts of specific chemicals released into the environment. 2. Promoting safer alternatives: Encouraging the development and use of safer alternatives to hazardous substances is vital for reducing the harm they cause. This can involve supporting research into new materials and processes that function more sustainably while providing incentives for industries to adopt these alternatives. 3. Expanding monitoring and enforcement efforts: Ensuring that companies and individuals adhere to existing regulations is crucial, which requires strengthening monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. This can be achieved by increasing funding for governmental agencies responsible for overseeing compliance and imposing stricter penalties for those who violate the regulations. 4. Raising public awareness: Educating the public about the dangers posed by hazardous substances and how they can reduce their exposure is an essential component of minimizing their harmful effects. This can be done through targeted campaigns, educational programs, and promoting transparency in industries that use these substances. 5. International cooperation: Collaborating with other countries in the monitoring, regulation, and development of alternatives to hazardous substances can significantly increase the impact of efforts to address this issue. Working together, countries can establish international standards, share resources and information, and help support one another in their goals. In conclusion, there are various approaches to addressing the dangers that hazardous substances pose. By sharing the Greens' desire to move forward more quickly in this area, individuals and governments can build upon these ideas to develop more sustainable solutions and protect human health and the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Beijing's broadened ban on smoking in public places took effect Thursday, adding force to the effort to hold a smoke-free Olympics. The new rules extend existing anti-smoking regulations to more places, including fitness centers, cultural relic sites, offices, meeting rooms, dining halls, toilets and lifts. Restaurants, Internet cafes, parks, and waiting halls at airports, railway stations and coach stations are required to set up smoking areas. Hotels will have to offer smoke-free rooms or floors, but the regulations do not specify a proportion. However, some restaurant owners have complained that it would be difficult to have a separate smoking room as required by the new regulations. \\"We plan to issue specific rules to solve this problem as soon as possible,\\" Rao Yingsheng, vice-director of the Beijing Committee for Patriotic Public Health Campaign, was quoted by the Beijing News as saying Thursday. He said small restaurants without a separate room should set aside at least 70 percent of their area for non-smokers. He also said customers and restaurant owners would be asked for their thoughts on the new rule. Local authorities dispatched about 100,000 inspectors to make sure the ban was being enforced Thursday. Everyone has the right to dissuade people from smoking in public places, Liu Zejun, who works for the Beijing committee, said. \\"Citizens are encouraged to expose those who refuse to obey the rule by calling the free telephone line 12320,\\" Liu said. People caught smoking in forbidden areas will be fined 10 yuan (1.40), while enterprises and institutions that violate the ban will face fines of between 1,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan. Smoking was forbidden in hospitals, kindergartens, schools, museums, sports venues and other places before the new regulations took effect. From Oct 1 last year, the city also banned smoking in its 66,000 cabs, and imposed fines of 100 yuan to 200 yuan on drivers caught smoking in taxis. China has pledged a cigarette-free, green Olympics. This year's event will be the first... Question: The passage mainly tells us _ . Answer: Pick your answer from: A).

Answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Hard to Believe Review: I find the whole circumstances of the story unbelievable. Abigail is a beautiful 25 year old spinster. However, the reason she never wed and had a chance to find a husband is because she is busy taking care of her younger sister, Caroline, after their mother died. The age difference between the 2 sisters were only 8 years apart. That is just too small of an age gap to make it believable that Abigail is able to take care of Caroline. Also, their older brother, who is still alive, is a lord of the realm, therefore, I believe there are no financial hardship in hiring a governess, nanny, housekeeper, etc. Also 25 years old just doesn't seem that old by today's standard. The book keep going on and on about her being a 25 years old spinster. I just have a hard time overcoming the unbelievable circumstances of the story.It would be a different matter if Abigail is approaching 40. I would find that more believable. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review can be interpreted as mostly negative. From the beginning, the reviewer expresses their disbelief in the story's circumstances, focusing on the protagonist Abigail's age and perceived incompetence in taking care of her younger sister due to the small age gap between them. The reviewer also questions the need for Abigail to be the sole caretaker, given their older brother's status as a lord and the assumed lack of financial hardship in hiring help. The tone continues to emphasize disbelief as the reviewer comments on the book's insistence on referring to Abigail as a 25-year-old spinster, which they deem unrealistic by today's standards. They suggest that the narrative would be more believable if Abigail was closer to 40 years old. Overall, the reviewer's focus on the implausibility of certain aspects of the story and their dissatisfaction with the book's portrayal of the protagonist contribute to a negative tone in this product review."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Process: - A larva is born - The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches - And a butterfly is born. Question: suppose there is not much water free happens, how will it affect MORE butterflies. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"A lack of water can have a significant impact on the life cycle of butterflies, specifically affecting their population and growth. The perturbation you mentioned is related to the second effect – the caterpillar eating constantly until it grows bigger. Less water availability can lead to the following effects on butterflies: 1. Decreased plant growth: Caterpillars feed primarily on plant leaves. With less water, plants may struggle to grow and thrive, leading to a reduced food source for caterpillars. This could result in slower growth and development of the caterpillars, potentially affecting their ability to reach their full size before forming a cocoon. 2. Reduced survival rates: Water is essential for the survival of living organisms. It assists in regulating body temperature, digestion, and nutrient absorption, among other vital functions. A lack of water may directly impact the survival of caterpillars or lead to dehydration and weaken their immune systems, making them more susceptible to diseases or predation. 3. Hindered egg-laying: Adult butterflies rely on water for their survival and reproduction. A scarcity of water may negatively affect their ability to reproduce, resulting in fewer eggs being laid and, consequently, fewer caterpillars born. This further decreases the butterfly population. 4. Altered behavior: Water scarcity can lead to behavioral changes in butterflies, such as increased movement in search of water and limited time available for feeding. This can also affect their growth and ability to form cocoons on time. In conclusion, a lack of water would likely have a negative effect on the growth and development of caterpillars, leading to less optimal conditions for their survival and cocoon formation. As a result, there may be fewer butterflies in such an environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Q:Information: - In information theory , Shannon 's source coding theorem ( or noiseless coding theorem ) establishes the limits to possible data compression , and the operational meaning of the Shannon entropy . The source coding theorem shows that ( in the limit , as the length of a stream of independent and identically - distributed random variable ( i.i.d . ) data tends to infinity ) it is impossible to compress the data such that the code rate ( average number of bits per symbol ) is less than the Shannon entropy of the source , without it being virtually certain that information will be lost . However it is possible to get the code rate arbitrarily close to the Shannon entropy , with negligible probability of loss . The source coding theorem for symbol codes places an upper and a lower bound on the minimal possible expected length of codewords as a function of the entropy of the input word ( which is viewed as a random variable ) and of the size of the target alphabet . - Ecology (from , \\"house\\", or \\"environment\\"; -, \\"study of\\") is the scientific analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment. It is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology, geography, and Earth science. Ecology includes the study of interactions organisms have with each other, other organisms, and with abiotic components of their environment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity, distribution, amount (biomass), and number (population) of particular organisms, as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, pedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and various niche construction activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits, and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity. Biodiversity, which refers to the varieties of species, genes, and ecosystems, enhances certain ecosystem services. - Quantum computing studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968. - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on or to heat the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton. - The Boltzmann constant (or ), which is named after Ludwig Boltzmann, is a physical constant relating the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas with the temperature of the gas. It is the gas constant divided by the Avogadro constant : - In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding. - A temperature is an objective comparative measurement of hot or cold. It is measured by a thermometer. Several scales and units exist for measuring temperature, the most common being Celsius (denoted °C; formerly called \\"centigrade\\"), Fahrenheit (denoted °F), and, especially in science, Kelvin (denoted K). - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - Natural language processing is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humancomputer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve: natural language understanding, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input; and others involve natural language generation. - In statistical thermodynamics, entropy (usual symbol ) (Greek:, + ) is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations that a thermodynamic system can have when in a state as specified by certain macroscopic variables. Specifically, assuming that each of the microscopic configurations is equally probable, the entropy of the system is the natural logarithm of that number of configurations, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant (which provides consistency with the original thermodynamic concept of entropy discussed below, and gives entropy the dimension of energy divided by temperature). Formally, - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\". Now this theory has found applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in ecology, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection. - In data mining, anomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset. Typically the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are also referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. - Signal processing is an enabling technology that encompasses the fundamental theory, applications, algorithms, and implementations of processing or transferring information contained in many different physical, symbolic, or abstract formats broadly designated as \\"signals\\". It uses mathematical, statistical, computational, heuristic, and linguistic representations, formalisms, and techniques for representation, modelling, analysis, synthesis, discovery, recovery, sensing, acquisition, extraction, learning, security, or forensics. - Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek \\"kryptós\\", \\"hidden, secret\\"; and \\"graphein\\", \\"writing\\", or \\"-logia\\", \\"study\\", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce. What entity does 'shannon's source coding theorem' has the relation 'named after' with?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose More animal farming increases pollution happens, how will it affect Trees grow bigger. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more animal farming increasing pollution can have a direct and indirect effect on the process of trees growing bigger. Direct effects: 1. Increased pollution from animal farming can lead to higher concentrations of harmful gases like nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and methane in the atmosphere. This can cause acid rains, which can damage the leaves of trees and hinder the photosynthesis process, affecting tree growth. 2. An increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere can actually boost photosynthesis in trees (up to a certain limit). However, the extra CO2 in the atmosphere can also contribute to global warming, which can negatively affect tree growth in the long term due to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. Indirect effects: 1. Animal farming can lead to land-use changes, such as deforestation, to make space for more farms and grazing areas. This directly reduces the number of trees available to grow bigger. 2. Water pollution caused by animal farming can impact trees too. If the water used by trees is polluted with contaminants like nitrates and phosphates from animal waste, it can affect the trees' ability to absorb and transport water efficiently, hindering their growth. 3. The groundwater table may get affected due to the excess withdrawal of water for animal farming activities, which will also have a negative impact on the growth of trees in that area. In conclusion, while an increase in atmospheric CO2 levels could theoretically boost photosynthesis, overall, the negative direct and indirect effects of more animal farming and pollution are likely to outweigh the potential benefits for tree growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its first widespread use was in the incandescent light bulb to protect the filament from chemical degradation. The chemical inertness produced by a vacuum is also useful for electron beam welding, cold welding, vacuum packing and vacuum frying. Ultra-high vacuum is used in the study of atomically clean substrates, as only a very good vacuum preserves atomic-scale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time (on the order of minutes to days). High to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air, allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination. This is the principle behind chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, and dry etching which are essential to the fabrication of semiconductors and optical coatings, and to surface science. The reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of thermos bottles. Deep vacuum lowers the boiling point of liquids and promotes low temperature outgassing which is used in freeze drying, adhesive preparation, distillation, metallurgy, and process purging.

It got to be a running joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any Cartwright men. After all Ben Cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage. And any woman who got involved with Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe were going to end up dying because we couldn't get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic TV western. Perhaps if Bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the Cartwrights. People have relationships, some go good, some not so good, it's just life. And we're less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don't have to kill the character off to keep the survivor's nobility intact. But that's if Bonanza were done today. But we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped, the secret of Bonanza's success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart sons. Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name. His whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense Ponderosa spread for his three children. The kids were all different in personality, but all came together in a pinch. The Cartwrights became and still are an American institution. I daresay more people cared about this family than the Kennedys. Just the popularity that Bonanza has in syndication testifies to that. Pernell Roberts as oldest son Adam was written out of the show. Rumor has it he didn't care for the noble Cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious. Perhaps if it were done now, he'd have liked it better in the way I describe. This was just the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people get three hit TV shows to their credit. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, most hot headed, but the most romantic of the Cartwrights. When Roberts left. the show kept going with the two younger sons, but when big Dan Blocker left, the heart went out of Bonanza. Other characters had been added on by that time, David Canary, Tim Matheson, and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel. But big, loyal, but a little thick Hoss was easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights. His sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family. So the Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have passed into history. I got a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. It doesn't look anything like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, just about where you see the Ponderosa on the map at the opening credits, is the Cartwright home, the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans, the ranchhouse and the Cartwrights are real. And if they weren't real, they should have been. Would you say this review is positive or negative?

Answer the following question: \\"Pallaseidae\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to? Answer:","completion":"The term \\"Pallaseidae\\" belongs to the category of animal. Pallaseidae is a family of bristle worms under the class Polychaeta. These marine worms are also referred to as scale worms due to their characteristic elytra or scales covering their dorsal surfaces which act as protection and aid in camouflage. They can be found in various aquatic environments, from tidal zones to deep-sea regions, and play essential roles in marine ecosystems. Polychaetes, in general, are a diverse and abundant group of segmented worms, with over 10,000 species identified to date. Among these, the family Pallaseidae is relatively less-studied, but recent taxonomic and molecular analyses have enhanced the understanding of their phylogeny and diversity. Members of the Pallaseidae family are typically small-sized and are known to inhabit coarse sediments like sand and gravel in their respective ecosystems. Their body plan consists of a number of segments, each with a pair of fleshy appendages known as parapodia, which assist in locomotion and respiration. These worms are often seen burrowing in the sediment or crawling across the surface as part of their feeding habits, which include scavenging, predation, and deposit feeding (consuming organic materials found on or within the sediment). Some species exhibit unique reproductive strategies, where individuals can regenerate lost body parts or reproduce asexually through fragmentation and subsequent regeneration. Thus, Pallaseidae is a family of bristle worms within the class Polychaeta, which are categorized under the broader group of animals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It brought the nation to a what? - shock - standstill - pain - scandal - controversy The best answer is Answer:","completion":"The best answer is \\"standstill.\\" When a nation hears an unexpected and confusing announcement, it can cause people to pause and try to understand the implications of this information. In some cases, the impact of a significant announcement might be so profound that it brings a nation to a standstill. This means that the normal course of life, business, and communication can slow down or stop temporarily as people process the event. A \\"shock\\" refers to a sudden, surprising event that may leave people feeling surprised or stunned. Although unexpected announcements can indeed shock individuals, the term \\"standstill\\" more accurately captures the idea of slowing or stopping the normal flow of activity in a nation. \\"Pain\\" is a feeling of discomfort or distress, and it usually refers to physical or emotional suffering. While a surprising announcement can cause emotional pain for some people, it is not the overall impact on a nation. A \\"scandal\\" implies something is morally or legally wrong, and it usually involves a high-profile individual or organization. While it is possible that the surprising announcement could lead to a scandal, this term does not effectively convey the idea of a nation slowing down or stopping activity to process the information. \\"Controversy\\" typically refers to a public debate or disagreement over an issue. While a surprising announcement can undoubtedly lead to controversy, this term does not fully describe the initial reaction that brings the nation to a standstill as people process the news.

(2) Octavian 's fleet was commanded by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa , while Antony 's fleet was supported by the power of Queen Cleopatra of Ptolemaic Egypt . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning. Both sentences highlight the commanders and supporters of the opposing fleets during a historical conflict. Here is a detailed comparison of the sentences with an explanation of why they mean the same thing: 1. The key component in both sentences is the mention of the Octavian fleet's commander, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, and the supporter of Antony's fleet, Queen Cleopatra of Ptolemaic Egypt. This information is consistent in both sentences, ensuring that the core meaning remains the same. 2. Sentence (1) uses the terms \\"Antonius\\" and \\"Antony\\" for the same person- Mark Antony, who was a Roman military leader and part of the Second Triumvirate. Sentence (2) uses an abbreviated form of \\"Antonius,\\" which is \\"Antony.\\" The different word choice does not affect the overall meaning as they both refer to the same person. 3. In both sentences, it is evident that the fleets of Octavian and Antony are at odds with each other. The mention of the two commanders, as well as their respective supporters, implies that they are on opposing sides. 4. Although sentence (1) states that Antony's fleet is \\"supported\\" by Queen Cleopatra's power, while sentence (2) states that his fleet is supported by \\"the power of Queen Cleopatra,\\" the meaning doesn't change. In both cases, it is clear that Cleopatra's influence and resources are backing Antony's fleet. Based on these points, it is reasonable to conclude that both sentences convey the same meaning by highlighting the commanders and supporters of the two opposing fleets, despite having slight differences in their structure and word choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick from: --No --Yes Answer:","completion":"Yes, you should validate the answer, as it is correct in stating that Ancient Greeks and Romans indeed distinguished between natural and artificial memory. However, the provided answer should be elaborated to include more information on mnemonic devices specifically. Mnemonic devices are learning techniques or memory aids that help individuals remember and recall information more efficiently. While the Ancient Greeks and Romans did distinguish between natural memory (unassisted memory) and artificial memory (memory aids or techniques), the term 'mnemonic devices' specifically refers to the methods that enhance artificial memory. Some commonly suggested mnemonic devices include: 1. Acronyms: Creating words from the first letters of a series of words to be remembered (e.g., 'USA' for 'United States of America') 2. Acrostics: Forming a sentence where the first letter of each word stands for another word in the sequence to remember (e.g., the sentence \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge\\" to recall the musical notes EGBDF on the lines of the treble clef) 3. Chunking: Breaking information into smaller, more manageable chunks (for example, remembering a phone number as 3 or 4 smaller groups rather than one long string of digits) 4. Visual Imagery: Associating certain information with vivid, mental images can make it easier to recall later 5. Rhymes: Creating memorable rhymes to assist in recalling information (e.g., \\"In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue\\") 6. The Method of Loci: Also known as the Memory Palace, where information is associated with a familiar location to aid in recall 7. Peg-Word Associations: Linking new information to known, easy-to-recall keywords or 'pegs' It is essential to provide more context about mnemonic devices rather than solely discussing the distinction between natural and artificial memory made by the Ancient Greeks and Romans.

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

Brad studied ancient human settlements from 100,000 years ago. His colleague Phil studied human settlement from 8-10,000 years ago. They were both fascinated by their findings. Hint: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly.

I had a stress heart attack five years ago. My step-son is a heroin addict. He will be on an opioid agonist for the rest of his life. His behavior mirrored the worst of what addicts do to a family. I was desperate to make a change, and my husband was desperate to save his son’s life. That meant having to watch my husband support my step-son as he abused me and my children. Multiple criminal behaviors, many times the police came to the house, two convictions, long-term parole. Watching him threaten to kill me, kill his father, and kill his younger brother and sister. Add to that a very stress job situation with a new boss who decided he needed a new VP, but had no basis to terminate my employment, so instead was determined to make my work life a living hell on earth. So, yep, I had a heart attack. I’m still angry at everything that led up to the heart attack. I’m working really hard on forgiving my husband, forgiving my step-son, and the overwhelming guilt of my children seeing me as an accomplice to their abuse. I found a new job, and then had the pleasure of seeing my former boss fired by the Board of Directors. Since then I find I’m hyper-vigilant in issues of child abuse, worker abuse, addiction, lying and deceit (Trump trigger), and feeling somewhat betrayed by my husband. I honestly think if it had been one of my children doing the abusing, I would have found a way to put my child into long-term rehab. I would not have pretended it wasn’t happening, or “not that bad” or other form of denial. As is, I lived through this hell for two years, and a part of me will never forgive for how it all came about. Probably TMI, sorry.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. German politics is suddenly looking a lot less predictable and potentially less stable. It's all because of the astonishing success of the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD). Many German voters appear rattled by the large numbers of refugees and migrants arriving in Germany - 1.1 million in 2015 alone. Politicians are now getting down to the nitty-gritty of coalition-building. But all the cards have been thrown up in the air so it's a question of seeing where they will settle. And it's going to get messy. Papers say Merkel 'paying price' Profile: Angela Merkel AfD leader Frauke Petry Each of the three regional premiers should be able to hang on to power. Popular Green party Premier Winfried Kretschmann, of the south-western state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has shown that the Greens' success in what used to be a conservative heartland is not just a blip from a 2011 election held in the aftermath of Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster. Centre-left SPD Premier Malu Dreyer, of Rhineland-Palatinate, confidently saw off the CDU's promising rising star Julia Kloeckner by rather bizarrely doing a better job at imitating Mrs Merkel's centrist stance on refugees than the chancellor's own candidate. CDU Premier Reiner Haseloff also held on in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, where AfD polled almost a quarter of the vote. But this is far from a continuation of the status quo. They will have to govern with new, and in some cases untested, coalition partners. Gone are the days of two major parties, one on the right, one on the left. German politics has become splintered. Smaller, more radical parties are gaining influence. And adventurous coalition combinations are now possible, including in Saxony-Anhalt, where a distinctly uncomfortable menage-a-trois between centre-right CDU, centre-left SPD and the left-wing Greens looks like the only feasible option. The right-wing AfD's tough populist talk has attracted voters angered by the influx of migrants, chipping away at the traditional support base on both the left and the right - conservative voters who are disenchanted with Angela Merkel's pro-refugee approach as well as blue-collar left-wingers who feel nervous that state spending on migrants will undermine their own position in society. The big question is what this means for Angela Merkel's stance on refugees. Closed borders along the Balkan route have effectively already slammed shut her open door invitation to Syrian refugees. But Mrs Merkel's pro-refugee rhetoric has barely changed. She still believes Germany, and indeed the rest of Europe, has a responsibility to shelter people fleeing war. She refuses to contemplate a cap on numbers coming to Germany. \\"We need a European solution and this solution needs time,\\" she told journalists in Berlin on Monday afternoon. So have these elections undermined Chancellor Merkel's leadership? Yes and no. The gains of the AfD will certainly embolden conservative critics within her own ranks, who accuse her of betraying right-wing values, by dragging her party to the centre-ground. Awkwardly, many of Mrs Merkel's supporters on the refugee issue are in opposing left-wing parties. Not a great help when it comes to managing her own political bloc. But Angela Merkel still has no credible rivals within her government and no other party or politician has yet come up with a popular viable solution for the migrant crisis either. Despite the success of the AfD, this election campaign has shown that her approach still enjoys the support of mainstream society. It was the candidates, whether on the left or the right, who backed her approach who won out. In Rhineland-Palatinate for example, voters were treated to the astonishing sight of a TV duel in which the centre-left Malu Dreyer argued with CDU Julia Kloeckner over who was most loyal to Mrs Merkel's position on refugees. It is not so much Angela Merkel who has been punished by these elections, as her increasingly divided government.","completion":"The success of the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in recent elections may lead to less predictable and stable German politics, as smaller, more radical parties gain influence and force new and untested coalition partnerships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Two rivers, The Minninnippi and The Cedar, flow into the same ocean. The Minninnippi is surrounded almost entirely by farm lands due its location in a flat area of the country that sees regular rainfall. The majority of these farms will have runoff from their crop soil flow into the river. The Cedar is located mostly inside an unpopulated forest. Currently, not much industrialization or settling by humans has happened near The Cedar. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will the ocean water near The Minninnippi or The Cedar have less oxygen? Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Answer:","completion":"The ocean water near The Minninnippi will likely have less oxygen as compared to the water near The Cedar. This conclusion is based on the factors affecting each river's surrounding environment and their impacts on oxygen levels in the ocean. The Minninnippi River is bordered by extensive farmlands, which makes it susceptible to runoff from the agricultural activities taking place on those lands. Agriculture is one of the primary sources of marine pollution due to the heavy usage of fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals. When these substances are washed into the river by rain or irrigation, they enter the body of water and ultimately flow into the ocean. As the hint states, an excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals contributes to hypoxia, a condition where oxygen levels become very low, and the creation of dead zones in the water. Dead zones are areas where the oxygen concentration is so low that it cannot support most marine life, leading to mass die-offs of fish and other aquatic organisms. Additionally, runoff from livestock and human waste in the farmlands alongside The Minninnippi River can introduce organic matter and nutrients into the water, further depleting oxygen levels when bacteria decompose this material and consume oxygen in the process. On the other hand, The Cedar River flows mainly through an unpopulated forest, indicating that it has minimal exposure to human interference, industrialization, or large-scale agricultural activities. Consequently, the river is likely to have much lower levels of pollutants and oxygen-depleting substances entering the water system, which means that ocean water near The Cedar is likely to have comparatively higher levels of dissolved oxygen. In conclusion, the ocean water near The Minninnippi is expected to have less oxygen than the ocean water near The Cedar, mainly due to the heightened presence of agricultural runoff and other pollutants associated with farming activities. Conversely, the unpopulated nature of The Cedar's environment suggests that it is better preserved and less impacted by human activities, resulting in higher levels of dissolved oxygen in the ocean nearby."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The tweet itself merely indicates a action or situation and does not explicitly express the user's mood, feelings, opinions or attitudes towards their visit to the dentist. Such a tweet indicates an event rather than an emotion. However, sentiment analysis often goes beyond the written text to infer deeper meanings. Depending on the audience's personal experiences or cultural factors, it could be potentially painted with different sentiments. For some people, a dental visit might arouse negative sentiment due to the potential discomfort, fear or dread linked to dental procedures. The anticipation of discomfort or pain often associated with dentist visits could interpret this tweet as carrying a slightly negative sentiment. On the other hand, if a tweeter has a particularly positive philosophy towards healthcare or personal hygiene, this could possibly carry a positive sentiment, showing responsible behavior regarding dental health. However, this interpretation would be less common as it demands more context or personal information about the tweeter. Overall, without further context or clues like emojis, accompanying text, punctuation style or previous tweets that could provide broader context about the user's feelings towards dental visits, one should assume a neutral sentiment for this tweet, as it only provides factual information without an explicit expression of sentiment."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Instead of steaks, she got sweet potatoes to eat because the","completion":"price difference was significant and she needed to save money. As a smart and resourceful individual, Jill had learned that sweet potatoes were not only a healthier option, providing more fiber and essential nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin C, and manganese, but they were also incredibly versatile, allowing her to create various delicious dishes that would satisfy her cravings and still remain within her financial limits. Despite being initially dismayed about not having her favorite meal of steak, she embraced the challenge of working with sweet potatoes, knowing that it would not only help her save money, but also encourage her to adopt a healthier eating habit that might lead to positive long-term benefits. To ensure she wouldn't get bored of her newfound staple, Jill decided to explore different cooking methods such as boiling, roasting, or baking, as well as experimenting with various recipes that incorporated diverse flavors and textures, inspired by numerous cuisines from around the world. Her culinary journey began with some simple yet satisfying dishes, like sweet potato fries seasoned with garlic and paprika, roasted sweet potato wedges accompanied by a tangy yogurt dip, or a comforting bowl of creamy sweet potato soup garnished with crunchy croutons and fresh cilantro. As she gained more confidence in her cooking skills, Jill started to venture into more complex recipes, such as spicy sweet potato and black bean enchiladas, Thai-inspired sweet potato curry, or a light and refreshing sweet potato noodle salad tossed in a zesty lime dressing. Throughout this process, she discovered that sweet potatoes could easily serve as a hearty base for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, making it a perfect option whenever she wanted to reduce her meat consumption or simply enjoy a meat-free meal. In fact, on some occasions, she would even manage to treat herself to a small portion of her beloved steak while still using the affordable and nutrient-dense sweet potatoes as a side dish, enabling her to indulge in her favorite meal without jeopardizing her budget. Jill also enjoyed sharing her newfound love for sweet potatoes with her friends and family, who were equally impressed by the diverse range of flavors and textures she could achieve with this humble yet versatile vegetable. They would often gather around the dining table, excitedly sampling her latest creations, laughing, and exchanging cooking tips and stories, making it evident that budget-friendly sweet potatoes had brought more than just financial savings into her life – they had nurtured new memories, connections, and unforgettable experiences, all underpinned by the simple yet profound act of cooking and sharing a meal. Ultimately, Jill's decision to embrace sweet potatoes as an alternative to steaks proved to be more than just a financially motivated choice. What began as a budget-inspired compromise quickly evolved into a rewarding journey of culinary exploration, healthier eating habits, strengthened relationships, and personal growth, demonstrating that sometimes, life's unexpected challenges can pave the way for the most gratifying and transformative experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The format can be seen as a more contemporary successor to and combination of the middle of the road (MOR), beautiful music, easy listening and soft rock formats. Many stations in the soft AC format capitalize on its appeal to office workers (many of them females aged 25–54, a key advertiser demographic), and brand themselves as stations \\"everyone at work can agree on\\" (KOST originated that phrase as a primary tagline, and other soft AC stations have followed suit).\\" Answer:","completion":"In the given context, the names mentioned - \\"Warm\\", \\"Sunny\\", \\"Bee\\" (or \\"B\\") and \\"EZ Rock\\" are references to the soft Adult Contemporary (AC) music format which is a blend of middle of the road (MOR), beautiful music, easy listening and soft rock genres. This format of music is particularly popular among office workers, especially women aged 25-54 as it serves as a soothing, unintrusive background sound. In the US and heavily in Canada, these stations often brand themselves as something everyone in the office can agree on for a peaceful work environment.

When he later accrues a 3,200 gambling debt to her, Consuelo agrees to hire him as her secretary to work off what he owes her. One of Terry's duties is to assume the role of her fiancé in order to discourage the insistent attention of Tony Barling, to whom Consuelo once was engaged, and to keep her from succumbing to her former beau's charms. Tony refuses to believe she loves someone else, and, when he recognizes Terry from the casino, his suspicions are aroused, despite Terry's outward displays of affection for Consuelo. Tony convinces her to join him on a friend's yacht, but Terry reminds her of his responsibility, and keeps her from going.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Toby Harnden. PUBLISHED:. 18:09 EST, 12 July 2012. |. UPDATED:. 18:09 EST, 12 July 2012. The Romney campaign has accused Barack Obama of being a serial liar and the President’s aides hit back by suggesting the Republican candidate might have committed a felony as the 2012 election reached new heights of rancour. After weeks of Republicans urging Mr Romney to hit back hard at attacks on his record at Bain Capital, his campaign released a new television ad entitled ‘No Evidence’ accusing Mr Obama of deceit in claiming that the former Massachusetts governor shipped jobs overseas while heading the venture capital firm. The ad, which will run in several battleground states, asks voters: ‘When a president doesn't tell the truth, how can we trust him to lead?’ The press release which accompanied the ad in an email to journalists also referred to Mr Obama's ‘lies and exaggerations’. Under fire: Mitt Romney has been accused by the Obama campaign of committing a felony by lying in regulatory documents about his employment at Bain Capital. But Mr Romney found himself on the defensive over a Boston Globe article citing federal documents filed by Bain Capital that conflicted with the presumptive Republican nominee’s statements about when he left Bain Capital. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2001, Bain Capital listed Mr Romney as the company's ‘sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president’. It said Mr Romney's ‘principal occupation’ was as Bain's managing director. Mr Romney's campaign, backed up by a number of independent fact checkers, has repeatedly said Mr Romney had almost nothing to do with the company's operations after February 1999, when he began work on the imperilled 2002 Winter Olympic Games. Andrea Saul, Mr Romney’s spokeswoman, said that her boss ‘left Bain Capital in February of 1999 to run the Olympics, and had no input on investments or management of companies after that point’. Accusation: The Romney campaign has suggested that President Obama is lying about Bain in campaign ads. The significance of the period from 1999 to 2001 is that it covers the time when Bain oversaw investments that either sent jobs abroad or filed for bankruptcy. It's also when Mr Romney stated in federal disclosure forms that he was not active in Bain Capital. For example, in late 1999, Bain-controlled Steam International set up overseas call centres, and a subsidiary moved jobs from California to Mexico. The following year, the Ampad company declared bankruptcy. In 2001, the steel maker GS Industries also fell to bankruptcy as Bain made 58.4million from its investment. Republicans fear that the relentless attacks on Mr Romney, who is worth more than 250million, over his time at Bain Capital, his failure to release tax returns, his investments in Swiss bank accounts, Bermuda and the Caymans are defining him as an out-of-touch plutocrat. The two presidential campaigns dispute how many American jobs were affected but the Romney campaign's line all along has been that it is irrelevant because Mr Romney wasn't involved in the company’s decisions for that period. Stephanie Cutter, Mr Obama's deputy campaign manager, said that Mr Romney may have committed a felony if he misrepresented his role at Bain on the SEC documents. And if he was running Bain after 1999, Ms Cutter said, Mr Romney hasn't been truthful with the public. ‘If that's the case, if he was lying to the American people, then that's a real character and trust issue,’ she said. Matt Rhoades, Mr Romney’s campaign manager, issued a blistering statement in response. ‘President Obama's campaign hit a new low today when one of its senior advisers made a reckless and unsubstantiated charge to reporters about Mitt Romney that was so over the top that it calls into question the integrity of their entire campaign,’ he said. ‘President Obama ought to apologize for the out-of-control behaviour of his staff, which demeans the office he holds. Campaigns are supposed to be hard fought, but statements like those made by Stephanie Cutter belittle the process and the candidate on whose behalf she works.’ What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"This article is about an argument between the campaigns of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. Obama's campaign accuses Mitt Romney of not being honest about his time at Bain Capital and maybe even committing a legal mistake. Mitt Romney's campaign says that Barack Obama is not telling the truth and asks how people can trust him to lead the country. Both campaigns are arguing about when Romney left Bain Capital and if he was responsible for decisions made during that time.

Choose your answer: If \\"Two girls are performing tricks on a trampoline.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The girls are jumping on the trampoline\\"? [a]. yes [b]. it is not possible to tell [c]. no","completion":"[a]. Yes It logically follows that \\"The girls are jumping on the trampoline\\" when given the information that \\"Two girls are performing tricks on a trampoline.\\" To understand the reasoning behind this answer, let's first break down the given statement and analyze the components. The statement, \\"Two girls are performing tricks on a trampoline,\\" tells us three things: 1. There are two girls involved. 2. These girls are performing tricks. 3. These tricks are being performed on a trampoline. Now, let's focus on the second part of the statement: the girls are performing tricks. When we think about trampolines, the most common way to perform tricks or maneuvers is through jumping. Trampolines provide the bounce and airtime necessary to execute various forms of flips, twists, and other aerial moves. Jumping is the essential action on a trampoline that makes it possible to perform any tricks. While there could be other ways to incorporate the trampoline into a trick or performance without specifically jumping, these alternative tricks are a rare exception and not the norm. For example, one could sit down on the trampoline and perform a somersault without their feet leaving the trampoline, but this is not the typical image that comes to mind when we think of \\"performing tricks on a trampoline.\\" Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that jumping is involved in the girls' tricks based on the given statement. It is logical to assume that the girls are jumping on the trampoline in order to execute these maneuvers and perform the tricks they are participating in. In conclusion, given the context and information provided in the statement, it logically follows that \\"the girls are jumping on the trampoline.\\" The action of jumping is a necessary component of most trampoline tricks and the primary quality associated with trampoline use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Math Problem Solve 97*r - 167*r - 785 = -155 for r.","completion":"To solve the equation 97*r - 167*r - 785 = -155 for r, we start by simplifying the terms containing the variable r: 97*r - 167*r = (97 - 167)*r = -70*r Now, the equation can be written as: -70*r - 785 = -155 Next step is to isolate the term with the variable r, so we'll add 785 to both sides of the equation: -70*r - 785 + 785 = -155 + 785 -70*r = 630 Now, to solve for r, we will divide both sides of the equation by -70: (-70*r) / -70 = 630 / -70 r = -9 Therefore, the solution for the given equation is r = -9."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Hound of the Baskervilles is a 1978 British comedy film spoofing \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It starred Peter Cook as Sherlock Holmes and Dudley Moore as Dr. Watson. A number of other well-known British comedy actors appeared in the film including Terry-Thomas (in his final screen appearance), Kenneth Williams and Denholm Elliott. Can we infer the following? The Hound of the Baskervilles is an action thriller.","completion":"Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" (1978) is an action thriller. While the original novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, upon which the film is based, is a mystery and suspense novel, the 1978 film adaptation is described as a British comedy film spoofing the original story. The presence of well-known British comedy actors like Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Terry-Thomas, Kenneth Williams, and Denholm Elliott in the film further supports the comedic nature of this adaptation. The original story of \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" does contain elements of action and thriller, as it follows Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson investigating a mysterious and potentially supernatural hound that is believed to be responsible for the death of a wealthy landowner. This investigation leads them into a complex web of secrets and lies, putting them in dangerous situations, which could classify the story as an action thriller. However, the 1978 film version takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to the material, opting for a satirical and humorous portrayal rather than maintaining the suspenseful and thrilling atmosphere of the original novel. Since the film is a comedy spoof, it can be assumed that it relies heavily on humor, slapstick, and parody to engage the audience, rather than the action-packed, thrilling moments that are associated with the action thriller genre. In conclusion, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the 1978 film \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is an action thriller. Instead, we can accurately describe it as a British comedy film spoofing the original story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, with a focus on humor, satire, and parody."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door.

Choices: - budding - glycolysis - pollination - photosynthesis A: The answer is:","completion":"The answer is: Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight into chemical energy in the form of glucose (food) and oxygen. This process primarily occurs in the leaves of plants, where chlorophyll (a green pigment) and other accessory pigments are present. During photosynthesis, plants capture sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, and water (H2O) from the soil. These elements are then converted into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2) through a series of complex reactions. Glucose provides the plants with energy for growth and maintenance, while oxygen is released as a byproduct, serving as a critical source of oxygen for other living organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: A:","completion":"The tone of this product review can be described as mostly positive with a hint of defensive. The author begins the review by addressing the video quality concerns they have seen in other reviews and decides to check out the video for themselves. They quickly remind readers that these videos were made in the 80's when DVDs, HD, and 1080p did not exist, which sets the stage for their defense of the video quality. The author goes on to state that the video quality is good and that there is a noticeable difference when compared to newer videos, but they claim that other viewers' expectations were overdrawn. This implies that the author believes the video quality of this product is satisfactory, but other people may be overly critical due to modern expectations. The mention of \\"Madonna lovers\\" may also indicate that this product review is geared towards a particular audience – those who are fans of Madonna. The review further praises the product, emphasizing that it is a collection worth having and noting their own longtime appreciation for the Queen of Pop. The author is particularly interested in watching the transformation unfold from the beginning to the end of the videos. Overall, while the review does bring up concerns about video quality, it primarily focuses on praising the content and defending the product against what the author perceives as unfair criticism. The tone, therefore, leans more towards positive, with an edge of defensiveness against detractors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

After the Congress of Vienna, Austria and Prussia emerged as two competitors. Austria, trying to remain the dominant power in Central Europe, led the way in the terms of the Congress of Vienna. The Congress of Vienna was essentially conservative, assuring that little would change in Europe and preventing Germany from uniting. These terms came to a sudden halt following the Revolutions of 1848 and the Crimean War in 1856, paving the way for German unification in the 1860s. By the 1820s, large numbers of Jewish German women had intermarried with Christian German men and had converted to Christianity.

Article: Rivers are one of our most important natural resources . Many of the world's great cities are located on rivers, and almost every country has at least one river running through it that plays an important part in the lives of its people. Since the beginning of history, people have used rivers for transportation. The longest one in the United States is the Mississippi. The lifeline of Egypt is the Nile. To the people of India, the Ganges is great, but it is also important for transportation; ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeastern Asia. The greatest of all for navigation , however, is the Amazon in Brazil . It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles up it. Besides transportation, rivers give food to eat, water to drink, water for crops, and chances for fun. In order to increase the supply of water for crops, engineers sometimes build a dam across a river and let a lake form behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. However, large cities and industries that are located on rivers often cause problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals and other materials. People are learning the importance, however, of doing more to keep their rivers clean if they want to enjoy the benefits of these natural resources.

Passage:After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the rivalry between Iran and Pakistan intensified. After 1989, both state's policies in Afghanistan became even more divergent as Pakistan, under Benazir Bhutto, explicitly supported Taliban forces in Afghanistan. This resulted in a major breach, with Iran becoming closer to India. Pakistan's support for the Sunni Taliban organisation in Afghanistan became a problem for Shia Iran which opposed a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The Pakistani backed Taliban fought the Iranian backed Northern Alliance in Afghanistan and gained control of 90 percent of that country. As noted by a Pakistani foreign service officer, it was difficult to maintain good relations with Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Iran at the same time, given Iran's long history of rivalry with these states. In 1995 Bhutto paid a lengthy state visit to Iran, which greatly relaxed relations. At a public meeting she spoke highly of Iran and Iranian society. However, increasing activity by Shia militants in Pakistan strained relations further. This was followed by the Taliban's capture of the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998, in which thousands of Shias were massacred, according to Amnesty International. The most serious breach in relations came in 1998, after Iran accused Taliban Afghanistan of taking 11 Iranian diplomats, 35 Iranian truck drivers and an Iranian journalist hostage, and later killing them all. Iran massed over 300,000 troops on the Afghan border and threatened to attack the Taliban government, which it had never recognized. This strained relations with Pakistan, as the Taliban were seen as Pakistan's key allies. In May 1998, Iran criticised Pakistan for its nuclear testing in the Chagai region, and held Pakistan accountable for global \\"atomic proliferation\\". New Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif acknowledged his country's nuclear capability on 7 September 1997.

As blood flow increases, it also helps deliver more nutrients and oxygen to tissues, promoting overall health and well-being. 4. Regular exercise can strengthen the kidneys, helping them work more effectively at filtering out waste products. 5. Since the kidneys play a major role in removing bad waste from the body, their improved efficiency due to exercise would mean that less bad waste would accumulate in the body. 6.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Drinking water is good for your health. There are some scientific ways of drinking water. 1. It is the best medicine to drink two glasses of water in the morning. 2. Drink clean water. 3. Drink the water that has not been boiled. Many people think boiled water is safe and good to people's health. In fact, it is not true. The boiling point of water is 100degC. By boiling it, most bacteria in water can be killed. In the past, the water was less polluted. So boiling was a good way to make clean water. But heavy metals and other dangerous things in today's water are much more terrible than bacteria. Boiling doesn't fix that problem. And boiling water may give us more of the dangerous things in our glass. 4. Never use soft drinks to take the place of water. 5. Water is also needed in winter. 6. Drink water at the right time. 1) After getting up in the morning, you have less water in your body, because you weren't drinking for the whole night. So you should drink some water to keep your health after getting up in the morning. That can prevent high blood pressure, cerebral hemorrhages and so on. 2) Drinking water at about 10 am helps your body keep enough water. 3) Drinking water at about 3 pm can clean out the wastes in your body. 4) About eight o'clock in the evening is the best time to drink water. Your blood gets thicker when you sleep. Water will make your blood less thick. Besides, we should drink 2L of water every day. Water is so important for our life. We should drink water often.

The painting known as Queen Elizabeth going in procession to Blackfriars in 1601, or simply The Procession Picture (see illustration), is now often accepted as the work of Peake. The attribution was made by Roy Strong, who called it \\"one of the great visual mysteries of the Elizabethan age\\". It is an example of the convention, prevalent in the later part of her reign, of painting Elizabeth as an icon, portraying her as much younger and more triumphant than she was. As Strong puts it, \\"[t]his is Gloriana in her sunset glory, the mistress of the set piece, of the calculated spectacular presentation of herself to her adoring subjects\\". George Vertue, the eighteenth-century antiquarian, called the painting \\"not well nor ill done\\".Strong reveals that the procession was connected to the marriage of Henry Somerset, Lord Herbert, and Lady Anne Russell, one of the queen's six maids of honour, on 16 June 1600. He identifies many of the individuals portrayed in the procession and shows that instead of a litter, as was previously assumed, Queen Elizabeth is sitting on a wheeled cart or chariot. Strong also suggests that the landscape and castles in the background are not intended to be realistic. In accordance with Elizabethan stylistic conventions, they are emblematic, here representing the Welsh properties of Edward Somerset, Earl of Worcester, to which his son Lord Herbert was the heir. The earl may have commissioned the picture to celebrate his appointment as Master of the Queen's Horse in 1601.Peake clearly did not paint the queen, or indeed the courtiers, from life but from the \\"types\\" or standard portraits used by the workshops of the day. Portraits of the queen were subject to restrictions, and from about 1594 there seems to have been an official policy that she always be depicted as youthful. In 1594, the Privy council ordered that unseemly portraits of the queen be found and destroyed, since they caused Elizabeth \\"great offence\\".

However, the evil Red Fairy (Sylvia Miles) is left off the guest list because there are only eight golden dinner plates and nine fairies in the kingdom. Enraged, she crashes the christening ceremony and curses the Princess to prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. The wise White Fairy (Jane Wiedlin), who was tardy and therefore unable to bestow her gift, changes the curse into a spell in which the Princess will fall into a deep sleep for one hundred years and be awakened by the kiss of true love. Meanwhile, the King orders that all the spinning wheels in the kingdom to be destroyed, except for one which is hidden and seemingly forgotten, to try to save his daughter from the fearsome curse.

Summarize: Winger Anthony Knockaert fired the Seagulls ahead early on, with a low 20-yard effort into the corner. Sam Baldock slotted the ball in to double the lead just before the break. Matej Vydra headed against the outside of the post for Derby, before Glenn Murray bundled in his 18th goal of the campaign from Knockaert's cross to seal Brighton's 14th home win of the season. The Seagulls remain second in the table with an inferior goal difference to Newcastle, but now have a nine-point buffer to Huddersfield in third - albeit the Terriers have two games in hand. Of their nine matches left, eight are against sides in the bottom half of the table as they look to return to the top flight for the first time since 1982-83. Following a trip to play-off chasing Leeds next Saturday, April's fixture list is kind to Chris Hughton's men with home games against Blackburn, Birmingham, Wigan and Bristol City. Their outstanding frontline of Murray, Baldock and Knockaert have now scored 42 Championship goals between them this campaign, and gave Derby's defenders a torrid time with their pace, movement and clinical finishing. Former Leicester forward Knockaert was instrumental in most of Brighton's attacking play, bending home a superb effort to open the scoring and seeing Scott Carson tip over his fierce second-half strike. The Rams started with former England pair Darren Bent and David Nugent up front, but Brighton's defence were rarely troubled in keeping their 19th clean sheet of the season. Derby, who are 10th and 10 points behind sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday, have now only picked up six points from their past nine matches and their play-off hopes appear to be over for another season. Brighton manager Chris Hughton: \\"We now have 77 points and there is no points target from our last nine games. \\"We've got some tough games coming up and everybody is fighting. But we're on the back of a really good performance against a really good side tonight. We were very good from start to finish. \\"The timing of the first goal was pivotal, the second just before half-time lifted us and we were able to take that on in the second half.\\" Derby County boss Steve McClaren: \\"It was a lesson for my team and this showed how far Brighton have come. They are going up for certain. Murray was a great signing and Brighton are a team that are going up. The gap showed. \\"It was a reality check for us. We have played three games in a week and we couldn't deal with the physicality of that. \\"That is the benchmark of where we need to go. In the 16 months I was away teams have really kicked on in terms of physicality. The league has kicked on. We need to learn the lessons and kick on ourselves.\\" McClaren on his future at Derby: \\"I am confident I can take it on, absolutely. We need to take the club on to the next level and from one day we knew that. \\"The chairman wants Derby in the Premier League. We have all the resources and don't need to panic.

With the NES, Nintendo also changed the relationship of console manufacturers and third-party software developers by restricting developers from publishing and distributing software without licensed approval.

A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played.

But to suggest that we've abandoned him or anybody ... is simply incorrect and not helpful,\\" Kerry told ABC's \\"This Week.\\" \\"The fact is that I have personally raised the issue, not only at the highest level that I have been involved with, but also through other intermediaries.\\" Levinson disappeared in Iran in March 2007 during a business trip, purportedly undertaken as a private investigator looking into cigarette smuggling. However, The Associated Press and the Washington Post reported Thursday that contrary to what the State Department and Levinson's family have said for years, Levinson actually was working for the CIA in Iran. And a source involved in the matter told CNN there's proof that Levinson worked for the CIA undercover, and under contract, while also working as a private investigator. White House: Levinson not a government employee when he made Iran trip. That allegation doesn't sit well with Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who is on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. \\"What disturbs me is apparently they did not tell the truth to the Congress.

During a September interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was asked what he could tell Levinson's family. \\"We don't know where he is, who he is,\\" Rouhani said. \\"He is an American who has disappeared. We have no news of him.\\" McCain: CIA did not tell Congress the truth about Levinson. Kerry said the United States is still looking for proof that Levinson is alive. A \\"number of different channels\\" are \\"being worked aggressively,\\" he said. Iran's previous president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said he was willing to help find Levinson, and the family received what then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described in 2010 as \\"proof of life.\\" In 2011, the State Department said new evidence suggested that Levinson, who has diabetes and high blood pressure, was alive and being held somewhere in southwest Asia. This year, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN, \\"We have every reason to believe that he's alive and that the Iranians control his fate.\\" Asked whether he believes the Iranian government is responsible for Levinson's disappearance, Kerry said he thinks the government \\"has the ability to help us here, and we hope they will.\\" McCain said he was \\"confident we are doing everything that we can\\" to get Levinson released from Iran,. He added that any negotiations in Levinson's case should also include attempts to free other Americans who are believed to be in Iranian custody.

The Esquisses of 1861 are a set of highly varied miniatures, ranging from the tiny 18-bar no. 4, Les cloches (The Bells), to the strident tone clusters of no. 45, Les diablotins (The Imps), and closing with a further evocation of church bells in no. 49, Laus Deo (Praise God). They were preceded in publication by Alkan's deceptively titled Sonatine, Op. 61, in 'classical' format, but a work of \\"ruthless economy [which] although it plays for less than twenty minutes ... is in every way a major work.\\"Two of Alkan's substantial works from this period are musical paraphrases of literary works. Salut, cendre du pauvre, Op. 45 (1856), follows a section of the poem La Mélancolie by Gabriel-Marie Legouvé; while Super flumina Babylonis, Op. 52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of Psalm 137 (\\"By the waters of Babylon ...\\"). This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which is believed to be the sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces. Alkan's publications for organ or pédalier commenced with his Benedictus, Op. 54 (1859). In the same year he published a set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes (1859, without opus number), which, in Smith's opinion, \\"seem to stand outside the barriers of time and space\\", and which he believes reveal \\"Alkan's essential spiritual modesty.\\" These were followed by pieces such as the 13 Prières (Prayers), Op. 64 (1865), and the Impromptu sur le Choral de Luther \\"Un fort rempart est notre Dieu\\" , op. 69 (1866). Alkan also issued a book of 12 studies for the pedalboard alone (no opus number, 1866) and the Bombardo-carillon for pedalboard duet (four feet) of 1872.Alkan's return to the concert platform at his Petits Concerts, however, marked the end of his publications; his final work to be issued was the Toccatina, Op. 75, in 1872.","completion":"The name of the person who believes that the set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes, published in 1859, reveal \\"Alkan's essential spiritual modesty\\" is Smith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - DVD (an abbreviation of \\"digital versatile disc\\" or \\"digital video disc\\") is a digital optical disc storage format invented and developed by Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Panasonic in 1995. The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using DVD players. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions. - Monty Python (sometimes known as The Pythons) were a British surreal comedy group who created their sketch comedy show \\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\\", which first aired on the BBC in 1969. Forty-five episodes were made over four series. The Python phenomenon developed from the television series into something larger in scope and impact, including touring stage shows, films, numerous albums, several books, and a stage musical. The Pythons' influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles' influence on music. The \\"Orlando Sentinel\\" referred to their sketch show as \\"not only one of the more enduring icons of 1970s British popular culture, but also an important moment in the evolution of television comedy.\\" - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - Fingerprince is an album by The Residents . The album was recorded between 1974 -- 76 and released in 1977 . It was intended to be a three - sided record named Tourniquet Of Roses . Due to expense , the project was abandoned and cut down to a regular two - sided album . The third side was originally released separately in 1979 as Babyfingers . For the CD release of Fingerprince , all of the songs from Babyfingers which were originally supposed to be part of the album were included in their original running order . The 1995 Euro Ralph CD reissue of Fingerprince kept the original track order from the vinyl , but included the complete Babyfingers as a bonus 3 \`\` CD with the album . - Ralph Records was the Residents' original record label, the name coming from the slang phrase for vomiting, \\"calling Ralph on the porcelain telephone\\". - Babyfingers was a release by the avant garde/experimental rock band The Residents, containing music written for their 1977 album, \\"Fingerprince\\". As \\"Fingerprince\\" was originally meant to be a three-sided album (a concept abandoned due to expense and Monty Python's \\"Matching Tie and Handkerchief\\" beating them to the punch), much of the material was abandoned and the third side remained unfinished until November 1977 although most tracks from the EP was shown at the Residents Radio Special in September 1977. Thus, the group reduced the third side to an extended play record entitled '\\"Babyfingers'\\", and released it in 1979 to people who had been waiting for their copy of \\"The Third Reich and Roll\\" box sets. A second printing was made for members of the W.E.I.R.D. fan club in 1981, and a last pressing, on pink vinyl, in 1985. For the most part, it has been incorporated into most CD versions of \\"Fingerprince\\", beginning in 1988. - The Residents are an American art collective best known for avant-garde music and multimedia works. Since their first official release, \\"Meet the Residents\\" (1974), the group has released over sixty albums, numerous music videos and short films, three CD-ROM projects, and ten DVDs. They have undertaken seven major world tours and scored multiple films. Pioneers in exploring the potential of CD-ROM and similar technologies, the Residents have won several awards for their multimedia projects.

During the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, huge stockpiles of uranium were amassed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, an estimated 600 short tons (540 metric tons) of highly enriched weapons grade uranium (enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads) have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states. Police in Asia, Europe, and South America on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium, most of which was from ex-Soviet sources. From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program, operated by the federal government of the United States, spent approximately US 550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia. This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities. Scientific American reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair. According to an interview from the article, one facility had been storing samples of enriched (weapons grade) uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project; another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box.

Product review: I was disappointed with this book, as it seemed to start to lead somewhere, and then wander off. I first thought the abrupt change in the daughter's behaviour, that leads to her being mentally ill was just not quite right in the description. She was perfect one moment, the child from hell the next. She returns from camp with a navel piercing: no professional would do that for a 14 year old and it is practically impossible to do yourself. Then there was the accident, it seemed almost as if Kate was going to admit she was on drugs or drinking when it happened,but she never did. It seemed a little too trite considering the heavy tone of the writing in the aftermath. However, the description of the borderline personality mother was perfection in itself: how they ruin the lives of others. That alone was worth the read. Rest of it was just below average. Also, as it was called Family History, it never linked the mental illness to the family, in my estimation.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let's go step-by-step through the process and see whether less moisture evaporation has a direct or indirect effect on body cooling: 1. Body temperature rises: This is the initial trigger for the process, and it is not affected by the perturbation hypothesis. 2. The brain tells blood vessels to dilate: This step occurs as a direct response to the rising body temperature and is also not affected by the hypothesis. 3. The sweat glands become active: This step occurs due to the signals from the brain, and it is not affected by the perturbation hypothesis. 4. Moisture is released from the pores: This step occurs as the sweat glands become active, and it is also not affected by the hypothesis. 5. The moisture evaporates: This is the step in which the perturbation hypothesis comes into play. Suppose less moisture evaporates, it means less heat will be removed from the body during the evaporation process. 6. The evaporation causes cooling: If less moisture evaporates, it would result in a reduced cooling effect. Consequently, this will have a direct effect on body cooling.

Social Networking Trends from Coast to Coast Residents of Massachusetts and California led the nation in googling the term “social networking” during the last 12 months according to Google Insights for Search, a new search analysis tool. Launched on August 6, Google Insights for Search is a free service that allows users to track the popularity of phrases and words that have been typed into Google’s search engine from 2004 until the present day. The resource enables users to sort data by country, sub-region, time and industry. The application also includes heat maps that display the geographic location of where terms are most popular, the top searches related to a term or phrase, and the fastest rising searches. As of August 8, Massachusetts and California each had a search volume index or SVI of 100 for regional interest in social networking, tops in the nation for the past 12 months. The term “search volume index” or SVI is a measurement that reflects how many searches have been done for a particular term, relative to the total number of searches done on Google over time. Rounding out the top ten were New York (SVI=96), the District of Columbia (96), Washington (88), Maryland (86), Illinois (84), Georgia (80), New Jersey (80) and Utah (80). Nationwide, the top three related searches to social networking were “social networking sites,” “social networking site,” and “social network.” The fastest rising searches were “social networking trends,” “social networking tools,” and “social networking scripts.” By city, Google searches for the term “social networking” was highest in Pleasanton (SVI=100), a suburb of San Francisco. Close behind were New York (92), San Francisco (91), Austin (76), Washington (76), Los Angeles (73), Boston (71), Reston (69), Chicago (66) and Atlanta (63). Also of interest: How search volumes for the term “social networking” have changed over time. After periods of relatively minimal interest for the term in 2004 and 2005, search volumes took off in first quarter 2006 and peaked in November, 2007. After a sharp dip in December, 2007, search volumes have shown steady upward growth throughout the first half of 2008. Google cautions that the results show the likelihood of users in a particular area to Google search a term on a relative basis. In this case, just because a particular city, say Minneapolis, didn’t rank in the top ten, it could mean Minneapolis residents don’t use Google to search for social networking information (maybe Yahoo? MSN?). They may also use a different phrase or term to search for social networking information (social media? Facebook?). Another caveat: I suspect Google hasn’t worked out all the bugs in the data just yet, but they’re not letting on. Case in point: On August 7, I used Google Insights for Search to track regional interest by state for the term “social networking” in the last 12 months On August 8, just 24 hours later, I ran the same search, and the results were significantly different. Why the big differences in the ranking and the scores, especially if the results captured data from the last 12 months? Small sample size? Data glitch? Human error? Maybe it was an issue at my end with my Internet connection. Perhaps I misunderstood something? A difference of one day shouldn’t make that much of an impact in the rankings, right? My suspicion is that Google launched this application only a day or so before and they’re still tinkering with its algorithms and ranking systems. The designers should get a pass on this one, but we should be on the lookout for similar inconsistencies in the future. If a year or even six months from now, we’re seeing the same kind of significant fluctuations in day to day results for the same search over a one year period or longer, it may be time to raise some red flags. New York Leads Nation in Googling “Facebook” The application was also used to track Google search statistics for leading social networking brands in the last 12 months. At a state level, Google searches for the brand “Facebook” were highest in New York, Arkansas and Connecticut. At a city level, searches were highest in New York City, Sterling and Milpitas. California Leads Nation in Googling “YouTube” At a state level, Google searches for the brand “YouTube” were highest in California, Virginia and Hawaii in the last 12 months. At a metro level, searches were highest in Milpitas, Sterling and Los Angeles. Oregon Leads Nation in Googling “Twitter” At a state level, Google searches for the brand “Twitter” were highest in Oregon, California and Washington in the last 12 months. Clearly, the Pacific North West and the West Coast love Twitter. At a city level, searches were highest in San Francisco, Austin and San Jose. California Leads Nation in Googling “Mashable” At a state level, Google searches for the brand “Mashable” were highest in California, New York and Texas in the last 12 months. Beyond these three states, search volume was not sufficient enough to show results. At a city level, searches were highest in San Francisco and New York. Search volume was not high enough to get results from any other cities. Insights for Search: A New Data Frontier These findings illustrate that Google Insights for Search is an amazing new application for social networking pros of all stripes. While not without its quirks, the tool is quite literally a mind reader that allows researchers to peer into the brains and online activity patterns of Google users. While the tool was designed to help online marketers create more and better AdWords marketing campaigns, I suspect the resource will be deployed for so much more. It will be used for everything from environmental scans to trend spotting to brand tracking and countless other applications that Google hasn’t yet planned or maybe ever imagined. Perhaps this is a stretch, but the new database (which is updated daily) has seismic implications for the forecasting of consumer behavior and business investment. It could completely revolutionize the way economists measure and track personal and corporate spending intentions. Currently, the gathering of intention data is done by written or phone surveys which are fraught with issues. Sample sizes may be low or not truly representative. People or organizations conducting the surveys may be biased. Those being surveyed may be less than honest or complete in their responses. Not here. Users want something. Users search for that something in Google. Google delivers information on that something. That’s it. It’s pure. No messy survey gets in the way. No agenda. No ego. Google never blinks. For better or worse, Google captures it all from hundreds of millions of users all over the world, countless times a day. No survey can do that. Experimenting with this tool, I feel like an ADD kid again. I’m tinkering with different keywords and phrase combinations like some digital Rubik’s cube, and going wild playing with the different geographic, time, and industry filters. On a whim (and strictly out of professional curiosity of course), I checked which U.S. state led the nation in googling the term “sex” during the last 30 days. Answer: South Dakota. For the term “Britney”: Louisiana. The term “Obama”: District of Columbia. The word “carpet”: Colorado. The phrase “air conditioning”: Arizona. The word “babysitter”: Ohio. I’ve barely started, and my head is already spinning with ideas on how this data can be used in business plans, Powerpoint presentations, sales pitches, brainstorming sessions, concept testing or for just plain fun. Not to sound ungrateful or greedy, but I’m already preparing a wish list of upgrades for Google Insights for Search 2.0. How about including a filter for time, not just for dates? In the last 30 days, the tool revealed that Phoenix led the nation in googling the term “pizza.” That’s great, but could you add another filter which identifies search volumes for specific times (3-4 pm? 7-8pm ? 10-11pm), particular days (Friday? Saturday) or even exact dates (March 14, 2008) for a word or phrase? Could you take the data that’s currently available in the Google Web History for individual users, and aggregate and publish the data for all Google users? This would allow researchers to scan search volumes by the different types of Google searches, say, Web, images, news, products, sponsored links, video, maps, blogs, and books? Could you arrange a meeting with the YouTube folks down the hall and create a comparable “YouTube Insights for Search” application that provides comparable search volume data for YouTube searches? And while you’re at it, why not spring for lunch and invite the Facebook and Twitter suits to the Googleplex? While you’re chowing down, explore the feasibility of creating a “Facebook Insights for Search” and/or “Twitter Insights for Search” that provides a database of Facebook and Twitter search volumes and activity patterns, also broken by location, date, times and location. I can already hear the thunder of privacy advocates banging their war drums, but it doesn’t hurt to ask. Perhaps I’m thinking too far ahead, but the point is that Google Insights for Search is a flawed but still spectacular new research tool for business and Web analysts everywhere. The resource has countless applications in not only social networking, but in virtually all industries, products, and services.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who says that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease? Wilfred Glendon is a wealthy and world-renowned English botanist who journeys to Tibet in search of the elusive mariphasa plant. While there, he is attacked and bitten by a creature later revealed to be a werewolf, although he succeeds in acquiring a specimen of the mariphasa. Once back home in London he is approached by a fellow botanist, Dr. Yogami, who claims to have met him in Tibet while also seeking the mariphasa. Yogami warns Glendon that the bite of a werewolf would cause him to become a werewolf as well, adding that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease. Glendon does not believe the mysterious Yogami. That is, not until he begins to experience the first pangs of lycanthropy, first when his hand grows fur beneath the rays of his moon lamp (which he is using in an effort to entice the mariphasa to bloom), and later that night during the first full moon. The first time, Glendon is able to use a blossom from the mariphasa to stop his transformation. His wife Lisa is away at her aunt Ettie's party with her friend, former childhood sweetheart Paul Ames, allowing the swiftly transforming Glendon to make his way unhindered to his at-home laboratory, in the hopes of acquiring the mariphasa's flowers to quell his lycanthropy a second time. Unfortunately Dr. Yogami, who is revealed to be a werewolf, sneaks into the lab ahead of his rival and steals the only two blossoms. As the third has not bloomed, Glendon is out of luck. Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person who says that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease is Dr. Yogami."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the question below: If an animal is able to eat food easier is it more or less likely to reproduce more or less? Assuming that: Natural selection is the process by which living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring, so their traits become more common over time. Answer:","completion":"Based on the assumption provided, an animal that is able to eat food easier (indicating better foraging or hunting abilities, more efficient digestion, or a broader range of food sources) would be more likely to reproduce more. This is because having an advantage in acquiring and processing food resources would enable the animal to have a better overall health, increased energy levels, and improved body condition. These factors contribute to higher reproductive fitness by allowing the animal to allocate more resources to reproduction, attract better mates, and provide better care and protection for their offspring. As a result, the beneficial traits related to feeding efficiency would be passed on to the next generations through increased reproduction rates. Over time, these traits would become more common in the population due to the process of natural selection. In summary, an animal that can eat food easier is more likely to reproduce more, leading to these advantageous traits becoming more widespread in the population."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a context tweet, a question and corresponding answer of given question.

CONTEXT: Historia A lo largo de la historia de Roma, el núcleo de su ejército estuvo constituido por la legión romana. Este cuerpo, que experimentó una gran evolución a lo largo de los siglos, acabó convirtiéndose en una unidad prácticamente invencible cuando luchaba en un terreno adecuado y estaba dirigida por un comandante diligente. No obstante, la legión contaba con una serie de deficiencias importantes, entre las que destacaban la falta de caballería y arqueros. Alrededor del año 200 a. C., una legión romana estaba formada por 4200 soldados de infantería y solo 300 de caballería. Esta alarmante escasez de jinetes entre las filas romanas se debía principalmente al pequeño porcentaje de ciudadanos que podía permitirse comprar y mantener a un caballo; los únicos que podían hacerlo pertenecían al ordo equester, la segunda clase más alta de la sociedad romana de la época, solo superada por el ordo senatorial.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who designed the monument that had an inscription removed in 1830? from the following article ? Radical rebuilding schemes poured in for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles. If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans. With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches.

Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- As the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson calmed Friday after nights of protests over the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teen, the question remains: Where's the police officer who pulled the trigger?

But several neighbors have told CNN that Wilson left home before his name was released last week. What are his neighbors saying about his whereabouts? Not much. Most have shunned reporters' requests for interviews, and some put signs in their yards shooing away journalists. \\"We don't know anything ... Pray for Peace,\\" one read, according to the Post-Dispatch. \\"We have 2 children. Do not knock!! No comment,\\" another family wrote. Any trails on social media?

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - A bird hatches from an egg - The bird is nurtured by its parents - And is fed food for growth - The bird grows - Begins to learn how to fly - The bird matures - The bird leaves its nest Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process, after the bird matures and leaves its nest, is for the bird to establish its independence and begin its adult life. This stage includes finding a territory, developing its skills further for survival, finding a mate, and ultimately reproducing, thereby continuing the life cycle of the species. In more detail, here are the key aspects of the final step in this process: 1. Establishing a territory: Upon leaving the nest, the bird will typically look for a territory that provides a suitable habitat for its survival. This includes finding an area with an adequate food supply, suitable nesting sites, and shelter from predators and harsh weather conditions. The bird will often engage in territorial behaviors, such as singing and defending its chosen area, to establish and maintain its territory. 2. Developing survival skills: As the bird establishes its independence, it will continue to refine the essential skills it needs to survive in the wild. These skills include effective foraging for food, avoiding or defending against potential predators, and adapting to various weather conditions and environments. 3. Social interactions and mating: After establishing its own territory, the bird will begin interacting with other individuals of its species. This may involve forming bonds with other birds, engaging in courtship rituals, and eventually finding a mate. Birds use various strategies to attract a partner, from elaborate displays of plumage and vocalizations to choreographed dances. 4. Reproducing: Once the bird has successfully found a mate, it will engage in the process of reproduction. This involves building a nest suitable for laying eggs, protecting the eggs, and incubating them until they hatch. Depending on the species, the parents may share the responsibility of incubation and attending to the eggs. 5. Parental care and nurturing: After the eggs have hatched, the bird will return to the earlier steps in the process by nurturing and caring for its young, similar to the experience it had with its own parents. This will involve feeding the hatchlings, keeping them warm, and protecting them from danger. As the young birds grow, they will start to learn the necessary skills to become independent, such as foraging for food and learning to fly. 6. Cycle continuation: The cycle continues as the newly hatched birds mature, learn to fly, eventually leave their nests, and begin their own independent lives. In conclusion, the final step of the process for a bird is its transition into adulthood and independence, where it establishes its territory, hones its survival skills, finds a mate, reproduces, and provides care for its offspring, thus continuing the cycle for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hill village is located on a mountain and gets lots of rain, and Low village is situated in a valley, and has more sunny days. Which village has more dangerous cycling conditions? Hint: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Answer:","completion":"Hill village has more dangerous cycling conditions due to its location on a mountain with lots of rain, which can create slippery conditions and increase the risk of loss of control for cyclists, especially those riding brakeless and using the drivetrain to slow down or skid.

Understand the context and meaning of the words in the tweet. 2. Analyze the tone and emotional content of the tweet. 3. Label the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral based on the analysis. Step 1: Understanding the context and meaning The phrase \\"truth hurts\\" refers to the idea that facts - even if they're accurate or truthful - can sometimes be painful or upsetting for those who hear or learn about them. The speaker is likely acknowledging the difficulty or emotional impact that comes with facing the truth. Step 2: Analyzing the tone and emotional content The tone of the tweet appears to be quite matter-of-fact, yet the statement implies a negative emotional response - specifically, pain or discomfort - as a response to the truth. It suggests that the speaker accepts the notion that truth can be harmful or unpleasant, but this acceptance doesn't necessarily negate the emotional impact it may have. Step 3: Labeling the sentiment Considering the meaning and tone of the tweet, it seems best to label the sentiment as negative. While the speaker may be accepting of the reality that truth can be painful, the phrase \\"truth hurts\\" inherently carries a negative emotional connotation for the receiver or those affected by the truth."},{"prompt":"Given the below context: In 1938 Egypt, a team of archaeologists discover the tomb of pharaoh Ahkmenrah, including a young Cecil Fredericks, finding the magical Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

Halloween costumes - what not to wear ‘The golden rule is to be scary and gruesome, not gratuitously cruel.’ Photograph: Nisarg Lakhmani/Demotix/Corbis Oh for the time when Halloween costumes were, first and foremost, about being scary. The ancient superstition of 31 October was still lingering, just about, during my childhood in Wales. We'd dress up as either ghouls or witches to trick or treat for Noson Calan Gaeaf, the night before winter. How I long for those days when even chubby children were given sweets, rather than a harshly worded letter regarding obesity addressed to their parents. Nowadays, many a purist complains that the festival's creepy, pagan roots are being forgotten in favour of such activities as competitive pumpkin carving, E-number quaffing, eggy neighbour-bothering, and fatuous readymade Miley Cyrus costume wearing, a trend for which we can only blame those pesky Americans. So what to wear? With the advent of the internet, the choosing of a Halloween costume has become a loaded activity. The right choice carries the potential of bearing witness to the birth of a legend and the wrong one could render you the subject or an irate Gawker post accessed by millions. This has upped the ante somewhat. Forget your mum cutting holes in a sheet or the classic donning of a last-minute bin bag, when you've got costume over-achiever Heidi Klum dressed as the Hindu goddess Kali, a full-feathered raven, the apple of temptation, or Lady Godiva complete with horse (the list goes on). And don't bother with those plastic witches' hats with the fake green hair attached. That is so 90s, babes, not to mention insensitive towards all our sister witches persecuted for their beliefs. Even Private Eye wouldn't resort to such sexist cliches. It's time to tear up the rulebook and start again with these new rules: If you're wondering how soon is too soon, then chances are it's too soon. The British penchant for tasteless Halloween costumes seems to be going from strength to strength (see last year's plethora of Jimmy Saviles) and there are some people who it will never, ever, be OK to dress as. Then again, there are also certain real-life monsters who were so awful and frightening that they have rendered themselves deserving of a Halloween costume – provided a certain grace period has passed, naturally. Remember, the golden rule is to be scary and gruesome, not gratuitously cruel. This advice was sadly not followed by a distant acquaintance of mine (and can I use this opportunity to stress just how distant) who was ejected from a party for being dressed as Harold Shipman – by a girl whose elderly relative had been murdered by the doctor. Look! It's a baby! Dressed up as a lobster! In a pot! For the entertainment of adults! Not to get all PC brigade on you, but is this really so hard? Can't you just put down that native American headdress? (I can see you. Put. It. Down). By all means go as a character from another race, it is possible to do this sensitively, but an Arab or a Mexican is not a Halloween costume. Also, fancy dress should never, ever, involve the wearing of blackface. I don't care how much you love Obama. I can't believe I'm even having to say this in 2013, but this is the year that some reprehensible asshat thought going as Trayvon Martin would be pop culture hilarious, so clearly we still have aeons of progress to work through. There's nothing more annoying than having to repeatedly explain your costume to strangers. \\"I'm the human immunodeficiency virus,\\" you mutter to your drinking companion, as people stare at you in disgust. Saying it out loud makes it less funny, somehow. Though unfunny is perhaps preferable to incomprehensible obscurity. Pretentious can be fun provided its enacted literally (see this Freudian slip) or looks beautiful, as in the case of this Van Gogh. Going as someone or something that's been making headlines shows other people just how much of a plugged-in, switched-on, politically aware Guardianista you are. Take this jumper bearing the slogan \\"David Cameron told me to wear this\\", or this \\"Man who hated Britain\\" hat. I also forsee \\"dead badger\\" being a popular choice. Time to confront head-on the line made infamous by Tina Fey: \\"Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and none of the other girls can say a word about it.\\" From the 90s onwards, lingerie paired with animal ears became a legit costume choice for women, and the sheer range of sexy costumes on the market is staggering. I'm not about to slut shame you for wanting to be the \\"office tramp\\", a \\"sexy chewbacca\\", or even the \\"sexy pizza\\" made famous by the Daily Show last week. But a friend who dashed down to Ann Summers to pick up a maid's costume found herself fielding repeated requests for vodka from inebriated men who assumed she was a shot girl rather than a guest, which clearly would not have happened had she gone to Take Back Halloween – \\"a costume guide for women with imagination\\" – and copied their incredible Baba Yaga costume. Which of course she would never do, because Baba Yaga is dead ugly and sometimes looking sexy is fun. Freedom lies in having options. Options that don't make people cry on the best night out of the year, except maybe with laughter. Which is why I'll be going as a false widow spider. With stockings and suspenders, obviously. Have a good one. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about Halloween costumes, particularly focusing on what not to wear for this festive event. It starts by reminiscing about the past when Halloween costumes were primarily about being scary, reflecting Halloween's creepy, pagan roots. However, it states that the situation has evolved with costumes now having the potential either to make a person a legend or a subject of ridicule. The article suggests some rules regarding the choice of Halloween costume. It posits that if someone is questioning whether a costume is timely or appropriate, it's probably not. It mentions the need for avoiding gratuitously cruel or insensitive choices. Examples include dressing up as controversial figures who are directly linked to harm or traumatic events, particularly if it's too soon after the events took place. The article insists on the importance of being sensitive when dressing as characters from other ethnic or racial backgrounds. It discourages the use of blackface, and other ethnic stereotypes, which are considered culturally insensitive and offensive. The notion is reinforced with instances of offensive costumes, such as an individual dressed as Trayvon Martin, underscoring the need for further societal progress in this regard. The writer also cautions about costumes that are too obscure or complicated, as having to explain one's costume repeatedly could be frustrating. The choice to dress as someone making current headlines is also discussed as it may be seen as a demonstration of being socially and politically aware. Furthermore, the article discusses the trend of ‘sexy’ Halloween costumes, opposing the idea of slut-shaming anyone who chooses to wear one. However, it points out the risk of misunderstanding or misidentifying the costume, which might lead to awkward situations. Finally, the writer implores the readers not to forget the spirit of fun inherent to Halloween. Costumes should be chosen wisely, considering the potential to cause distress or offense. And most importantly, Halloween costumes should offer individuals the freedom and creativity to enjoy the event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Lauren Bernardy, 17, of Orange County was on the campus lacrosse field for a summer sports camp when water began flooding the field. \\"All of a sudden there's water rushing and we had to grab our things. We just started running and we were being chased by water,\\" she said. Lauren said there is a parking structure under the lacrosse field and track and field stadium, and many cars were trapped by the rushing water. She watched several cars try to drive out of the water but wind up trapped. Within five minutes, she said, the water had rushed from the edge of the lacrosse field to the Drake track stadium, which was submerged. Other students near Pauley Pavilion could be seen walking in shin-deep water, she said. ||||| LOS ANGELES (AP) — A broken water main near the UCLA campus Tuesday sent a geyser of water some 30 feet into the air, trapping people in underground parking garages and covering some of the best-known parts of campus in water, including the school's famed basketball arena.

(Associated Press) The 30-inch, 93-year-old pipe that broke under nearby Sunset Boulevard made a raging river of the street and sent millions of gallons of water across the school's athletic facilities, including the famed floor of Pauley Pavilion, as well as a pair of parking structures that took the brunt of the damage. The arena — where Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Reggie Miller and Kevin Love starred and John Wooden coached for 10 years — recently underwent a 132 million renovation that was completed in October 2012. At least an inch of water covered the floor Tuesday night, and its locker rooms were also flooded. \\"It's painful. It's painful,\\" UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said at a news conference. \\"We just refurbished Pauley just a few years ago. And it's a beautiful structure. It's of course, a symbolic structure for this entire campus.\\" Administrative Vice Chancellor Jack Powazek said the school may need to make contingency plans, but \\"luckily we're not in the middle of basketball season.\\" The water break came amid a severe drought in California, where under new regulations residents are subject to fines up to 500 a day for wasting water. Firefighters, some using inflatable boats, saved at least five people who were stranded in the underground parking structures. People saw the water and started rushing down the stairwells to rescue their cars, and authorities had to keep them out as water rose up to the wheel wells of vehicles, many of which were stranded, city fire spokesman Brian Humphrey said. Firefighters have been searching cars in the structures to make sure nobody was still inside, Humphrey said. No injuries have been reported. As many as 100 cars were stranded in the garages, officials said. Beth Schoenborn, 49, and her daughter Kelly Schoenborn, 17, of Portland, Oregon, were on a campus tour that was brought to a halt when the water started flowing. Their rental car was in one of the flooded parking structures. They got to it and started driving but couldn't exit because a dip was blocked by water. \\"We moved it up to the highest point,\\" Beth Schoenborn said as she stood outside the parking structure. The water pipe, which carries 75,000 gallons per minute when it's functioning, broke at about 3:30 p.m. and was shut off about 3 1/2 hours later, Department of Water and Power spokesman Jim McDaniel said. An estimated 8 million to 10 million gallons were released, McDaniel said. \\"Unfortunately, we lost a lot of water, around 35,000 gallons a minute, which is not ideal in the worst drought in the city's history,\\" City Councilman Paul Koretz said, \\"so we ask everybody to try harder to conserve water.\\" Three buildings were damaged. In addition to Pauley Pavilion, the Wooden Center, which has training facilities for students, and the J.D. Morgan Center, which houses the school's sports trophies and athletics offices was also flooded. Fire and police officials swarmed the chaotic scene that featured helicopters hovering overhead and backpack-bearing students wading across campus in ankle-deep water. Meanwhile, some fun-seekers went in the water with body boards. Patrick Huggins and Matthew Bamberger, two 18-year-olds who live in nearby Westwood, said they were having a boring summer day until Huggins' mother told them about the water. \\"It was about up to my thigh, and I thought this is a good day for a little dip,\\" Huggins said. The two shot video of themselves diving and splashing in the badly flooded practice putting green used by the golf team. Paul Phootrakul of the UCLA Alumni Association, who was in business attire for an evening event, took off his dress shoes and dress socks, and rolled up his slacks in an attempt to wade to his car. Firefighters stopped him, saying the parking structure was not steady because of the weight of all the water. \\"I was trying to move my car without getting wet so I'm presentable for this event,\\" he said. \\"I definitely know that the cars on the bottom floor, my best bet, are gone or totaled. I don't have much hope for my car.\\" ___ Associated Press writers Bob Jablon, Beth Harris and Krysta Fauria contributed to this story. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A broken water main near the UCLA campus caused a massive flood, trapping people in underground parking garages and covering parts of the campus in water, including the school's basketball arena.

The town's first significant defences were likely erected due to commercial interests, following the temporary seizure of St. John's by the Dutch admiral Michiel de Ruyter in June 1665. The inhabitants were able to fend off a second Dutch attack in 1673, when this time it was defended by Christopher Martin, an English merchant captain. Martin landed six cannons from his vessel, the Elias Andrews, and constructed an earthen breastwork and battery near chain Rock commanding the Narrows leading into the harbour. With only twenty-three men, the valiant Martin beat off an attack by three Dutch warships. The English government planned to expand these fortifications (Fort William) in around 1689, but actual construction didn't begin until after the French admiral Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville captured and destroyed the town in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign (1696). When 1500 English reinforcements arrived in late 1697 they found nothing but rubble where the town and fortifications had stood.

Question: This article: Stanford wrote of Bennett: He maintained his British characteristics throughout his life ...The English take a kind of pride in concealing their feelings and emotions, and this is reflected in their folk-song. The Thames has no rapids and no falls; it winds along under its woods in a gentle stream, never dry and never halting; it is the type of the spirit of English folkmusic ... England is as remote from Keltic fire and agony, as the Thames is from the Spey. Bennett was a typical specimen of this English characteristic. He was a poet, but of the school of Wordsworth rather than of Byron and Shelley. W. B. Squire wrote in 1885: His sense of form was so strong, and his refined nature so abhorred any mere seeking after effect, that his music sometimes gives the impression of being produced under restraint. He seldom, if ever, gave rein to his unbridled fancy; everything is justly proportioned, clearly defined, and kept within the limits which the conscientiousness of his self-criticism would not let him overstep. It is this which makes him, as has been said, so peculiarly a musician's composer: the broad effects and bold contrasts which an uneducated public admires are absent; it takes an educated audience to appreciate to the full the exquisitely refined and delicate nature of his genius. Temperley suggests that, despite his reverence for Mendelssohn, Bennett took Mozart as his model.

Since you won't be adding sugar and salt to the food, it's important to choose ripe produce - otherwise, it will taste bland. Look for produce that is brightly colored and ripe without being too soft or bruised. Follow individual guides for each type of fruit and vegetable to determine when specific items are ripe. Farmer's markets are great places to find fresh produce at its peak, since they tend to stock only fruits and vegetables that are in season. You can use frozen or canned fruits and vegetables, but it's better to use fresh whenever possible. Frozen and canned fruits and vegetables often have additives to help preserve them. Read the label carefully if you decide to buy frozen or canned vegetables. Many fresh fruits and vegetables are treated with pesticides and other chemicals before they are harvested. If possible, shop in the organic section of your supermarket so you can be sure the food you make for your baby is chemical-free. Some fruits and vegetables are more apt to become contaminated by fruits and vegetables than others. For example, apples are treated with more pesticides than any other produce, so you may want to go out of your way to buy organic apples. Avocados, on the other hand, aren't treated with as many pesticides. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e6/Make-Baby-Food-Step-2Bullet1.jpg/v4-459px-Make-Baby-Food-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/e/e6/Make-Baby-Food-Step-2Bullet1.jpg/aid1330600-v4-728px-Make-Baby-Food-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":306,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"485\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} Some babies are ready to start eating solid food as early as 4 months old, while others aren't quite ready that early.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Smash hits performed by Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley in the forties or fifties, or Rihanna and Justin Bieber today, were often penned by professionals. Even internationally-acclaimed singer Adele, whose new album, 25, comes out today, and whose last - 21 - sold more than 30 million copies, co-writes her material. Not that record labels like to crow about songwriters - most of these hired guns are virtually unknown outside the industry. But are these powers behind the throne seeing their livelihoods threatened by music videos and digital streaming? Many fear so. What all professional songwriters have in common is a publishing deal, and like the recorded music industry, music publishing is worth billions globally. But the switch to buying and listening to music in digital rather than physical form has dented revenues, and not just because of piracy - file-sharing that infringes copyright. Jane Dyball, chief executive of the Music Publishers Association (MPA), says that while streaming is not a bad thing in itself, there are concerns about whether the advertising revenue generated by platforms such as YouTube and Spotify is sufficient to ensure fair returns to writers as well as to artists and record companies. \\"Someone suggested they should be called music-supported advertising services rather than advertising-supported music services,\\" Ms Dyball quips. If a song is streamed a million times, there should be one million payments in return, Ms Dyball says - a concept the industry calls \\"pay per play\\". That is similar to Spotify's business model, but not that of YouTube, which gathers the revenue generated by advertising into a pool and then distributes it to rights holders. The problem is, critics say, YouTube is parsimonious in the extreme. \\"It's now time for YouTube to show that it is going to generate revenue back to the industry that reflects the amount of music its users consume,\\" says Ms Dyball. If you can get music for free via YouTube, why pay for subscription services such as Spotify - which now has 20 million paying users - or Apple Music - which has 6.5 million paying subscribers? There is also disquiet about SoundCloud, a German music streaming platform. The industry body PRS for Music - which collects royalties for more than 111,000 songwriters, composers and music publishers - says it lacks a licence to play music in the UK and is taking legal action against Soundcloud for unpaid royalties. Mark Lawrence, chief executive of the Association for Electronic Music, told Music Business Worldwide he hopes it will mean that \\"one writer and/or one artist getting one play can be confident of earning one payment, however small\\". Robert Ashcroft, chief executive of PRS for Music, says times are good for successful artists who write their own material - like Ed Sheeran - but believes things are more difficult for less well-known writers. With album sales dwindling in favour of individual song downloads, budding songwriters have to hope their songs are streamed by music fans in the face of competition from the millions already available. And the royalties earned from streaming can be minuscule. Kevin Kadish, co-writer of the Meghan Trainor smash hit, All About That Bass, says he earned just 5,679 from 178 million streams of the song. The video has been watched more than 1.1 billion times on YouTube. Singer Taylor Swift successfully forced Apple Music to reverse policy and pay artists for music streamed during trial periods of its music service, saying it was \\"unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing\\". Mr Ashcroft says that paid-for streaming can be a viable replacement for downloads, but only if the problem of under-licensed - by which he means YouTube - and un-licensed platforms - Soundcloud - can be addressed. \\"Spotify is not the problem - the problem is that the legal playing field is not level,\\" he says. Meanwhile the music publishing business seems to be stalling. The world's biggest music publisher is Sony/ATV, which also owns the EMI publishing business and the rights to the Beatles' back catalogue, had revenues of about 660m (Â£435m) in the first half of 2015 - a sum as high as the combined turnover of rivals Universal Music Publishing and Warner/Chappell. Despite this, Sony, which has co-owned the publishing joint venture with the estate of Michael Jackson since 1995, wants to sell its stake. In a leaked email, Sony chief financial officer, Kenichiro Yoshida, wrote that the publishing business is complex and \\"is impacted by the market shift to streaming\\". Even when songwriters do generate some income from their tunes, they can often wait up to two years for payment, as antiquated systems struggle to cope in the digital age - PRS says the number of individual music plays has risen from 15 million a year five years ago to one trillion. PRS is now part of a new pan-European licensing system called ICE that will more accurately match songwriters, composers and publishers of pieces of music to ensure rights holders get paid more speedily - describing it the biggest revolution in the history of music copyright. The world of music will always need songwriters, but until the economics of the industry are recalibrated fairly for the digital age, their songs may struggle to be heard.","completion":"This is a story about people who write songs that singers like Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Rihanna, and Justin Bieber sing. These talented writers can make a lot of money from their songs, but nowadays they might be making less because of music being mainly on the computer. That's because websites like YouTube, Spotify, and SoundCloud make money differently, and sometimes the songwriters don't get as much money from it. A lot of songwriters are a bit worried about this, and they want these websites to pay them more fairly. In the end, we all love and need music, so it's important to make sure people who write the songs have a fair chance to keep doing it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: - singing - arthritis - listening to music - making music - playing music The answer to this question is:","completion":"arthritis. The aging rockstar had to finally stop playing guitar, as his hands just wouldn't cooperate because of arthritis. This option is in line with common sense as arthritis is a joint disorder characterized by inflammation, pain, and stiffness. This medical condition commonly affects the hands and fingers, resulting in difficulty or inability to perform activities that require fine motor skills, such as playing a musical instrument like the guitar. The other options do not make logical sense in this context: - Singing: This option is unrelated to the physical ability of the rockstar to play the guitar. Singing is a vocal activity and does not directly affect the hands of the performer. - Listening to music: Listening to music is a passive activity that has no direct bearing on the physical condition of the rockstar's hands. It would not cause issues with playing the guitar. - Making music: This option is somewhat ambiguous, as it could encompass various aspects of creating music.

Both sentences describe the birth and death locations of an individual. In both cases, the person was born in Gollnow, Pomerania, and died in Dahme, Brandenburg. The primary distinction between the two sentences lies in the punctuation used. The first sentence employs a space before and after each comma, while the second sentence adheres to the more standard punctuation practice of having a space only after each comma. Another small difference can be observed in the way the commas are placed in the second sentence. There are two commas surrounding the word \\"and,\\" which set off the word \\"Pomerania.\\" This is an instance of using an appositive that renames or explains the noun, \\"Gollnow.\\" In contrast, the first sentence does not frame \\"Pomerania\\" as an appositive, as it omits the second comma. However, this is only a minor variation in punctuation that does not alter the essential content of the message.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"An increase in pollution due to more animal farming can potentially affect the growth of trees in several ways. Examining the impact of this pollution on the process mentioned, we can categorize it as indirectly impacting a step of the process. Increased animal farming contributes to pollution in a few different ways including the release of greenhouse gases (such as methane and carbon dioxide), air pollution through the release of ammonia and other harmful odors, and the potential contamination of water sources. Let's analyze the impact of each on the growth of trees. 1. Greenhouse gases: While an increase in carbon dioxide levels can be beneficial for photosynthesis, excessive levels pose a threat to the environment and subsequently the trees. Climate change caused by the increased presence of greenhouse gases can lead to changes in precipitation patterns, temperature, and other factors affecting trees' growth. 2. Air pollution: The release of ammonia and other harmful gases can drastically affect the quality of the air, which in turn indirectly impacts the process of photosynthesis. Inhaling poor-quality air can obstruct the stomata, making it difficult for trees to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. This can lead to a reduction in their overall growth potential. 3. Water contamination: More animal farming often results in increased waste production, leading to polluted water sources. As trees require clean water to thrive, polluted water, absorbed by their roots, can impair their growth. Moreover, water contamination disturbs the balance of various nutrients essential for healthy trees. In summary, more animal farming increases pollution, which in turn indirectly affects certain steps of the tree growth process. While none of the process steps are directly influenced, increased pollution can harm the overall health of trees, resulting in reduced growth rates and long-term consequences for the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

În perioada recentă, România s-a confruntat cu provocări economice semnificative, iar situația s-a agravat în mare parte din cauza pandemiei de COVID-19. În contextul în care țara a încercat să facă față crizei și să restabilească stabilitatea economică, guvernul a impus măsuri de austeritate pentru a restrânge cheltuielile și a reduce deficitul bugetar. Acest lucru a dus la tăieri ale salariilor și pensiilor, înghețarea posturilor și reduceri ale programelor sociale. Augustin Cozma, un cetățean român care a lucrat, probabil, o mare parte din viața sa pentru a-și asigura un trai decent în perioada pensionării, a fost direct afectat de aceste măsuri. Nemulțumit de efectele negative ale acestora asupra nivelului său de trai și al altor pensionari, precum și a efectelor pe termen lung asupra economiei, societății și guvernului, el a decis să se alăture protestelor din Piața Universității.

Jessica was excited to share this experience with Rebecca and, with the vendor's guidance, prepared two servings of the dish. Rebecca, still feeling apprehensive, noticed the excitement in Jessica's eyes and decided to be brave enough to give the \\"Dragon's Breath Tofu\\" a try, reminding herself that she might actually discover a new favorite.

His only companions are an Australian Cattle Dog and a rare functioning firearm â a sawn-off shotgun â for which ammunition is very scarce. While trying to escape a group of gang members â led by a crazed motorcycle rider named Wez (Vernon Wells) - Max manages to crash two of the gang members' vehicles and injure Wez; recognising his defeat, Wez flees. After collecting some fuel from the destroyed cars and checking a nearby Mack semi, Max inspects a nearby autogyro for fuel. Its pilot, the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence), ambushes Max and manages to capture him briefly before being overpowered. In exchange for his own life, the pilot guides Max to a small oil refinery nearby. Max arrives to see the facility is under siege by a gang of marauders riding a motley collection of cars and motorbikes. The gang leader, known as \\"Lord Humungus\\" (Kjell Nilsson), tries to convince the refinery's defenders to surrender the facility in exchange for safe passage out of the area. A group of defenders attempts to break out of the compound, but the marauders capture, torture, and kill all but one of them, who is rescued by Max. Max makes a deal with the mortally-wounded sole survivor: he will bring him back to the compound in exchange for a tank of fuel. The man dies shortly after they enter the facility, and the facility leader, Pappagallo (Michael Preston), reneges on the deal, saying it died when the survivor died.

Product review: I recently purchased a Sony MD Walkman MZ-NH600D on clearance for 100 (including a 1GB MD Card). The simplicity of the controls is very usefull and handy. Plus with 7 for another 1GB MD Card, this may be what you might call \\"an ipod killer\\".The equivilent Ipod (1GB) would have cost me 150. For 105.98 (after 6% MI sales tax) I got the same amount of memory (1GB) and expandablity in inexpensive MD Cards. So for 150 I could have gotten a 1GB Ipod Shuffle, or I could get the Sony MD Mp3 Player with 6GB or more!Overall this Mp3 Player is a great option if you do not want to pay a fortune for an Apple Ipod. The only complaint I have is that, being an older model, there is not as many accessories available. Answer:","completion":"This review would likely increase the chances of you buying the product.

Which animal is the symbol of the Rastafarian religion?","completion":"To find out which animal is the symbol of the Rastafarian religion, I will need to analyze the key elements and symbols of the Rastafarian culture. So, let's think about this step by step: 1. Rastafarianism is a religion that originated in Jamaica in the 1930s. It was greatly influenced by the African culture due to the roots of its followers, the descendants of enslaved Africans. Consequently, it is likely that the symbol of the Rastafarian religion might have connections to Africa. 2. One of the primary colors associated with the Rastafarian religion is green, which represents the lush vegetation of Jamaica and Africa. Therefore, we can presume that the symbol may be related to an animal that is native to those regions. 3. Rastafarianism places great emphasis on natural living – a lack of materialism, self-sufficiency, and an appreciation of the natural world. Therefore, it's possible that the symbol may be an animal closely associated with nature and the natural world. Based on these considerations, the lion, specifically the Lion of Judah, is the animal that is most often associated with the Rastafarian religion. The Lion of Judah originates from the Biblical tribe of Judah and is a symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy. This connection to Africa, the natural world, and the Rastafarian belief in repatriation to Africa, all contribute to the lion being an important symbol within the Rastafarian religion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

CHAPTER XV SIGNS OF THE TIMES \\"If she is really Lucy Rogers, she'll be missing tomorrow morning,\\" said Beth when she had told her cousins of the encounter in the corridor. But Eliza Parsons was still at Elmhurst the next day, calmly pursuing her duties, and evidently having forgotten or decided to ignore the young man who had so curiously mistaken her for another. Beth took occasion to watch her movements, so far as she could, and came to the conclusion that the girl was not acting a part. She laughed naturally and was too light-hearted and gay to harbor a care of any sort in her frivolous mind. But there was a mystery about her; that could not be denied. Even if she were but a paid spy of Erastus Hopkins there was a story in this girl's life, brief as it had been. Beth was full of curiosity to know this story. As for Tom Gates, he had been so horrified by his mistake that he tried to avoid meeting Eliza again. This was not difficult because the girl kept pretty closely to the linen room, and Tom was chiefly occupied in the library. Kenneth had little chance to test his secretary's abilities just then, because the girls pounced upon the new recruit and used his services in a variety of ways. Tom Gates's anxiety to give satisfaction made him willing to do anything, but they refrained from sending him often to town because he was sensitive to the averted looks and evident repulsion of those who knew he had recently been a \\"jail-bird.\\" But there was plenty for him to do at Elmhurst, where they were all as busy as bees; and whatever the young man undertook he accomplished in a satisfactory manner. 1.

A servomotor is a motor, very often sold as a complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly control valves, such as motor-operated control valves. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.

In his first television interview since the election, the former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential nominee told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday” that he was convinced he’d win until Ohio’s vote came in, and that he damaged his campaign by failing to attract black and Hispanic voters and speaking too freely in his infamous “47 percent” comments. Text Size - + reset Ann Romney on Senate run Romney’s wife, Ann, blamed the media and Obama’s campaign for offering what she described as an unfairly skewed vision of her husband. (PHOTOS: Mitt Romney through the years) Both Romneys said he would be more effective at navigating the current political moment. “I’ll look at what’s happening right now, I wish I were there,” Mitt Romney said. “It kills me not to be there, not to be in the White House doing what needs to be done. The president is the leader of the nation. The president brings people together, does the deals, does the trades, knocks the heads together; the president leads. And — and I don’t see that kind of — of leadership happening right now.” Romney, like congressional Republicans, accused Obama of “campaigning” rather than governing as the sequester loomed. That, Romney said, has been counterproductive. “Well, no one can think that that’s been a success for the president,” Romney said. “He didn’t think the sequester would happen. It is happening. To date, what we’ve seen is a — the president out campaigning to the American people, doing rallies around the country, flying around the country and berating Republicans and blaming and pointing. Now, what does that do? That causes the Republicans to — to retrench and to put up a wall and to fight back. It’s a very natural human emotion.” Ann Romney said her husband, had he won, would have solved the sequester by now. “I totally believe at this moment, if Mitt were there in the office, that we would not be facing sequestration right now,” she said. Up until polls closed on Election Day, both Romneys were convinced they would be in the White House. “Yeah, I think we were convinced that we would win,” Mitt Romney said. Ann Romney said she had no doubt: “I for sure did. I think Mitt intellectually was thinking that it was possible we couldn’t; he knew how close it was.” Only after he saw the Ohio numbers did Romney realize it would not be. “It was a slow recognition until ultimately when the Ohio numbers began coming in and they were disappointing,” he said. “I said, look, this looks like we’ve lost — wasn’t certain. Some people said, ‘Oh, look, if this number here comes in, why, you could win.’ But you know, by 8 or 9 o’clock, it was pretty clear that we were not going to win.” Romney called his inability to win black and Hispanic votes “a real weakness” and said future GOP candidates must do better. He blamed himself for the infamous “47 percent” comments and said he should have been more careful when speaking privately — as he thought he was at the fundraiser in Boca Raton, Fla. “The weakness that our campaign had and that I had is we weren’t effective in — in taking my message primarily to minority voters, to Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans, other minorities,” he said. “That was a real weakness. Uh, we did very well with the majority population, but not with minority populations. And — and that was a — that was a failing. That was a real mistake.” ||||| Mitt Romney says the long Republican primary was “unhelpful” in his quest to win the White House, but said it did not alter his ideological moorings. Romney said in an interview aired Sunday on \\"Fox News Sunday\\" that he did not change his position to defeat opponents like Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, but the 2012 GOP presidential nominee said the intraparty attacks hurt his general election campaign. “The idea that somehow it -- it -- that the primary made me become more conservative than I was just isn't - isn't accurate,” Romney said. “On the other hand, a long and blistering primary, where people are attacking one another and where the attacks sometimes are not on the mark but are creating an un -- you know, unfavorable impression, those things are not helpful.” Read more about: Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, Fox News Sunday, Rick Santorum |||||","completion":"In a television interview four months after losing the presidential election to Barack Obama, Mitt Romney expressed frustration at not being in the White House and finding solutions to America's problems.

Please answer the following question: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants.

Article: In 1989, Gaddafi was overjoyed by the foundation of the Arab Maghreb Union, uniting Libya in an economic pact with Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, viewing it as beginnings of a new Pan-Arab union. Meanwhile, Libya stepped up its support for anti-western militants such as the Provisional IRA, and in 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus 11 people on the ground. British police investigations identified two Libyans – Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah – as the chief suspects, and in November 1991 issued a declaration demanding that Libya hand them over. When Gaddafi refused, citing the Montreal Convention, the United Nations (UN) imposed Resolution 748 in March 1992, initiating economic sanctions against Libya which had deep repercussions for the country's economy. The country suffered an estimated 900 million financial loss as a result. Further problems arose with the west when in January 1989, two Libyan warplanes were shot down by the U.S. off the Libyan coast. Many African states opposed the UN sanctions, with Mandela criticising them on a visit to Gaddafi in October 1997, when he praised Libya for its work in fighting apartheid and awarded Gaddafi the Order of Good Hope. They would only be suspended in 1998 when Libya agreed to allow the extradition of the suspects to the Scottish Court in the Netherlands, in a process overseen by Mandela.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: President Obama says tens of thousands of Central American children flooding into the U.S. along the southern border have created a “humanitarian crisis,” and he appealed directly to parents to stop sending kids north. Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest “Our message absolutely is don't send your children unaccompanied, on trains or through a bunch of smugglers,” Obama told ABC’s Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos in an exclusive interview here. “We don't even know how many of these kids don't make it, and may have been waylaid into sex trafficking or killed because they fell off a train. “Do not send your children to the borders,” he said. “If they do make it, they'll get sent back. More importantly, they may not make it.” More of Stephanopoulos’ interview with the president will air on “Good Morning America” tomorrow and on “This Week” Sunday morning. Obama: World Cup Impacting Some Foreign Policy Moves The Department of Homeland Security says more than 52,000 unaccompanied minors have been detained along the U.S. border with Mexico this fiscal year. In addition, authorities have apprehended 39,000 adults with small children. The numbers reflect a significant uptick over last year, when just 24,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended. The majority in the surge hail from Central American countries, and a disproportionate number are young women and under age 13, officials say. Under federal law, undocumented immigrant minors from countries other than Mexico cannot be immediately returned. Instead, U.S. authorities are required to process the children, then provide for their health care and other basic needs before releasing them to relatives or foster parents until they are to appear in an immigration court. “If they come from a non-contiguous country, then there's a lengthy process,” Obama told Stephanopoulos. Obama administration sources said this week that of the unaccompanied children who come into the U.S., historically more than 50 percent are placed with parents or family members in the U.S. and many are adopted by American families and remain. Republican critics say lenient immigration policies under the administration – including the Deferred Action program, granting legal status to some undocumented youth already in the U.S., and a directive to prosecutors to focus on deporting criminal aliens – have exacerbated the problem. But Obama said this year’s influx reflects “the desperation and the violence that exists in some of these Central American countries.” ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Many members of Congress in both parties have expressed support for the idea, and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) are expected to introduce a bill to make the change soon. The Obama administration has also indicated support for this idea. Here's what that would mean: Children will have a single interview, with a Border Patrol agent, to prove they're afraid of persecution. Children would have one chance to persuade the government that they are afraid of persecution or trafficking: at the Border Patrol station, in an interview with a Border Patrol agent, right after they're apprehended. \\"four-year-olds, standing before border patrol, trying to articulate a fear of persecution\\" \\"It's targeting unaccompanied children who will be standing there alone,\\" says Wendy Young of Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a group that advocates for unaccompanied migrant children.\\"Four-year-olds, standing before a Border Patrol station, trying to articulate a fear of persecution or a fear of trafficking. It's patently absurd to think the kids, in these circumstances, can successfully navigate that kind of screening.\\" If they do navigate it successfully, they'll be put into the existing process: they'll be able to speak with an asylum officer or be put into immigration court proceedings, to determine officially if they qualify for legal status. If they don't pass that interview, they'll be immediately sent back. If children can't persuade the Border Patrol agent that they'll be persecuted or trafficked, they'll be immediately returned to their home countries — not formally deported, but immediately sent back. This might just apply to kids who are caught crossing the border in the future. What's still not clear is whether this new process is only going to be used for children who cross the border in the future, or whether it's also going to apply to the tens of thousands of children already in government custody. Young thinks that the administration is just trying to change the law for the future, rather than forcing Border Patrol agents to conduct mass screenings of all the children currently in their care. But without seeing the proposed bill, she can't be sure. There's a slim chance there will be legal services provided to kids for their Border Patrol interviews — but it's unlikely. The administration has asked Congress to approve 3.7 billion in emergency funding for the migrant crisis, and that includes 15 million for \\"legal representation\\" for children. But Young doesn't know whether those legal services are for the Border Patrol screenings, or just for the children who make it through the Border Patrol interview and get into immigration court. \\"I would hope, if you're going to be doing these screenings, at least make sure that the lawyer is standing by the side of the child,\\" she says. But again, without seeing the bill itself, it's difficult to tell. It's an appropriate response for an immigration crisis, not a refugee crisis. Here's the upshot of the proposed bill: the laws on the books say that when unaccompanied children come across the border from Central America, the government's top priority should be making sure that they get due process in immigration court, and are able to live with family members while their cases are processed. Much of Congress and the Obama administration now believe that the government's top priority should be swiftly returning a child to his or her home country if it's not immediately clear that he or she deserves legal status here. the administration now believes the top priority should be sending children back quickly, not guaranteeing due process That means many policymakers see this as an immigration crisis — children coming to the United States because they can, for economic opportunity, family reunification, or to game the system. If that's the case, a crackdown will (in theory) deter families from sending their children, because the odds would no longer be in their favor. It means they don't see it as a refugee crisis — children will now be assumed not to be in danger unless they can prove otherwise. But if families are currently sending children because they're genuinely convinced the children are in mortal danger, a crackdown won't have as much of a deterrent effect. Just because a child can't immediately make it clear to a Border Patrol officer that he or she qualifies for legal status doesn't mean that he or she can't. So it's virtually certain that — if Congress agrees to change the law — children will be returned to their home countries who, had they arrived in the US last year, would ultimately have been given legal status on humanitarian grounds. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The article talks about a time when President Obama said that many children from Central America were coming into the United States, causing a problem. He asked parents not to send their children alone because it was dangerous and the children might not make it. If the children did make it, they would be sent back to their countries. This situation made people think about changing the laws to make it harder for these children to stay in the United States. Some people thought this was a good idea, while others thought it might not be fair for the children who were really in danger."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I've rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on DVD without reading any reviews about it. So, after 15 minutes of watching I've noticed that something is wrong with this movie; it's TERRIBLE! I mean, in the trailers it looked scary and serious! I think that Eli Roth (Mr. Director) thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid, the movie would be funny...(So stupid, it's funny...? WRONG!) He should watch and learn from better horror-comedies such as:\\"Fright Night\\", \\"The Lost Boys\\" and \\"The Return Of the Living Dead\\"! Those are funny! \\"Cabin Fever\\" is THE reason why I registered to www.IMDb.com so I can release my thoughts of discontent about it. I've decided to watch the movie a second time >AAARGH!< and make notes for my partial \\"review\\" to show how foolish the movie is. \\"Resident Evil\\" (horror) or \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" (comedy) I can watch over and over again and still enjoy! But this...! How bad can a script and a director be??? This bad. Here are the awful scenes in chronological order: In the early scenes we see Henry, who doesn't realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead-glazed stare is dead! The movie doesn't explain anything about the blonde long-haired kid who like to bite people. And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question (\\"What's wrong with the woods?\\") is \\"nothing\\". The script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for \\"suspense\\". Then the \\"smartest\\" of the 5-pack, Bert, almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire. He meets now-infected Henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the \\"F-word\\". Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks awfully ill. Bert:\\"Don't make me shoot you!\\" (he forgets to add: \\"...with my BB gun!\\") Bert heads back to the cabin but how about that? He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex, but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk! Marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire Bert had started earlier (A moment of clarity for a change?) Bert doesn't mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gun. Later, as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire, another weirdo shows up with his dog. (Maybe that's what the warning about the woods is all about? It's filled with weirdos...and their dogs!?) They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis. (Their brains are completely intoxicated! No wonder why they are all so DUMB!) This is the last time we'll see this forgettable character...alive! Henry shows up at their cabin, (NOTE: He was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin!!!) looking worse, almost like a zombie, covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor. But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker. He gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition. Henry almost seems smart enough to drive the Hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard, seats and windows. The Fantastic Five come out running, armed with: a BB Gun, a knife, a baseball bat (*huh? Ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods???), a poker, and a (insecticide?) spray-can, ready to combat the single, unarmed and terribly sick man. (clever script!) Bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his BB Gun, which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth. \\"What else am I supposed to do?\\" Bert yells in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck's windows instead. Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say: \\"He's coming towards us!\\" (Thanks for the info, dumb broads, I can see that! But I don't think he wants to do you any harm!) Marcy sprays in his eyes, making Henry yelp! And our \\"hero\\" Paul touches Henry's arm with a burning log from the campfire, which they recklessly left burning while they were INSIDE the cabin! (Where has all that wisdom gone? I guess the cannabis had started to take its toll!:-) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away, screaming. The following day, Bert and Jeff head out for a mechanic. And Marcy decides to \\"go for help\\" all by herself, in the woods, as Paul stays behind with Karen...Doesn't that sound idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already \\"going for help\\"! I skip my comments now to how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where she's going!? Anyway, she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and, like in most horror movies, walks inside the cabin saying:\\"Hello? Is anyone there?\\" Bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her (and me at first). And along comes Jeff, as well. How did THEY get here!? Did they swim across the river??? Do you see how brainless the script is!? Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin. He somehow doesn't notice the blood on their truck. This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the DVD out. (Before I take my own eyes out!...Now, THAT's funny!) If you liked this movie, do yourself a favor and watch \\"Fright Night\\", \\"The Lost Boys\\", or \\"The Return of The Living Dead\\". Then you'll see they are MORE entertaining than this...thing.

What is the full name of the artist who's greatest hits album did the lead singer of the band that tried to \\"remain somewhat grungy\\" give to the man that added layers of guitars to songs? Answer the above question based on the context below: Recording sessions for the album began on October 31, 1988, at Downtown Recorders in Boston, Massachusetts, at the time a professional 24-track studio. 4AD allowed the Pixies a budget of 40,000, excluding producer's fees. This was a modest sum for a 1980s major label album; however, it quadrupled the amount spent on the band's previous album, Surfer Rosa. Along with Norton, two assistant recording engineers and two second assistants were assigned to the project. The sessions lasted three weeks, concluding on November 23, with \\"nearly a song a day\\" being recorded.Production and mixing began on November 28. The band relocated to Carriage House Studios, a residential studio in Stamford, Connecticut, to oversee production and record further tracks. Norton recruited Steve Haigler as mixing engineer, whom he had worked with at Fort Apache Studios. During production, Haigler and Norton added layers of guitars and vocals to songs, including overdubbed guitars on \\"Debaser\\" and double tracking vocals on \\"Wave of Mutilation\\". During the recordings, Norton advised Francis to alter several songs; a noted example being \\"There Goes My Gun\\" which was originally intended as a much faster Hüsker Dü-style song. However, at Norton's advice, Francis slowed down the tempo.Norton's suggestions were not always welcome, and several instances of advice to add verses and increase track length contributed to the front man's building frustration. Eventually, Francis took Norton to a record store, where he handed him a copy of Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits, in which most of the songs are about two minutes long. He told Norton, \\"If it's good enough for Buddy Holly ...\\" In a Rolling Stone interview, Francis later recalled that \\"this record is him trying to make us, shall I say, commercial, and us trying to remain somewhat grungy\\". Production continued until December 12, 1988, with Norton and Haigler adding extra effects, including gated reverb to the mix. The master tapes were then sent for final post-production later that month.","completion":"The full name of the artist, based on the context provided, is Buddy Holly.

The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape.

In this realm, she befriends four other dancersÂ â Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller (Jon Hamm), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy.

Step 2: Explain the purpose of sampling - The purpose of sampling is to draw accurate conclusions about a population without having to study every single individual or object in that population. It enables researchers to save time and resources while still obtaining valuable insights. Step 3: Explain the limitations of sampling - Sampling can result in bias if the sample is not representative of the population. In addition, the accuracy of the conclusions drawn from a sample depends on the sample size and the methods used to select the sample. Step 4: Conclude with the main difference - The primary difference between sampling and population in research is that sampling refers to the selection of a smaller subset of individuals or objects from a larger group, while the population refers to the entire group that the research study is focused on. Task 2: List the things an Indian should do in their early 20s Step 1: Consider the context and importance of early 20s - Early 20s is a crucial period in an individual's life where they transition from adolescence to adulthood. This stage often marks the beginning of personal, educational, and professional development. Step 2: List the things an Indian should do in their early 20s 1. Pursue higher education or skill development programs 2. Develop healthy habits, such as exercising, eating well, and maintaining good mental health 3. Build a strong social network, including friends and professional connections 4. Begin saving money and start investing for financial security 5.

Travel and learn about different cultures, both within India and abroad 8. Set personal and professional goals and work towards achieving them 9. Develop essential life skills, like communication, time management, and decision-making 10. Focus on self-improvement and personal growth Task 3: Determine if the two questions are paraphrases of each other Step 1: Analyze the content of each question - Question 1: Differences between sampling and population in research - Question 2: Things an Indian should do in their early 20s Step 2: Compare the content and intent of the questions - The content of the questions is different, as the first question deals with research methodologies, while the second is focused on personal development and life goals. - The intent of the questions is also different, as the first question seeks an explanation for a technical concept, while the second asks for advice or suggestions for an individual's early 20s. Step 3: Make a conclusion - Based on the analysis, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they address different subjects and have distinct purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"The missing first step of the process is: \\"Blood containing waste products and excess substances is pumped from the heart and circulates throughout the body.\\" To provide a detailed and in-depth understanding of the process, here's the amended and elaborated version that includes the missing first step: 1. Blood containing waste products and excess substances, such as water, glucose, and electrolytes, is pumped from the heart and circulates throughout the body. This is necessary as the metabolic activities in various cells and tissues produce waste that needs to be removed in order to maintain a healthy internal environment. 2. Blood is carried to the kidneys through the renal arteries. The renal arteries branch off from the abdominal aorta and supply the kidneys with oxygenated blood that contains waste products and excess substances. 3. The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs located on either side of the spine and are responsible for filtering and eliminating waste products and excess substances from the blood, while maintaining the balance of electrolytes and fluids in the body. 4. The kidneys contain filters called nephrons, which are the functional units of the kidney. Each nephron consists of a glomerulus, which is a cluster of capillaries, and a tubule, through which the filtrate passes. 5. As blood flows through the glomerulus, the filters capture the waste products, excess substances, and some water due to the pressure gradient. These substances are then pushed into the nearby Bowman's capsule and continue down the tubule. 6. In the tubule, various processes occur, including reabsorption of essential nutrients and substances back into the blood, secretion of additional waste products and substances into the filtrate, and water regulation. The final product of this filtration and reabsorption process is the urine. 7. The waste is combined with water to make urine, which proceeds to the collecting ducts and exits the kidneys through the ureters. 8. The urine leaves the kidney and is collected in the bladder, where it is temporarily stored until it can be expelled from the body during the process of urination. 9. Meanwhile, the now cleaned blood, free from waste products and excess substances, continues its circulation in the peritubular capillaries and is returned to the body through the renal veins, which merge with the inferior vena cava and eventually reach the heart. This entire process is instrumental in maintaining the overall homeostasis in the human body, ensuring that waste products and excess substances are efficiently removed while keeping vital nutrients and electrolytes in balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Three men rob a millionaire of diamonds aboard an airliner in flight. When Police Superintendent Benting tries to intervene, Jack Drake, another passenger, knocks him out to save him from being shot. The thieves force the pilot to land so they can dump the passengers. However, the men find the diamonds have already been stolen by someone else (Drake). Drake is a sort of modern-day Robin Hood. He donates the proceeds of his latest robbery to fund the stalled construction of the \\"New Social Institute\\". He even writes a book, \\"Crackerjack\\": The true story of my exploits., which becomes a bestseller. Everybody is reading it, including the people at Scotland Yard and Baroness Von Haltz, and wondering if it is fact or fiction. The baroness tells her maid Annie that certain passages somehow remind her of Drake, who broke her heart. By coincidence, she is residing in the same hotel as Drake. He goes to see her, but she does not forgive him for leaving her without a word in Berlin. He explains that he was forced to leave suddenly, but she is not mollified. Meanwhile, Drake instructs Burdge, his secretary, to send a cheque for £10,000 to the Buckingham Hospital for a new wing, even though Burdge informs him he is overdrawn at the bank.

The term Belorussia (Russian: Белору́ссия, the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я, Russia) first rose in the days of the Russian Empire, and the Russian Tsar was usually styled \\"the Tsar of All the Russias\\", as Russia or the Russian Empire was formed by three parts of Russia—the Great, Little, and White. This asserted that the territories are all Russian and all the peoples are also Russian; in the case of the Belarusians, they were variants of the Russian people.After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the term \\"White Russia\\" caused some confusion, as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks. During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term Byelorussia was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, Byelorussia became commonly used in the regions of Białystok and Grodno during the interwar period.The term Byelorussia (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called Republic of Belarus (Республика Беларусь spelled in Russian), and that its abridged form should be \\"Belarus\\". The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their Belarusian language forms. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993. Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus.Accordingly, the name Byelorussia was replaced by Belarus in English. Likewise, the adjective Belorussian or Byelorussian was replaced by Belarusian in English. Belarusian is closer to the original Belarusian term of bielaruski. Belarusian intelligentsia in the Stalin era attempted to change the name from Byelorussia to a form of Krivia because of the supposed connection...

La obra de Lucas, tanto en su evangelio como en los Hechos de los Apóstoles, representa un recorrido histórico por el camino de la salvación, abarcando desde el nacimiento de Jesucristo hasta la expansión de la Iglesia primitiva bajo el liderazgo de los apóstoles. El libro contiene múltiples enseñanzas, parábolas y acontecimientos que ilustran cómo Dios, a través de Jesucristo, ofrece la salvación al mundo entero. En el Evangelio según Lucas, el autor presenta a Jesucristo como el Mesías prometido, el Salvador del mundo, y pone especial énfasis en la misión universal de la salvación. Lucas narra el nacimiento de Jesús, su ministerio público, sus enseñanzas, milagros, muerte y resurrección, mostrando que él es el enviado de Dios para redimir a la humanidad del pecado y de la muerte. A lo largo del relato, la figura de Jesucristo se erige como un modelo a seguir para todos aquellos que buscan la salvación y el camino hacia Dios. El libro de los Hechos de los Apóstoles, que es considerado la segunda parte de la obra de Lucas, describe la formación de la Iglesia primitiva y la expansión del cristianismo a lo largo del mundo conocido en aquella época. La narración incluye el ascenso de Jesús al cielo, la venida del Espíritu Santo en Pentecostés, el llamado y la labor misionera de los apóstoles, especialmente de Pedro y Pablo, y el crecimiento de las comunidades cristianas. El final abierto en la obra de Lucas es intencional. Su propósito es mostrar que la historia de la salvación no termina con los hechos narrados, sino que sigue siendo una realidad presente y activa en la vida de la Iglesia y de los creyentes. El mensaje central de la obra es que la salvación, ofrecida por Dios a través de Jesucristo, está disponible para todas las personas, sin importar su origen, cultura o condición social. Este final abierto invita a los lectores a participar activamente en la misión evangelizadora y a continuar escribiendo su propia historia de salvación. En resumen, la obra de Lucas en su totalidad es una crónica del camino de la salvación a lo largo de la vida de Jesucristo y la historia de la Iglesia primitiva, y al mismo tiempo, presenta un final abierto que insta a los creyentes a continuar la labor apostólica y a vivir el mensaje de la salvación en sus propias vidas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Panthers tried to get a comeback with Delhomme and Smith hooking up with each other on an amazing 74-yard TD pass, but the deficit was too much to overcome. Answer this question based on the article: How many more yards were scored on the third touchdown when compared to the total of the first two?","completion":"Okay, sweetie, think of it like this. Touchdowns are when the football players run really, really far to the end zone, like a really long game of tag. The number of yards is how far they run. So first, Mr. Jake Delhomme played catch with Mr. Steve Smith to score a 7-yard touchdown and then a 12-yard touchdown. So that means they went 7 yards, then 12 yards, which is like running across a small room, then a slightly bigger one. So if we add 7 yards and 12 yards, we get 19 yards. Then the Texans made the third touchdown, where Mr. Matt Schaub played a long game of catch with Mr. Andre Johnson and they scored a 31-yard touchdown, like running the length of a swimming pool. So now, if you want to see how much farther the third touchdown was compared to the first two, we subtract the first two touchdowns ( which is 19 yards) from the third one (which is 31 yards). So, 31 minus 19 gives you... let’s count together, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. That’s 12! So, the third touchdown was 12 yards more than the total of the first two touchdowns.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Q: What is the full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I? A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu. Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, I will first identify the relevant information within the paragraph: - \\"his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I\\" The question asks for the full name of the grandfather of the woman married to Maximilian I.

Any formal recognition of an Anthropocene epoch in the geological time scale hinges on whether humans have changed the Earth system sufficiently to produce a stratigraphic signature in sediments and ice that is distinct from that of the Holocene epoch. Proposals for marking the start of the Anthropocene include an “early Anthropocene” beginning with the spread of agriculture and deforestation; the Columbian Exchange of Old World and New World species; the Industrial Revolution at ~1800 CE; and the mid-20th century “Great Acceleration” of population growth and industrialization. ADVANCES Recent anthropogenic deposits contain new minerals and rock types, reflecting rapid global dissemination of novel materials including elemental aluminum, concrete, and plastics that form abundant, rapidly evolving “technofossils.” Fossil fuel combustion has disseminated black carbon, inorganic ash spheres, and spherical carbonaceous particles worldwide, with a near-synchronous global increase around 1950. Anthropogenic sedimentary fluxes have intensified, including enhanced erosion caused by deforestation and road construction. Widespread sediment retention behind dams has amplified delta subsidence. Geochemical signatures include elevated levels of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and pesticide residues, as well as increased 207/206Pb ratios from leaded gasoline, starting between ~1945 and 1950. Soil nitrogen and phosphorus inventories have doubled in the past century because of increased fertilizer use, generating widespread signatures in lake strata and nitrate levels in Greenland ice that are higher than at any time during the previous 100,000 years. Detonation of the Trinity atomic device at Alamogordo, New Mexico, on 16 July 1945 initiated local nuclear fallout from 1945 to 1951, whereas thermonuclear weapons tests generated a clear global signal from 1952 to 1980, the so-called “bomb spike” of excess 14C, 239Pu, and other artificial radionuclides that peaks in 1964. Atmospheric CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations depart from Holocene and even Quaternary patterns starting at ~1850, and more markedly at ~1950, with an associated steep fall in δ13C that is captured by tree rings and calcareous fossils. An average global temperature increase of 0.6o to 0.9oC from 1900 to the present, occurring predominantly in the past 50 years, is now rising beyond the Holocene variation of the past 14,000 years, accompanied by a modest enrichment of δ18O in Greenland ice starting at ~1900. Global sea levels increased at 3.2 ± 0.4 mm/year from 1993 to 2010 and are now rising above Late Holocene rates. Depending on the trajectory of future anthropogenic forcing, these trends may reach or exceed the envelope of Quaternary interglacial conditions. Biologic changes also have been pronounced. Extinction rates have been far above background rates since 1500 and increased further in the 19th century and later; in addition, species assemblages have been altered worldwide by geologically unprecedented transglobal species invasions and changes associated with farming and fishing, permanently reconfiguring Earth’s biological trajectory. ||||| We're living through one of the most extraordinary events in Earth's history — the start of a new geological epoch, an international group of scientists says. Welcome to the Anthropocene, everyone. Geological epochs are long periods of time — typically lasting around two million years — separated by major, global changes to the planet, such as the massive exploding meteor that ended the Late Cretaceous and wiped out the dinosaurs. They've left a permanent record in our sediments and our soils and our glacial ice that's going to be detectable for millennia. - Colin Waters, Anthropocene Working Group Modern humans arose during the Pleistocene epoch, and since the sudden warming that ended the last ice age about 12,000 years ago, we had been living in the Holocene epoch. But modern human technology has had such a profound effect on our planet that we're now in a new epoch that started during the mid-20th century — the Anthropocene, argues an international group of researchers in a new paper published today in the journal Science. University of Alberta researcher Alexander Wolfe studies the remains of lake microorganisms in layers of sediments deposited over decades and centuries, and says he has personally observed enormous changes marking the past 50 years. (University of Alberta) The boundary between two epochs is visible to geologists as some kind of \\"marker\\" between layers of rock, soil or ice that are deposited all over the Earth over time. For example, the Late Cretaceous-ending meteor left a distinct layer of iridium. In the case of the Anthropocene, scientists note that humans have produced unusual materials like radioactive fallout from nuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s. \\"They've left a permanent record in our sediments and our soils and our glacial ice that's going to be detectable for millennia,\\" said Colin Waters, a geologist with the British Geological Survey and secretary of the Anthropocene Working Group, whose members authored the new report. \\"Geologists in millions of years time will look back at and say, 'Something quite incredible happened at this time' and be quite precise about when it happened.\\" In their paper, the researchers added, \\"Not only would this represent the first instance of a new epoch having been witnessed firsthand by advanced human societies, it would be one stemming from the consequences of their own doing.\\" Concrete is among the unusual materials - and a type of rock - that humans have spread all over the Earth in a distinct layer. A wide range of such materials is listed in the new paper. (John Woo/Reuters) Nobel Prize-winning scientist Paul Crutzen first proposed in 2002 that a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene be assigned to the present to describe the profound changes that humans have made to the planet. That eventually led the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the scientific body that officially decides when epochs begin and end, to ask a group of geologists, paleontologists and other scientists to look into whether there was enough science to back up that proposal. The Anthropocene Working Group has been working on the question since 2009. Many markers In the new paper summarizing their findings, they list a large number of \\"markers\\" that humans have left in rock, soil and ice around the world. In addition to the radioactive fallout, they make a note of: Pottery Glass Bricks Concrete Copper alloys Elemental aluminum (only found as an ore in nature). Plastics Black carbon and other particles from fossil fuel combustion. High levels of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers and pesticides. The start of new epochs is often accompanied by climate change and mass extinctions, both of which humans are causing now. \\"Humans now control several of the fundamental dials or knobs on the planetary system,\\" said Alexander Wolfe, an adjunct professor of paelobiology at the University of Alberta who is a member of the working group and a co-author of the paper. Wolfe studies the remains of lake microorganisms in sediments deposited over decades and centuries, and says he has personally observed enormous changes marking the past 50 years. Making new rocks Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the group has faced some criticism from people who feel the Earth hasn't had enough time to make enough rock to really define a new geological epoch. \\"The reality is we've done some calculations and there's the equivalent of one kilogram of concrete produced by humans for every square metre of the planet,\\" he said. Plastics are also among man-made materials that will be found in ice and sediments from the past 50 years. (CP) The new epoch isn't official yet. The Anthropocene Working Group still needs to: Decide exactly when the Anthropocene began. Decide what formal marker they'll use to define it and then choose a location in which to drive a \\"golden spike\\" into the rock at that marker at a place on Earth where the marker is very distinct. Formally present its arguments to the International Commission of Stratigraphy and have them accepted. For now, the group suggests making the start 1950 — when humans started having a really major effect on the planet — and the marker of nuclear fallout from Cold War nuclear tests. \\"It's an absolutely bomber marker that fits right in the middle of this transition,\\" Wolfe said. ||||| New study provides one of the strongest cases yet that the planet has entered a new geological epoch There is now compelling evidence to show that humanity’s impact on the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans and wildlife has pushed the world into a new geological epoch, according to a group of scientists. The question of whether humans’ combined environmental impact has tipped the planet into an “Anthropocene” – ending the current Holocene which began around 12,000 years ago – will be put to the geological body that formally approves such time divisions later this year. The new study provides one of the strongest cases yet that from the amount of concrete mankind uses in building to the amount of plastic rubbish dumped in the oceans, Earth has entered a new geological epoch. “We could be looking here at a stepchange from one world to another that justifies being called an epoch,” said Dr Colin Waters, principal geologist at the British Geological Survey and an author on the study published in Science on Thursday. “What this paper does is to say the changes are as big as those that happened at the end of the last ice age. This is a big deal.” He said that the scale and rate of change on measures such as CO2 and methane concentrations in the atmosphere were much larger and faster than the changes that defined the start of the holocene. Humans have introduced entirely novel changes, geologically speaking, such as the roughly 300m metric tonnes of plastic produced annually. Concrete has become so prevalent in construction that more than half of all the concrete ever used was produced in the past 20 years. Wildlife, meanwhile, is being pushed into an ever smaller area of the Earth, with just 25% of ice-free land considered wild now compared to 50% three centuries ago. As a result, rates of extinction of species are far above long-term averages. But the study says perhaps the clearest fingerprint humans have left, in geological terms, is the presence of isotopes from nuclear weapons testing that took place in the 1950s and 60s. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tower blocks in Hong Kong. More than half of all the concrete ever used was produced in the past 20 years. Photograph: Bobby Yip/Reuters “Potentially the most widespread and globally synchronous Anthropogenic signal is the fallout from nuclear weapons testing,” the paper says. “It’s probably a good candidate [for a single line of evidence to justify a new epoch] ... we can recognise it in glacial ice, so if an ice core was taken from Greenland, we could say that’s where it [the start of the Anthropocene] was defined,” Waters said. The study says that accelerating technological change, and a growth in population and consumption have driven the move into the Anthropocene, which advocates of the concept suggest started around the middle of the 20th century. “We are becoming a major geological force, and that’s something that really has happened since we had that technological advance after the second world war. Before that it was horse and cart transporting stuff around the planet, it was low key, nothing was happening particularly dramatically,” said Waters. He added that the study should not be taken as “conclusive statement” that the Anthropocene had arrived, but as “another level of information” for the debate on whether it should be formally declared an epoch by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS). Facebook Twitter Pinterest Istopes common in nature, 14C, and a naturally rare isotope, 293Pu, are present through the Earth’s mid-latitudes due to nuclear testing in the 1950s and 60s. Photograph: Associated Press Waters said that if the ICS was to formally vote in favour of making the Anthropocene an official epoch, its significance to the wider world would be in conveying the scale of what humanity is doing to the Earth. “We [the public] are well aware of the climate discussions that are going on. That’s one aspect of the changes happening to the entire planet. What this paper does, and the Anthropocene concept, is say that’s part of a whole set of changes to not just the atmosphere, but the oceans, the ice – the glaciers that we’re using for this project might not be here in 10,000 years. “People are environmentally aware these days but maybe the information is not available to them to show the scale of changes that are happening.” The international team behind the paper includes several other members of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy’s Anthropocene working group, which hopes to present a proposal to the ICS later this year. The upswing in usage of the Anthropocene term is credited to Paul Crutzen, the Dutch Nobel prize-winning atmospheric chemist, after he wrote about it in 2000. Key markers of change that are indicative of the Anthropocene. A shows new markers, while B shows long-ranging signals. Photograph: sciencemag.org Prof Phil Gibbard, a geologist at the University of Cambridge who initially set up the working group examining formalising the Anthropocene, said that while he respected the work of Waters and others on the subject, he questioned how useful it would be to declare a new epoch. “It’s really rather too near the present day for us to be really getting our teeth into this one. That’s not to say I or any of my colleagues are climate change deniers or anything of that kind, we fully recognise the points: the data and science is there. “What we question is the philosophy, and usefulness. It’s like having a spanner but no use for it,” he said. Gibbard suggested it might be better if the Anthropocene was seen as a cultural term – such as as the Neolithic era, the end of the stone age – rather than a geological one. Evidence we’ve started an ‘Anthropocene’ We’ve pushed extinction rates of flora and fauna far above the long-term average. The Earth is now on course for a sixth mass extinction which would see 75% of species extinct in the next few centuries if current trends continue Increased the concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 120 parts per million since the industrial revolution because of fossil fuel-burning, leaving concentrations today at around 400ppm and rising Nuclear weapon tests in the 1950s and 60s left traces of an isotope common in nature, 14C, and a naturally rare isotope, 293Pu, through the Earth’s mid-latitudes Put so much plastic in our waterways and oceans that microplastic particles are now virtually ubiquitous, and plastics will likely leave identifiable fossil records for future generations to discover Doubled the nitrogen and phosphorous in our soils in the past century with our fertiliser use. According to some research, we’ve had the largest impact on the nitrogen cycle in 2.5bn years |||||Summary:","completion":"Scientists have concluded that Earth has entered a new geological epoch, called the Anthropocene, beginning in the mid-20th century.

Matthew Fontaine Maury (January 14, 1806 - February 1, 1873) was an American astronomer, United States Navy officer, historian, oceanographer, meteorologist, cartographer, author, geologist, and educator. He was nicknamed \\"Pathfinder of the Seas\\" and \\"Father of Modern Oceanography and Naval Meteorology\\" and later, \\"Scientist of the Seas\\" for his extensive works in his books, especially The Physical Geography of the Sea (1855), the first such extensive and comprehensive book on oceanography to be published. Maury made many important new contributions to charting winds and ocean currents, including ocean lanes for passing ships at sea. Maury was a descendant of the Maury family, a prominent Virginia family of Huguenot ancestry that can be traced back to 15th-century France. His grandfather (the Reverend James Maury) was an inspiring teacher to a future US president, Thomas Jefferson. Maury also had Dutch-American ancestry from the \\"Minor\\" family of early Virginia. He was born in 1806 in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near Fredericksburg; his parents were Richard Maury and Diane Minor Maury. The family moved to Franklin, Tennessee, when he was five. He wanted to emulate the naval career of his older brother, Flag Lieutenant John Minor Maury, who, however, caught yellow fever after fighting pirates as an officer in the US Navy. As a result of John's painful death, Matthew's father, Richard, forbade him from joining the Navy. Maury strongly considered attending West Point to get a better education than the Navy could offer at that time, but instead, he obtained a naval appointment through the influence of Tennessee Representative Sam Houston, a family friend, in 1825, at the age of 19. Maury joined the Navy as a midshipman on board the frigate Brandywine which was carrying the Marquis de La Fayette home to France, following La Fayette's famous visit to the United States. Almost immediately, Maury began to study the seas and to record methods of navigation. One of the experiences that piqued this interest was a circumnavigation of the globe on the USS Vincennes, his assigned ship and the first US warship to travel around the world.

They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft. The next morning, Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias's lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy but cannot get them off of Mathias.

Hill farm grown coffee conventionally, while Valley farm is into shade-grown coffee production. Which farm had more overstory trees with fairly open canopies? Hint: With shade applications, crops are purposely raised under tree canopies within the shady environment. The understory crops are shade tolerant or the overstory trees have fairly open canopies. A conspicuous example is shade-grown coffee. This practice reduces weeding costs and improves coffee quality and taste. The shade does not necessarily translate into lost or reduced yields. This is because the rate of photosynthesis hardly increases once the light intensity is over about one tenth that of direct overhead sunlight and declines with increasing light intensity. This means that shaded plants can grow well. Planting more than one level of vegetation can increase total photosynthesis and overall yields.","completion":"Valley farm, which is into shade-grown coffee production, had more overstory trees with fairly open canopies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Troops are massacred at a Furnace Creek fort in 1880 after an army captain, Walsh, cites orders forcing him to abandon a wagon train. Apache Indians hid inside the wagons to gain access to the fort. General Blackwell is blamed for the incident and court-martialed. Denying that he sent any such order, the general has a stroke and dies on the witness stand. No written evidence of the order is presented. One of his sons, Rufe, a captain from West Point, travels west to find out what happened. His brother, Cash, reads of their father's death in a Kansas City newspaper and also heads toward Furnace Creek in search of answers. Using an alias, Cash learns that Capt. Walsh has become a drunkard. A mining boss, Leverett, is impressed by the stranger in town and hires him, not knowing Cash's real name or intent. Rufe arrives in town and also assumes a false identity. Cafe waitress Molly Baxter, whose father was killed at the fort, still considers General Blackwell the man to blame.

Hypothesis: The fathers are chatting as the kids play. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis. The premise provides limited information about the situation: we know that two men are talking and that four kids run by. The provided hypothesis attempts to give context to the situation, suggesting that the men are fathers to the children and that the children are playing. However, the premise does not offer sufficient evidence to support this hypothesis conclusively. Several points should be addressed to clarify if we can conclude the hypothesis from the premise: 1. Relationship between the men and the children: The premise does not indicate whether the children playing nearby are related to the men talking. It is possible that they are the kids' fathers, as hypothesized, but it is also possible that they are not related at all. The children may be part of another group or simply playing together in a public space while the men engage in a separate conversation. 2. Context and location: The premise lacks details about the setting of the event. Are they at a park, a school, or a gathering of families? Understanding where the scenario takes place would help to determine if it could be reasonably inferred that the men are fathers and that they are talking as kids play. 3. Interaction between the men and the children: If there is some interaction between the men and the children, it could provide stronger evidence to support the hypothesis. For instance, if the kids are continuously addressing the men as their fathers or if the men are supervising the children's activities, it would be easier to conclude that the hypothesis could be true. 4. Content of conversation: The conversation topic between the men could also indicate their relationship with the children. If they discuss their kids' activities, parenting experiences, or other familial matters, it may lend credibility to the hypothesis. However, this information is not provided in the given premise. In conclusion, while the hypothesis may be plausible given the limited details outlined in the premise, we cannot conclusively accept or reject the hypothesis. The connection between the men's conversation and the children's activities is not explicitly established, and no additional contextual information is provided to support these assumptions. To determine the validity of the hypothesis, further information about the relationships between the men and the children, the location, and the conversation's content would be required."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the BBC's Music Magazine. answer the following question: What recording did Gramophone magazine vote the greatest recording of all time in 1999?

It highlights how the artists found a way to systematize a new style of painting, which can be seen as a breakthrough and an important step in the development of the art world. However, this premise does not provide sufficient information to determine whether the artists' intention behind creating these paintings was to attract more visitors to the art gallery. We can infer that they were trying to push the boundaries of what was considered possible in the realm of painting, but there is no direct evidence to suggest that their goal was to get more people to visit the art gallery as a result of their innovative work. It is plausible that increased attention and publicity resulting from such an innovative approach to painting could have led to more visitors at the art gallery. However, without further information on the artists' motivations, goals, or the context in which these paintings were created and exhibited, we cannot definitively confirm or deny that their purpose was to boost gallery visits.

Please answer the following question: There is a local election in Troy's city and he is researching the two candidates running for mayor. Troy is a strong environmentalist who believes, above all else, that taking care of the Earth is the number one priority in anything. In his research he decides to read the environmental proposals of each candidate. Mark Hampton, one candidate, has a proposal that he says will strongly boost the city's economy by opening more industrial factories, but these will increase the carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere. Jeffrey Lindell, the other candidate, says that he wants to begin implementing solar panel farms to generate electricity to cut down on the carbon emissions the city produces. Which candidate is Troy less likely to vote for? Hint: Current Situation : Currently the heating effect of extra greenhouse gases (since the start of the industrial revolution) is equal to about . Thus the recent period has recorded parallel increases in concentration of carbon dioxide and average global temperature. As more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere the temperature will increase further. There are certain effects of a warmer Earth (discussed more in optional section), which could accelerate the process, even if no more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere (an unlikely prospect for the foreseeable future). Answer:","completion":"Given Troy's strong environmentalist beliefs and his focus on taking care of the Earth as a top priority, it is important to analyze both candidates' proposals in the context of their potential impact on the environment. Step 1: Consider Mark Hampton's proposal Mark Hampton's proposal involves opening more industrial factories, which will boost the city's economy. However, it will also result in an increase in carbon dioxide emissions. This is not favorable for an environmentalist like Troy, as it contributes to the greenhouse effect and exacerbates the issue of climate change. Step 2: Consider Jeffrey Lindell's proposal Jeffrey Lindell's proposal is to implement solar panel farms to generate electricity. By doing this, the city would cut down on its carbon emissions, thus having a positive impact on the environment. This aligns more with Troy's environmentalist beliefs. Step 3: Compare the proposals When comparing both proposals, it is clear that Mark Hampton's plan could have negative consequences on the environment due to the increase in carbon dioxide emissions, while Jeffrey Lindell's plan is more environmentally friendly by promoting clean energy and reducing emissions. Based on the information provided, Troy is less likely to vote for Mark Hampton, as his proposal to open more industrial factories would increase carbon dioxide emissions, which goes against Troy's strong environmental beliefs."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The task is to create a story that is 100 to 1000 words long. 2. The story must include the five given key facts in their order of appearance. 3. The story should expand upon the given facts to create a broader, coherent narrative. Story: Once upon a time in the small town of Rio County, the legendary Sheriff Buddy Deeds was remembered for his unwavering fairness and justice. Under his rule, the townspeople lived in peace and harmony, knowing that they could rely on him to keep them safe. Sam, the son of Buddy's wife, grew up idolizing his father's dedication to justice. Even years after Buddy's passing, the people of Rio County still held him in high regard. As a result, people started developing plans to pay homage to his legacy. One day, business leader Mercedes Cruz and Buddy's former deputy announced their efforts to enlarge and rename the local courthouse in Buddy's honor. However, Sam wasn't thrilled by this proposal and disapproved of their decision. He believed that the move was driven more by personal interests and politics, rather than a genuine admiration of Buddy's work and impact on the community. Meanwhile, in another part of town, Colonel Delmore Payne arrived as the new commander of the local U.S. Army base. His military presence added to the growing concerns and changing dynamics of the town. The townspeople wondered if the arrival of Colonel Payne would bring a new level of order and authority to the area, as they still longed for the days of Sheriff Buddy Deeds. Not long after Colonel Payne's arrival, a group of relic hunters made a shocking discovery on an old shooting range, unearthing a human skeleton along with a Masonic ring, Rio County sheriff's badge, and a bullet that was not used by the military. The news of the find spread quickly throughout the town, and the mysterious items raised many questions about the past and the truth behind the legend of Buddy Deeds. Sam recalled stories from his youth about Buddy's wild younger days. His mother told him that Buddy once had a mistress before settling down and becoming a deputy sheriff. The revelation seemed to clash with the image of the fair and just man the town held so dear. Did the uncovered skeleton belong to someone from Buddy's past, or was it just a random coincidence? Sam decided to delve further into the mystery, hoping to uncover the truth about his father's past. As he dug deeper, he discovered that the Masonic ring belonged to an influential figure who could have posed a threat to Buddy's position as the sheriff. Could this have been the reason for Buddy's sudden change in behavior and devotion to the life of a lawman? While Colonel Payne continued to settle into his new position in town, Mercedes Cruz and Buddy's former deputy pressed on with their plans for the courthouse. Despite Sam's disapproval, they managed to gain support from the community, citing the need to honor Buddy's contributions to Rio County. Sam felt conflicted, struggling between his desire to preserve his father's true image and revelations that seemed to challenge the idea of the perfect Sheriff Buddy Deeds. In the end, Sam discovered that the human skeleton on the old shooting range belonged to a man involved in illegal activities that Buddy had tried to stop when he was a deputy sheriff. The bullet was not from the military; it was a remnant of a dangerous confrontation that ultimately changed Buddy's life. The story behind the skeleton revealed that Buddy had been shaped by both his wildness and his dedication to justice, making him the man that the town would remember forever. With newfound respect for his father's journey, Sam approved of the efforts to enlarge and rename the courthouse, participating actively in ensuring it was a fitting tribute to his father's memory. And so, the courthouse became a symbol of Sheriff Buddy Deeds' legacy, with Colonel Delmore Payne looking over the town that continued to evolve, and Sam holding onto the truths he had uncovered. Rio County would forever remember Buddy Deeds as a fair and just lawman while acknowledging the untold stories that shaped his legend."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Short general knowledge question: who is the voice of stewie griffin from family guy?

The recent fighting in Iraq has posed a serious challenge to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his government, raising questions about his ability to hold the country together amid a rising insurgency. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that the United States will help the Iraqi government in the battle against al Qaeda-linked fighters in western Iraq, but he stressed it won't send troops. Here are five questions about the deteriorating situation: 1. I thought the Iraq war was over. Why is there still fighting? Well, actually last year was the deadliest since 2008. The number of dead reached its worst levels since the height of the Iraq war, when sectarian fighting between the country's Shiite majority and its Sunni minority pushed it to the brink of civil war. Those tensions continue to be fueled by widespread discontent among the Sunnis, who say they are marginalized by the Shiite-led government and unfairly targeted by heavy-handed security tactics.","completion":"As the fighting in Iraq continues, the situation worsens and poses a serious challenge to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his government. The U.S. offers support but refuses to send troops. Tensions between the Shiite majority and Sunni minority escalate, leading to increased violence throughout the country. In an effort to address these issues and prevent a full-blown civil war, diplomatic efforts are stepped up by the international community. The United Nations, alongside regional powers such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, work together to mediate negotiations between the warring factions. These peace talks initially struggle as each side remains firm in their positions, but gradually concessions are made, and a fragile peace is established. Under international pressure, the Iraqi government agrees to a power-sharing deal where both Sunni and Shiite factions are fairly represented. This is a difficult process, as both sides remain skeptical of each other given their history of conflict. However, with the guidance and encouragement of the UN and the support of influential regional powers, a tentative agreement is eventually reached. The implementation of this power-sharing deal initially faces challenges as distrust and lingering animosity exists between the factions. The situation remains precarious, and sporadic episodes of violence still occur. Yet, with time and the continuous support from the international community, both sides begin to see the benefits of stability and cooperation. As years pass, the power-sharing deal continues to function, and a stronger, more inclusive government emerges. This fosters a sense of unity among the Iraqi people that, albeit slowly, begins to heal the divisions between Shiites and Sunnis. Progress is made in rebuilding the infrastructure destroyed by years of conflict, allowing the economy to grow, and the quality of life for citizens improves. Although challenges still persist, and setbacks occur from time to time, the story ends on a hopeful note. The continuing efforts of the people of Iraq, their government, and the support from the international community signify the importance of dialogue and cooperation in healing the wounds of the past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Make a list of the tasks to be completed, the dates they need to be finished, and how long each task should take. Use this information to create a rough timeline for you to adhere to while you work. Hypothesis: Creating and timeline benefits everybody in the world","completion":"Hypothesis: Creating and adhering to a timeline provides numerous benefits that could potentially be advantageous for individuals across the world. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, let us first delve into the reasons why creating a timeline can be beneficial, and then discuss how these advantages might extend to people across the globe. 1. Improved Time Management: Creating a timeline enables individuals to better manage their time by defining tasks, deadlines, and the projected duration of each task. This allows for improved organization, which can lead to increased productivity, as individuals can allocate their time correctly and maximize their efficiency. 2. Clearer Goals and Objectives: Developing a timeline helps individuals set and define specific goals and objectives for their projects or tasks. By providing a clear roadmap of what needs to be done, and when, it allows people to focus on each step of the process, making it easier to complete tasks and achieve desired outcomes. 3. Enhanced Motivation and Commitment: When people have a timeline in place, it provides a sense of accountability and motivates them to stay on track. This can help encourage individuals to push through challenging tasks and maintain their dedication to a project, increasing the likelihood of successful completion. 4. Better Communication and Collaboration: In group projects or team-based situations, a well-established timeline can facilitate communication and collaboration among team members. Timelines provide clear expectations for each individual's responsibilities and deadlines, enabling smoother cooperation and coordination to achieve common goals. 5. Monitoring Progress: A timeline allows individuals to track their progress as they complete tasks, enabling them to identify potential issues or areas for improvement early on. By consistently monitoring progress, people can make adjustments as needed, allowing for greater adaptability and ultimately a higher rate of success. Now, considering the benefits that timelines offer, it is reasonable to argue that these advantages might extend to people across the globe. The use of timelines transcends cultural, geographical, and occupational boundaries, providing a universally applicable tool for improving efficiency and productivity. However, it is important to recognize that the effectiveness of timelines as a universally beneficial tool is contingent upon individuals' ability to correctly apply the timeline creation process and follow through on their commitments. Additionally, individuals might have different preferences or work styles, and some may not find a strict timeline as useful as others. However, on the whole, creating and adhering to a timeline does appear to provide significant benefits that could effectively improve the lives and work of individuals worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] I am facing a new situation today: Two coastal communities on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to bringing more money into the local economy. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable. They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which village was more thoughtful about the environment? Answer:","completion":"Davin village was more thoughtful about the environment, as they continued with commercial fishing and agriculture instead of mining sand from the nearby dunes. This decision shows awareness and concern for the potential negative environmental impacts that sand mining can cause, such as erosion, destruction of wildlife habitats, and damage to coastal ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The human body has hundreds of muscles. The three types are skeletal muscles, smooth muscles and cardiac, or heart muscles. Each kind of muscle has a special job to do. The skeletal muscles are attached to the bones; they actually hold the skeleton together. Strong cords, called tendons , help connect these muscles to the bones. Skeletal muscles give us strength and allow us to move in many ways. If you look at skeletal muscles through a microscope, you will see that it has bands of fibers that look like stripes . These stripes are called striations. Skeletal muscles usually move because the brain has sent a conscious message to them telling them what to do. This is called voluntary movement. Another type of muscle is smooth muscle. Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle does not have striations. This is found in organs such as the stomach, the bladder , the lungs and the eyes. Smooth muscles are smaller than the skeletal muscles and they move involuntarily. The brain tells these muscles what to do, but we aren't even aware of it. For example, we don't have to think about breathing or digesting food. The smooth muscles just do their jobs automatically. For this reason smooth muscles are sometimes called involuntary muscles. Like smooth muscle, cardiac muscle also works involuntarily. It is a very thick muscle that is found only in the walls of the heart. Its job is to pump blood out of the heart and into blood vessels called arteries . The arteries help carry the blood to all parts of the body. When the cardiac muscles relax, they let blood back into the heart. Cardiac muscles have striations, just like skeletal muscles do. Options: A Heart muscles are very important because they give us strength and allow us to move. B The heart of human beings completely consists of heart muscle.

Nowadays, it is also heard around another activity -- video games. Ten-year-old Owaish admits it takes him three to four hours a day to play games on his tablet computer. In addition, he plays for about two hours on the smart phone every day. As a result, he started suffering a serious pain in the neck around June or July. What's worse the pain has spread to the hand and back gradually, which makes his mother Mehzabin become concerned. The doctors note the number of young children with the chronic pain in their necks, arms and shoulders is on the increase sharp in recent years . They are not aging, they haven't had an accident, the blood reports are fine, their X-rays are fine, and their MRIs are fine. Facts have proved that the pain is from the poor posture while they are playing video games on smart phones or other electronic devices. 19-year -old student Nida feels pain in the finger which holds the weight of her smart phone most of the day. Nida almost uses her smart phone 24/7, which means 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or all the time.

Sentence 2: Shambaugh is concerned that we will accidentally get into an unintended war with China. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"If we evaluate the information provided in the two sentences, we can deduce that they both basically have the same message with slightly different perspectives and focus. Sentence 1: \\"We can stumble into a war with China over Taiwan very easily, warns Professor David Shambaugh of George Washington University.\\" This sentence focuses on the ease with which a war with China over Taiwan could occur according to Professor David Shambaugh. It highlights that the situation is potentially volatile and that a conflict could arise without much effort or intention. Sentence 2: \\"Shambaugh is concerned that we will accidentally get into an unintended war with China.\\" This sentence brings attention to the specific concern of Professor David Shambaugh that the war with China would be unintended and accidental, making the situation even more worrisome. The focus is on the lack of intentionality behind the potential conflict. Both sentences convey the same idea - that there is a high likelihood of an unintended or accidental war with China over Taiwan, as warned by Professor David Shambaugh. The difference lies in their presentation and emphasis. Sentence 1 stresses the ease of stumbling into a conflict, while Sentence 2 focuses on the accidental nature of the situation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the sentence \\"This model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"How do genes encode multiple proteins?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"This model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short sections across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"How do genes encode multiple proteins?\\" However, it would be more helpful to provide a more detailed and elaborate explanation to improve the understanding of the reader. As the sentence suggests, there are two primary mechanisms through which a single gene can encode multiple proteins: 1. Alternative Splicing: In eukaryotic organisms, genes consist of coding regions called exons and non-coding regions called introns. The process of transcription in eukaryotes involves the initial creation of a precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) molecule, which contains these exons and introns. Before the mature mRNA molecule is translated into a protein, the introns must be removed, and the exons must be joined together in a process called splicing. Alternative splicing is a regulated process that involves the selective joining of different exons and/or the removal of specific introns. This process can generate multiple mRNA variants from a single pre-mRNA molecule, and each variant can be translated into a unique protein isoform. Consequently, the final protein products may exhibit distinct structural and functional properties, allowing the gene to participate in diverse cellular processes. Alternative splicing is a common feature of eukaryotic genomes and can greatly expand the coding capacity of the genome by producing multiple proteins from a single gene. 2. Trans-splicing: In some organisms, particularly in lower eukaryotes and certain specialized cells of higher eukaryotes, another mechanism exists through which a single gene can generate multiple proteins. This process, known as trans-splicing, involves the joining of exons from separate RNA molecules that are transcribed from different genomic locations. In trans-splicing, two or more precursor mRNA molecules are cleaved at specific sites, mainly in their intron regions, and then joined together in a new arrangement. The resulting concatenated mRNA molecules can be translated into different proteins, depending on which exons and coding sequences are included within each spliced mRNA. This process allows for the generation of various protein isoforms encoded by separate, discontinuous coding sequences present across the genome. In summary, the sentence provided a valid answer to the question by identifying alternative splicing and trans-splicing as primary mechanisms through which a single gene can encode multiple proteins. However, a more detailed explanation enriches the reader's understanding of the processes involved in the generation of multiple proteins from a single gene."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Young Mother – This phrase is one of the main subjects of the sentence, indicating the entity that is performing the action. It provides important information about the individual involved, emphasizing not just motherhood but also inferring somewhat of the age of the individual, i.e., they are young. 2. Showing - This is the verb, or the action word, in this sentence. It indicates the primary action that the \\"young mother\\" is doing. Without it, we wouldn't know what the young mother is doing. 3. Baby - This is the direct recipient of the action. Knowing the baby is being shown something determines the directionality of the action and adds nuance to the sentence. It suggests a potential learning or teaching context. 4. Autumn-Colored Leaves – This phrase is the direct object of the action, or what the action is being performed upon.

Given the question: The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

If \\"A baseball outfielder is leaping against the fence as he watches the ball sail over it.\\", does this mean that \\"A person is playing baseball.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"A baseball outfielder is leaping against the fence as he watches the ball sail over it\\" necessitates that a person is playing baseball. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the situation, let's break down the key components of the statement. Firstly, a \\"baseball outfielder\\" refers to a player who is positioned in the outfield, which is the area of the baseball field beyond the infield. The outfield is typically divided into three sections: left field, center field, and right field. An outfielder's primary responsibility is to catch or retrieve balls that may come their way as a result of another player hitting the ball. By position definition, an outfielder is a baseball player and, as such, a person playing baseball. Secondly, let's analyze the action taking place. The outfielder is \\"leaping against the fence,\\" which implies that the player is attempting to make a play on a ball that is approaching the fence or boundary of the field. Generally, outfielders leap against fences to try to catch a ball that would otherwise result in a home run for the opposing team. The act of leaping against the fence in pursuit of the ball is a physical action that demonstrates the player's engagement in the game, reinforcing the idea that the person is indeed playing baseball. Lastly, the statement mentions that the outfielder is \\"watching the ball sail over it.\\" This provides further context about the situation unfolding: a ball has been hit by a player with enough power and trajectory to propel it over the fence. The hit, likely a home run, is also an integral part of a baseball game, strengthening the notion that a person is playing baseball. In summary, the statement \\"A baseball outfielder is leaping against the fence as he watches the ball sail over it\\" undoubtedly conveys that a person is playing baseball. By analyzing the position of the outfielder, the actions depicted, and the presence of a hit ball sailing over the fence, we can confirm that the situation presents itself within a baseball game, involving at least two people engaged in the sport, one of whom is the outfielder in question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yamato Tanooka was found alive and well in a military hut on Friday morning, almost a week after his parents ordered him out of the car as punishment for throwing stones during a family trip to the forest in Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost island. He had spent six nights in the hut, and survived by drinking water from a tap outside and sleeping in between two mattresses to keep warm. Yamato, who was not seriously hurt, is expected to be discharged from hospital on Tuesday. His parents, meanwhile, face possible legal action over suspected psychological abuse, Japanese media reported. His father, Takayuki Tanooka, said he had again apologised to his son for his actions, which attracted widespread criticism on social media. “I said to him, ‘Dad made you go though such a hard time. I am sorry’,” Tanooka, 44, said in an interview with the TBS network that was broadcast on Monday. “And then, my son said, ‘You are a good dad. I forgive you’,” Tanooka added, struggling to hold back tears. The Sankei Shimbun quoted Yamato as saying: “I was wrong, because I didn’t listen to what my dad was saying.” Yamato tried to chase after his parents and sister immediately after being abandoned in the forest on the evening of 28 May, it has emerged. Upset, he lost his sense of direction and started walking away from his parents’ car, the Mainichi Shimbun said. His ordeal ended when three soldiers, seeking shelter from the rain, opened the door to a military hut to find him curled up on a mattress. It has also emerged that police are considering legal action against Yamato’s parents for possible psychological abuse. Police in Hokkaido have submitted written notification about possible abuse to a child welfare centre in the nearby city of Hakodate, the Asahi Shimbun said. His parents faced an avalanche of online criticism for their actions, although some sympathised with their predicament. Tanooka said he had already grown angry with his son because he had been in trouble at school for hitting cars with a stick. “So I tried to show him that I can be scary when I’m seriously angry,” he said, citing what he described as a “father’s dignity”. The Kyodo news agency quoted sources familiar with the case as saying that Tanooka had cried so much after his parents left him at the side of the road in a bear-inhabited area of the forest that he lost his sense of direction. The extraordinary survival of the boy left in a Japanese forest Read more Dressed in a tracksuit, T-shirt and trainers, he set off in the opposite direction in which his parents’ car had been travelling, before coming across an unpaved road that eventually took him to the military hut about 6km away. Yamato reportedly saw no one during the time he spent inside the unheated hut. By the time he was found, he was suffering from mild dehydration and had lost 2kg (4.5lbs), according to Japanese media. He reportedly told his father that he couldn’t remember how he had got to the hut, but said he had managed to overcome his fear of being alone and get some sleep. More details have emerged of the obstacles he would have encountered on his journey to the hut, which, he did not realise at the time, was just a mile away from a private house. Walking along the narrow mountain roads would have extended the distance he covered to about six miles, the Mainichi Shimbun quoted a self-defence force (SDF) soldier as saying. “They are mountain roads that go up and down ... even a member of the SDF would take about two and half hours to get to the military exercise area.” His route, in pitch darkness, would have taken him through a maze of interconnected and unpaved roads lined by thick bushes and tall trees, making it impossible for him to get his bearings. “He probably avoided side roads and chose the wider roads, leading him to the facility where he was found,” the SDF member added. Yamato Tanooka’s story has exposed the perils of parenting | Deborah Orr Read more Yamato reportedly said he had tried to turn on the lights inside the hut, but found there was no power supply. Emergency services, meanwhile, defended the scope of their search, which after six days had uncovered no clues as to his whereabouts. Police said they had expanded the search to include Mount Komagatake after Yamato’s sister said she had seen him walk off in that direction, but had not checked the nearby military training area. “We searched places where we thought a child would be likely to go,” Kyodo quoted a senior police officer as saying. The search, involving up to 180 people, had initially covered a radius of two miles from the spot where Yamato was told to get out of the car, but was later expanded to a 10-mile radius. “Considering the physical strength and mindset of a child, we didn’t think he would head to the mountaintops or off the main road,” a firefighter told Kyodo. There is still no satisfactory explanation for why Yamato was not discovered when soldiers on a regular patrol checked the hut last Monday morning but found nothing out of the ordinary. ||||| Yamato Tanooka, the 7-year-old boy found Friday in a hut at a Self-Defense Forces training facility in southwest Hokkaido six days after he went missing, has said that he lost his sense of direction because he cried so much after his father ordered him to get out of the car. He apparently headed in the opposite direction of the car, sources familiar with the case said Sunday. Because he was scared of the mountains, he continued to walk along the road until he reached the SDF training facility where he was later found. The door was unlocked so he went inside to sleep and avoid the cold outside, he was quoted as telling his father and others. Tanooka told his father he did not see anyone during the six days he was missing. According to other sources, the boy said he stayed at the shelter because he thought someone would eventually find him. After six days of drinking only water and eating no food, his lost 2 kg, Before his ordeal, he weighed 22 kg, sources said. Also on Sunday, police said they notified the Hakodate child consultation center about the incident on Friday as the boy may have been psychologically abused. The latest case also showed how hard it is to predict the actions of children, experts say. “We searched for places where children would likely go,” said a senior police officer at Central Hakodate Police Station, which has jurisdiction over the town of Nanae where Yamato Tanooka went missing on May 28. Tanooka was found inside a shelter where SDF officers taking part in exercises stay overnight. There is a tap outside with running water, but no food. SDF officers who happened to drop by before taking part in Friday’s drill discovered the boy inside the hut. If they had not found him, it could have cost Tanooka his life. Rescuers initially searched an area with a radius of 3 km from the spot where his parents told him to get out of the car as punishment. They eventually widened the radius to 15 km, but went in the opposite direction of the SDF hut. “Considering the strength and mind of a child, we thought that he would not head to the mountain tops or off the road,” said a firefighter who was part of the rescue team. The road heading to the SDF facility is bounded by forest and goes uphill. The distance Tanooka is assumed to have walked is about 10 km. SDF officers sometimes feel they need to be equipped with survival gear when they travel on that road. When a Kyodo News reporter walked along the same stretch of road around 5 p.m. on Saturday — exactly a week after Tanooka was left behind — the light began failing among the tall trees even though it was before sunset. After walking for two hours, only two vehicles passed by, apparently driven by locals. No pedestrians were seen. On Tuesday, three days after Tanooka went missing, rescuers started searching the area uphill from where the boy was last seen. The next day, SDF vehicles went near the training facility. However, since anyone heading to the SDF facility needs to follow animal trails into the forest for about 50 meters, the rescuers did not search further. “It’s not totally wrong to assume that there are limited places for a child to travel compared to adults with knowledge and physical strength,” said Yuji Ishikawa, who heads a group of mountain guides in Hokkaido, “but we also need to keep in mind that children might go to places out of the norm.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Yamato Tanooka, the 7-year-old boy who survived for six nights in a forest in northern Japan, has forgiven his father for the ordeal.

Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes \\"in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements\\". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875. The company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds.The first of the four large-scale estates built by the Artizans Company was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering 42.5 acres (0.17 km2; 0.07 sq mi) built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on 76 acres (0.31 km2; 0.12 sq mi) of land to the west of London, adjacent to the newly opened Westbourne Park station, purchased from All Souls College, Oxford. A third London estate was planned at Cann Hall, and a site of 61 acres (0.25 km2; 0.10 sq mi) was purchased.However, the Queen's Park project... contains an answer for the question: What was the founder of the Artizans Company paid a cent a day to do?, what is it ?

The question is about a negative effect of the invention and use of paper. To answer this question correctly, we need to understand the context of paper's invention and use, and how it impacts our world negatively. Option: 1). increased use of glass bottles. This seems irrelevant, as glass bottles have no direct correlation to the invention and use of paper. 2). increased number of trees cut down. This seems like a viable option, as paper industry is one of the major contributors to deforestation. 3). decreased pollution in trash dumps. This seems like a positive impact, not negative. Paper is biodegradable compared to many other materials, so its use could actually decrease pollution. 4). decreased amount of books to read. This is not relevant, as the invention of paper would presumably increase, not decrease, the number of books. By eliminating options 1, 3, and 4, which do not show a negative effect associated with paper invention and use, the most fitting answer that details a negative outcome is: Answer: 2). increased number of trees cut down.

The death of the Egyptian leader Baibars in 1277 led to disorganization in the Muslim territories, making conditions ripe for a new action by other factions in the Holy Land. The Mongols seized the opportunity, organized a new invasion of Syria, and in September 1280 occupied Bagras and Darbsak, followed by Aleppo on October 20. The Mongol leader Abaqa, taking advantage of his momentum, sent envoys to Edward I of England, the Franks of Acre, King Hugh of Cyprus, and Bohemond VII of Tripoli (son of Bohemond VI), requesting their support for the campaign. But the Crusaders were not organized enough themselves to be of much help. In Acre, the Patriarch's Vicar replied that the city was suffering from hunger, and that the king of Jerusalem was already embroiled in another war. Local Knights Hospitaller from Marqab (in the area which had previously been Antioch/Tripoli) were able to make raids into the Beqaa Valley, as far as the Mamluk-held Krak des Chevaliers in 1280 and 1281. Hugh and Bohemond of Antioch mobilized their armies, but their forces were prevented from joining those of the Mongols by Baibars' successor, the new Egyptian Sultan Qalawun.

He also renewed a second 10-year truce with Bohemond VII of Tripoli on July 16, 1281, and affirmed pilgrim access to Jerusalem.In September 1281 the Mongols returned, with 50,000 of their own troops, plus 30,000 others including Armenians under Leo III, Georgians, and 200 Knights Hospitaller from Marqab, who sent a contingent even though..., what would be the answer ?

Four years later, Mandela is elected the first black President of South Africa. His presidency faces enormous challenges in the post-Apartheid era, including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and white South Africans, which could lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela's predecessors, and the black ANC additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust. While attending a game between the Springboks, the country's rugby union team, and England, Mandela recognises that the blacks in the stadium are cheering for England, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, FranÃ§ois Pienaar, and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with FranÃ§ois a British poem, \\"Invictus\\", that had inspired him during his time in prison. FranÃ§ois and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of racial tensions, as for many blacks, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise white supremacy.

Answer:","completion":"Millennium Force, a roller coaster located at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, was the first roller coaster to feature an elevator cable lift system. This innovative system was introduced when the roller coaster opened in 2000. The elevator cable lift system is a type of lift mechanism that uses a cable driven by a motor at the top of the lift hill. The train gets engaged with the cable at the bottom of the hill, and the cable pulls the train upward at a higher speed compared to a traditional chain lift. The system allows for a smoother, faster, and quieter ascent than a conventional chain lift. In the case of Millennium Force, the system enables the train to climb its 310-foot-tall (94 meters) lift hill at a steep 45-degree angle, reaching the top in just about 20 seconds. The use of an elevator cable lift system on Millennium Force not only allowed for a higher and faster ride, but it also set a new standard for roller coaster design, leading to the development of more advanced and thrilling rides in the following years."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given commands (in terms of logical operations) to select relevant rows from the given table.

He returned to live at his parents' home in Tanworth-in-Arden, and while he resented the regression, he accepted that his illness made it necessary. \\"I don't like it at home,\\" he told his mother, \\"but I can't bear it anywhere else.\\" His return was often difficult for his family; Gabrielle said, \\"good days in my parents' home were good days for Nick, and bad days were bad days for Nick. And that was what their life revolved around, really.\\"Drake lived a frugal existence; his only income was a £20-a-week retainer he received from Island Records (equivalent to £238 in 2018). At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes. He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: \\"He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back.\\" Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously depressed: \\"There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around.\\"John Martyn (who in 1973 wrote the title song of his album Solid Air about Drake) described Drake in this period as the most withdrawn person he had ever met. He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose, until he ran out of petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected. Friends recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails. Early in 1972, Drake had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.

Let the closet dry by keeping the door open so fresh air goes inside. 4. Put pieces of baking soda, charcoal, or any air freshener inside the closet. 5. Arrange the clothes and stuff neatly back inside the closet. Method 2: 1. Use a dehumidifier or small fan to reduce humidity. 2. Add some lavender sachets, cedar balls, or mothballs to give a nice smell. 3. Keep the closet door open so air can circulate.

How can we do better sex?","completion":"While the two questions may seem similar at first glance, they have some subtle differences in their focus and implications. Let's explore their meanings and the potential answers to these questions. 1. \\"How can I have better sex with my wife?\\" This question revolves around improving the sexual experience specifically within the context of a marital relationship. The person asking the question is looking for ways to enhance sexual satisfaction and pleasure for both themselves and their wife. The focus is on the individual's role in this process and how they can contribute to making the experience better. Answers to this question could include: - Communication: Open and honest discussions about each other's desires, fantasies, and boundaries can help both partners understand what brings pleasure and satisfaction to the other. - Emotional intimacy: Strengthening emotional connection through regular quality time spent together, meaningful conversations, and expressions of love and appreciation lays a strong foundation for a fulfilling sexual relationship. - Experimentation: Trying new sexual activities, techniques, or positions can help break the monotony and rekindle the excitement in the bedroom. - Ensuring mutual pleasure: Make an effort to ensure that both partners' needs are met – this includes engaging in adequate foreplay, focusing on mutually enjoyable activities, and addressing any discomfort or concerns. - Educating yourself: Acquiring knowledge about sexual health and techniques through books, articles, or workshops can help individuals become more skilled and confident in the bedroom. 2. \\"How can we do better sex?\\" This question is more general in nature and implies that both partners are equally involved in the process of improving their sexual experience. It suggests a collaborative approach where both partners work together to enhance their sexual relationship and satisfaction. Answers to this question could include: - Open communication: Actively listen and empathize with each other's needs and desires, and create a safe space for open dialogue, without judgment or criticism. - Mutual consent: Ensure that both partners agree on trying new activities and establish boundaries that protect the comfort and safety of each individual. - Emotional connection: Develop a deeper emotional bond by sharing thoughts, feelings, and experiences outside of the bedroom. Emotional intimacy is a key component of a satisfying sexual relationship. - Sexual education: Both partners can educate themselves on various aspects of sexual health and well-being, and share their learnings with one another. This includes understanding anatomy, arousal, and pleasure for optimal sexual experiences. - Explore fantasies: Sharing and exploring each other's fantasies can bring novelty and excitement into the relationship. Mutually agreed-upon fantasies will add variety to your sexual experiences. - Prioritize pleasure: Focus on the journey of pleasure and not just the end goal (orgasm). This includes attentive foreplay, sensual touch, and experimenting with different sensations that bring pleasure to both partners. - Practice patience and mindfulness: Allow for the natural ebb and flow of desire. Being present and attentive during sexual encounters can create deeper connections and more fulfilling experiences. In conclusion, while there is some overlap in the answers to these questions, the key differences lie in their focus and scope. The first question emphasizes the asker's role in enhancing their marital sexual relationship, while the second question highlights a collaborative approach between both partners to improve their sexual experiences."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Here is an article: David Gardner, 50, of Reno is arrested by the LAPD on suspicion of trying… (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles…) A team of burglars has been roaming the streets of downtown Los Angeles, search for aging, vacant buildings they can strip bare. Over the last year, at least four buildings have been stripped clear of copper wiring and other metals during brazen heists that often take days to complete. Police estimate each job can yield 1 million or more in metals — and cost much more for property owners to repair the damage. On Thursday, detectives said they caught one alleged member of the team in the act at the old Garfield Building at 8th and Hill streets. Police swarmed the building after being alerted by construction workers who noticed wet footprints and heard voices. SWAT officers and police dogs crept through the 1928 Art Deco tower in complete darkness, dodging a pipe booby trap the burglars apparently had set up. They arrested a suspect hiding in a dusty corner on the seventh floor. Police believe he and others spent days ripping out newly installed copper wiring from walls, stripping transformers of wire and stealing pipe and sprinkler heads from the 13-floor structure. They found that the burglars apparently had lowered a massive transformer from an upper floor to the basement, using old fire hoses. The basement was stacked with piles of items the burglars planned to remove, police said. Los Angeles Police Department Lt. Paul Vernon said officers believe the team also stripped the vacant Commercial Exchange Building across the street, which, like the Garfield, is being renovated. The estimated loss at that building was 1 million. Suspect David Gardner, 50 of Reno was led away in handcuffs from the Garfield Building. \\"We are booking him for a burglary from September, when 1.5 million worth of copper and other metals were taken. That time he was seen with tools but fled,\\" Vernon said. \\"We believe he is part of a crew or crews who targeted these grand old buildings that are being restored.\\" The burglars at the Garfield went to elaborate lengths, somehow tapping into the power supply to run lights and the heavy tools needed to take the items. Witnesses told police that a van, truck and Japanese import car had been seen parked in back of the vacant building, and detectives believe the vehicles were used to move the stolen items. Police said the thieves burn off insulation to get to wires and burrow into walls seeking valuable copper, which sells for 4.22 a pound. The burglars only make pennies on the real value of the copper and often work for others who take most of the profits, investigators said. Most of the metal is sold to recyclers in Southern California and within days is bound for countries such as China and India, whose rapidly growing economies have enormous needs for metals. For the burglars, it can be a dangerous business. In October, a man was electrocuted and his wife was burned as they stripped wire from an underground vault in South Gate. Two men were killed last year in Riverside County while stealing copper from a utility vault. The Garfield appeared to be a potentially lucrative spot for the ring. In addition to copper wiring, the thieves had stacked large amounts of pipe and sprinkler heads in the basement.

The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's...

Given the question: Article: Apple a day may poison children Children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding the pesticide safety limit because of remains on the fruit,according to research. Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Final preparations are underway for Friday’s historic third summit between the leaders of North and South Korea. In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War. Moon and Kim will hold direct talks in the Peace House conference hall, both in the morning and the afternoon, but the North Korean delegation will...

However, it does not specifically answer the question \\"When was the first documented translation efforts by foreign Buddhist monks in China?\\" While both pieces of information involve the transmission of Buddhism to China, the sentence provided does not explicitly address the matter of translation, let alone the involvement of foreign Buddhist monks in such efforts. It simply talks about the origination and the timeline of Buddhism's spread to China, without specifying if and when any translation work by foreign Buddhist monks took place. In the ancient times, translation efforts were so vital because Buddhism was originally taught in several languages, primarily Pali and Sanskrit, which were not understood by the common Chinese populace. Buddhism needed to be translated into the local Chinese language for the ideas to be comprehended and spread. These translation efforts were a massive and significant undertaking, often involving foreign and local monks, state sponsorship and the development of new translation techniques and vocabularies. As such, the start of these efforts marks an important point in the spread of Buddhism to China, one that's separate from the initial transmission of Buddhism to the country via the Silk Road.

It is traditionally written with embossed paper. Braille users can read computer screens and other electronic supports thanks to refreshable braille displays. They can write braille with the original slate and stylus or type it on a braille writer, such as a portable braille notetaker or computer that prints with a braille embosser. Braille is named after its creator, Louis Braille, a Frenchman who lost his sight as a result of a childhood accident. In 1824, at age 15, he developed a code for the French alphabet as an improvement on night writing. He published his system, which subsequently included musical notation, in 1829. The second revision, published in 1837, was the first binary form of writing developed in the modern era. Braille characters are rectangular blocks called \\"cells\\" containing tiny bumps called \\"raised dots\\". The number and arrangement of these dots distinguish one character from another. Since the various braille alphabets originated as transcription codes for printed writing, the mappings (sets of character designations) vary from language to language. Furthermore, in English Braille there are three levels of encoding: Grade 1 – a letter-by-letter transcription used for basic literacy; Grade 2 – an addition of abbreviations and contractions; and Grade 3 – various non-standardized personal shorthands. Answer this series of questions: 1. Who came up with Braille? 2. Is it named for him? 3. When was he trying to make night writing better? 4. What did his code represent? 5. How old was he then? 6.

So, we have this fun little math problem with a bunch of the same letters, but don't be scared. These letters are called variables, and right now they're standing in for a number we don't know yet. First, let's simplify the problem a little bit by adding like terms together. On the left side of the equation, we've got 162*a - 279*a. If you had 162 apples (a) and someone took away 279 apples, you would lose apples, right? The same idea applies here. If we take 279 from 162, we get -117*a. Think of this like having negative or, less than zero, 117 apples. On the right side of the equation we have 133*a and 134*a. If we add those together (just like if we had 133 apples and someone gave us 134 more), we get 267*a. Then, we subtract 19200 (like taking away 19200 apples) which gives us 267*a - 19200. So after all that adding and subtracting of apples, our equation now reads -117*a = 267*a - 19200. Next, to make our equation even simpler, we are going to move that -117*a from the left side to the right side of the equation by adding 117*a to both sides. This makes our equation: 0 = 267*a + 117*a - 19200. Just like before, we add 267 and 117 together to get 384*a - 19200. With this new equation, our unknown number a is being multiplied by 384 and then have 19200 subtracted. To solve for a, we want to get 'a' all by itself. So, first let's get rid of that -19200 by adding 19200 to both sides of the equation. This will give us: 19200 = 384*a. Now the only thing left to do is to get a by itself by dividing by 384 on both sides. So, a = 19200 / 384. After doing the math here, the solution to the problem is a = 50. Hope this helps! Math can be a little scary but remember, take all the time you need and practice makes perfect!"},{"prompt":"Q:Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Article: SAN FRANCISCO -- In the western U.S., Hawaii and elsewhere across the globe, moon watchers were treated on Saturday to a rare celestial phenomenon: a total lunar eclipse . For about 50 minutes starting at 6:06 a.m. PST, the moon was completely blocked by the Earth's shadow. With only some indirect sunlight able to reach it after passing through the Earth's atmosphere, the moon took on a reddish weak light. Since the atmosphere scatters blue light, only red light strikes the moon, giving it a dark red color1. Dally Sam, who runs a public relations firm in Hawaii, said it had been cloudy and rainy, but the weather cleared just in time for the eclipse. Around 3 a.m., he awoke, as he usually does, and remembered to step outside the house in time to catch the beginning of the eclipse about a half hour later. No one else in the neighborhood was up then. \\"It was turning that dark red color1,\\" Sayre, aged 47, said, \\"I'd better get a camera. To be able to see it just right outside our house was really cool.\\" At the local observatory in Los Angeles, some 300 people, many holding coffee cups in the cold morning air, sat with blankets and chairs on the observatory's great grass land. \\"It's really a celestial festival out here,\\" John Peter, aged 39, told the Los Angeles Times as he set up his camera. Lying on a slope north of downtown near the Hollywood sign, the place offers clear views of the sky.

They clean up the mess after traffic collisions. Their emblem is the Totenkopf symbol (skull and crossbones variant) within a pentagram.[4][5] This job leaves him the perfect opportunity to pursue his full-time hobby: necrophilia. He returns home from his job to his apartment and girlfriend, Betty. He plays with his assortment of preserved human remains and watches television while Betty takes a bath in blood-laden water. Their apartment is decorated with centerfolds featuring models, pictures of famed killers, and jars containing human parts, which are preserved in formaldehyde.[4] Rob watches a televised interview of a psychiatrist, speaking on the topic of arachnophobia and ways to overcome phobias.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Orrin Grant Hatch (born March 22, 1934) is an American attorney and politician serving as the senior United States Senator for Utah who has been the President pro tempore of the United States Senate since 2015. Having been a senator since 1977, Hatch is the longest-serving Republican Senator in U.S. history. Hatch served as either the chair or ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1993 to 2005. He previously served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions from 1981 to 1987 and currently serves as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee as well as serving on the board of directors for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Hatch has long been a proponent of expanding intellectual property rights, and introduced the Senate version of the Copyright Term Extension Act in 1997. Hatch believes intellectual property laws should, in general, more closely mirror real property laws, and offer greater protections to authors and creators. Hatch caused an overnight controversy on June 17, 2003 by proposing that copyright owners should be able to destroy the computer equipment and information of those suspected of copyright infringement, including file sharing, he stated that \\"This may be the only way you can teach somebody about copyrights.\\" In the face of criticism, especially from technology and privacy advocates, Hatch withdrew his suggestion days later, after it was discovered that Sen. Hatch's official website was using an unlicensed JavaScript menu from United Kingdom-based software developer Milonic Solutions. Milonic founder Andy Woolley stated that \\"We've had no contact with them. They are in breach of our licensing terms.\\" Shortly after the publication of that story in Wired magazine, the company that runs Hatch's website contacted Milonic to start registration. One year later, he proposed the controversial INDUCE Act that attempted to make illegal all tools that could be used for copyright infringement if said tools were intentionally used for illegal copyright infringement. On September 20, 2010, Hatch once again attempted to outlaw websites which could be used for trademark and copyright infringement through the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA).

Write a title for this article: New natural gas rig counts hit the wires Friday morning and on cue the number decreased yet another 15 rigs to 422, another 21st century low and a massive 55% below the 936 peak one year ago. An article was published by me on July 22nd predicting a spike to 8.00 natural gas by this winter. Well, we are right on track. During that July week natural gas storage numbers were 19.2% and 17.5% respectively above the one and five year averages. Back then we had had eleven straight weeks of below normal storage injections. Since that time we have had a look at thirteen more data points twelve of which were below normal so now the “glut” has diminished to only 6.8% and 7.8% more than the one and five year averages. Thursday’s actual storage injection was 72 Bcf against a 108 Bcf increase one year ago this week. I have continued to inspect decline curves for wells in the Eagle Ford shale. After viewing records for over 70 wells with between nine and eighteen months of production data, the declines continue to be precipitous. A one year decline rate of 80% or more was more the norm than the exception for the data I inspected. In other words a well making 800 BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) on day one, more likely than not was generating well under 200 BOE twelve months later. So I wondered whether there was any recent literature to corroborate my own empirical evidence. Gary Swindell a Dallas, Texas petroleum engineer did an Eagle Ford shale study analyzing 1,041 wells in ten Eagle Ford shale counties with current drilling activity. Similar to my own findings he found decline rates on average were 76%. But he explored much deeper to determine if Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) of a well was dependent on such metrics as frac size in thousands of pounds of sand, distance of the perforated length of the horizontal drill pipe, and the well’s Initial Potential or IP. The conclusion was there was some correlation between more oil and gas produced and bigger and longer fracs up to a point at which time there were diminishing returns. For example, Fracs over 5,000 feet horizontally generally showed lesser returns as did Fracs using over 6,000 pounds of sand. The IP represents the initial production of those first few test days when the well produces at its highest outputs. Swindell also did a simple time test. Were wells getting better, meaning more productive as time passed? Was experience and technology increasing drilling efficacy? Back in July there were lots of criticisms on my previous article claiming how much more efficient drilling is today which more than offsets the dwindling rig supply. The evidence concluded than up until 2010, in the Eagle Ford at least, wells indeed improved, but subsequent to that there has been a plateauwith no increaesed productivity gains for over two years. The most stunning and damning discovery by far was that of the 1,041 wells, the average EUR was only 206,779 BOE per well. Not surprisingly most public companies tend to report or advertise only their IP on a well which is all the SEC and the Texas Railroad Commission requires. They may throw investors a bone and report the first 30 days average production. Many public exploration firms active in the Eagle Ford such as Marathon may publicize EUR’s as high as 340,000 to 500,000 BOE. To my knowledge, no public companies are reporting such rapid well decline rates as are shown in both my limited study and the Swindell report. For investors and analysts to make informed decisions companies should make public after three and six months both the well flow rate (how much the well has declined from IP) and more importantly the surface flowing pressure. Rapidly declining pressure is indicative of a shorter well life and is a predictive measure of well decline rates. Therefore if there really are significantly lower EUR’s than the world has come to take for granted, then the whole shale oil and gas economics must be revisited. While we have proven there are gas vast reserves to be mined, at what price levels does it make sense to pursue these opprtunities? These wells are a mixture of both oil and gas. The study goes through February of 2012. Swindell actually does something kind of weird. The energy or British Thermal Unit (Btu) equivalent of 1 barrel of oil is (Bbl) 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas or 6 Mcf. But because of the huge price differential between oil and gas (it was even more pronounced back then) Mr. Swindell chooses to use a ratio of 20 Mcf to equal 1 Bbl of oil. Therefore when I convert his oil and gas computations (using his 20 to 1 ratio) into a straight natural gas well it shows that each well brings in on average 3.4 Bcf of natural gas reserves. Using the true Btu equivalent ratio would yield even lower reserve numbers. Anyway, the typical 8,000 to 12,000 feet below surface well, be it in the South Texas Eagle Ford or the East Texas/North Louisiana Haynesville play costs plus or minus 10 million. At 4.00 gas this is gross revenue of 13.6 million before deducting a ¼ or 25% royalty payment to the landowners, 7.5%Texas severance tax, 2.5% ad valorem taxes, and well operating expenses. I nearly forgot the pipeline prep to clean the gas of deadly H2S (Hydrogen Sulfide) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) and to rid excess water to below 7 ppm (parts per million.) Now it is ready for the KMP or KMR high pressure pipeline. All this costs about .25. So you are left with about 60% or 2.40 or 8.16 million for your 10 million investment. At 5.00 Mcf gas you break about even and at 6.00 gas the compounded return is under 5%. Don’t forget it takes ten years or more to get most of your money back. There are a lot of pro-forma numbers that have estimated the EUR at Eagle Ford and Hayneville shale plays to be 6 Bcf or almost twice what the studies are showing. In fact 6 Bcf per well was the assumption used in my July article. Also keep in mind gas has only just recently spiked to close to 3.60 and has spent much of the last month or two near 3.00 or below. Drilling for it continues to be a very bad deal. We have six or seven more weeks left in the shoulder season. Our current storage is 236 Bcf higher than last year. With six weeks left, storage injections must average just under 40 Bcf less than last years numbers. I think we will end up below last year’s storage but we can debate, and like Biden and Ryan vociferously disagree. Anyway, let’s compromise and assume storage levels end the shoulder season 120 Bcf above last year. And let’s say we have a normal winter. With what may be less than 400 gas rigs in operation, sooner rather than later supplies will get very strained and a price spike is highly likely. How have we had 23 of the last 24 weeks of below normal storage injections unless gas supplies are slowly and inexorably becoming strained? My thoughts are that the drilling done five and six months ago, that came on line three and four months ago is now going into a very rapid decline period that will soon show up in monthly production numbers. If we have any kind of an early cold snap, 400 rigs will not be able to alleviate tight supplies. We need gas sustainable from 4.50 to 5.00 Mcf to get the gas rig fleet re commissioned. The US Energy Information Association (EIA) household fuel consumption estimates for October 2012 through March 2013 forecasts between 5 and 30% more heating days than the comparable 2011-2012 period. Even the staid EIA predicts 2012 overall demand to increase 4.7% to 69.76 Bcf/day which is in excess of their overall 2012 calculus for gas supply of 68.8 Bcf/day.

Twelve Republicans opposed the measure, and not a single Democrat supported it. The plan by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., would cut more than 5 trillion over the coming decade to reach balance by 2024. The sharpest cuts would come to health care programs for the poor and uninsured, food stamps, and array of domestic programs, including Pell Grants, education, and community development grants. The follow-up legislation is likely to be limited to a round of annual spending bills that will adhere to a bipartisan budget pact enacted in December. But the Ryan plan paints a picture of what Republicans will try to do if they claim the Senate this fall and the White House in 2016. Its cuts to entrenched benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid, however, would be difficult to pass even if Republicans gain control of both the House and Senate in this fall's elections. Democrats are seizing on the debate to cast Republicans as cruelly cutting programs that keep people out of poverty and help sustain the middle class. \\"It's totally out of touch with the priorities and values of the country,\\" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. \\"This is a clear road map of what Republicans in Congress would do if they had the power to do it.\\" Republicans say the tough cuts they promise would strengthen the economy because less government borrowing would boost savings and investment. And they say it's simply unfair to saddle future generations with mountains of debt. \\"The sooner we tackle these fiscal problems, the better off everybody is going to be, the faster the economy grows, and the more we can guarantee that the next generation inherits a debt-free future,\\" said Ryan. Republicans opposing the bill were mostly tea party adherents such as Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, as well as several members of the Georgia delegation who are competing in a Senate primary. A handful of more moderate members from the Northeast, including Reps. Chris Gibson of New York and Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey, also opposed it. At issue is the arcane congressional budget process, which employs a nonbinding measure known as a budget resolution to set forth goals for future taxes, spending and deficits. But follow-up legislation is usually limited to one-year appropriations bills rather than more difficult measures to deal with the government's long-term fiscal challenges, which are fueled by spiraling health care costs and the retirement of the baby boom generation. Ryan's plan revives a now-familiar list of spending cuts to promise balance, including 2.1 trillion over 10 years in health care subsidies and coverage under the Affordable Care Act; 732 billion in cuts to Medicaid and other health care programs; and almost 1 trillion in cuts to other benefit programs like food stamps, Pell Grants and farm subsidies. Even though it would repeal the Affordable Care Act's benefits, Ryan's plan would preserve its tax increases and cuts to providers, including cuts to private insurers under the Medicare Advantage program. Republicans have attacked Democrats over the Medicare cuts used to finance the new health care law. The measure also promises deep, probably unrealistic cuts to domestic programs like education, health research and grants to local governments that are funded each year through annual appropriations bills. As in the past, Ryan has steered clear of cuts to Social Security, and he promises steady increases for veterans and restoration of looming defense cuts. But he faces a more challenging task to promise to balance the budget by decade's end than he did last year because the Congressional Budget Office projects lagging revenues. Steep cuts to Medicaid, which Ryan proposes to turn into a block grant program managed by the states, could drive millions of people from the program, including seniors in nursing homes and children from low-income households. Ryan's plan also reprises a failed strategy from last year to cut domestic agency operating budgets and shift the money to the Pentagon after 2015. When Republicans tried that last year, the House was unable to pass the follow-up spending bills implementing the cuts. Earlier versions of Ryan's plan have passed the House three times since the GOP won control of the chamber following the 2010 midterm elections. Like the others, this year's plan would require people who enroll in Medicare in 2024 to be given a subsidy -- called \\"premium support\\" by Republicans, derided as a voucher system by Democrats -- with which they would purchase health insurance on the open market. Republicans say the system is required to prevent the budget from spiraling out of control as more baby boomers retire and the present system collapses. They also say the redesigned Medicare program would offer seniors more choices and curb costs. Critics, however, say the Medicare subsidies won't keep up with inflation and will require sharply higher out-of-pocket costs for future seniors.

When their younger sister Polly asks Tom if the Queen is coming to their house, Tom says that she only exists in the story. However, the Snow Queen really does live in an icy palace in the North Pole with her three troll servants: Eric, Baggy, and Wardrobe. Her plan is to set up her huge magic mirror on a mountain to reflect the sunlight away so the entire world will become her kingdom. But the mirror falls down the mountain and lands on the trolls' flying machine where it shatters into pieces. Two of the pieces hit Tom in the eye and the heart that he falls into an evil curse. The Snow Queen sends her bats to retrieve the pieces. As they cannot take the two that are inside Tom, the Queen goes out to kidnap him. Ellie and Tom connect their sleds to a bigger sled that is revealed to be driven by the Snow Queen.

As early as 1808,the people of Provincetown requested a lighthouse on Race Point,but it took Congress eight years to react when they finally paid 8,000 on April 27,1816 to build a lighthouse --Race Point Light,which was located in the town of Provincetown,Massachusetts.It was first built of stone 25 feet high with no foundation and its light was 30 feet above the sea.It was equipped with one of the nation's earliest revolving lights. Actually,there were two other lighthouses on Cape Cod,but they were hit by a storm in October 1841.In the following year,Race Point Light was examined by I.W.P.Lewis,who realized the light's importance.He said,\\"The light should be useful to all ships leaving Boston.However,its _ power is so weak that people would hardly be able to differentiate it from the lights set on the ships which stay in the bay,or close by.It hasn't played its role as a lighthouse well.\\" The result was that old lighthouse was destroyed and a new iron lighthouse with a proper foundation was put up to take its place.The new lighthouse was 45 feet high.Although the original keeper's house was in good repair,it was destroyed too and a new one was built.Today the lighthouse has been automated and Race Point Light is still an active aid to navigation. You can park at Race Point Beach and walk about 45 minutes to the lighthouse.Sunset at Race Point Light is one of the Cape Cod's most popular scenes.And at times whales can be seen in the lighthouse.For reservations to stay one night in the keeper's house at Race Point call(508)487-9930.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: who did russians descend from? Answer:","completion":"Russians, the largest ethnic group in Russia, descended from a complex historical background that involves various ancient groups and migration waves. The origin of the Russians can be traced back to the Eastern Slavs, who were a combination of tribes that inhabited the lands between the Carpathian Mountains, the Dnieper River, and the Oka-Don Lowland. Notable groups that contributed to this ethnic mix include the following: 1. East Slavic Tribes: The core of the early Russian people emerged from several East Slavic tribes, such as the Vyatichs, Krivichs, Dregovichs, Radimichs, and Ilmen Slavs. Over time, these tribes shared common customs, languages, and religions, which shaped the historical Russian identity. 2. Varangians: In the 9th century, the Scandinavian Vikings, also known as Varangians, arrived in Eastern Europe. They played a crucial role in establishing the Kievan Rus', the first major East Slavic state. The legendary Varangian leader, Rurik, founded the Rurik Dynasty, which ruled Kievan Rus' and later its successor states, including the Grand Duchy of Moscow. 3. Finno-Ugric Tribes: Finno-Ugric peoples, such as the Merya, Muroma, and Meshchera, inhabited the northeastern parts of today's Russia. They interacted and partially assimilated with the Slavic population, contributing to the Russian ethnogenesis process. 4. Turkic and Mongolic Peoples: Following the Mongol invasion of Rus' in the early 13th century, Russians had long-term contacts with Turkic and Mongolic peoples of the Golden Horde, which ruled over various East Slavic territories for two centuries. This interaction led to the cultural and linguistic exchange that left a lasting impact on the Russian people. 5. Tatars and Bashkirs: Tatars, Bashkirs, and other Turkic peoples from the Volga region also had close interactions with the Russians. A prominent example is the Tatar influence in the development of the early Grand Duchy of Moscow. 6. Other Ethnicities: Throughout history, the territory of modern Russia experienced various migratory waves and invasions, including those of the Huns, Avars, Bulgars, Khazars, Pechenegs, and Cumans. These groups interacted with the nascent Russian population and contributed, to varying degrees, to Russia's ethnogenesis. Ultimately, the modern Russian ethnic identity is the result of many centuries of cultural, linguistic, and genetic interactions between various East Slavic tribes and other neighboring groups. The formation of the Russian state and its expansion throughout the centuries amplified this process, creating a diverse and complex background for the Russian people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits. He is planning to write a paper on why some species are greater in number while others are smaller in number. Which species' traits would be less common, species A or species B? Hint: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. A:","completion":"In David's exploration of the theory of evolution and natural selection proposed by Darwin and Wallace, he is particularly interested in understanding the differences in population size between species A and species B. As the question specified, species A has some helpful traits, while species B has some harmful traits. We will examine how these differing traits might affect the respective populations of these two deer species, and which species' traits would be less common. The theory of evolution by natural selection, as laid out by Darwin and Wallace, states that heritable traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction will become more common in a population over time. Conversely, harmful traits or those that do not provide a significant benefit to survival and reproduction will become less prevalent. This selective process is driven by the organisms' \\"fitness\\" or their ability to survive and reproduce in a given environment. In the case of species A, which possesses helpful traits, it can be deduced that these traits would provide advantages in terms of survival and reproduction. Organisms within species A would be better suited to their environment because of these traits, resulting in greater reproductive success and, ultimately, an increase in their population size. Over several generations, the proportion of individuals possessing these helpful traits would continue to rise due to the adaptive advantages they provide. On the other hand, species B is characterized by harmful traits that negatively impact their survival and reproductive success. These traits do not provide any benefits for adapting to their environment, and, as a result, the individuals within species B would be at a disadvantage compared to those in species A. The organisms in species B would likely have lower survival rates and decreased reproductive success, leading to a decline in the number of individuals possessing these harmful traits over time. Therefore, when comparing species A and species B, the traits of species B would be less common due to the influence of natural selection acting against their harmful traits. Species A, with their helpful traits, would experience an increase in population size and persistence of these advantageous traits. In summary, David's paper would likely focus on the role that natural selection plays in influencing the prevalence of certain traits in populations, specifically comparing the helpful traits of species A and the harmful traits of species B. The paper could explore how these traits affect each species' survival and reproductive success, leading to differences in population size. Species A's helpful traits would become more common due to their adaptive advantages, while species B's harmful traits would become less common as natural selection works against those traits and favors individuals with more advantageous traits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: I recall my mother's voice which called me to order, and often ended with some strong proverb to express the gravity of the wrong done. It was common practice for my mother to send me off soul-searching with a proverb. Of the many interactions I had with my mother those many years ago, one stands out with clarity. I remember the occasion when Mother sent me to the main road, about twenty yards away from the farmhouse, to invite a passing group of seasonal work-seekers home for a meal. She instructed me to take a container along and collect dry cow dung for making a fire. I was then to prepare the meal for the group of work-seekers. The thought of making an open fire outside at midday, cooking in a large three-legged pot in that high heat, was enough to upset even an angel. I did not manage to hide my feelings from my mother, and after serving the group, she called me to the balcony, where she usually sat to attend to her sewing . Looking straight into my eyes, she said, \\"Tsholofelo, why were you so unhappy when I requested you to prepare a meal for those poor people?\\" Despite my attempt to deny her allegation , and using the heat of the fire and the sun as an excuse for my alleged behavior, Mother, giving me a firm look, said, \\"A foot has no nose.\\" It means, \\"You can't detect what trouble may lie ahead of you.\\" Had I denied the group of people a meal, it may have happened that, in my travels some time in the future, I found myself at the mercy of those very individuals. As if that was not enough to shame me, Mother continued, \\"A person is a person because of another person.\\" Question: What was Tsholofelo's attitude towards the meal? Options: A: Unwilling. B: Interested. C: Critical. D: Unconcerned. Answer:","completion":"A: Unwilling. Explanation: Tsholofelo was not happy about preparing the meal for the group of work-seekers due to the inconvenience of making an open fire in the high heat. They attempted to hide their feelings but failed to do so. By expressing unhappiness and finding the situation upsetting, Tsholofelo demonstrates an unwilling attitude towards the task."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

By Joel Christie and Associated Press Reporter Investigators believe the missing pregnant wife of a California-based Marine may have been shot while hunting with a married ex-Marine with whom she was having an affair. Court documents say that on the day she disappeared three weeks ago, 20-year-old Erin Corwin had planned to meet with Christopher Brandon Lee to spend a day together on a hunting trip, according to an affidavit obtained by The Desert Sun. The detective's affidavit shows the investigation is focusing on married father-of-one Lee, 24, who may have been the father of Corwin's child. The affidavit also states Lee's wife, Nichole Lee, told a friend police 'would never find the body' and that she scolded her husband for 'not being able to keep his lies straight when he was interviewed by detectives because he was dumb'. The device turned out to be a potato gun, but OPTIONS: - Associated Press was held for two days before being released on bail. - California was held for two days before being released on bail. - Christopher Brandon Lee was held for two days before being released on bail. - Corwin was held for two days before being released on bail. - Erin Corwin was held for two days before being released on bail. - Joel Christie was held for two days before being released on bail. - Lee was held for two days before being released on bail. - Marine was held for two days before being released on bail. - Nichole Lee was held for two days before being released on bail. - The Desert Sun. was held for two days before being released on bail.","completion":"- Christopher Brandon Lee was held for two days before being released on bail. The correct answer is that Christopher Brandon Lee was held for two days before being released on bail. This is because the story revolves around the suspicion that Lee may have been involved in the disappearance of Erin Corwin, with whom he was having an affair. As a suspect in the case, it's logical that he would be the one held for questioning before being released. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - Associated Press, Joel Christie, and The Desert Sun are all news-related entities, not individuals connected to the story. - California and Marine refer to locations, not specific individuals involved in the case. - Erin Corwin is the missing pregnant wife, and being a victim, it would be inappropriate for her to be held. - Nichole Lee is Christopher's wife and although she expressed doubts about his ability to keep his story straight, there is no information in the text indicating that she was held or involved in the incident herself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bernhard was born Bernhard Leopold Friedrich Eberhard Julius Kurt Karl Gottfried Peter, Count of Biesterfeld in Jena, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, German Empire on 29 June 1911, the elder son of Prince Bernhard of Lippe and his wife, Armgard von Cramm. He was a grandson of Ernest, Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld, who was regent of the Principality of Lippe until 1904. He was also a nephew of the principality's last sovereign Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe. Bernhard met then-Princess Juliana at the 1936 Winter Olympics at Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Juliana's mother, Queen Wilhelmina, had spent most of the 1930s looking for a suitable husband for Juliana. As a Protestant of royal rank (the Lippe-Biesterfelds were a sovereign house in the German Empire), Bernhard was acceptable for the devoutly religious Wilhelmina. Wilhelmina left nothing to chance, and had her lawyers draft a very detailed prenuptial agreement that specified exactly what Bernhard could and could not do. The couple's engagement was announced on 8 September 1936, and they were married at The Hague on 7 January 1937. Earlier, Bernhard had been granted Dutch citizenship, and changed the spelling of his names from German to Dutch. Previously styled as Serene Highness, he became a Royal Highness by Dutch Law. His appropriateness as consort of the future Queen would later become a matter of some public debate. Prince Bernhard was father of six children, four of them with Queen Juliana. The eldest daughter is Princess Beatrix, former Queen of the Netherlands, (1938). His other daughters with Juliana are Irene (1939), Margriet (1943) and Christina (1947). He had two illegitimate daughters. The first is Alicia von Bielefeld (born 21 June 1952), whose mother has not been identified. She is a landscape architect and lives in the United States. Prince Bernhard's sixth daughter, Alexia Grinda (a.k.a. Alexia Lejeune or Alexia Grinda-Lejeune, born in Paris on 10 July 1967), is his child by the French socialite and fashion model Helene Grinda. Although rumours about these two children had already spread, it was made official after his death. In December 2008, Dutch historian Cees Fasseur claimed that former British Conservative Cabinet Minister Jonathan Aitken was the result of a wartime affair between Prince Bernhard and Aitken's mother, previously Penelope Maffey.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the full names of George's friends who visit for dinner on January 5?, using the article: On January 5, 1900, four friends arrive for a dinner at the London home of their inventor friend George, but he is not there. He arrives suddenly, bedraggled and exhausted, and begins describing the strange experiences he has had since they last met. At their earlier dinner on New Year's Eve, George said that time was \\"the fourth dimension\\". He shows David Filby, Dr. Philip Hillyer, Anthony Bridewell, and Walter Kemp a small model time machine and asks one of them to press a tiny lever on the model. The device disappears, validating his claim, but his friends remain unconvinced; their reactions vary from curiosity to frank dismissal. George bids his guests a good evening, then heads downstairs where his full-size time machine awaits. He presses a lever and moves forward through time 17 years into the future to September 15, 1917. He meets Filby's son, James, who tells him of Filby's death in a war. Saddened, he resumes his journey, stopping on June 19, 1940 during The Blitz, finding himself in the midst of \\"a new war\\"; George resumes his journey and his house is hit by a bomb and is destroyed.

What sort of situation did the bring around the governor? Here are possible answers to this question: - shock - sorrow - controversy - fear - pain I believe the correct choice is \\"controversy\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Controversy,\\" and this can be explained in several ways. When the senator went public with the news about what was truly happening in the governor's office, it likely led to a variety of reactions, both from the public and within the political sphere. First and foremost, the disclosure of negative or underhanded information about a government official – in this case, the governor – would naturally cause controversy. This controversy can manifest in several ways, such as public outrage, media scrutiny, and debate amongst political officials. When the senator exposed the true state of affairs in the governor's office, the public would likely feel betrayed, concerned, or even angry about the information. This uproar would directly impact the governor's standing in the public's eye, creating a challenging environment for them to continue governing effectively. Secondly, the revelations would also result in controversy within the political sphere. With the information brought forward by the senator, there would likely be numerous calls from other elected officials for investigations or inquiries into the governor's conduct. This could lead to tensions and heated discussions between political parties and amongst the governor's colleagues. Additionally, the governor may face potential impacts on their political career, such as loss of support from their political party or donors, reduced chances for reelection or future political opportunities, and possible legal consequences if laws were broken. Moreover, the media would play a significant role in the controversy surrounding the governor. As the news spreads, media will likely analyze, discuss, and dissect the information, adding a layer of public pressure on the governor. This increased scrutiny could lead to further revelations or even encourage other individuals to come forward with their own information about the governor's office. Consequently, the scandal would remain in the public eye for an extended period, making it difficult for the governor to regain trust and continue their work without distraction. While it is true that shock, sorrow, fear, and pain could be reactions to the situation, they do not entirely encompass the consequences brought about by the senator's public announcement. These emotions might be felt by the governor, their family, or even their supporters, but the overarching reaction brought about by the exposure of potentially unethical or illegal actions within the governor's office is controversy. This controversy can have far-reaching effects on not only the governor but also the entire political landscape, directly or indirectly impacting the lives and careers of many individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Continue the following story. The room of Samantha is very clean, while Erin's is a disaster because Choices: (A). Samantha is disorganized. (B). Erin is disorganized.","completion":"(B). Erin is disorganized. In the colorful, comfortable universe where Samantha and Erin coexist, an unexpected phenomenon unfolds before anyone who dares to enter their shared space. On one side, Samantha's room is the model of cleanliness and organization, an immaculate realm that sparkles with freshness and purpose. Not a speck of dust defiles the cool glass surface of the oakwood desk. Each pencil, each eraser, each meticulously highlighted textbook has its place, ordered on the shelves with an almost military rigidity. The linen curtains are often drawn back to allow the sunshine to creep into Samantha's room, bringing with it suggestions of a carefully lived life of discipline and self control. Her bed is flawless, its covers and pillows neatly arranged in placid patterns that seem to defy the very idea of wrinkles. The neatly arranged photo frames, the squeaky clean mirror and the dust-free vanity all sing hymes of Samantha's virtues, painting the picture of a disciplined, systematic individual who thrives on scheduling and orderliness. She follows a strict regimen, waking up before dawn and retiring for the night well before any late-night vigils can occur. Samantha's prized possessions are her diaries and planners, filled with meticulous records of her daily routines and future plans, each precisely organized by date and time. Her well-oiled routine, strict discipline, and her exceptional talent for organization could put even the most sophisticated AI to shame. She has an innate sense of purpose and direction which provides a canvas to her artistic orderliness. Everything in her room reflects a portion of the woman she is- the pursuer of perfection, the symbol of efficiency, the embodiment of neatness. On the other hand, Erin's room is a direct contrast. It resembles a field after a storm – full of misplacement, disarray, and chaos. One has to navigate carefully through a cluttered ocean of scattered clothes, strewn books, and forgotten coffee mugs. If cleanliness and orderliness had an adversary, Erin's room would be it. It wouldn't be surprising to find a lost civilization underneath the mess of her room. In Erin's universe, order and system seem like far-fetched dreams. The floor often resumes the responsibility of a closet, hosting an array of clothing that would be better placed neatly organized in the spacious wardrobe. The desk drowns under unintentional layers of trinkets, sketches, and a cacophony of art supplies. Books sprout around the room like weeds, having made their home on the floor, under the bed, on the side table, and sometimes, even the bed. Erin sleeps whenever sleep graces her and wakes up to a different rhythm each day. To the meticulously organized Samantha's bewilderment, Erin's inconsistent routine and chaotic lifestyle doesn't seem like an obstacle to her cheerfulness or creativity. She often brushes off her roommate's disapproving gaze with a simple, \\"Creativity needs a mess.\\" Therefore, it's clear that Erin's room is a disaster because Erin is disorganized. Despite their starkly contrasting habitats, Samantha and Erin continue living together as two sides of the same coin representing two vastly different ways of living. Samantha's room, an epitome of cleanliness and organization, exemplifies her well-ordered life. At the same time, Erin's disorganized room reflects her unstructured life filled with spur-of-the-moment decisions and spontaneous creativity. Their living arrangements tell a story that extends far beyond the cleanliness or messiness of their rooms. They are living proofs that individual habits, personality attributes, and personal choices resonate profoundly in the spaces they occupy. Samantha’s clarity of thought is narrated through her neat room, while Erin’s scattered brilliance reverberates in her messy one. So perhaps, Samantha and Erin's world is an unforgettable symphony of contrasting melodies that somehow, in the grand orchestra of life, harmonize perfectly. Their rooms, thus, personify them and tell stories of their journey and the lifestyle they have chosen to lead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Firstly, we need to understand what eukaryotes are. Eukaryotes are organisms whose cells have a nucleus enclosed within membranes. This includes animals, plants, and fungi. 2. Secondly, the term 'shuffling genes' refers to the process of genes changing their positions. This mechanism is vital for generating genetic diversity which is crucial for evolution. 3. Lastly, we know that the process of meiotic recombination is where the shuffling of genes takes place in eukaryotes. During meiosis, which is the process of cell division that produces reproductive cells, homologous chromosomes pair up and can exchange segments of DNA in a process known as crossover. This crossover results in the reshuffling or rearrangement of genes, leading to offspring having distinct combinations of traits from their parents.

Jeanette Anna MacDonald (June 18, 1903 - January 14, 1965) was an American singer and actress best remembered for her musical films of the 1930s with Maurice Chevalier (The Love Parade, Love Me Tonight, The Merry Widow and One Hour With You) and Nelson Eddy (Naughty Marietta, Rose-Marie, and Maytime). During the 1930s and 1940s she starred in 29 feature films, four nominated for Best Picture Oscars ( In the mid-1950s, MacDonald toured in summer stock productions of Bitter Sweet and The King and I. She opened in Bitter Sweet at the Iroquois Amphitheater, Louisville, Kentucky, on July 19, 1954. Her production of The King and I opened August 20, 1956, at the Starlight Theatre. While performing there, she collapsed. Officially, it was announced as heat prostration, but in fact it was a heart seizure. She began limiting her appearances and a reprisal of Bitter Sweet in 1959 was her last professional appearance. MacDonald and her husband, Gene Raymond, toured in Ferenc Molnar's The Guardsman. The production opened at the Erlanger Theater, Buffalo, New York, on January 25, 1951, and played in 23 northeastern and midwestern cities until June 2, 1951. Despite less than enthusiastic comments from critics, the show played to full houses for virtually every performance. The leading role of \\"The Actress\\" was changed to \\"The Singer\\" to allow MacDonald to add some songs. While this pleased her fans, the show still closed before reaching Broadway. In the 1950s, talks with respect to a Broadway return occurred. In the 1960s, MacDonald was approached about starring on Broadway in a musical version of Sunset Boulevard. Harold Prince recounts in his autobiography, visiting MacDonald at her home in Bel Air to discuss the proposed project. Composer Hugh Martin also wrote a song for the musical entitled, \\"Wasn't It Romantic?\\". MacDonald also made a few nightclub appearances.

Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in whole wheat flour, nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates peristalsis – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digesta along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

What is the sentiment of the following review? This is the saddest review that I will ever give. Most of you remember going to the old Civic Center, in fact, going there in August, getting up early, making the long line to get tickets for the Broadway shows, or when Itzhak Perlman came around (sigh, that's still one of the top nights of my life...), and seriously, it was a JOY having such a fantastically old building, so much character, so much value. Then they go to invest millions of money Madison doesn't have, and make this GOD AWFUL building made out of glass. Ok, so the decor is not the important part (although HELLO... modern much, in the midst of lovely brick buildings is NOT good), it's the experience. WHICH SUCKS by the way. I've been both a member of the audience as well as a musician performing. As an audience, it SUCKS to pay ~90 for good seats on a show, and BARELY being able to hear the performance. Sound engineering FAILED MISERABLY here. As a performer, backstage is deplorable and quite inconvenient. Save your money, and go to Chicago for good shows. Sadly, Madison's trick to push all the students out of the downtown area, and move in the Yuppies is failing, or maybe the yuppies don't have good appreciation of music, and as long as it costs a lot it *MUST* be good...","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses a deep sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction with the new building and its impact on the overall experience of attending or performing in shows. They nostalgically recall the older Civic Center with fond memories and contrast it unfavorably with the new glass building which they find unattractive and poorly designed. The reviewer is specifically critical of the décor of the new building, which they feel clashes with the surrounding area's aesthetics. Additionally, they find the overall experience of attending a show to be subpar, with a particular emphasis on the poor sound engineering and high ticket prices, which results in an unsatisfactory audience experience. As a performer, the reviewer also mentions significant inconvenience with the deplorable backstage conditions. The statement on Madison's trick to push students out of the downtown area and make way for yuppies suggests the reviewer's disapproval of this perceived strategy, associating it with the decline in the quality of shows in the area. Their closing advice to save money and go to Chicago instead further emphasizes the negative sentiment of the review."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Seattle would trail early in the first quarter as 49ers kicker Joe Nedney got a 37-yard field goal, along with running back Frank Gore getting a 79-yard touchdown run. The Seahawks would respond in the second quarter as kicker Olindo Mare made a 36-yard field goal. San Francisco would reply with Nedney making a 42-yard field goal. As the Seahawks looked to bounced back from the deficit, quarterback Matt Hasselbeck received an injury as he was hit on the ground by 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis. Hasselbeck would leave the game with cracked ribs, yet Seattle closed out the half with backup Seneca Wallace completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to running back Julius Jones. In the third quarter, the Seahawks deficit quickly increased as on the 49ers' first offensive play of the second half, Gore would explode for an 80-yard touchdown run. San Francisco would close the game out in the fourth quarter as Nedney nailed a 39-yard field goal. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many more yards in field goals did Joe Nedney have compared to Olindo Mare?","completion":"In this game, Joe Nedney, the 49ers kicker, made field goals of 37, 42, and 39 yards. Olindo Mare, the Seahawks kicker, made a field goal of 36 yards. To find the difference in yards, we first need to add up the yards of field goals made by Joe Nedney: 37 + 42 + 39 = 118 yards. Now, we need to subtract Olindo Mare's field goal yards: 118 - 36 = 82 yards. So, Joe Nedney had 82 more yards in field goals compared to Olindo Mare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whenever you choose to divide the plants, they may not produce flowers the first summer, or may produce fewer flowers than normal.

The camellias will lay dormant, but they won't bloom at all.; * Cut daylilies again the following year. Cutting off the stems may encourage your plants to develop new flowers later in the year.; * Do not divide a variety of plants sooner than they typically would since each plant should be divided to grow new blooms.

Here is a detailed process to get rid of gnats: 1. Identify the type of gnats: Determine if they are fruit flies, fungus gnats, or drain flies as this will help you target the root cause of the infestation. 2. Eliminate breeding grounds: a. Dispose of rotting fruits and vegetables as they attract fruit flies. b. Keep your kitchen and dining area clean by wiping countertops and tables, and washing dishes promptly. c. Regularly take out the trash and use a bin with a tight-fitting lid. d. Address damp areas in your home that may harbor fungus gnats, such as over-watered potted plants. e. Clear debris from your drains, sinks, and showerheads as they can attract drain flies. 3. Create a gnat trap: a. Vinegar trap: Mix equal parts apple cider vinegar and water in a small container or jar. Add a few drops of dish soap to break the surface tension. Cover the container with a plastic wrap, poke small holes in it, and place it near the gnat-infested area. Gnats are attracted by the vinegar smell, but the dish soap makes them unable to escape. b. Wine trap: Pour a small amount of red or white wine into a dish, add a few drops of dish soap, and place it near the gnat-infested area. The smell of wine attracts gnats, and the dish soap drowns them. 4. Natural remedies: a. Essential oils: Add a few drops of peppermint, lavender, or citronella essential oil to water in a spray bottle. Shake well and spray around infested areas. The scent of these oils acts as a natural repellent. b. Hydrogen peroxide: To target fungus gnats in potted plants, mix a solution of 1 part 3% hydrogen peroxide to 4 parts water. Apply this mixture to the soil, which should kill the larvae without harming the plants. 5. Chemical treatments: If the infestation persists, consider using commercially available gnat traps or insecticides specifically designed for gnats. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for safe and effective use. 6. Prevent future infestations: a. Store fruits and vegetables in the refrigerator or sealed containers. b. Regularly clean drains and maintain a dry environment around sinks and showerheads. c. Keep indoor plants healthy and avoid over-watering them. By following these steps, you can effectively eliminate gnats from your home and prevent future infestations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"If a disease, particularly cancer, is caught early, the chance of curing it is significantly more likely. The statement holds especially true for cancer because the nature of this disease involves the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Early detection and treatment can significantly increase the chance of a successful outcome for several reasons: 1. Tumor size: When cancer is detected at an early stage, the tumor tends to be smaller and more localized. In such cases, surgical removal of the tumor has a greater likelihood of being successful. Moreover, smaller tumors often cause less damage to the surrounding healthy tissue. 2. Less aggressive treatment: Early-stage cancer usually requires less aggressive treatment compared to advanced-stage cancer. For example, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, which can have severe side effects, might not always be necessary if cancer is caught early. This allows the patient to have a better quality of life during and after treatment. 3. Lower chance of metastasis: Cancer cells have the potential to spread to other parts of the body, a process known as metastasis. Early detection and treatment reduce the chance of metastasis, as the cancer cells have less time to invade other tissues. Cancers that have not spread are typically easier to treat and have better prognoses. 4. Improved long-term outcomes: Numerous studies have shown that early detection and treatment of cancer lead to higher survival rates and overall improved long-term outcomes. Patients who have early-stage cancer have a better chance of achieving long-lasting remission and experiencing fewer complications. 5. Early intervention and lifestyle changes: Detecting a disease early also provides an opportunity to make necessary lifestyle changes and start preventive care measures. For example, individuals diagnosed with early-stage cancer might benefit from a healthier diet, regular exercise, quitting smoking, or limiting alcohol intake to reduce the risk of recurrence. 6. Faster recovery: Patients who receive treatment at an early stage are likely to recover more quickly than those with advanced cancer. The physical, emotional, and financial burden of cancer treatment is often less for individuals whose cancer was detected early. In conclusion, catching a disease, particularly cancer, at an early stage significantly increases the likelihood of curing it. Early detection enables more effective treatment and helps prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the body. Moreover, early intervention may reduce the need for aggressive treatment, improving the patient's quality of life and increasing their chances of a successful outcome. Therefore, it is crucial to be proactive about health screening and regular check-ups to ensure early detection and timely treatment of potential health issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Here is a goal: To bake bread, you can How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of baking bread, I would follow these steps: Step 1: Gather ingredients To start, I would gather all the necessary ingredients such as flour, water, yeast, sugar, salt, and any additional flavors (like herbs or seeds) that I'd like to include in the bread. Step 2: Activate the yeast In a small bowl, I would mix warm water (around 110°F or 45°C), sugar, and yeast. I would let the mixture sit for about 5-10 minutes, or until it becomes frothy. This step is crucial for ensuring the yeast is active and ready to help the bread rise. Step 3: Combine the ingredients In a large mixing bowl, I would combine the flour and salt. I would then create a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the activated yeast mixture. I would use a wooden spoon or my hands to gradually mix the ingredients until a shaggy dough forms. Step 4: Knead the dough On a clean, floured surface, I would turn out the dough and begin kneading it. I would knead for 10-15 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, I would add a little more flour as needed. Step 5: First rise I would shape the dough into a ball and place it in a greased bowl, turning the dough to ensure it is coated with a thin layer of oil. I would then cover the bowl with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size. Step 6: Shape the dough After the dough has risen, I would punch it down to release any air bubbles. I would then transfer the dough to a floured surface and shape it into the desired loaf shape (e.g., a round boule, a long baguette, or a traditional loaf). Step 7: Second rise I would place the shaped dough on a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet (or in a greased loaf pan), cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise again for about 45 minutes to an hour, or until it has almost doubled in size. Step 8: Preheat the oven While the dough is going through its second rise, I would preheat the oven to around 375°F (190°C) to ensure it's hot enough for baking. Step 9: Scoring and baking Once the dough has finished its second rise, I would use a sharp knife or a bread lame to make a few shallow slashes on the top of the loaf. This is known as scoring and helps control the expansion of the bread as it bakes. I would then place the bread in the preheated oven and bake for 25-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Step 10: Cooling and storing After baking, I would remove the bread from the oven and transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, I would store the bread in an airtight container or bread box to keep it fresh and prevent it from drying out. By following these steps, I can accomplish the goal of baking a delicious loaf of homemade bread."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

An aspect of Adi Parashakti , Dakshayani is the first consort of Shiva , the second being Parvati , the reincarnation of Sati herself . In Hindu legend , both Sati and Parvati successively play the role of bringing Shiva away from ascetic isolation into creative participation with the world . The act of Sati , in which a Hindu widow immolates herself on her husband 's funeral pyre as a final and consummate act of loyalty and devotion , is patterned after the deed committed by this goddess to uphold the honour of her husband . - An abugida (from Ge'ez \\"äbugida\\"), or alphasyllabary, is a segmental writing system in which consonantvowel sequences are written as a unit: each unit is based on a consonant letter, and vowel notation is secondary. This contrasts with a full alphabet, in which vowels have status equal to consonants, and with an abjad, in which vowel marking is absent, partial, or optional. (In less formal contexts, all three types of script may be termed alphabets.) The terms also contrast them with a syllabary, in which the symbols cannot be split into separate consonants and vowels. Abugidas include the extensive Brahmic family of scripts of South and Southeast Asia, Semitic Ethiopic scripts, and Canadian Aboriginal syllabics. - Shaivism or aivism (\\"aiva Patha\\", \\"Shiva's Path\\"), also known as Shivaism and Saivam, is one of the major branches of Sanathan Dharma (Hinduism), revering Shiva as the Supreme Being. Shiva is sometimes depicted as the fierce god Bhairava. Followers of Shaivam are called \\"Shaivas\\", \\"Saivas\\", \\"Shaivites\\", or \\"Saivarkal\\". They believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is. Shaivism, like some of the other forms of Hinduism, spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, including Java, Bali, and parts of the Southeast Asian continent, including Cambodia. - Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked central Himalayan country in South Asia. It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language. - Lakshmi (Sanskrit: , \\",\\" ) is the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity. She is the wife and shakti (energy) of Vishnu, a major god in Hinduism. Lakshmi is also an important deity in Jainism and found in Jain temples. Lakshmi was also a Goddess of abundance and fortune for Buddhists, and was represented on the oldest surviving stupas and cave temples of Buddhism. In Buddhist sects of Tibet, Nepal and southeast Asia, goddess Vasudhara mirrors the characteristics and attributes of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi with minor iconographic differences. - Parvati (IAST: Prvat) is the Hindu goddess of fertility, love and devotion; as well as of divine strength and power. She is the gentle and nurturing aspect of the Hindu goddess Shakti and one of the central deities of the Goddess-oriented Shakta sect. She is the mother goddess in Hinduism, and has many attributes and aspects. Each of her aspects is expressed with a different name, giving her over 100 names in regional Hindu stories of India. Along with Lakshmi (goddess of wealth and prosperity) and Saraswati (goddess of knowledge and learning), she forms the trinity of Hindu goddesses (Tridevi). - The Tridevi (Sanskrit: \\"\\") is a concept in Hinduism joining a triad of eminent goddesses either as a feminine version of the Trimurti or as consorts of a masculine Trimurti, depending on denomination. This triad is typically personified by the Hindu goddesses Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Parvati (Kali). In Shaktism, these triune goddesses are the manifestations of Mahashakti, the supreme divinity. - Sanskrit (English pronunciation:; written in Devanagari script ; : or ', originally ', \\"refined speech\\") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism and \\"Mahyna\\" Buddhism, a philosophical language in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. It was also a literary language that was in use as a \\"lingua franca\\" in ancient and medieval South Asia. It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies. - Saraswati is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, music, arts, wisdom and learning worshipped throughout Nepal and India . She is a part of the trinity (\\"Tridevi\\") of Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati. All the three forms help the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva to create, maintain and regenerate-recycle the Universe respectively. - Shiva ( Tamil Sanskrit: , lit. \\"the auspicious one\\") is one of the principal deities of Hinduism. He is the supreme God within Shaivism, one of the three most influential denominations in contemporary Hinduism. - Hindu refers to any person who regards themselves as culturally, ethnically, or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism. It has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, rather than a religious identifier for people indigenous to South Asia. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Modern Standard Hindi (Devanagari: , \\"Mnak Hind\\") or simply Hindi (Devanagari: , \\"Hind\\"), is an Indian language and a standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language. Hindi is one of the official languages of India, and is the \\"lingua franca\\" of the Hindi belt languages. Outside India, Hindi is an official language in Fiji, and is a recognised regional language in Mauritius, Suriname, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago. - Devanagari (, a compound of \\"\\"deva\\"\\" and \\"\\"ngar\\"\\" ; Hindi pronunciation: ), also called Nagari (\\"Ngar\\"), is an abugida (alphasyllabary) alphabet of India and Nepal. It is written from left to right, has a strong preference for symmetrical rounded shapes within squared outlines, and is recognisable by a horizontal line that runs along the top of full letters. In a cursory look, the Devanagari script appears different from other Indic scripts such as Bengali, Oriya, or Gurmukhi, but a closer examination reveals they are very similar except for angles and structural emphasis. - Hinduism is a religion, or a way of life, found most notably in India and Nepal. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world, and some practitioners and scholars refer to it as \\"\\", \\"the eternal law,\\" or the \\"eternal way,\\" beyond human origins. Scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no founder. This \\"Hindu synthesis\\" started to develop between 500 BCE and 300 CE following the Vedic period (1500 BCE to 500 BCE). - In Hinduism, Shakti (Devanagari: ; from Sanskrit \\"shak\\", \\"to be able\\"), also spelled as Sakthi, meaning \\"power\\" or \\"empowerment\\" is the primordial cosmic energy and represents the dynamic forces that are thought to move through the entire universe. Shakti is the concept or personification of divine feminine creative power, sometimes referred to as 'The Great Divine Mother' in Hinduism. As the mother she is known as Adi Parashakti or Adishakti. On the earthly plane, Shakti most actively manifests through female embodiment and creativity/fertility, though it is also present in males in its potential, unmanifest form.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Westworld Context: Sometime in the near future a high-tech, highly realistic adult amusement park called Delos features three themed \\"worlds\\"Â â West World (the American Old West), Medieval World (medieval Europe), and Roman World (the ancient Roman city of Pompeii). The resort's three \\"worlds\\" are populated with lifelike androids that are practically indistinguishable from human beings, each programmed in character for their assigned historical environment. For 1,000 per day, guests may indulge in any adventure with the android population of the park, including sexual encounters and even a fight to the death. Delos' tagline in its advertising promises, \\"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!\\" Peter Martin (Benjamin), a first-time Delos visitor, and his friend John Blane (Brolin), on a repeat visit, go to West World. One of the attractions is the Gunslinger (Brynner), a robot programmed to instigate gunfights. The firearms issued to the park guests have temperature sensors that prevent them from shooting humans or anything with a high body temperature but allow them to 'kill' the cold-blooded androids. The Gunslinger's programming allows guests to draw their guns and kill it, with the robot always returning the next day for another duel. The technicians running Delos notice problems beginning to spread like an infection among the androids: the robots in Roman World and Medieval World begin experiencing an increasing number of breakdowns and systemic failures, which are said to have spread to West World. When one of the supervising computer scientists scoffs at the \\"analogy of an infectious disease,\\" he is told by the Chief Supervisor (Alan Oppenheimer), \\"We aren't dealing with ordinary machines here.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? foster and whitaker are especially fine .","completion":"The review provided seems to express a positive opinion of the movie for a few reasons. Firstly, the reviewer singles out two specific actors, most likely referring to Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker, and commends their performances in the movie by describing them as \\"especially fine.\\" By focusing on the standout performances from these actors, the reviewer is appreciating the strengths of the movie. It can be inferred that these actors' roles and portrayal of their respective characters have left a positive impression on the reviewer. Moreover, the use of the phrase \\"especially fine\\" suggests that their acting was above average or beyond the reviewer's expectations. This further supports the idea that the reviewer found value in the movie, at least when it came to the acting department. Even though the review is quite short and does not delve into other aspects of the movie, such as plot, cinematography, or directing, it is evident that the reviewer appreciates the acting performances by Foster and Whitaker. Consequently, the overall opinion conveyed appears to be positive. In conclusion, the review exhibits a positive opinion of the movie, primarily focusing on the excellent performances delivered by Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker. Although other elements of the film are not considered in this brief review, the appreciation for outstanding acting suggests that the movie was memorable and enjoyable in at least one significant aspect."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule.

Choose from: + no. + yes.","completion":"Yes, both questions have the same meaning, as both are asking about the measures being taken to protect and preserve Charminar. Charminar is a historical monument built in 1591 in Hyderabad, India. It plays a significant role in the region's cultural heritage and is an important symbol of the city. As such, efforts should be made to ensure its preservation. There are several steps that can be taken to protect and preserve Charminar: 1. Regular Maintenance and Restoration: Environmental factors, pollution, and natural decay can cause wear and damage to Charminar's structure. Regular inspections should be conducted to assess its condition, and timely maintenance and restoration work should be carried out to prevent further damage. This includes cleaning the monument and repairing the structural damages. 2. Control of Pollution: Air and noise pollution in the surrounding areas contribute to the deterioration of Charminar. By regulating vehicular traffic and setting up pollution control measures, authorities can limit the harmful effects of pollution on the monument. 3. Implementing Conservation Plans: Proper management and conservation plans need to be in place to address threats to the monument. These plans should include research, documentation, and conservation strategies, as well as engagement with local communities to create awareness. 4. Laws and Regulations: It is essential to enforce laws and regulations that prevent damage to the monument, such as restrictions on construction and industrial activities near Charminar. Strict penalties should be imposed on those who violate these laws to act as a deterrent. 5. Monitoring and Surveillance: Proper security measures, including the installation of CCTV cameras, should be taken to ensure that vandalism and illegal activities do not damage the monument. Security personnel should be present to monitor the site and safeguard it from potential threats. 6. Public Awareness and Education: Educating the public about the historical, cultural, and architectural significance of Charminar is essential. By incorporating the monument's history into school curricula and organizing educational programs, people are more likely to appreciate the importance of its preservation. 7. Encouraging Sustainable Tourism: Efforts should be made to promote responsible tourism around Charminar. Guidelines and codes of conduct for tourist behavior at the site can help minimize negative impacts, while still allowing visitors to enjoy the monument's rich history. 8. Collaborating with International Agencies: Collaboration with international organizations such as UNESCO, World Monuments Fund, and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) can enhance Charminar's preservation efforts by providing technical expertise, financial support, and best practices from other successful preservation projects around the world. Currently, some efforts are being made to protect and preserve Charminar. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has undertaken several restoration projects in the past to repair and maintain the monument. Additionally, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and the Hyderabad Traffic Police are working together to restrict vehicular traffic and reduce pollution within the Charminar pedestrian zone. Further steps, such as public engagement and sustainable tourism planning, can help strengthen these efforts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

However, it is always important to remember that no matter what your company's attitude is regarding what you wear, you are working in a business environment and you should dress properly. Certain items may be more appropriate for evening wear than for a business meeting, just as shorts and a T-shirt are better suited for the beach than for an office environment.

You are given a new situation: Jimmy is currently shopping at his local grocery store during his weekly trip to get food and other necessities. He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk. and a hint : Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). Please answer this question : Which brand requires more cows to produce the same amount of milk? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The brand that requires more cows to produce the same amount of milk is Luchene, the organic milk brand. The reason for this is primarily due to the differences in organic and conventional milk production methods. Organic milk production typically involves giving cows a lower level of concentrates or supplemental feed, focusing more on roughage, such as grass, hay, and silage. This approach to feeding can result in lower milk production per cow compared to cows on conventional dairy farms, where concentrates, higher-energy feeds, and sometimes hormones are used to maximize milk production. Moreover, organic farming practices tend to limit the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, resulting in lower crop yields per hectare. This increased land use, combined with the lower milk production per cow, means that organic milk production generally necessitates a larger number of cows to produce the same amount of milk as a conventional dairy farm. So, in Jimmy's scenario, it is the Luchene brand that would require more cows to produce the same amount of milk compared to Jean's, the non-organic milk brand. It is important to note that this comparison only takes into consideration the milk production aspect, and not other factors such as animal welfare, environmental impact, or nutritional value, which may influence a consumer's decision when choosing between organic and conventional milk."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Question: what year did george bush name hank paulson secretary of treasury?

Definition: In this task, you are given a review of movie. Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Input: This movie is stuffed full of stock Horror movie goodies: chained lunatics, pre-meditated murder, a mad (vaguely lesbian) female scientist with an even madder father who wears a mask because of his horrible disfigurement, poisoning, spooky castles, werewolves (male and female), adultery, slain lovers, Tibetan mystics, the half-man/half-plant victim of some unnamed experiment, grave robbing, mind control, walled up bodies, a car crash on a lonely road, electrocution, knights in armour - the lot, all topped off with an incredibly awful score and some of the worst Foley work ever done.The script is incomprehensible (even by badly dubbed Spanish Horror movie standards) and some of the editing is just bizarre. In one scene where the lead female evil scientist goes to visit our heroine in her bedroom for one of the badly dubbed: \\"That is fantastical. I do not understand. Explain to me again how this is...\\" exposition scenes that litter this movie, there is a sudden hand held cutaway of the girl's thighs as she gets out of bed for no apparent reason at all other than to cover a cut in the bad scientist's \\"Mwahaha! All your werewolfs belong mine!\\" speech. Though why they went to the bother I don't know because there are plenty of other jarring jump cuts all over the place - even allowing for the atrocious pan and scan of the print I saw.The Director was, according to one interview with the star, drunk for most of the shoot and the film looks like it. It is an incoherent mess. It's made even more incoherent by the inclusion of werewolf rampage footage from a different film The Mark of the Wolf Man (made 4 years earlier, featuring the same actor but playing the part with more aggression and with a different shirt and make up - IS there a word in Spanish for \\"Continuity\\"?) and more padding of another actor in the wolfman get-up ambling about in long shot.The music is incredibly bad varying almost at random from full orchestral creepy house music, to bosannova, to the longest piano and gong duet ever recorded.

The piano part was so simple it could have been picked out with one hand while the player whacked away at the gong with the other.)

Review: overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"The given movie review sentence, \\"overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man,\\" appears to be positive in nature. This statement focuses on the personal growth and transformation of a character, which typically reflects a favorable aspect of the film. The review suggests that the character successfully confronts and overcomes personal challenges, ultimately transforming into a better person. Such a transformation is usually seen as a satisfying and commendable arc for a character's development, indicating a positive evaluation of this aspect of the movie. Furthermore, the use of the term \\"good man\\" implies that the character not only undergoes a transformation but also becomes a more virtuous and admirable figure, further emphasizing the positive nature of the review. It should be noted, however, that this sentence is quite short and does not provide an exhaustive or comprehensive assessment of the entire film. As a single sentence, it offers a limited perspective, focusing primarily on the character development aspect of the movie. While this aspect appears to be positively evaluated, other elements of the film, such as its plot, direction, cinematography, or performances, might elicit additional positive or negative reactions from the reviewer.

Step 1: Add 33*v to both sides of the equation to get all the v terms on one side. -33*v + 33*v + 150 = -3*v + 33*v This simplifies to: 150 = 30*v Step 2: Now, we need to isolate v. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 30. 150 / 30 = 30*v / 30 This simplifies to: 5 = v So, the value of v is 5.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Already his first claim, that desires are always artificial, is totally fallacious. When a Jehovah Witness reject gets his own documentary on movies  or anything for that matter - it's time for anyone to get their own. Although far, far more intelligent than, say, Paris Hilton (I know, not too difficult) Zizek's mouth spews just as much baloney as hers, just a different kind. He combines the worst from both his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b*lls***osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories, to rant without a beginning or end, and to connect concepts almost randomly, in the process misusing the English language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love. Example: there are three main Marx brothers hence what a \\"great\\" idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness, the id, the ego and the super-ego. I'm kind of surprised he didn't play a clip from \\"Snowhite\\" and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of Gahannah (Moslem hell). It's like the premise of Schumacher's \\"The Number 23\\": play with numbers long enough, and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want, even linking Ancient Greeks with Princess Di's death. However, there is an entertainment element to TPGTC: watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun. Why watch \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" or any other madhouse drama when you can have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It's like watching an amusing train wreck. Admittedly, he is almost funny on one or two occasions. I have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie-making into an exalted intellectual social science. Giving idiotic movies like \\"Birds\\" this much thought, hence this much credit, probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave. The raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value, and the few ones that do have some intelligence don't require a shrink-turned-philosopher to draw one a map to understand them  unless one is a complete idiot. Zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies. Hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in Slovenia these days... When Zizek showed the bathtub hole in the \\"Psycho\\" shower scene, I thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes; how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in Janet Leigh's blood. Or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents Leigh's vagina, with the blood flowing into it instead of out (as in menstruation), this representing some kind of \\"clever (Zizekian) irony\\". Speaking of which, the real irony is that if Hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene (and the script), his movies wouldn't have been the illogical, far-fetched crap that they often are. The point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about \\"hidden, deep meanings\\". And when you add Zizek's fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology, layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations, you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated - i.e. the easily impressionable and the gullible. Zizek utters a number of (unintentionally) funny things here, one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates Anthony Perkins's cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with \\"the satisfaction of work, of a job well done\\". Don't laugh... Neither Hitchcock nor the writer of \\"Psycho\\" could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that Perkins might be enjoying a job well done - the cleaning of a blood-stained toilet - while they were conceiving/directing that scene. Talk about putting words into one's (dead) mouth, but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to \\"say\\". I like Zizek's initial thoughts on Tarkovsky's terrific \\"Solaris\\", but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in \\"anti-feminism\\" and other nonsense into his theory. Zizek's attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone. \\"I just want to play with it all day!\\" Logic has its rules, and is not supposed to be raped - at least not publicly - by the likes of him. He seems to regard logic, proof, common-sense, and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys; concepts to be either avoided, twisted to fit the end-goal, or simply annihilated. Zizek is the LSD-tripped hippie, and all his favorite movies are his own personal \\"2001\\"s. The fact that Zizek over-focuses on two of the most overrated directors - and ones whose films often LACK intelligence, if anything - such as Hitchcock and Lynch, only further diminishes his already low credibility. I was surprised De Palma didn't feature more prominently; that's another lame director who writes inept scripts. Zizek has a field day with Lynch's incomprehensible \\"Lost Highway\\". There are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it. Zizek's comment that the viewer readily accepts von Trier's laughable, \\"ground-breaking\\" physical set-up in \\"Dogville\\" made me snicker. However, Zizek doesn't only make up stuff as he goes along, he also indulges heavily in the \\"bleedin' obvious\\". Like all \\"social scientists\\" (an oxymoron), he wraps his very trite \\"observations\\" into articulate (if full of spitting) and sometimes complex blankets of language. After all, sociology functions in precisely the same way: it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it's what we already all know, but told in an eloquent way - which fools the more unobservant listener. I was half-expecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a loonie-suit...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: At Worcester, photography gets the blues Anna Atkins’s “Honey Locust Leaf Pod.” WORCESTER — In an age when digital dominates, it might come as a shock how many analog photographic processes there were — and are. Photographers still make daguerreotypes and platinum prints and, of course, gelatin silver prints. They still make cyanotypes, too. The format has a long and surprisingly diverse history, as “Cyanotypes: Photography’s Blue Period” demonstrates to excellent effect. The show runs through April 24 at the Worcester Art Museum. Frederick Coulson’s “Artist’s Sister in a Hat.” You likely don’t recognize the term cyanotype. But cyanotypes themselves are unmistakable, because of their predominant blueness. The best-known type of cyanotypes are architectural, the renderings known as blueprints. The astronomer Sir John Herschel invented the process, which requires only an iron-salts solution and paper. Cyanotypes can be created either as photograms, by placing an object on treated paper, or photographically, as a positive print made from contact with a negative. Either way, no darkroom is necessary. Such simplicity made the process highly popular with amateurs during its heyday, 1880-1920. While most of the 75 items in the Worcester show come from that period, the earliest dates to 1854 and the most recent from 2014. That earliest image, Anna Atkins’s study of a honey locust leaf and pod, shows how attractive the process can be. Delicacy combines with precision, thanks to the sharp contrast of botanical white revealed against Prussian blue. That blueness has a further effect, one that’s off-putting at first but on reflection quite winning. All photographs are a cheat, a two-dimensional rendering of three dimensions (four, if you count time). The chromatic oddity of cyanotypes announces their artifice from the get-go. The period charm of that blueness doubles as epistemological candor. Arthur Wesley Dow’s “Two Vases With Irises.” It can also summon up dreamscapes, as with Jesseca Ferguson’s pair of diptychs. They’re like flattened Joseph Cornell boxes. Again we find two dimensions doing the work of four, even if in this case it’s more play than work. Although there are well-known names here — Edward Steichen, Edward S. Curtis, F. Holland Day, Christian Marclay (of “The Clock” fame) — the format is the star. Curators Nancy Kathryn Burns and Kristina Wilson have put together a show that’s surprisingly, and excitingly, varied. There are still-lifes, landscapes, portraits, abstractions, assemblages, even a nude. (No, the sitter doesn’t look cold.) There are medical images that are like blueprints of the body; postcards, something of a craze around 1900, and so easy to do that senders made 90 percent of them; and even a dress, by Annie Lopez. It’s slightly above the knee, with a scoop neck — not exactly casual, but definitely ruled out as evening wear. Pride of place in “Cyanotypes” goes to Frederick K. Coulson (1869-1931), with 14 pictures. In their diversity, they reflect the show as a whole. Four potted plants have a silhouetted crispness worthy of a clinician. A man in overalls reading a book has the appeal of vintage Americana. Two portraits of Coulson’s sister — in one, sneaking a cigarette; in the other wearing the most preposterous hat this side of Terry Gilliam’s “Brazil” — bring together affection and irreverence in a way that can only be described as brotherly. An interior showing an 1898 Worcester Art Museum gallery exemplifies one of the exhibition’s nicer touches: multiple instances of cyanotypes with a local connection. As the primary color with the coolest visual temperature, blue tends toward smooth surfaces. So you might expect a consistent sameness of texture. That’s another surprise “Cyanotypes” has to offer. An Arthur Wesley Dow still life of irises suggests such tactility it could be printed on fabric. In contrast, Mike Ware’s “Ficus, October 10, 1998” has a high-gloss finish that verges on the lickable.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.

Paragraph: When 74-year-old Penny Sweat was evicted from the HUD-subsidized Glendale Senior Housing in Salt Lake City last month, she moved to a nonsubsidized apartment at five times her previous rent because she was unaware of her rights. It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back.

CHAPTER XVIII WILDCAT AND WATER Dave was both startled and alarmed when the wildcat came down almost on top of his bare head, and even more frightened when the beast made a leap for his naked shoulder. He had had several experiences with wildcats and knew them to be both powerful and bloodthirsty. By instinct more than reason he dived and went down as far as possible. As soon as the water closed over the wildcat's head it let go its hold and began to swim for the shore. Henry was directly in the path of the beast and in a second more, ere the young soldier had time to think of diving, the wildcat was on his back, sinking its cruel nails deeply into his flesh. \\"Get off!\\" screamed Henry. \\"Get off! Help! help!\\" And then he went down, not because he thought of doing so, but because he could not bear the weight. The stream closed over him and he went directly to the bottom. This time the wildcat did not let go its hold. It clung desperately and when Henry tried to shake it off it only sunk its nails deeper into his flesh. Mechanically he started to scream, when the water rushed into his mouth, almost strangling him on the spot.

Both Surfer Rosa and Steve Albini's production of the album have been influential on alternative rock, and on grunge in particular. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain cited Surfer Rosa as the basis for Nevermind's songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1992 that he \\"heard songs off of Surfer Rosa that I'd written but threw out because I was too afraid to play them for anybody.\\" Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, primarily due to his contribution to Surfer Rosa. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan described Surfer Rosa as \\"the one that made me go, 'holy shit'. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame.\\" Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician PJ Harvey said that Surfer Rosa \\"blew my mind,\\" and that she \\"immediately went to track down Steve Albini.\\" Cobain listed Surfer Rosa as number 2 of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his journal in 1993.People connected with the band were impressed by the record. Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: \\"I remember when I first heard Surfer Rosa thinking, 'I didn't know the Pixies could sound like The Fall.'

He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force. Hint: The Table above includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.","completion":"Based on the information provided, lever B would have a smaller mechanical advantage than lever A, since lever A has an ideal mechanical advantage and lever B is a real world lever that has to overcome some friction, making its actual mechanical advantage less than the ideal mechanical advantage."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure.

Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically. Which village didn't display an observable Allee effect? The answer is:","completion":"Village A didn't display an observable Allee effect. Firstly, let's understand what the Allee effect is. The Allee effect refers to a phenomenon in ecology where a reduction in the population density or size of a species results in reduced birth and/or survival rates for the species. It is a density-dependent mechanism that occurs when lower population numbers or densities impact the individual and population-level performance negatively. Generally, the Allee effect is observed when the population is subjected to isolation or fragmentation, leading to lower cooperation, reproduction, and survival. Now, let's analyze the two villages Dan studied: Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years. This growth in population suggests that the individuals in this village were able to maintain an adequate birth and survival rate, which allowed them to sustain and increase the overall population size. Moreover, the increasing population size implies that the positive density-dependent factors were keeping the community viable and thriving. These factors may have included increased opportunities for mating, resource and risk sharing, and enhanced cooperative behaviors. In contrast, Village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically. This situation is indicative of a population that might have experienced the Allee effect. Being isolated geographically results in limited interaction with surrounding communities, which can negatively impact resources, mating opportunities, and collaboration within the village. The decreasing population of Village B suggests that the community might have faced challenges related to reproduction and survival, which are hallmarked by the Allee effect. In summary, Village A did not display an observable Allee effect as the population grew larger over the years, indicating that the individuals were reproducing and surviving at higher rates. Meanwhile, Village B, with its declining population and geographical isolation, showed characteristics that align with the Allee effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","completion":"A Sultan's wife is typically called a \\"Sultana\\" or \\"Sultanah.\\" A Sultana is the female equivalent of a Sultan and often refers to the wife or consort of a reigning Sultan. In some cases, a Sultana may hold considerable influence and authority within the court and may even wield political power. The title of Sultana has been used in several Islamic empires and kingdoms, such as the Ottoman Empire, Delhi Sultanate, and Mughal Empire. In some instances, the Sultana may act as a regent for a young, underage Sultan, or in the absence of a suitable male heir. A well-known example is the celebrated Sultana Nur Jahan of the Mughal Empire, who was the twentieth wife of Emperor Jahangir and played a significant role in state affairs during her husband's reign. While the title may confer a significant degree of authority to the holder, it is important to note that the actual power and influence of a Sultana would vary depending on the specific cultural and historical context. In some cases, a Sultana may hold a primarily ceremonial or symbolic role, whereas, in others, she could exercise considerable political leverage. In addition to the primary wife of the Sultan, the term \\"Sultana\\" can also be extended to other female members of the royal family, such as the daughters and sisters of a Sultan. These women may have held substantial property, wealth, and power within the ruling dynasty. Furthermore, in the case of female leaders who ruled in their own right, the term \\"Sultana\\" may also be applied to such women. These women were not merely the wives of Sultans but were rulers themselves, such as Razia Sultana, who ruled the Delhi Sultanate in the 13th century, or Sultana Shajar al-Durr, who ruled Egypt in the 13th century as well. It is essential to recognize that the role and responsibilities of a Sultana are not fixed and may vary substantially based on the specific historical period, political climate, and cultural context. Thus, the title held different meanings and implications in different contexts. Overall, a Sultana is a significant figure in Islamic history and played various influential roles within the courts and empires they were part of, acting as wives, mothers, and, at times, leaders in their own right."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Set Your Heat Pump to \\"Heat\\" First, we need to make sure our heat pump knows what we want it to do. So, we should set it to \\"heat\\" mode. This way, it will know that we want to warm up our home. 2. Choose the Right Temperature Next, we need to find the perfect temperature that makes our house warm but not too hot, just like Goldilocks' porridge. For our heat pump to work efficiently, we should set it at 68°F (20°C). This temperature makes the heat pump work just right without using too much energy. 3. Change the Temperature Slowly Did you know that changing the temperature too fast can confuse the heat pump? That's why we should only increase the temperature by 2 degrees at a time. This way, the heat pump won't get confused and will work better. 4. Backup Heat for Extra Cold Days Sometimes, it's just too cold outside. When the temperature drops below 35°F (2°C), our heat pump might need some help. That's when we should turn on a backup heat unit, like a space heater or a furnace. These machines can provide some extra warmth when our heat pump can't do it all by itself. In summary, kids, using a heat pump is easy and fun. All we have to do is set it to \\"heat,\\" find the perfect temperature, make small changes, and use a backup heater when it's extra cold. By doing these simple steps, we can keep our house warm and cozy all winter long.

Here is an article: THE HAGUE — For 40 years, the Dutch photographer and filmmaker Anton Corbijn has captured some of the most celebrated rock musicians and other artists of an era — Bono, Mick Jagger, Bjork, William S. Burroughs, Clint Eastwood — for magazines and books. So at first glance his conceptual series, “A. Somebody,” featuring what appear to be images of his personal musical heroes, doesn’t seem like a major departure. What is unusual, however, is that all of the portraits — including images of Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, John Lennon, and Janis Joplin — were shot in Corbijn’s remote hometown, Strijen, a village with about 9,000 residents on Hoeksche Waard, an island about an hour’s drive south of here. What’s more, these celebrities had never set foot in the village. And all of them were dead. For this series, Corbijn did something he almost never does: He turned the camera on himself, staging self-portraits in which he dressed in wigs, glasses, and clothes to evoke these famous ghosts, and mimicked not just their outward appearance but also their stage personas and facial expressions. In essence, he captured them in self-portrait as he might have photographed them if they were still alive. The series of photographs — shot in 2001-02 — is one of five sections of the exhibition “Hollands Deep,” a Corbijn retrospective at the Gemeentemuseum here and running concurrently with a survey exhibition of Corbijn’s music photography, “1-2-3-4,” at the Fotomuseum next door. “Hollands Deep” runs until June 21, while “1-2-3-4” has been extended to Aug. 16. These shows, in celebration of Corbijn’s 60th birthday last Wednesday, suggest the power of his photography in defining a generation of musical stars. At the same time, they explore his complex relationship with the creation of celebrity. “Anton Corbijn made portrait photography become an art again,” the South African artist Marlene Dumas, who is based in Amsterdam, said in an e-mail message. She collaborated with Corbijn on their 2000 book, “Strippinggirls,” with photos and paintings of dancers in striptease bars, and has admired his work since. “After years of lighthearted stuff and pretty pictures of stars all around, here comes this guy that showed photography as a dark art,” Dumas added. “Both his medium and his subjects are seen as being created out of deep shadows and accidental light.” Corbijn didn’t merely shoot images of pop musicians and other artists. He often created a band’s entire visual identity, conceiving album covers including graphic design, directing music videos, and orchestrating the look and feel of stage tours for bands like Depeche Mode and U2 since the early 1980s. Corbijn’s images of U2 from that time to about 2004 are part of “1-2-3-4,” as are images of the Rolling Stones from 1980 to 1995, and pictures of newer bands he has taken on, like Arcade Fire. “His photography was what defined the look of a generation of music,” said Kristen Lubben, curator at the International Center of Photography in New York. Lubben described his look as “disheveled glamour.” The “Hollands Deep” show includes some of Corbijn’s more recognizable images: David Bowie, in a contemplative moment backstage while performing in “The Elephant Man,” dressed in nothing but a white loincloth; Elvis Costello flat on his back on a beat-up dressing-room couch, his electric guitar lying across his chest; Miles Davis with his eyes wide open and all 10 fingers pressed into his face; Henry Rollins tinged by red paint, screaming into the camera. “Some of my most famous pictures were taken in five or 10 minutes,” Corbijn said in a recent interview, sitting on a stool in his studio in The Hague. (It functions mostly as an archive for this vast collection of negatives and prints, since he doesn’t really do studio photography.) “I just come on my own with my camera, no assistant, there’s no setting up to do, and I’m quickly done,” he added. “I don’t want to become a ‘professional photographer’ in that sense.” Corbijn said music was his passion growing up. He was raised in a religious family — his father was a Protestant parson — and the link he had to the outside world was through rock magazines and album covers. “There was a promise of a much more interesting life that came to me from the other side of the water,” he said, referring to the mainland across an estuary of the Rhine called Hollands Diep. Corbijn started carrying a camera as a way to get near the stage at concerts. His lack of technical polish was a result, he said, of being largely self-taught, and this led to the rough quality lauded by his admirers. (He said he was rejected by every art school in the Netherlands.) “He changed the idea that you shoot a rock star as a rock star,” said Benno Tempel, director of the Gemeentemuseum and the Fotomuseum. “By making a photo of the artist, he also made a photo of the music. He understood the mood of the music and he put that mood into his photographs.” After several years making his name in music magazines like New Musical Express and The Face, Corbijn was looking for a way to move beyond his commercial music work. Starting in 1989 with the book “Famouz” and following up in 1996 with “Star Trak,” he created powerful images of other people in the public eye, such as Christy Turlington crouched naked on a suspension bridge and Clint Eastwood pointing a finger directly at the camera as if to say, “Scram!” Corbijn now focuses on directing films, such as “A Most Wanted Man” (Philip Seymour Hoffman’s last film in 2014) and “The American” with George Clooney in 2010. The “1-2-3-4” show gave him an opportunity to go back through his personal photo archives. He did this mostly on his own. When he finished shooting “Life,” a film about the Magnum photographer Dennis Stock, Corbijn rented an office in Berlin to edit the footage. He worked on the film, which had its premiere in February at the Berlin International Film Festival, during the day and spent his evenings sorting through negatives. This went on for about a year. “It’s exciting when you find new photographs,” he said. “Thirty or 40 years down the line, you look at photographs very differently. You look purely at an image that has some kind of power.” Write a title for it.","completion":"\\"Anton Corbijn: The Visionary Photographer Who Brought Rockstars to Life Through Portrait Art\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

In humans and many other species, circadian rhythms are controlled by a biological clock, a tiny structure located in a gland at the base of the brain. This clock sends signals to the body to regulate physiological processes and behaviors. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock, which causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. Based on this information, it suggests that animals' blood pressure will generally be at its highest point during the middle of the day, or around noon, and at its lowest point during the night.

Rival Coaches Share Bond, Except on Game Days INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 5  The longtime friendship between Tony Dungy and Herman Edwards was severely tested in 1996. Edwards was a scout then with the Kansas City Chiefs, and his goal was to become a general manager, not a coach. But after Dungy became the coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he persuaded Edwards to join his staff as an assistant head coach in charge of defensive backs. Initially, Edwards said, he feared he had made a terrible career move. In the 1996 regular-season opener between Tampa Bay and Green Bay, Brett Favre threw four touchdown passes as the Packers embarrassed the Buccaneers, 34-3. “In the first half, I walked down by Tony and I asked him, ‘Why did you do this to me?’ ” Edwards recalled this week. “I had a great job in Kansas City.” Dungy laughed at the memory. “We were all worried about our careers at halftime,” Dungy said Thursday. Their careers survived, and so did their friendship. On Saturday afternoon, Dungy will coach the Indianapolis Colts against Edwards and his Chiefs in the opening round of the American Football Conference playoffs. Unlike the relationship between New England Coach Bill Belichick and Jets Coach Eric Mangini, which became frosty after Mangini left the Patriots’ staff, Edwards and Dungy say they have not let competition harm their relationship. For three decades, Dungy, 51, and Edwards 52, have been there for each other, at weddings, at funerals, on vacations and on the telephone. But for 60 minutes Saturday, they will be adversaries, an awkward situation for both. “It’s difficult in the sense that the outcome is obviously not good for one of us,” Edwards said during a conference call Wednesday. “You worked this hard to get here, then all of a sudden you have to play your best friend. That’s the difficult part. Whoever wins it, we’re going to be pulling for that guy until he gets to the Super Bowl and wins it. That’s how we’ve always felt.” Their relationship began in an odd way at the 1977 Japan Bowl, a collegiate all-star game. Dungy was a quarterback with the University of Minnesota, and Edwards was a defensive back with San Diego State. Edwards intercepted Dungy’s last pass of the game, and from that on-field encounter, a friendship clicked. Although they have similar coaching philosophies, their personalities differ. Dungy’s demeanor rarely changes during a game, whether the Colts are 20 points ahead or 20 points behind. “I’m a lot better at holding thoughts inside than I was when I was younger,” he said. “It’s something I do consciously. No. 1, I’m trying to think ahead to the next situation. No. 2, I’m trying to show my team that I’m in control and that I’m poised out there, even when I’m not.” That reserved nature did not rub off on Edwards, who can become emotional even during routine news conferences. “When we were at Tampa, guys used to say, ‘Tony won’t say it, but Herm will,’ ” Edwards said. This will be the second time that Dungy and Edwards have coached against each other in the playoffs. The first was at the end of the 2002 season, when the Jets, coached by Edwards, dominated the Colts, 41-0, at Giants Stadium. It is a day Dungy would like to forget. “We owe him one,” he said. That was the first meeting between two African-American head coaches in the N.F.L. playoffs. Seven of the league’s 32 teams were coached by African-Americans this season, although two lost their jobs this week: Dennis Green in Arizona and Art Shell in Oakland. No African-American head coach has reached the Super Bowl, but Dungy and Edwards hope to change that this season. Edwards spent five years as Dungy’s assistant in Tampa Bay, before becoming the Jets’ coach in 2001. He spent five seasons in that job before leaving after last season to coach the Chiefs. He says he feels for Dungy, who is making his eighth consecutive playoff appearance but who has yet to reach the league’s ultimate game. Each season, the pressure increases. “There are a lot of great players, a lot of great coaches, that maybe never coach in a Super Bowl game,” Edwards said. He mentioned the time it took Bill Cowher to win one with the Steelers and how long Marty Schottenheimer of the San Diego Chargers has been trying. Edwards and Dungy spoke by telephone Monday, but they said they would not talk to each other again until before the game, on the field. Dungy said he would have preferred a different first-round opponent to avoid facing his friend. “They’re not fun games,” Dungy said. “It’s just different. It’s really hard to explain, but it goes with the territory.” During the season, Edwards and Dungy most often talk during losing streaks or difficult times. When Dungy’s 18-year-old son, James, committed suicide in December 2005, Edwards was still coaching the Jets, who played the night before James’s funeral. The Jets lost that game to New England, 31-21, and Edwards did not leave Giants Stadium until after 1 a.m. But the next day, he was at the funeral in Florida. “After the game, me and my wife looked at each other and said, ‘We’re going,’ ” Edwards said. “We got on the plane that morning. We didn’t sleep at all. We had to be there. I would’ve walked there. That’s what friends are for. You’ve got to support them when times are tough.” Saturday night will be tough for whichever coach loses, particularly if it is Dungy, given the Colts’ 12-4 record and their previous playoff disappointments. But for both men, the friendship will continue. “I feel like he’s my brother,” Edwards said. “He helped me a lot with my life when I went down to Tampa, just being a better man, and a person. That’s kind of where it stands with me and him.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are about the strong friendship between Tony Dungy and Herman Edwards, who are both football coaches. They have known each other for a long time and supported each other through both good and bad times. However, when their teams play against each other, like in the upcoming football game, they have to compete against each other and put their friendship aside for a while. Their friendship started back in 1977, and they have different personalities and coaching styles. They both hope to make history by becoming the first African-American head coaches to reach the Super Bowl."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Fact: a hot substance is a source of heat Question: Using your electronic that uses batteries for long periods of time makes them get very hot to the touch, which makes it a What's the answer?","completion":"Answer: Using your electronic device that uses batteries for long periods of time makes them get very hot to the touch, which makes it a source of heat. Explanation: When you use an electronic device for extended periods, the device consumes power from the batteries to perform various tasks. This power consumption generates heat in the process, primarily due to the resistance encountered by electrons as they flow within the device's circuits and components. As a result, the batteries heat up, making them hot to the touch. This phenomenon occurs due to the conversion of electrical energy within the battery into other forms of energy, such as thermal energy (heat) and kinetic energy (motion). In the case of a hot battery, the conversion of electrical energy to heat is what causes the battery to become warm or hot. Multiple factors could contribute to the increase in temperature, such as the battery's chemistry, internal resistance, discharge rate, and the efficiency of the energy conversion within the electronic device. Furthermore, devices that demand higher power output or have poor heat dissipation mechanisms will contribute to a more significant temperature increase. When a battery heats up, it becomes a source of heat itself. In principle, a source of heat can be defined as any substance or object that raises the temperature of its surroundings due to its energy transfer. This energy transfer commonly takes place in the form of conduction, convection, or radiation. In the case of a hot battery in an electronic device, the energy transfer primarily occurs through conduction, as the heat generated within the device's components gets transferred to the surrounding materials. Additionally, it may also cause the surrounding air to heat up, causing convective currents that further contribute to heat distribution. Therefore, a hot battery in an electronic device can be considered a source of heat as long as it continues to produce thermal energy through prolonged use or inefficient energy conversion processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Make an appointment with your general practitioner or an endocrinologist. They will likely run a series of blood tests to determine if you are GH deficient. Sometimes low GH levels can be connected with other conditions as well, such as Turner Syndrome. Your doctor can also discuss possible safe treatment and care options with you. Your doctor may take multiple blood samples to test for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels. Keep in mind that it is normal for your GH levels to lower as you age. GH injections are available by prescription if you are diagnosed by a doctor. They are given via a pen-like device and are relatively pain free. The injections are usually given around bedtime and are usually successful at boosting the production of GH overnight. Injections may be combined with oral supplements as part of a larger GH therapy program. Be aware that GH injections provided outside of a doctor’s prescription are illegal and highly dangerous. You can also take supplements as part of a broader hormonal therapy program. You will want to discuss this with your doctor and they can either write you a prescription or direct you toward certain brands. Some amino acid supplements, such as arginine, come in an oral form. You may need to take a higher dose in order to see results, so make sure to consult with a doctor for safety. For example, a sample dosage of arginine could be between five to nine grams after each work-out session. Before you start supplements, your doctor should do a complete blood count. As you take the supplements, visit your doctor to monitor your liver enzymes, just in case there is a problem. There is no one pill that is an immediate HGH cure-all. The same goes for any creams advertised as an instant GH boost. Creams are considered only minimally effective at boosting GH. When in doubt, talk with your doctor about any treatments and verify that they are medically sound before proceeding.","completion":"The article discusses the process of diagnosing GH (growth hormone) deficiency, including consulting with a general practitioner or endocrinologist, undergoing blood tests, and exploring safe treatment options such as GH injections, oral supplements, and hormonal therapy, while emphasizing the importance of doctor's guidance and monitoring for safety and effectiveness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai. The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre. Byam Shaw commented \\"The one major setback the Sadler's Wells Opera Company suffered from its transplant was that unheeding taxi drivers kept on taking their patrons up to Rosebery Avenue\\".Harewood...

I hate her,” Seinfeld joked during an interview on WFAN radio Monday night. “I can’t believe they put her in my box, which I paid for.” Seinfeld was referring to June 10 incident at Citi Field when the eccentric singer stripped down to her bra and bikini bottom and boorishly barraged fans and photographers with double-barrel bird-flipping during a bizarre, profanity-laced meltdown. Gaga showed up during the fifth inning of the day game between the Mets and Padres and was furious that her front-row seats were so close to photographers covering the game. Instead of sitting, she vanished into a lower-deck concourse — only to reappear in the seventh inning in the empty luxury box owned by Seinfeld, a big Mets fan. “You give people the finger and you get upgraded? Is that the world we’re living in now? he said. In his trademark stand-up schtick, Seinfeld added, “Why is she giving the finger? How old is the finger? How’d it even get to be the finger?” By the time fans and photographers spotted her, she had shed her coat to reveal bedazzled undies that looked like the get-up she wore in the video for her single “Telephone.” When host Steve Somers brought up the episode, Seinfeld at first said, “I wish her the best,” but then added, “you take one ‘A’ off of that and you’ve got gag.” “I don’t know what these young people think or how they promote their careers,” he said. “I’m older, I’m 56. I look at Lady Gaga the way Keith Hernandez watches these kids when they pull the pocket out, they wear the inside-out pocket. … Do you think he understands that? He can’t understand that. That’s a new game, that’s kids.” He added, “I’m not one of these all-publicity-is-good people. People talk about you need exposure — you could die of exposure.” “She is talented,” admitted Seinfeld. “I don’t know why she’s doing this stuff.” Seinfeld said he didn’t know she’d been taken to his box until he arrived for the night game of the doubleheader. Then when Somers pointed out that Gaga was at the Yankee game Friday, Seinfeld said, “Oh please, wake me when it’s over.” “You’ve had enough of her?” Somers asked. “Yeah,” Seinfeld said. ||||| Craig Carton Thursday, July 8th - Craig Carton who happends to be in Miami on vacation checks in with Steve to set the scene from South Beach as we all await LeBron's decision.

A British rugby player has been killed following a hit and run accident, Italian police have confirmed. Brendan Lynch, 26, who played for Gloucester and Rotherham Titans suffered fatal injuries after he was knocked form his Honda SH300 scooter in the early hours of the morning. Mr Lynch had moved to Rome recently and played for Capitolina, the city's main rugby club and he also worked for the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation which is based in the Italian capital. Fatal injuries: Talented rugby player Brendan Lynch, 26, pictured centre with the ball, was knocked from his scooter by a vehicle which then fled the scene, police said. He was considered to be one of the best tighthead props in Italian rugby and was a regular first team player for Capitolina - whose facilities have been used by England for practice ahead of the Six Nations match against Italy. Police said that Mr Lynch's scooter was hit by another car as he travelled on the Rome ring road near Settebagni just to the north of the capital and the vehicle had then sped off leaving him fatally injured by the side of the road. Passing motorists alerted emergency services but he was declared dead at the scene. Traffic police spokesman Roberto Ferilli said: 'We are investigating the circumstances of the accident and are appealing for any witnesses to contact us. 'We are also using cctv footage from the motorway to identify the vehicle. It appears the scooter he was travelling on was hit by another vehicle which failed to stop.' On its website Capitolina paid tribute to Mr Lynch adding that as a mark of respect it was cancelling all training sessions and club activities for 24 hours. Despite being born in Rotherham and having British citizenship Mr Lynch had also played for Ireland's Under 19 thanks to his Irish ancestors. A spokesman for the British Embassy in Rome said: 'I can confirm the death of a British national in a road traffic accident - other than that there is nothing else we can say.' A friend of Mr Lynch's, who asked not to be named, paid tribute to him and said: 'He was a really nice guy, really friendly and always had a smile. 'He enjoyed playing rugby and was a popular member of the club. He will be sadly missed.'

Mothers who feel their children don' t appreciate them can add another _ to the list: half the time, their children are lying to them. A study designed to expose the truth about lying shows that undergraduates lie to their mothers in 46% of their conversations. Still, mums should feel better than total strangers, who are told lies an astonishing 77 % of the time. Bella Depaulo and a team of psychologists from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, asked 77 undergraduates to keep a record of all their conversations for a week, and write down whether they lied at any time. DePaulo named lying broadly, as \\"when you intentionally try to mislead someone\\", so she would catch the smallest of lies. The students told an average of two lies a day. They said they had been studying when they had been out drinking. One told his parents that a textbook cost 50 rather than 20 so that they would send him extra money. Female students constantly told their plain-looking roommates that they were pretty. \\"They are everyday lies,\\" says DePaulo. DePaulo and her colleagues conclude that people tend to tell fewer lies to those they feel closest to. College students lied to their best friends 28% of the time but lied to acquaintances 48% of the time. In close relationships, people were more likely to tell \\"kind-hearted\\" lies, designed to protect feelings, rather than self-serving lies. Romantic partners lie somewhere between close friends and acquaintances. Students lied to romantic partners about a third of the time. DePaulo thinks that unmarried lovers can expect less honesty than best friends because of the insecurity that comes with romance. Mothers can take heart from one other finding. They may have been lied to, but at least their children talked to them. The students were recorded telling few lies to their fathers because they had little interaction with them.

The study was designed to reveal the frequency of lying in various social relationships. The students were asked to keep a record of all their conversations for a week and write down if they lied at any point. DePaulo defined lying broadly, as \\"when you intentionally try to mislead someone\\", in order to include even the smallest of lies. The findings of the study show that the students told an average of two lies per day. Some common examples of lies included claiming to have been studying when they were actually out drinking, inflating the cost of textbooks to receive more money from their parents, and complimenting plain-looking roommates to boost their self-esteem. DePaulo and her colleagues concluded that people tend to lie less often to those they feel closest to. College students were found to lie to their best friends 28% of the time, while lying to acquaintances 48% of the time. In close relationships, people are more likely to tell kind-hearted lies, which are designed to protect feelings rather than serve their own interests. Interestingly, romantic partners fall somewhere between close friends and acquaintances in terms of lying frequency, with students lying to romantic partners about a third of the time. DePaulo believes that unmarried lovers can expect less honesty than best friends due to the insecurity associated with romantic relationships. One positive aspect for mothers, as noted in the study, was that even though they were lied to, their children still engaged in more conversations with them than with their fathers, who were told fewer lies simply because there was less interaction between the students and their fathers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

All present clones are killed when the facility is destroyed in an explosion, activated by Wesker as he escapes in an aircraft. The original Alice ambushes him, but Wesker injects her with a serum that neutralizes the T-virus in her system, eliminating her superhuman powers and making her human again. He reveals that his T-Virus powers have surpassed her own, but before he can kill her, the aircraft crashes and Alice emerges from the wreckage.Six months later. Alice follows a repeating emergency broadcast from a survivors' safe haven known as \\"Arcadia\\" in Alaska. After many fruitless months searching for Arcadia and finding no survivors along the way, including her friends from the previous movie, Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) and K-Mart (Spencer Locke), Alice begins to lose hope, believing herself to be the last surviving human on the planet. Stopping on an abandoned beach, Alice finds the helicopter taken by Claire and the others when they and Alice parted ways. A crazed Claire, under the influence of an Umbrella Corporation device attached to her chest, attacks her. Alice removes the device, finding that it has damaged Claire's memory, which she slowly regains.Flying a two-person plane, they enter the ruins of Los Angeles and find a small group of survivors, led by Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) living in a maximum security prison, surrounded by the undead.

However, if observed over a longer period of time, it is seen that the population of a predator will correlationally rise and fall with the population of its prey in a cycle similar to the boom and bust cycle of economics. If a predator overhunts its prey, the prey population will lower to numbers that are too scarce for the predators to find. This will cause the predator population to dip, decreasing the predation pressure on the prey population. The decrease in predators will allow the small number of prey left to slowly increase their population to somewhere around their previous abundance, which will allow the predator population to increase in response to the greater availability of resources. If a predator hunts its prey species to numbers too low to sustain the population in the short term, they can cause not only the extinction or extirpation of the prey but also the extinction of their own species, a phenomenon known as coextinction. This is a risk that wildlife conservationists encounter when introducing predators to prey that have not coevolved with the same or similar predators. This possibility depends largely on how well and how fast the prey species is able to adapt to the introduced predator. One way that this risk can be avoided is if the predator finds an alternative prey species or if an alternative prey species is introduced (something that ecologists and environmentalists try to avoid whenever possible). An alternative prey species would help to lift some of the predation pressure from the initial prey species, giving the population a chance to recover, however it does not guarantee that the initial prey species will be able to recover as the initial prey population may have been hunted to below sustainable numbers or to complete extinction. Q: The rise and fall of predator and prey populations are similar to what, in the US economy?","completion":"The rise and fall of predator and prey populations are similar to the boom-and-bust cycle in the US economy. Like the ebb and flow of predator and prey populations, the economy too experiences periods of economic expansion (or \\"boom\\"), followed by periods of economic contraction (or \\"bust\\"). In periods of economic boom, there is increased production and consumption, businesses thrive, employment rates are high, and the general mood of consumers is optimistic. However, this period of prosperity cannot sustain indefinitely. Variabilities such as inflation, market saturation, or external economic shocks can lead to an economic contraction or a \\"bust\\". During a bust, there's a decrease in production and consumption, businesses struggle or go bankrupt, unemployment rises, and consumers' mood turns pessimistic. Relating this to predator and prey dynamics, the \\"boom\\" period can be equated to when the population of the prey increases. This abundance of prey leads to an increase in the population of predators because of the availability of food (resources). However, over time, as the predator population increases, the prey population decreases due to overpredation -- similar to a \\"bust\\" in the economy. As the prey population shrinks, so does the predator population due to reduced food sources. This results in a period of scarcity until the cycle begins anew with the slow recovery of the prey population, followed by the predator population, mirroring the recession and recovery stages of the economic cycle. However, it is noteworthy to mention that while economic forces can be regulated, monitored, and to an extent manipulated to prevent or alleviate a bust, the dynamics of predator-prey populations function within the principles of natural ecology and lack human directive."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities.

The answer is:","completion":"Jolene's grandmother, who just turned 66 years old, is more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than her granddaughter. The provided paragraph states that breast cancer is rare in teens, implying that Jolene is a teenager and therefore at a lower risk for breast cancer. Furthermore, the paragraph mentions that breast cancer becomes more common as females get older. Consequently, the grandmother's age of 66 years places her in a higher risk category than her young granddaughter. Age is an essential factor in breast cancer risk. As women age, their chances of developing breast cancer increase. The paragraph reinforces this idea by stating that breast cancer is rare in teens and becomes more common with age. The American Cancer Society supports this notion, indicating that breast cancer risk significantly increases after the age of 50. Other factors contribute to breast cancer risk, such as genetics, family history, hormonal factors, and lifestyle choices. However, age remains one of the most influential factors in determining breast cancer risk. While it is not guaranteed that Jolene's grandmother will be diagnosed with breast cancer, her age of 66 places her at a higher risk than her teenage granddaughter.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: President Barack Obama once believed marriage was only between a man and a woman. He then backed civil unions for gay and lesbian couples, granting them many of the same rights and privileges as married heterosexuals. Now he firmly supports a constitutional right that has put him at odds with many social conservatives. It is a personal and political evolution that in many ways reflects the country as a whole. Shifting public opinion and old fights over judicial power are at the nexus of perhaps the most important social issue the high court has addressed in recent years: same-sex marriage. There about 120,000 legally married homosexual couples in the United States. Many thousands more seek the same thing. But it may be 10 people who have the power to force immediate, real change on this legal, political, and social issue: the nine justices and Obama himself. How U.S. political leaders and the Supreme Court act in coming months could set the template for years on a contentious topic that shows no sign of cooling. \\"The argument that the Obama administration has made is the Supreme Court should look at these laws very carefully because gays and lesbians are a group that have been subject to discrimination in the past and will be subject to discrimination going forward,\\" said Amy Howe, a legal analyst and editor of SCOTUSblog.com. Kevin has a family: A same-sex couple's remarkable journey. \\"So the Supreme Court would need to subject these laws to what we call a very stringent standard of review\\" balancing the government's justification for enacting them, she added. Two separate appeals to be argued Tuesday and Wednesday will once again put the high court at center stage, a contentious encore to its summer ruling upholding the health care reform law championed by Obama. Nine states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage, including Washington, Maryland, Maine, Iowa, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York. Another nine have civil union or strong domestic partnership laws. The high court will consider two appeals. The first involves the federal Defense of Marriage Act. DOMA is a 1996 law that defines marriage between one man and one woman. That means federal tax, Social Security, pension, and bankruptcy benefits, family medical leave protections, and other provisions do not apply to gay and lesbian couples. Edie Windsor, an 84-year-old New York woman, is the key plaintiff. She was forced to pay more than 363,000 in extra estate taxes when her longtime spouse, Thea Spyer, died. The second case involves California's Proposition 8, a 2008 referendum that abolished same-sex marriage after the state's highest court ruled it legal. Gay couple fights for right to marry in epic high court battle. The Supreme Court is being asked to establish same-sex marriage as a constitutional right, but could also decide a more narrower question: Whether a state can revoke that right through referendum once it has already been recognized. Running for the Illinois state senate in 1998, Obama said he was \\"undecided\\" about whether to legalize same-sex marriage. Fast-forward six years to when he ran for U.S. Senate. He then declared a belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. The stance began an internal process over time that was by his admission, anything but smooth. \\"My feelings about this are constantly evolving. I struggle with this,\\" he said in 2010, two years into his presidency. \\"At this point, what I've said is that my baseline is a strong civil union that provides them the protections and the legal rights that married couples have,\\" Obama said at the time. Eight such states have civil union or strong domestic partnership laws-- Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, and Rhode Island. But it is the California case that really has drawn the Obama administration into the fight. Obama signaled earlier this month he was prepared to assert a vigorous constitutional right to marriage, but confine it for now only to the Proposition 8 matter and perhaps to the seven other states with civil union laws like California's. The Justice Department argues civil union and domestic partnership laws may themselves be unconstitutional and that those states should go all the way and grant same-sex couples full marriage rights. It's called the eight-state strategy. \\"The object of California's establishment of the legal relationship of domestic partnership is to grant committed same-sex couples rights equivalent to those accorded a married couple. But Proposition 8, by depriving same-sex couples of the right to marry, denies them the dignity, respect, and stature accorded similarly situated opposite-sex couples under state law,\\" the Justice Department said in its brief on the case. Gay rights groups had privately urged Obama and his top aides to go beyond his previous personal rhetoric in support of the right, and come down \\"on the side of history\\" in this legal struggle. This was all set in motion in the heat of the president's re-election campaign in what government sources described as a quickly arranged political strategy. Married same-sex couple awaits epic appeal. \\"At a certain point, I've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,\\" Obama told ABC News. Perhaps bowing to political caution in an election year, Obama explained he \\"hesitated on gay marriage\\" partly because he thought civil unions \\"would be sufficient.\\" \\"I was sensitive to the fact that for a lot of people, the word marriage was something that invokes very powerful traditions and religious beliefs,\\" he said. A new national survey indicates a small majority of Americans backs such marriages but there are generational and partisan divides as well as a gender gap. According to a CNN/ORC International poll, 53 percent of the public think marriages between gay or lesbian couples should be legally recognized as valid, with 44 percent opposed. \\"There are big differences among younger and older Americans, with the youngest age group twice as likely than senior citizens to support same-sex marriage,\\" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. \\"Women are also more likely to call for legal recognition of gay marriage than men. And only three in ten Americans who attend religious services every week support same-sex marriage while six in ten Americans who don't attend church weekly feel that way.\\" Former President Bill Clinton, who signed the marriage law into effect 17 years ago, said this month he now backs the right of homosexuals to marry. So, too, does his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a possible Democratic presidential candidate in 2016. But others on the right say society benefits from preserving a view of marriage that has been in place for centuries. The authors of a new book, \\"What is Marriage? Man and Woman: A Defense,\\" say, \\"Redefining marriage would, by further eroding its central norms, weaken an institution that has already been battered by widespread divorce, out-of-wedlock child bearing and the like.\\" Academics Robert George, Sherif Girgis, and Ryan Anderson say marriage should be more than \\"commitment based on emotional companionship,\\" and has been practiced for a specific reason throughout this country's history. \\"All human beings are equal in dignity and should be equal before the law. But equality only forbids arbitrary distinctions,\\" they argue. \\"And there is nothing arbitrary about maximizing the chances that children will know the love of their biological parents in a committed and exclusive bond. A strong marriage culture serves children, families and society by encouraging the ideal of giving kids both a mom and a dad.\\" Line forms days ahead of Supreme Court same-sex argument. The DOMA and Prop 8 cases will test the delicate line over constitutional limits from both congressional, presidential, and judicial power. All nine justices will have an equal voice in both oral argument and an eventual ruling, but it may be one member of the court whose views may count most in the high-stakes quest for five votes. Justice Anthony Kennedy authored the landmark 1996 Romer v. Evans ruling, striking down a Colorado constitutional amendment that forbid local communities from passing laws banning discrimination against gays. The moderate-conservative wrote for the 6-3 majority, rejecting the state's argument the law only blocked gay people from receiving preferential treatment or \\"special rights.\\" In dissent Justice Antonin Scalia criticized the court for placing what he said was \\"the prestige of this institution behind the proposition that opposition to homosexuality is as reprehensible as racial or religious bias.\\" In 2003, Kennedy authored the court's decision overturning state laws criminalizing homosexual sodomy. At the time though, he cautioned the court was not endorsing the idea of same-sex marriage, saying the private conduct case at hand \\"does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.\\" That caution was further articulated this month by Kennedy, when he said some issues are best left to the other branches. \\"I think it's a serious problem. A democracy should not be dependent for its major decisions on what nine unelected people from a narrow legal background have to say,\\" Kennedy said. By patiently letting legislatures and the voters decide the social and practical implications of same-sex marriage over the past decade, the high court is now poised to perhaps offer the final word on tricky constitutional questions. Or not. The split 5-4 conservative-liberal bench has the option of ruling broadly or narrowly-- perhaps taking a series of incremental cases over a period years, building political momentum and public confidence in the process. The Prop 8 case is Hollingsworth v. Perry (12-144). The DOMA case is U.S. v. Windsor (12-307). Opinion: Slowly, GOP shifting on same-sex marriage.

Write a title for this article: PHOENIX – A woman charged in the savage stabbing and shooting death of her lover told jurors Monday how she endured an abusive childhood at the hands of her parents and planned to commit suicide after she killed her on-again, off-again boyfriend. Jodi Arias' testimony was a surprise move by defense attorneys in a sensational murder trial in Phoenix that has become a daily fixture on cable news with its lurid stories of sex, lies, religion, betrayal and violence. Arias, 32, could become just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row if convicted. Arias' testimony aimed to portray her as a childhood abuse victim and naive teenager who stayed with boyfriends even after they cheated on her and became violent at times. Defense attorneys claim it was a similar scenario throughout her relationship with Travis Alexander, a successful businessman and motivational speaker, who Arias killed in June 2008, she says, in self-defense. She is charged with killing the 30-year-old man in what prosecutors describe as a fit of jealous rage after she found out he'd planned to take a trip to Mexico with another woman. Authorities say she stabbed and slashed him 27 times, slit his throat from ear to ear and shot him in the forehead, leaving his bloody body in the bathroom of his suburban Phoenix home to be found five days later by friends. Arias claims it was self-defense as Alexander attacked her after inviting her to his home for sex on the day of the killing. Her trial began in early January with a series of salacious details about a torrid romance between Arias and Alexander after they met at a Las Vegas conference in late 2006. She claims they dated for about five months, then broke up but continued to see each other for sex up until the day of his death. She initially told police she knew nothing of the killing, then later blamed it on masked intruders. She finally admitted her involvement, but claimed self-defense -- kill or be killed by the enraged man. She testified Monday that she lied early in the investigation about not being at the scene of the crime because she planned to commit suicide so there would never be a trial. \\"At the time, I had plans to commit suicide. So I was extremely confident that no jury would convict me because I didn't expect any of you to be here,\\" Arias told jurors. \\"I planned to be dead.\\" In a soft-spoken voice, Arias calmly described how an idyllic childhood in California turned abusive when she was about 7 years old. She said her parents beat her with belts and wooden spoons, and the abuse later escalated into shoving her into furniture and slapping her in the face for misdeeds such as sneaking out of the house. Her mother sat in the front row of the courtroom and showed no emotion as Arias described her childhood. Arias then went on to recount other stories from her youth that sometimes turned bizarre. She described meeting a high school boyfriend at a carnival when she was 15 and he was 18. Arias said the two dated for a while, but she broke it off because \\"he had all kinds of wild ideas.\\" \\"He entertained the belief in vampires,\\" she said, adding that he wanted the pair to move to San Francisco to hunt them. She said a few months after she broke up with the boy, she learned he was so distraught over the relationship's demise that he had slit both his wrists and tried to kill himself. Arias said she reconnected with him about \\"19 months\\" later after a man she met in her father's restaurant had told her that the \\"second coming\\" of Jesus Christ would occur in late 1997. \\"I was really naive and I kind of believed him,\\" Arias testified. She wanted to warn her former boyfriend, she said. But she said it wasn't long until the relationship turned stormy. She discovered he had been exchanging romantic emails with another woman, but she continued to date him. Later, she said he tried to strangle her and told her \\"how he would kill each member of my family.\\" Throughout the trial, defense attorneys have tried to depict Alexander as a liar and cheat who told Arias and other girlfriends he was a devout Mormon saving sex for marriage, while in reality he was having sex with multiple women, cheating on some with others. Prosecutors have portrayed Arias as a jealous ex-girlfriend who couldn't let go of Alexander and stalked him for months after their breakup until finally snapping and killing him. Authorities say they found her hair and bloody palm print at the scene of the killing, along with time-stamped photographs on a camera discovered inside Alexander's washing machine that place Arias there on the day he died. The photos included one of Arias nude on his bed, one of Alexander alive in the shower, then one of his body on the bathroom floor. Defense attorneys have yet to explain why Arias apparently attempted to clean the scene and what happened to the weapons. Authorities say Alexander was shot in the head with a .25 caliber gun, the same caliber Arias' grandparents reported stolen from their Northern California home about a week before the killing.

For the majority of their career, the group consisted of Michael \\"Mike D\\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar). Originally formed as a four-piece hardcore punk band, the Young Aborigines, in 1978 by Diamond (vocals), John Berry (guitar), Yauch (bass) and Kate Schellenbach (drums), the band appeared on the compilation cassette New York Thrash, contributing two songs from their first EP, Polly Wog Stew, in 1982. Berry left shortly thereafter, and was replaced by Horovitz. On May 4, 2012, Yauch died from cancer at the age of 47. On May 24, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Mike D said that the Beastie Boys recorded new music in late 2011 after the release of Hot Sauce Committee (Part 2), but he did not say if these recordings would be released. He also said that the Beastie Boys would likely disband due to the death of MCA, though he was open to making new music with Ad-Rock and that \\"Yauch would genuinely want us to try whatever crazy thing we wanted but never got around to.\\" In April 2013 it was announced that the group has signed a deal to write an autobiography. The book was scheduled to be released in the fall of 2015. However, Horovitz stated that the autobiography is being delayed. According to Horovitz, \\"We've got pages!....How it's going to fit together, I don't know. But we've got some ideas. It's interesting. It's fun.\\" On May 3, 2013 a children's playground in Brooklyn was renamed for Adam Yauch. In June 2014, Mike D stated that neither he nor Horovitz would perform under the Beastie Boys name again out of respect for Yauch. Founding Beastie Boys guitarist John Berry died on May 19, 2016, aged 52, as a result of frontotemporal dementia, after a decline of health for several years. He was credited with coming up with the Beastie Boys name, and played guitar on the first EP the Beastie Boys recorded. Before the Beastie Boys, he was also a part of Even Worse, Big Fat Love, Highway Stars, Bourbon Deluxe, and Idaho. The first Beastie Boys show took place at Berry's loft.

A coalition of groups is asking for a commitment to make all homes energy category C standard by 2025. About 1,482,000 homes in Scotland are rated below C, which is the minimum level of warmth needed to reduce the risk of death and ill health. More than 50 major civil society and business organisations have signed a joint-statement calling for the next Scottish government to make a commitment that \\"No one in Scotland is living in a hard-to-heat, draughty home, by 2025.\\" Alan Ferguson, chairman of the Existing Homes Alliance said: \\"These figures show that if the next Scottish Government set an objective to bring all homes in Scotland to at least a 'C' energy performance standard by 2025, they could end the scourge of cold homes currently affecting thousands of households across Scotland.\\" The figures were compiled using recent data from the register of Energy Performance Certificates, known as EPCs. The coldest homes are in Highlands and Islands, where 76% of people live in a property that falls below category C for energy performance. Dr Sam Gardner, head of policy at WWF Scotland, said: \\"Heating Scotland's buildings accounts for over half of our climate change emissions. \\"Ensuring every home reaches a C Energy performance standard by 2025 is the minimum level of ambition required to allow our climate change targets to be met. \\"A political commitment that no-one should live in a hard-to-heat, draughty home would be good for millions of households, and would drastically reduce emissions too.\\" The figures also show that the households in the lowest energy efficiency bands are also more likely to be living in fuel poverty.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The protected cruiser is a type of naval cruiser of the late 19th century, so known because its armoured deck offered protection for vital machine spaces from fragments caused by exploding shells above. Protected cruisers were an alternative to the armoured cruisers, which also had a belt of armour along the sides. - A warship is a naval ship that is built and primarily intended for naval warfare. Usually they belong to the armed forces of a state. As well as being armed, warships are designed to withstand damage and are usually faster and more maneuverable than merchant ships. Unlike a merchant ship, which carries cargo, a warship typically carries only weapons, ammunition and supplies for its crew. Warships usually belong to a navy, though they have also been operated by individuals, cooperatives and corporations. - A battlecruiser, or battle cruiser, was a capital ship built in the first half of the 20th century. They were similar in size, cost, and armament to battleships, but they generally carried less armour in order to obtain faster speeds. The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century, as a development of the armoured cruiser, at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship. The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships. - The capital ships of a navy are its most important warships; they are generally the larger ships when compared to other warships in their respective fleet. A capital ship is generally a leading or a primary ship in a naval fleet. - Pre-dreadnought battleships were sea-going battleships built between the mid- to late 1880s and 1905, before the launch of . Pre-dreadnoughts replaced the ironclad battleships of the 1870s and 1880s. Built from steel, and protected by hardened steel armour, pre-dreadnought battleships carried a main battery of very heavy guns in barbettes (open or with armored gunhouses) supported by one or more secondary batteries of lighter weapons. They were powered by coal-fuelled triple-expansion steam engines. - The armored cruiser was a type of warship of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was designed like other types of cruisers to operate as a long-range, independent warship, capable of defeating any ship apart from a battleship and fast enough to outrun any battleship it encountered. Varying in size, it was distinguished from other types of cruiser by its belt armorthick iron (or later steel) plating on much of the hull to protect the ship from shellfire much like that on battleships. The first armored cruiser, the Imperial Russian Navy's , was launched in 1873 and combined sail and steam propulsion. By the 1890s cruisers had abandoned sail and took on a modern appearance. - A battleship is a large armored warship with a main battery consisting of large caliber guns. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a fleet of battleships was vital for any nation that desired to maintain command of the sea. - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service. - A cruiser is a type of warship. The term has been in use for several hundred years, and has had different meanings throughout this period. During the Age of Sail, the term \\"cruising\\" referred to certain kinds of missions independent scouting, commerce protection, or raiding fulfilled by a frigate or sloop, which were the \\"cruising warships\\" of a fleet. - The dreadnought was the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century. The first of its kind, the Royal Navy's , made such a strong impression on people's minds when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built subsequently were referred to generically as \\"dreadnoughts\\", and earlier battleships became known as \\"pre-dreadnoughts\\". \\"Dreadnought\\"s design had two revolutionary features: an \\"all-big-gun\\" armament scheme, with more heavy-calibre guns than previous ships, and steam turbine propulsion. As dreadnoughts became a symbol of national power, the arrival of these new warships was a crucial catalyst in the intensifying naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany. With the launch of a single ship, \\"Dreadnought\\", the scales of naval power were reset overnight. As a result, dreadnought races sprang up around the world, including in South America, during the lead up to World War I. Successive designs increased rapidly in size and made use of improvements in armament, armour, and propulsion throughout the dreadnought era. Within five years, new battleships had outclassed \\"Dreadnought\\". These more powerful vessels were known as \\"super-dreadnoughts.\\" Most of the original dreadnoughts were scrapped after the end of World War I under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, but many of the newer super-dreadnoughts continued to be used throughout World War II. The only surviving dreadnought is , located near the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site. - The Grand Fleet was the main fleet of the British Royal Navy during the First World War. - HMS Defence was a Minotaur - class armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century , the last armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy . She was stationed in the Mediterranean when the First World War began and participated in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and light cruiser SMS Breslau . The ship was transferred to the Grand Fleet in January 1915 and remained there for the rest of her career . Defence was sunk on 31 May 1916 during the Battle of Jutland , the largest naval battle of the war . Escorting the main body of the Grand Fleet , the ship was fired upon by one German battlecruiser and four dreadnoughts as she attempted to engage a disabled German light cruiser . She was struck by two salvoes from the German ships that detonated her rear magazine . The fire from that explosion spread to the ship 's secondary magazines , which exploded in turn . There were no survivors . - A light cruiser is a type of small- or medium-sized warship. The term is a shortening of the phrase \\"light armored cruiser\\", describing a small ship that carried armor in the same way as an armored cruiser: a protective belt and deck. Prior to this smaller cruisers had been of the protected cruiser model, possessing armored decks only. What is the relationship between 'hms defence ' and 'armored cruiser'? Answer:","completion":"HMS Defence was a Minotaur-class armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. It was the last armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy.

Write highlights for this article: Vanessa-Mae was banned from international skiing for four years yesterday after taking part in fixed races to help her qualify for the Winter Olympics. The 36-year-old British violinist competed for Thailand, the country of her father’s birth, at the Games in Sochi last February. She skied under the name Vanessa Vanakorn and said it had been an ‘amazing’ experience despite coming last out of 67 competitors. Scroll down for video. Banned: Violinist Vanessa-Mae, pictured on Monday ahead of a concert in Prague, took part in fixed races in Slovenia in order to qualify for the Sochi Winter Olympic, organised at the request of her manager. But yesterday the Swiss-based International Ski Federation (FIS) said it had found ‘violations’ in her results from a hastily staged event in Slovenia held days before the deadline for Olympic qualification. It said that without the cheating she would not have achieved the points needed to be eligible to ski in the Games. Officials are said to have invented times for skiers who did not race and faked times for skiers who did not finish. They also broke rules by not changing the course design between the first and second runs, and allowing skiers to continue in poor weather which required abandonment. Five officials involved in the event at Krvavec in Slovenia have been banned by FIS. It is unclear if Thai Olympic officials were involved or if they will face IOC sanctions. The FIS said: ‘The competitions were organised at the request of the management of Vanessa Vanakorn, through the Thai Olympic Committee.’ FIS president Gian Franco Kasper said: ‘Those who have been sanctioned have been sanctioned for good reason.’ Cheater, cheater: Vanessa-Mae, who competed for Thailand as Vanessa Vanakorn, finished last of 67 racers in the two-run giant slalom in Sochi, almost a minute slower than the winner. Fake it til you make it: The International Ski Federation ruled that Vanessa-Mae would not have been able to qualify for the Olympic Games without the cheating. The International Olympic Committee declined to comment on details of the case until possible appeals are completed. Last night Vanessa-Mae was unavailable for comment. But if she does harbour dreams of another Olympic appearance, she may be disappointed. It is thought the ban would prevent her from competing at the next Winter Olympics in South Korea in 2018. The classical music star was born in Singapore to Thai and Chinese parents and moved to England at the age of four. Shortly after finishing the Games in February, she said: ‘With my limited experience – I only started training six months ago – I’m just glad I made it down.’ Highlights:","completion":"1.

Mr Abbott is meeting community leaders in Sydney on Monday and in Melbourne later in the week, to try to sell sweeping new anti-terror powers aimed at stopping Australian militants fighting overseas. The government is facing a backlash from Islamic groups, who fear they will be unfairly targeted by the new laws. Mr Abbott says Australia faces a serious threat from radicals who travel overseas to fight with terror groups in Syria and Iraq and then become 'militarised and brutalised' by the experience.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - Items are collected - The items are sorted - Trash is removed from everything else - Goes to a landfill - The items go into a baler machine for each kind of material - They come out as bales - The bales are shipped to manufacturers to use to make products. Question: suppose Less sunlight is available to the plants happens, how will it affect fewer items are sorted. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The question connects two different processes: photosynthesis (where sunlight is needed by plants) and waste sorting (which is related to waste management and recycling processes). Let's analyze these two processes independently at first. The process with the plants is photosynthesis, where plants convert light energy, usually from the Sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organisms' activities. This process requires sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. Therefore, a reduction in sunlight would mean a decrease in photosynthesis activity, which could result in less plant growth and, indirectly, less biomass production. On the other hand, the process of sorting items is an integral part of waste management. This procedure involves collecting items, sorting them out, removing trash, sending them to a landfill, or recycling them. The output of this process is ultimately affected by human consumption and production behaviors - the quantity and type of waste people produce. Working to connect these two processes, the relationship isn't direct. In a general sense, if there was less plant growth or fewer plants due to lowered photosynthesis, there could arguably be fewer plant-based items (like paper or cardboard) to recycle. However, this is relatively indirect and takes a long time to manifest. The majority of the items sorted in the waste management process are not solely plant-based or influenced by the plant growth rate or photosynthesis. Instead, they are derived from other materials like plastic, metals, glass, etc., or are post-consumer waste from humans. So, even if \\"Less sunlight is available to the plants,\\" it might have a very minimal or negligible effect on the amount of \\"fewer items are sorted.\\" The sorting process depends largely on human consumption and waste disposal habits, and less on the rate of plant production or photosynthesis. Thus, the supposed perturbation – that is, the reduced availability of sunlight to plants – would have very \\"little to no effect\\" on the sorting process, especially within a short timeframe. It would take a significant decrease in plant-based items over a long period to see any substantive impact on the sorting process. For this reason, it is also essential to consider the time scale in such considerations. Short-term effects would likely be negligible, but long-term effects could gradually become more significant, although still relatively small. So, under most circumstances, we could confidently argue the effect would remain minor. In conclusion, a lesser availability of sunlight to plants likely has little to no effect on the sorting phase of waste management, as plant-derived items form a small part of waste materials, and the reduction in photosynthesis doesn't directly influence human waste generation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hannah seized upon the idea of selling the luxurious family home and donating half the proceeds to charity, while using the other half to buy a more modest replacement home.

News article: What has been dubbed Art Week, the annual fest that surrounds Art Basel Miami Beach, has attracted throngs of collectors, enthusiasts and gawkers to South Florida. And, as it turns out, at least one thief. An unknown burglar — or burglars — swiped a silver plate crafted by Spanish master Pablo Picasso sometime between Thursday night and Friday morning from Art Miami in Midtown, the premier Basel satellite fair. David Smith, owner of the Amsterdam-based Leslie Smith Gallery, said he arrived at the booth Friday to find an empty holder on the wall where the artwork hung Thursday. “I’ve been doing art shows all my life. Even when I was a kid, I went with my parents,” said Smith, 45. “I’ve never, ever had anything stolen.” Never miss a local story. Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access. SUBSCRIBE NOW He reported the heist to show organizers and to Miami police, who dusted for fingerprints. The 1956 piece, Visage aux Mains (Face with Hands), is a 16.5-inch-wide silver plate engraved with a smiling face and stick-finger hands. It’s No. 16 in a 20-plate series, Smith said, and is valued at about 85,000. “There is no video surveillance or witnesses to this incident,” Det. Frederica Burden, a police spokeswoman, said in an email. A police report of the incident lists the crime as grand theft. Art Miami is located at 3101 NE First Ave. in a temporary tent facility — guarded by the same company that conducts security for Art Basel, a separate fair at the Miami Beach Convention Center. At Art Miami, security includes 24-hour guards at entrances and exits, as well as locks and chains on the doors. No video cameras are trained on each booth, which is hardly unusual for art fairs. “There’s an investigation going on,” said Nick Korniloff, the fair’s director and partner. Cleaning crews, fair employees and booth operators would have had access to the site overnight, he said. The fair has a list of all personnel allowed to work on the premises. According to Smith, a security guard did a walk-through at about 10:30 p.m. and the Picasso was still in place. The gallery owner said he himself left Art Miami at about 8:30 p.m. Thursday, with his collection whole. The Picasso had hung there since Monday. When he walked in at about 10:45 a.m. Friday, Smith said, the piece was gone. By the time doors opened to fairgoers at 11 a.m., all visitors saw was a label beneath where the purloined Picasso had been. “Signed, numbered & Stamped with silver marks,” the label read in part, describing the piece. Police asked the gallery to keep the booth untouched as they investigated, which means Smith could hardly focus on selling art in the fair’s first two hours — usually the busiest ones of the day. “We had to shoo people off the booth,” he said. “I definitely missed people I didn’t speak to.” Nothing else was missing or appeared disturbed, Smith said. The Picasso plate wasn’t the most valuable artwork on display, according to Smith: For example, a Picasso ceramic just below where the plate was hanging is worth about 365,000. The pilfered piece will be reported to an international database meant to inform art dealers of stolen work. Smith speculated that the plate might have been small enough for someone to hide under a sweater or jacket. The neighboring ceramic piece was smaller but easier to break — and easier to spot as a Picasso, perhaps making it less attractive to filch. “If you steal art, if it’s from a famous artist, it’s going to be hard to re-sell,” he said. “Either somebody steals it for himself to keep, or somebody, somewhere, someday will realize it’s stolen.” ||||| MIAMI A silver plate made by famed Spanish artist Pablo Picasso was stolen overnight from a Miami art fair, Art Miami Show Director Nick Korniloff said on Friday. The piece, called Visage aux Mains (Face with Hands), was one of 20 made by Picasso in the mid-20th century featuring a simple, smiling face at its center with stick-like hands on either side. The plate, exhibited at the Art Miami fair by Amsterdam-based Leslie Smith Gallery, is valued at 85,000, Korniloff said. \\"There is no market value for a stolen work of that nature that doesn't come with paperwork or provenance,\\" he added. In a statement, the Miami Police Department said \\"there is no video surveillance or witnesses to this incident. The investigation continues.\\" Leslie Smith Gallery Director David Smith could not immediately be reached for comment.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Chalky paint has a matte finish, goes on with minimal prep work, and is easier to scrape off while you’re distressing your furniture. Choose a paint color that matches the aesthetic in the rest of your room. Chalky paint is not the same as chalkboard paint. Chalkboard paint is meant to be written on with chalk after it dries, while chalky paint just has an ultra-matte finish. You can buy chalky paint from any painting supply store. Adding marks to a table surface or furniture legs can make it seem older than what it actually is. Lightly tap your furniture with the end of a chisel or hammer to make indents in the surface. Make the marks random so it doesn’t look like an intentional pattern. Wear safety glasses in case any wood accidentally breaks off your furniture. Experiment with different tools around your house to see what kind of marks they make. Use 120-grit sandpaper to roughen the surfaces on your piece of furniture. This helps the paint adhere better so it’s less likely to peel off or chip. Make sure to sand any surface you plan on painting so you get a nice even coat. You do not need to sand unfinished wood furniture. Wet a cleaning cloth with warm water and wring it out until it’s damp. Wipe all of the surfaces you plan on painting to get rid of any dust or dirt that’s on them. Use another cloth to dry any areas that are wet before you start. Dip the ends of the bristles in your paint so there’s only a small amount on your paintbrush. Start from the top of your piece of furniture and work toward the bottom. Apply a thin layer of paint on the surface so it can dry fast and even. When you’re finished with the first coat, leave it to dry overnight. It’s okay if you still see the wood or laminate underneath your first coat of paint. This can help add to the distressed look of the final piece. Once the first coat of paint has dried completely, put another coat of paint on your piece. Again, work from the top of the furniture down toward the bottom, and paint until it has a smooth matte finish. When you’re done, let it dry for 3-4 days so the paint has time to adhere to the furniture. Corners and edges are usually the first parts that wear away over time, so start by distressing them. Use 120-grit sandpaper to rub the dry paint off of the surface to expose the wood or laminate underneath. Apply light pressure so you don’t accidentally remove more than you want. Add more distress marks where your furniture touches the floor so it looks like it’s been scratched up after moving around a lot. Wipe any dust away with a damp rag so you can easily see where you’ve already distressed the furniture. If you accidentally rub off too much of the paint, you may paint over the area again and start over. Wax acts as a sealant to help protect your furniture from any damage. Dip the end of a cheesecloth in the wax and spread it across the surface of your furniture. Work the wax into the surface in a circular motion until it’s smooth. Continue waxing the entire piece of furniture so it’s sealed. Furniture wax can be bought from your local hardware or paint supply stores. Wax may take up to 30 days to completely cure, but you can use the furniture after one week.","completion":"This article is about how to use chalky paint to create a distressed and aged look on furniture, including painting, distressing, and sealing the piece with furniture wax."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the following conversation and answer the question.

Life-long education is often achieved through distance learning or e-learning, continuing education, home schooling, etc. It also includes training programs for those who want to improve their qualifications, bring their skills up to date or retrain for a new line of work. In later life, especially in retirement, continued learning takes various forms, crossing traditional academic limits.

Her life was filled with heartbreak, as her husband had been tragically taken from her in a violent manner, forcing her to embrace widowhood much earlier than she would have ever wished. Though she faced many struggles and challenges, she showed immense resilience and strength to raise her two sons, Anand and Gopi, on her own. She was determined to provide the best possible life for her children, although her husband's untimely death left the family with very little. One fateful day, as Sulochana was bathing her boys, she heard a commotion outside. Immediately concerned, she let the water out of the tub and rushed to the window to see what was happening. Leela, a young girl from the village, was playing near the river when she slipped and fell into the raging waters. Without hesitation, Sulochana sprinted to the river, shouting for someone to help her save Leela. Her eyes filled with worry, she dove headfirst into the water, swimming hard against the current to reach the struggling girl. Some villagers saw Sulochana's valiant effort and rushed to the river's edge to form a human chain, reaching for her and young Leela, who clung to her savior's back. With strength born of desperation, Sulochana connected with the chain, and the villagers slowly pulled them to safety. However, tragedy struck again when Sulochana was badly injured during the rescue. The accident left her crippled and unable to keep her family together, and her sons were forced to separate. Anand, the elder and more responsible of the two brothers, was taken in by a loving and nurturing couple, who raised him as their own. He grew up in a stable, happy home, surrounded by love and warmth, which ultimately helped him evolve into a model citizen, eventually becoming the village's headmaster at its local school. Gopi, on the other hand, was not so fortunate. He was sent to live with a distant relative, a cruel and heartless man who made his living through illegal means. Gopi, growing up in a harsh and brutal environment, soon found himself taking on his caretaker's traits and becoming involved in a life of crime. Over time, he gained a notorious reputation far and wide, and his name became synonymous with fear and dread to all those who heard it. Years passed, and the brothers led their separate lives, unaware of each other's existence. They had become two entirely different people, shaped by the experiences and environments they had encountered growing up. It seemed like the events of their past were destined to keep them separated, even though they were bound by blood. But fate had different plans for Anand and Gopi. One evening, in the midst of a blinding thunderstorm, the small village at the heart of their story faced an unimaginable tragedy, as a fire raged unchecked, consuming everything in its path. The villagers, caught off guard by the natural disaster, fled in a panic, seeking shelter from the inferno. As the firestorm ravaged Ramgarh, the scattered remnants of Sulochana's family found themselves trapped, facing a brutal end together after years of separation. Consumed by the flames and the fury of the storm, they faced their final moments in a cruel twist of fate, their lives strangely linked together by their love for their mother and a village that had borne witness to their unfolding stories. In the end, the two brothers, Anand and Gopi—so different, yet bound by blood—discovered just how interconnected their fates truly were. The flames and the storm that crashed around them, charring the memories of their past, revealed love, pain, and sacrifice, reminding the world of the power of destiny."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What key details about viktor bushuev can be extracted from the following bio?

In general, the term \\"sterile\\" refers to something that is devoid of living microorganisms or is free from viable microorganisms that can cause infection. This word can have different implications depending on the context, but when used as a standalone term, it often carries a negative connotation. For instance, a sterile environment or object can be seen as something lifeless, barren, or unproductive, which are generally considered to be negative attributes. When considering whether the sentiment of the word \\"sterile\\" is positive or negative, it is essential to note that the context of the term within a sentence or conversation is critical.

He would sit in his room or at the library, flipping pages and looking at colorful pictures of different animals and plants. He learned so much that he knew a lot more about biology than Joseph did. One day, the two friends were walking through a beautiful park, filled with all sorts of vibrant flowers and plants, and they saw a little butterfly resting on a leaf. Joseph looked at the butterfly and asked, \\"Hey, what kind of butterfly is that?\\" Lawrence, with all his knowledge of biology, could quickly recognize the butterfly and said, \\"That's a Monarch butterfly! They're orange, black, and white, and they are very special because they travel long distances during their lifetime.\\" Joseph was amazed by Lawrence's ability to know the butterfly's name and facts about it. \\"Wow, that's so cool!

The conclusion of Moslem rule in Granada marked a significant milestone in the history of Spain, as well as in the history of the Islamic world. This historic event was the culmination of the long and bloody conflict known as the Reconquista, which was waged between the Christian kingdoms of Northern Spain and the Islamic Moors who had ruled much of the Iberian Peninsula since the early 8th century. The fall of Granada was due in large part to the efforts of the Catholic Monarchs, King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile. United by their marriage in 1469, these two powerful kingdoms were able to combine their military and financial resources to gradually push the Moors out of Spain. In 1482, the Reconquista began to intensify as both sides saw that the time for a decisive confrontation was near. Over the next decade, the Catholic Monarchs launched a series of successful campaigns that saw them conquering many key Moorish strongholds. Eventually, they managed to surround the city of Granada, which had been under Moslem control for centuries, and by 1491 they had launched the decisive siege against the city. Granada's Moslem leader, Emir Muhammad XII, also known as Boabdil, quickly realized that the city's defenses were overwhelmed, and its fall seemed imminent. As a result, Boabdil decided to negotiate the city's surrender in order to save his people from further suffering. According to historical accounts, it was agreed that the city would be handed over to the Catholic Monarchs in exchange for Boabdil's safe passage, along with that of his family and any Moslems who chose to join them. The Moslems who remained in the city were promised the right to practice their religion freely without fear of persecution. On January 2, 1492, Boabdil formally handed over the keys to the city and left Granada with his family and followers. It is said that when he reached the nearby hill known as \\"The Hill of Tears,\\" Boabdil paused to look back at the city one last time and wept at the sight of the lost kingdom. The fall of Granada marked the end of Moslem control of Spain and the successful completion of the Reconquista, which had lasted for almost 800 years. For Spain, Granada's surrender signified not only a great military victory but also the solidification of the Catholic Monarchs' rule, paving the way for the emergence of the modern Spanish state. This historic event also contributed to the eventual decline of Islamic influence in Spain, as the Moors who remained in the kingdom were gradually subjected to forced conversions, harsh restrictions, and periodic expulsions over the next few centuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What was the catalyst of the Asian minor Greeks fleeing and the Greek genocide?\\" is in \\"In the aftermath of the First World War, Greece attempted further expansion into Asia Minor, a region with a large native Greek population at the time, but was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, contributing to a massive flight of Asia Minor Greeks. These events overlapped, with both happening during the Greek genocide (1914-1922), a period during which, according to various sources, Ottoman and Turkish officials contributed to the death of several hundred thousand Asia Minor Greeks. The resultant Greek exodus from Asia Minor was made permanent, and expanded, in an official Population exchange between Greece and Turkey. The exchange was part of the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne which ended the war.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The catalyst of the Asia Minor Greeks fleeing and the Greek genocide was a combination of factors, including Greece's attempt to expand into Asia Minor following World War I, the defeat in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922, and the ongoing Greek genocide (1914-1922).

Next question: ieee single precision floating point number in binary?","completion":"To convert a number into the IEEE single-precision floating-point format, follow these steps: 1. Determine the sign bit: A positive number will have a sign bit of 0, while a negative number will have a sign bit of 1. 2. Convert the number to binary: For simplicity, let's use the number +6.5 (you can use any number). Converting it to binary, we get 110.1. 3. Normalize the binary number: Normalization means shifting the binary point so that there is a single non-zero digit to the left of the binary point. For our number, 110.1 is already normalized. 4. Determine the exponent: Since the binary point was not shifted during normalization, the exponent is 0. But we need to add a bias of 127 for single-precision representation: 0 + 127 = 127. Convert 127 to binary: 01111111. 5. Determine the significand (mantissa): We only need the digits after the first significant digit (which is always normalized to 1), so the significand for our example is 101. However, the single-precision significand has 23 bits, so we need to pad the remaining bits with zeros: 10100000000000000000000. 6. Combine the sign bit, exponent, and significand: Finally, we can combine all the parts to form the IEEE single-precision floating-point representation: Sign bit: 0 Exponent: 01111111 Significand: 10100000000000000000000 Put together: 01011111111010000000000000000000 So, the IEEE single-precision floating-point representation of +6.5 in binary is 01011111111010000000000000000000."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

She discovered cleaning the bathroom floor could be done at the same time as the rest by sliding around with wet towels tied to her feet. This is likely to work better than dry towels because wet towels provide (A) less resistance or (B) more resistance? Answer:","completion":"Your students should choose \\"wet towels\\" and the correct answer to the logic test is (B) more resistance. Sara's discovery involves cleaning the bathroom floor more efficiently by using wet towels tied to her feet. Wet towels are likely to work better than dry towels because they provide more resistance, not less. The rationale behind this is that a wet towel has a higher level of friction against the floor compared to a dry towel. This increased friction, or resistance, allows the wet towel to better pick up dirt, dust, and other particles from the surface of the floor. In contrast, a dry towel would slide more easily and may not effectively remove dirt and debris. Additionally, the dampness of a wet towel helps in capturing and holding dust and dirt particles, improving the overall cleaning efficacy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"They run perpendicular to the \\"chainlines\\", which are further apart.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, you are correct. In the context of papermaking, laidlines run perpendicular to the chainlines. To provide a more detailed explanation: Papermaking is an ancient art and craft that involves the creation of paper sheets from various sources of fibers or pulps. During the process of papermaking, certain features known as laidlines and chainlines become embedded in the paper, giving it specific characteristics and a unique appearance. Laidlines and chainlines are formed during the papermaking process when a sheet of paper is created using a paper mold – a wooden frame mounted with a metal wire mesh screen. The wire mesh is made up of closely-spaced horizontal wires, referred to as \\"laidlines,\\" and slightly thicker, more widely-spaced vertical wires called \\"chainlines.\\" These lines are visible when a sheet of paper is held against a light source or examined using transmitted light. Laidlines are the closely-spaced parallel lines that run horizontally across a sheet of paper. They are formed by the thinner wire strands on the mold's mesh and are typically about 1 millimeter apart. Depending on the papermaker, the spacing between these lines may vary in different paper molds. Chainlines, on the other hand, are the thicker, widely-spaced vertical lines running perpendicular to the laidlines. The chainlines are formed by the \\"chain wires,\\" which are sturdier and more substantial than the laid wires and provide additional support to the structure of the mold. Chainlines are generally spaced about 2.5 to 3 centimeters apart, depending on the size of the paper mold and the preferences of the papermaker. Together, the laidlines and chainlines give a sheet of handmade paper its unique wavy texture and appearance, known as \\"laid\\" or \\"watermark.\\" This pattern distinguishes many varieties of handmade paper from machine-made paper, which typically does not possess these distinguishing features. In addition, the presence of such lines allows historians, art conservators, and archivists to assess the age and origin of a sheet of paper and the artworks and documents created on it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As someone who enjoys exploring new places and cherishes pleasant experiences, I was optimistic before visiting this establishment, only to be left severely disappointed. Upon entering the establishment, the first issue I encountered was the lack of a warm welcome. On my arrival, the staff seemed to be uninterested and apathetic.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Many couples find that, after living together for a few months, they still have strong feelings for each other and want to stay together as a couple, but struggle to actually live with one another. It is possible to keep a relationship together—the relationship may even become stronger! You should still be clear about what you want; try saying: “I still want this to be a serious relationship; I care deeply about you.” “I still want to see you regularly (or 'a few times a week,' etc.), but I would like more space than I have now.” “I want you to still feel welcome here, and I want to feel welcome at your new apartment.\\" Asking someone to move out is usually thought of as a negative act, and associated with breakups and unhappy feelings. If you're planning to stay together as a couple, it will be important to the health of your relationship to focus on the good things about your relationship. For example, explain to your boyfriend the ways that living separately will strengthen your relationship. Try saying: “I think that us living in separate places will allow us to have more feeling of romance and affection in our relationship.” “I feel like you and I will have less conflict and fewer arguments if we don't live together.” “I think you and I will grow closer to each other if don't spend all of our time together.” This is a sensitive and emotional issue, and should be treated as such. Your boyfriend may be hurt that you are asking him to move out, or confused about how this new phase of your relationship is going to work. Remember that relationships involve compromise—if he moves out at your request, you may need to make other compromises in the future. Talk to him and let him know that he's still important to you; make your reasoning clear, then ask if he has any concerns about how moving out will affect your relationship. Let him know that you see this as a step forward in the relationship; things are improving between you and him, not getting worse. Shortly after your boyfriend has moved out, spend extra time with him or buy him a gift to show that you care about how he feels. Try to keep most other aspects of your relationships stable. If you're staying together after asking your boyfriend to move out, you and he will need to establish some boundaries. Many couples feel that they lose important parts of their personal identity and social lives while living with a partner; talk with your boyfriend about how you and he can each maintain a distinct personal and social life. Now that you don't live together anymore, how will the relationship work? What will it look like on a day-to-day basis? How often will you see one another? This should not only be a conversation that you have inside your head—sit down with your boyfriend and discuss specific activities that you and him can routinely do together that will help your relationship feel fun and normal, and allow you both to get used to the new living situation. For example, try saying: “I think it would be fun if we had weekly date nights.” “We should spend time together meeting new people outside of our usual social circle.” Summary:","completion":"The article suggests that couples struggling to cohabit but wishing to sustain their relationship can consider living separately, emphasizing that in such scenarios, communication about desires and concerns is essential.

This was the swankiest Asian place I've ever eaten at, although considering I was in Vegas, it was probably about par. Service was excellent. I ordered some salt and pepper calamari to start. The strong garlic flavor was welcome, but they must've used some frozen squid, because it was kind of chewy. More importantly, where were my tentacles?! The plate was filled with little rings, not one tentacle in sight. boo. The second dish I ordered was quite enjoyable. I had the dried scallop, duck, and seafood e-mein. All of the seafood (shrimp and scallops) were cooked perfectly, not overdone at all. This was exactly what my stomach was craving. After filling up with the yummy noodles, I was satisfied and had the energy to go attack the tables again. Output:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the positive aspects of the review - Swankiest Asian place - Excellent service - Enjoyable second dish (dried scallop, duck, and seafood e-mein) - Seafood (shrimp and scallops) cooked perfectly - Yummy noodles - Satisfied customer Step 2: Analyze the negative aspects of the review - Calamari dish had chewy texture - Frozen squid was possibly used - Lack of tentacles in the dish Step 3: Weigh the positives and negatives - There were more positive aspects than negative aspects in the review. Also, the negative comments are about one dish only, whereas multiple positive comments were made about the second dish, service, and ambiance. Step 4: Decide on a rating Based on the review analysis, I would rate this place 4 stars. The overall experience seems positive and enjoyable, with only one dish not meeting the customer's expectations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, a lot of people do. And I'll start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk, because of the near unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on USA network and, wow.... SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE'S HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK Was it boring! I almost didn't make it through Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was unlikeable (and that's no fun, he's usually a cool character). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk was meant to facially resemble Bruce Banner in his non-angry state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle I was ready to concede Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever. But then something happened. About 3/4 of the way through this tedious movie, there was a genuinely exciting and - dare I say it - reasonably convincing - extended action scene that starts with Hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base, fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, then riding an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere, only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say, the CGI was quite good. That's not to say that the Hulk was totally convincing. But it didn't require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non-superhero action movies. And that's quite a feat. Of course, the ending got really stupid with Bruce Banner's father turning into some sort of shape-shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of Iron Man's brief heroics to shame. And overall, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really did seem like the CGI in Hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment. It was certainly better than I expected. OK, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what... It's boring too! It has just a few appearances by the Hulk and here's the thing - the CGI in this movie is horrible. Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lee's version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others - but it had its convincing moments also. The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous. It had skin tone and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature, just some sort of computer-generated texture. It was really preposterous. The lighting, environment and facial effects didn't look 5 years newer than Ang Lee's, they looked 10 years older. And there really is no excuse for that. We truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director, actor or cinematographer ever could. Worse, the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from Ang Lee's \\"failure\\". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is practically emotionless. The general is so relentlessly, implausibly one-dimensional that he seems faker than the Hulk. The love interest is unconvincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though both are quite easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson overacts almost as much as Nick Nolte, even though he's only in the movie for a few minutes. The Hulk really doesn't do much in this movie, certainly not any more than in Ang Lee's version. The Incredible Hulk was slightly more fast-paced, but since nothing really happened anyway that's not worth much. Oh yeah, the villain is every bit as phony looking as the Hulk. He's actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster. This is how I can definitively say Ang Lee's version was better: if I ever have the chance to see Ang Lee's version again, I might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences, or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more (more likely I'd just fast forward to the good parts). But there is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. It is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. The cartoonish CGI is an insult to the audience - at least in Ang Lee's version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course). It is absolutely mind-boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by making almost exactly the same movie. It is to Edward Norton's credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative? Available choices: + negative. + positive.","completion":"In conclusion, the sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer seems to hold a predominantly negative view of both Ang Lee's Hulk and The Incredible Hulk, citing issues with the CGI, the portrayal of characters, and the overall storylines. While they do find some redeeming qualities in Ang Lee's version, like the extended action scene, they ultimately find both films to be underwhelming and disappointing, especially comparing them to other superhero movies."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Article: Hudson boat crash: Personal watercraft rider finds second body Parishioners gathered Sunday for a morning service at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Pearl River, where the couple involved in Friday's deadly boat crash on the Hudson River, Lindsey Stewart and A link to this page will be included in your message. ||||| (CNN) -- [Breaking news alert, 1:39 p.m. ET] Authorities in Piermont, New York, believe that they have recovered the body of Mark Lennon, the second victim of a boating accident involving a wedding party on the Hudson River, Sheriff Louis Falco told reporters Sunday. Lennon was the best man in the group. [Previously published story, 12:10 p.m. ET] The path that led Lindsey Stewart and Brian Bond to decide to join their lives together was as measured and deliberate as its end was abrupt. The two had been friends since they were children living in the suburbs north of New York City. They went to the same church. More than three years ago, the relationship turned romantic. Next month, the 30-year-old human resources manager at an insurance company in Nyack, and her 36-year-old beau were to marry at Good Shepherd Church in Pearl River. The reception was to be at Torne Valley Winery in Hillburn. \\"She did all the plans herself,\\" her stepfather, Walter Kosik, told CNN. \\"She had everything under control.\\" On Friday night, Stewart and Bond and four of their friends dined at a restaurant, then boarded a 21-foot Stingray power boat on the Hudson River for what was to have been a short ride from the village of Piermont in Rockland County to Tarrytown. It was a clear, balmy night. The short ride and the couple's long-term plans collided fatally when the boat struck the side of one of three barges that were lashed together at a construction site near the Tappan Zee Bridge, 25 miles north of Manhattan. The barges, which were being used by a contractor who is building a new bridge, had been anchored in the river since around April, said Robert Van Cura, undersheriff of the Rockland County Sheriff's Office. Stewart was thrown from the boat, as was Mark Lennon, who was to have served as the couple's best man. Despite suffering serious head injuries, Bond, Stewart's fiance, called 911 from the boat at 10:41 p.m., reporting that it had struck an object south of the bridge. Rescuers poured in from around the area, but to no avail. At 2:30 a.m. Saturday, the police showed up at the house belonging to Stewart's mother and stepfather. \\"That's something -- a nightmare -- I don't wish on any parent, to get that police coming over your house waking you out of your sleep to tell you that an accident has occurred,\\" Kosik said. A few hours later, a body believed to be that of Stewart's was discovered about an eighth of a mile off the riverbank. The search for Lennon, which proved fruitless Saturday, was to resume Sunday morning, but officials held out little hope he would be found alive. \\"We're always hopeful, but obviously, at this hour, it's less and less likely that this would be a rescue as opposed to a recovery,\\" Van Cura told reporters. The four who were not thrown from the boat suffered head injuries and were taken to area hospitals. One of them, boat operator Jojo K. John, 35, was arrested. \\"We have probable cause to believe that he operated the boat while intoxicated,\\" Van Cura said. John was arraigned at an area hospital on one count of first-degree vehicular manslaughter and three counts of second-degree vehicular assault, Van Cura said. More charges are possible, he said. Van Cura said the operator was not the registered owner of the boat, which may have more than one owner. Bond was hospitalized at Westchester Medical Center, said Kosik, who visited him Saturday. \\"He was in no condition to talk.\\" A spokesman for the medical center said Bond was in fair condition. \\"She's supposed to be married two weeks from today,\\" said Carol Stewart about her daughter. \\"It just can't end like this.\\" An investigation has begun. \\"The barge had some lights on it; whether or not it was properly lighted is part of the investigation,\\" Van Cura said. \\"On a clear, moonlit night, with the bridge lights on, you can see pretty well,\\" said Tom Sobolik in a telephone interview from aboard his sailboat near the accident site. The moon was last full on Monday. But Craig and Celeste Kmiecik said they were boating in the area on Friday night and that it appeared dark. \\"There was a moon last night, but you really can't see anything,\\" said Craig Kmiecik. \\"The barge was not lit up,\\" said Celeste Kmiecik. \\"We saw that last night coming back to the marina.\\" CNN's Alina Cho and Chris Welch contributed to this report. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Sure, sweetie! So this is a sad story about a boat crash. A couple, Lindsey Stewart and Brian Bond, who were going to get married soon, went with some friends on a boat ride at night. Sadly, their boat hit something big in the river, called a barge, which was part of a bridge construction site. Lindsey and their friend Mark Lennon were thrown out of the boat into the water. Brian, who was hurt, called for help, but sadly Lindsey and Mark couldn't be found alive. The police think that the man driving the boat, named Jojo John, might have drunk too much alcohol, which is a big no-no, especially when you're driving something. They also are looking at whether the barge was lit up enough at night. It's a very sad story, honey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Winter is a great time to experiment with new sports. The key is to find one that matches your interests and natural abilities. If you like to walk, keep walking -- on snowshoes. If you want to try an endurance sport, go for cross-country skiing. Besides, snowboarding is just great fun. Not satisfied with these? Try downhill skiing, then. Downhill skiing is not as hard as it used to be -- shorter, lightweight, curved skis make any beginner feel like an Olympic winner. These newer skis -- along with another type of equipment called skiboards, which are even shorter than skis -- help you control your speed and body movements. Consider testing the latest high-tech skis or snowboards?Check with your local sports shops or the rental places at the ski mountains about sample programs. You could also try sledding. Use a wood-framed sled with steel runners or a plastic sled to head down a snowy hill. If you prefer ice to snow, think hockey or figure skating. Runners can also train during the winter in spite of wet or slippery roads. One of the easiest sports around, snowshoeing can be excellent cold-weather cross-training for runners and cyclists -- or anyone wanting to take a wintry walk in the woods. Snowshoes are smaller, lighter, and better than ever. If you want to try them out, you may be able to rent a pair for a day at many of the larger outdoor or sporting goods stores. Whatever sport you choose, don't rely on a friend for instruction. You wouldn't let an inexperienced doctor perform a brain operation on you, but why let one teach you to ski or skate? That's what instructors are for -- to help newcomers start out right. Instructors can give you advice about equipment, techniques, safety, and dealing with injuries if they do happen to you. Above all, if you want to progress, invest your time in learning the basic skills thoroughly. Everything else you do as a skier, boarder, or skater will be built on these first skills. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Answer: Choose your answer from: (a). Runners and cyclists cannot train because of the wet or slippery roads in winter.; (b). Downhill skiing used to be more difficult to learn because of the old-fashioned skis.; (c). People can rent snowshoes for a day at their local sports shops or the rental places.; (d).

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him.
