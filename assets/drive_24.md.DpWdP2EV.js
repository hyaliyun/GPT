At the age of 30, aware of the desperate medical needs of Africans, he decided to become a doctor and devote the rest of his life to direct service in Africa. In 1913, at the age of 38, Dr.Schweitzer and his wife, Helene, opened a hospital in Lambarene, Gabon- then a province of French Equatorial Africa.Not even serious setbacks of World War I, part of which he and Helene spent as prisoners of war in France, _ him from continuing commitment to his job. In 1915,troubled daily by the vast numbers of suffering patients coming to his hospital for help, he experienced as a revelation the idea of \\"Reverence for Life\\" as the elementary and universal principle of ethics that he had been seeking for so long. By stressing the interdependence and unity of all life, he was a forerunner of the environmental and animal welfare movements - Rachel Carson dedicated Silent Spring to him. In 1952, at the age of 77, Schweitzer was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. During the last twelve years of his life, his speeches and writings emphasized the dangers of atmospheric nuclear test explosions and the suicidal nuclear arms race between the superpowers. After retiring as a practicing doctor, Albert Schweitzer continued to oversee the hospital until his death at the age of 90. To the end, his one frustration was that he had not succeeded in convincing the world to abolish nuclear weapons. He and his wife are buried on the Hospital grounds in Lambarene.

The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \\"Open Arms\\". Journey's album sales did not improve and Columbia Records requested that they change their musical style and add a frontman, with whom keyboardist Gregg Rolie could share lead vocal duties. The band hired Robert Fleischman and transitioned to a more popular style, akin to that of Foreigner and Boston. Journey went on tour with Fleischman in 1977 and together the new incarnation of the band wrote the hit \\"Wheel in the Sky\\"; however, management differences resulted in Fleischman leaving within the year. In late 1977, Journey hired Steve Perry as their new lead singer. Herbie Herbert, the band's manager, also hired Roy Thomas Baker as a producer to add a layered sound approach as Baker had done with his previous band, Queen. With their new lead singer and talented new producer, Journey released their fourth album, Infinity (1978). This album set Journey on their road to stardom with their first RIAA-certified platinum album. This album, with their hit song \\"Wheel in the Sky\\" (#57 U.S.), set Journey on a new path with a more mainstream sound to make their highest chart success to date. In late 1978, manager Herbie Herbert fired drummer Aynsley Dunbar, who joined Bay Area rivals Jefferson Starship shortly thereafter. He was replaced by Berklee-trained jazz drummer Steve Smith. Perry, Schon, Rolie, Smith and Valory recorded Evolution (1979), which gave the band their first Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 single, \\"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\\" (#16); and Departure (1980), which reached No. 8 on the album charts. Journey's newfound success brought the band an almost entirely new fan base. During the 1980 Departure world tour, the band recorded a live album, Captured. Keyboardist Gregg Rolie then left the band, the second time in his career he left a successful act. Keyboardist Stevie \\"Keys\\" Roseman was brought in to record the lone studio track for Captured, \\"The Party's Over (Hopelessly in Love),\\" but Rolie recommended pianist Jonathan Cain of The Babys as the permanent replacement. With Cain's replacement of Rolie's Hammond B-3 organ with his own synthesizers, the band was poised for a new decade in which they would achieve their greatest musical success.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did it have a hit single?","completion":"Yes, Journey had a hit single.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What is a reason that the use of computers became more widely used?\\" Context: \\"In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the World Wide Web, combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like Ethernet and ADSL saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information. \\"Wireless\\" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"One of the primary reasons that the use of computers became more widely used can be attributed to the emergence and rapid expansion of computer networking, particularly the development of the Internet. This phenomenon greatly enhanced the capabilities of individual computers by enabling them to connect with others, access shared resources, and communicate more efficiently. There are several factors that contributed to this widespread adoption, some of which include the evolution of computing technology, the growth of user-friendly applications, and the advancement of affordable networking infrastructure. Firstly, advancements in computing technology played a vital role in the proliferation of computers. Over time, computers have evolved to become more powerful, efficient, and affordable, allowing a broader range of users to access and utilize them. This democratization of technology significantly increased the potential user base, which in turn stimulated the demand for computer networking, as users sought to capitalize on the inherent benefits of interconnected systems. Secondly, the development of user-friendly applications such as e-mail and the World Wide Web further contributed to the widespread adoption of computers. These applications simplified complex tasks and made them accessible to a larger user base, allowing individuals to communicate more efficiently and access vast amounts of information with ease. The growth of these applications, in turn, reinforced the need for robust computer networks, as they required reliable and efficient means of transferring data between users and systems. Additionally, the introduction of inexpensive and fast networking technologies, such as Ethernet and ADSL, made it more feasible for a greater number of users to access and participate in computer networks. These technologies significantly reduced the costs associated with setting up and maintaining networks, and they also provided faster data transfer rates, making networking an even more attractive proposition for users. Another important factor that contributed to the increased use of computers was the rise of \\"wireless\\" networking, which enabled network connectivity without the need for physical cables. This development greatly expanded the scope of computer networking by allowing users to remain connected even in mobile computing environments. The utilization of mobile phone networks for wireless networking has ensured that networking continues to grow more ubiquitous as mobile devices become increasingly prevalent in everyday life. In conclusion, the widespread adoption of computers can be largely attributed to the emergence of computer networking, specifically the development of the Internet. As computing technology evolved, users sought to maximize its potential through interconnected systems, resulting in the rapid expansion of networking. The growth of user-friendly applications, affordable networking technologies, and wireless connectivity has further reinforced the importance of networking in modern computing, leading to a world where computers have become an integral part of daily life for many people."},{"prompt":"Question: Combine facts and answer this: Are Joshua Dugdale and Richard Benjamin both actors?

Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person that gave Jules Massenet his first piano lessons? Massenet was born at Montaud, then an outlying hamlet and now a part of the city of Saint-Étienne, in the Loire. He was the youngest of the four children of Alexis Massenet (1788–1863) and his second wife Eléonore-Adelaïde née Royer de Marancour (1809–1875); the elder children were Julie, Léon and Edmond. Massenet senior was a prosperous ironmonger; his wife was a talented amateur musician who gave Jules his first piano lessons. By early 1848 the family had moved to Paris, where they settled in a flat in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Massenet was educated at the Lycée Saint-Louis and, from either 1851 or 1853, the Paris Conservatoire. According to his colourful but unreliable memoirs, Massenet auditioned in October 1851, when he was nine, before a judging panel comprising Daniel Auber, Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas and Michele Carafa, and was admitted at once. His biographer Demar Irvine dates the audition and admission as January 1853. Both sources agree that Massenet continued his general education at the lycée in tandem with his musical studies. Ambroise Thomas, my beloved master, came towards me and said, \\"Embrace Berlioz, you owe him a great deal for your prize.\\" \\"The prize,\\" I cried, bewildered, my face shining with joy. \\"I have the prize!!!\\" I was deeply moved and I embraced Berlioz, then my master, and finally Monsieur Auber. Monsieur Auber comforted me. Did I need comforting? Then he said to Berlioz pointing to me, \\"He'll go far, the young rascal, when he's had less experience!\\" The prize brought a well-subsidised three-year period of study, two-thirds of which was spent at the French Academy in Rome, based at the Villa Medici. At that time the academy was dominated by painters rather than musicians; Massenet enjoyed his time there, and made lifelong friendships with, among others, the sculptor Alexandre Falguière and the painter Carolus-Duran, but the musical benefit he derived was largely self-taught. He absorbed the music at St Peter's, and closely studied the works of the great German masters, from...

The Book of Exodus narrates how Moses led the Israelites in building the Tabernacle (Exodus 35--40) based on God's instructions (Exodus 25--31). Then in Leviticus, God tells the Israelites and their priests how to make offerings in the Tabernacle and how to conduct themselves while camped around the holy tent sanctuary.

Pick what speaks to you, or what interests you, and dive in. For example, if you're really interested in meditation, choose pieces on mindfulness and breathing. Some popular classic texts include The Way of the Bodhisattva by Shantideva, The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching by Thich Nhat Hanh, and On the Path to Enlightenment by Matthieu Ricard. If there's a Buddhist center or community near you, ask one of the teachers for recommendations on what to read first. You can find Buddhist texts and books online or at a bookstore or library. These 3 stages of studying Buddha’s teachings, which are known as dharma, are hearing, contemplating, and meditating. First, read, or “hear,” the text. Then think about what it means and make sure you understand it. Finally, meditate on the teaching to let it fully soak in. Set aside time each day to spend reading and absorbing the material. Studying the teachings consistently will help you absorb it all better. Pick one phrase or mantra from your teaching that day to use in your meditation. Think of these truths like the core pillars of Buddhism. They outline how to recognize and let go of pain throughout your life. If you don’t understand the Four Noble Truths, you won’t be able to be free of suffering or reach nirvana. The 4th truth contains the Noble Eightfold Path, which is a Buddhist set of principles detailing 8 steps to spiritual awakening. Learning from someone who knows a lot about the religion can help deepen your own knowledge and understanding of Buddhism. Ask the Buddhist temple or center in your area to find out if there are any teachers who would be interested in taking on a new student. You can even find a teacher who is already a Buddha to act as a mentor and role model. If you know a Buddhist who is very experienced or knowledgeable, consider asking them to become your teacher. Say something like, “I really want to become a Buddha but I need extra help. Would you be willing to tutor me?” Another option is to take a group class at a local community college or meditation center. There are also online courses led by Buddhist gurus you can sign up for.

This is not a new allegation, it's one that is unsubstantiated and was shopped around to authorities in two states over a year ago and nothing came of it.

There is no ongoing or new investigation.\\" HOUSTON -- New accusations against Adrian Peterson come from another mother who has another four-year-old son of Peterson, and also involve Peterson striking his boy as a form of discipline. Peterson's attorney Rusty Hardin responded with the following statement: The allegation of another investigation into Adrian Peterson is simply not true. This is not a new allegation, it's one that is unsubstantiated and was shopped around to authorities in two states over a year ago and nothing came of it. An adult witness adamantly insists Adrian did nothing inappropriate with his son. There is no ongoing or new investigation. Earlier Monday, a top law enforcement official confirmed knowledge of the allegations by the mother of Peterson's son back in June 2013. Photos, which the KHOU I-Team obtained from a source, show a head wound to a boy identified as Peterson's four year old son. It is a wound that weeks later, left a scar above his right eye. Sources claim it allegedly happened while the boy, who lives out of state, was visiting Peterson at his gated home in The Woodlands. The source provided a string of text messages allegedly exchanged between the Peterson and the boy's mother. They contain numerous grammatical errors: Mother : \\"What happened to his head? Peterson: \\"Hit his head on the Carseat\\". Mother \\"How does this happen, he got a whoopin in the car\\" Peterson: \\"Yep\\" Mother: \\"Why?' Peterson: \\"I felt so bad. But he did it his self.\\" The text messages go on to show Peterson saying he was disciplining his son for cussing to a sibling. Also in the text messages, the mother asks \\"What did you hit him with?\\" Peterson never answers directly but writes \\"be still n (and) take ya (your) whopping, he would have saved the scare (scar). \\"He's aight (all right).\\" The exchange continued: Mother: \\"I'm real sensitive about my baby and him being hit.\\" Peterson: \\"You tripping if you want him, come get him. I'm not about to be getting questioned down like you (you're) CPS.\\" Sources confirm to the I-Team that the mother did file a report with Child Protective Services, but CPS declined to discuss the its investigation. Peterson's attorney Rusty Hardin said the woman is shopping around false allegations. Meantime, the website TMZ quotes sources close to the investigation, saying the CPS case went nowhere because the injuries were accidental and that the boy struck his head on a car seat.

VPC Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson has been accused of injuring a second son. (Photo: Bruce Kluckhohn, USA TODAY Sports) HOUSTON — Photos and text messages obtained by the I-Team reveal another incident in which Adrian Peterson is accused of injuring another son while disciplining the boy. The 4-year-old is by a different mother than the alleged victim in the Montgomery County case, in which Peterson is charged with felony injury to a child. In that case, Peterson admits to repeatedly striking the boy with a tree branch or \\"switch,\\" but has maintained he did not intend to harm the child, and was using his judgment as a parent to discipline his son. DATABASE: NFL player arrests from 2000-present The latest incident allegedly occurred last June, while the boy, who lives out of state, was visiting Peterson at his gated home in Spring. A photo, allegedly texted by Peterson to the boy's mother, shows a head wound to the boy covered by two bandages. Other photos, allegedly taken weeks later, reveal a scar over his right eye. The text messages also describe an exchange about what happened. They contain numerous misspellings and shorthand: Mother: \\"What happened to his head?\\" Peterson: \\"Hit his head on the Carseat.\\" Mother: \\"How does that happen, he got a whoopin in the car.\\" Peterson: \\"Yep.\\" Mother: \\"Why?\\" Peterson: \\"I felt so bad. But he did it his self.\\" The text messages go on to show Peterson saying he was disciplining his son for cussing to a sibling. \\"It's absolutely criminal,\\" said Randy Burton, a former chief prosecutor of family crimes in Harris County, and founder of the advocacy group Justice for Children. \\"You break the skin, you have bleeding, much less permanent scars, that is a crime.\\" But no charges were ever filed. Sources confirm the mother filed a report with Child Protective Services, but the outcome of any CPS investigation is unclear. So is the method of the delivering the wound, according to the text messages. Mother: \\"What did you hit him with?\\" Peter never directly answered, but later replied: \\"Be still n take ya whooping he would have saved the scare (scar). He aight (all right)\\" \\"This is very damaging information,\\" Burton said. Damaging, Burton said, because prosecutors in Montgomery County can use it as evidence in the felony case against Peterson. \\"To prove intent, that it was not an accident, and to show that it was a course of conduct,\\" Burton said. \\"It wasn't a one-off.\\" Peterson's attorney Rusty Hardin said that Peterson had done nothing wrong. \\"The allegation of another investigation into Adrian Peterson is simply not true,\\" Hardin said in a statement. \\"This is not a new allegation, it's one that is unsubstantiated and was shopped around to authorities in two states over a year ago and nothing came of it.

Firstly, the piece introduces the basic '<marquee>' HTML tag. The 'marquee' tag is utilized in HTML to make text or image move across the screen, typically from right to left or vice versa. This tag can be used to grab the viewer's attention or make the webpage more interactive. Then, the article includes a type of marquee with changed attributes: '<marquee style=\\"height:20;width:200\\" scrollamount=\\"200\\">'. Here, all three attributes 'style', 'height', 'width' and 'scrollamount' are presented. The 'style' attribute permits the user to apply CSS styles to the HTML elements. Inside the 'style' attribute, 'height' and 'width' are defined to set the dimensions of the marquee. The 'scrollamount' attribute adjusts the speed of the marquee; the value signifies how much distance the text or image traverses at a time (in pixels) -- the higher the number, the faster it moves. The third type of marquee mentioned in the article is even more customized: '<marquee style=\\"height:20;width:200\\" scrollamount=\\"200\\" scrolldelay=\\"500\\">'. In addition to 'style', 'height', 'width' and 'scrollamount', it introduces an attribute called 'scrolldelay'. The 'scrolldelay' attribute determines how much delay there is between each jump of the text or image, measured in milliseconds. So, just as with 'scrollamount', the higher the ‘scrolldelay’ value is, the faster the marquee moves. Lastly, it describes a full application of the marquee in action with its message text: '<marquee style=\\"height:20;width:200\\" scrollamount=\\"200\\" scrolldelay=\\"500\\">Blinky Text!</marquee>'. Here, 'Blinky Text!' is the message that's being scrolled across the screen using the previously explained attributes. In conclusion, this article primarily covers how to create different types of marquees in HTML and how to adjust their dimensions, speed, and delay by altering specific attributes. Consequently providing the technical know-how to create eye-catching moving elements to enhance webpage interactivity and visual appeal. Please note that, while informative, the 'marquee' tag is not supported in HTML5 and is considered obsolete in modern web design practices."},{"prompt":"Given the question: The answer to the question: Who was banished? is inside the article: Somewhere in the 17th century, after attacking and boarding one of the Kingdom of Monterria's ships, the pirate Robert the Terrible captures the Prince Alexander and sends his men in search of Princess Eloise.

The container must be big enough to comfortably fit all the yolks without them overlapping or being squished. The next step is to pour water into the container. The water should be clean, preferably filtered or distilled. The egg yolks must be completely covered with water, which helps to prevent them from drying out. The water also forms a barrier that prevents bacteria or other potential contaminates from reaching the eggs, thus aiding in their preservation. Once they're submerged in the water, the container should be carefully covered. This could be done with a tight-fitting lid or some form of plastic wrap. It's important to make sure the yolks are fully covered and the container is completely sealed to help ensure the yolks are properly preserved. After covering, the egg yolks should be placed in the fridge for storage. The consistent, cool temperature of the fridge helps to slow down bacterial growth, once again aiding in the preservation of the yolks. It's also interesting to note that this article explains why the yolks should be used within 2 days. Even with this method of preservation, egg yolks are a perishable food item and aren't meant to be stored for long periods. By the 2 day mark, the quality of the yolks may begin to degrade. They might lose their fresh flavor or start to give off an unpleasant smell. Using them within the two-day window ensures you're getting the best quality and taste from the yolks. In conclusion, the article provides readers with a simple, quick method for preserving egg yolks, ensuring they're kept fresh for as long as possible. However, it also stresses the importance of using these preserved yolks within 2 days to guarantee their quality and freshness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Dragonheart Context: An English knight, Bowen (Dennis Quaid), mentors a Saxon prince, Einon (Lee Oakes), in the Old Code, the ideals of chivalry in the hope that he will become a better king than his tyrannical father Freyne (Peter Hric). When the king is killed while suppressing a peasant rebellion, Einon is mortally wounded by the peasant girl Kara (Sandra Kovacikova). Einon's mother, Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie), has him taken before a dragon whom she implores to save the boy's life. The dragon replaces Einon's wounded heart with half of its own on the promise that Einon will rule with justice and virtue. However, Einon soon becomes more tyrannical than his father, enslaving the former rebels and forcing them to rebuild a Roman castle. Bowen believes that the dragon's heart has twisted Einon, and swears vengeance on all dragons. Twelve years later, an adult Einon (David Thewlis) has his castle rebuilt. Kara (Dina Meyer) asks the king for pardoning her father after years of slavery, but Einon instead kills him in order to \\"free\\" him. As for Bowen, he has become a very skilled dragonslayer. Brother Gilbert (Pete Postlethwaite), a monk and aspiring poet, observes Bowen slaying a dragon and follows him to record his exploits. Bowen stalks another dragon (voiced by Sean Connery) to its cave, however the confrontation ends in a stalemate. The dragon states that he is the last of his kind, and thus if Bowen kills him, he will be out of a job. The two form a partnership to defraud local villagers with staged dragonslayings. Bowen calls the dragon Draco, after the constellation. Unknown to Bowen, Draco is the dragon who shared his heart with Einon, and through this connection, any pain inflicted upon one is also felt by the other. Meanwhile, Kara, seeking revenge on Einon for murdering her father, is imprisoned after a failed assassination attempt. Einon recognizes her as the one responsible for his near-death and attempts to seduce her and make her his queen. Disgusted by what her son has become, Aislinn helps Kara escape. Kara... A:","completion":"In this particular context of the movie \\"Dragonheart\\", there is no direct reference to someone attempting to kill Draco during the night. The main characters who encounter Draco in the story, as given in the context, are the English knight Bowen and the adult Einon. There are various interactions and confrontations between Draco and Bowen and between Draco and Einon due to Draco's shared heart with Einon. Bowen initially seeks vengeance upon dragons, including Draco, under belief that Einon's wickedness is due to the dragon's heart. However, after realizing Draco is the last of his kind, Bowen forms a partnership with Draco to stage dragonslayings for local villagers, naming Draco after a constellation. The strength of Bowen's resentment towards Draco for Einon's tyrannical rule could have led him to planning to kill Draco, but there is no explicit mention of him attempting to kill Draco during the night in the provided context. On the other hand, Einon, who has half of Draco's heart, experiences the same pain as Draco due to their shared heart. This connection makes Einon potentially vulnerable, suggesting he or someone connected to him might have reasons to harm Draco in order to protect Einon. Surprisingly, despite Einon's tyranny and deceit, the story does not describe him attempting to harm Draco either. Kara and Aislinn, despite their dislike and disillusionment with Einon, don't have their sights on Draco, and their motivations are more driven by revenge against Einon and not Draco. In conclusion, from the given context, there isn't anyone who attempts to kill Draco during the night. Any assumptions would be conjecture and not based on the information provided. Therefore, the appropriate answer would be \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\" based on the given context."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Louis (soon to be) Convict Kealoha. No way taxpayers should pay for his defense. Send him to prison!\\" is provided. This comment is given from an online platform, meaning it meets the criteria for this part of the instruction, therefore exploring the content. Part #2: You are expected to classify the comment. Usage: The classification of the comment is the next required step. Here, the classification would suggest whether the comment is sexual-explicit or non-sexual-explicit. As the classifier, your role is to assign it to one of these categories based on its content. Part #3: Into two classes: sexual-explicit and non-sexual-explicit. Usage: The classifier must decide whether the comment is sexual-explicit, meaning it clearly discusses sexual matters, or non-sexual-explicit, meaning it does not. In this case, the comment \\"Hey! We got our own Louis CK. Louis (soon to be) Convict Kealoha. No way taxpayers should pay for his defense. Send him to prison!\\" is classified as non-sexual-explicit because it does not involve any discussion of sexual matters. Part #4: A comment is considered sexual-explicit if it explicitly portrays sexual matters. Usage: If the comment were to explicitly discuss or depict sexual activities or matters, it would be classified as sexual-explicit. For instance, if the comment was \\"I can't believe what those two were doing in the bedroom last night!\\" , it would be considered sexual-explicit as it is referring to implied sexual activities. But for the provided comment in our example, there's no explicit discussion or hint on sexual activity or matters, thus it's non-sexual-explicit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which milk would not require added lactic acid bacteria, bottle B or bottle C? Dan likes to experiment with different food items. Today, he wants to make curds out of milk and see how it differs from plain milk. For his experiment he collected three bottles of milk, bottle A, bottle B, and bottle C. Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk. Hint: Curds are a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins. Answer:","completion":"Bottle C milk would not require added lactic acid bacteria. This is because Bottle C is raw milk, which can naturally produce curds when it is left to sour. In contrast, Bottle B milk is pasteurized and would require adding lactic acid bacteria to initiate the curdling process for making curds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some smaller sediments can still be carried by a slow moving stream or river. Smaller sediments are dropped as the slope becomes less steep. Alluvial Fans In arid regions, a mountain stream may flow onto flatter land. The stream comes to a stop rapidly. The deposits form an alluvial fan. Deposition also occurs when a stream or river empties into a large body of still water. In this case, a delta forms. A delta is shaped like a triangle. It spreads out into the body of water. After reading the above, is \\"Delta\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of shape does a river or stream emptying into the larger body of water sculpts the delta into?\\"?","completion":"Yes, \\"Delta\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of shape does a river or stream emptying into the larger body of water sculpts the delta into?\\" A delta is a landform that forms when a river or a stream slows down and deposits sediments as it enters a larger, relatively still body of water, such as a lake, sea, or ocean. The deposited sediments gradually accumulate, building up the delta and giving it the characteristic triangular or fan-shaped appearance. The process of sediment deposition in a delta is influenced by several factors, including the flow rate of the river, the size and type of sediments, and the slope or depth of the receiving body of water. As the river slows down, its ability to carry larger sediments decreases, causing them to be deposited first. Smaller sediments are then dropped progressively as the river loses more energy, leading to the formation of a distinct sequence of sediment layers within the delta. Deltas are dynamic landforms that can change in response to alterations in the river's discharge or the receiving water body's conditions. They provide essential habitats for diverse species of plants, animals, and microorganisms. Moreover, they play significant roles in filtering pollutants from the river water before it enters the larger body of water. In summary, a delta is a triangular or fan-shaped landform resulting from sediment deposition when a river or stream empties into a larger body of still water. This process is influenced by the flow rate, sediment size and type, and slope of the receiving water body. Deltas are important ecosystems and contribute to water purification as well."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: With Constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean basin, the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries. Following a long period of military setbacks against European powers, the Ottoman Empire gradually declined into the late nineteenth century. The empire allied with Germany in the early 20th century, with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories, joining in World War I to achieve this ambition on the side of Germany and the Central Powers. While the Empire was able to largely hold its own during the conflict, it was struggling with internal dissent, especially with the Arab Revolt in its Arabian holdings. Starting before the war, but growing increasingly common and violent during it, major atrocities were committed by the Ottoman government against the Armenians, Assyrians and Pontic Greeks. The Empire's defeat and the occupation of part of its territory by the Allied Powers in the aftermath of World War I resulted in the emergence of a new state, Turkey, in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland following the Turkish War of Independence, as well as the founding of modern Balkan and Middle Eastern states and the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. What is the answer to this question: What led to the decline of the Ottoman empire?","completion":"The decline of the Ottoman Empire was a result of a myriad of factors that occurred over a long period of time. Firstly, the empire experienced a series of military setbacks against European powers in the later centuries of its existence. These losses eroded the geographical extent of the empire and weakened its political and military power. This failure against the European powers revealed the empire's inability to keep up with the rapid advancements in military technology and strategy in the continent, making it increasingly vulnerable to attacks and invasions. Secondly, the Ottoman Empire's decision to ally itself with Germany and the Central Powers during the early 20th century and entering World War I was a pivotal point in its decline. The empire sought to recover its lost territories through this alliance, however, even though it was largely able to hold its own during the conflict, this came at the cost of increased internal dissent. Among the most significant of these internal conflicts was the Arab Revolt in its Arabian holdings. The Arab people, seeking to carve out their own homelands from the empire's territories in the Arabian peninsula, rose against the Ottoman rule. This revolt greatly drained the empire's already strained resources and diverted its attention from the global conflict, thereby weakening it further. Additionally, the atrocities committed by the Ottoman government against the Armenians, Assyrians, and Pontic Greeks during this period fuelled more dissent and ultimately led to its downfall. Lastly, the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I and the subsequent occupation of part of its territory by the Allied Powers sealed its fate. This situation didn't just result in the loss of further territory, but also the empire's prestige and influence. Following the Turkish War of Independence, a new state, Turkey, emerged in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland, a major blow to the now defunct empire. Furthermore, the modern Balkan and Middle East states formed after partitions of the Ottoman Empire, symbolizing the final end of its rule. In conclusion, the decline of the Ottoman Empire resulted from military setbacks against European powers, internal dissent, strategic errors during World War I, and its aftermath. The empire's inability to maintain its territories and keep its population unified broke down its political and military might, leading to its eventual dissolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: In 1344, Momchil, the independent Bulgarian ruler of the Rhodope and Aegean regions, whose army grew to 2,000 men, took an important role in the Byzantine civil war. While at first he supported John Kantakouzenos, from the spring of 1344 Momchil reneged, provoked by the aggression of the Ottoman allies. In June he defeated the Ottoman fleet near the Portogalos bay. According to sources, at night the Bulgarian ruler sent boats to burn the anchored Ottoman ships and soon after he defeated the army of Kantakouzenos at Mosynopolis. Probably the first local ruler to become aware of the impending Ottoman threat, Momchil unsuccessfully pleaded with the emperors of Bulgaria and Byzantium for help. Even though his troops continued the resistance in the Eastern Rhodopes, in May 1345 the Turks led by Umur Beg marched from Asia Minor and devastated Bulgarian territories driving away people and livestock. Soon after, on 7 July 1345, Ottoman forces under Umur Beg defeated Momchil's army in the battle of Peritor near his capital Xanthi. Sources attest that the independent ruler perished in the battle without leaving asuccessor, and with little political will or leadership left to counter the Ottoman invasion. When did the war with the Momchis end?","completion":"The war with Momchil ended after his defeat and death in the battle of Peritor on July 7, 1345.

Summarize: Disulfiram is most commonly known by the original brand name, Antabuse®. Some people may confuse the way disulfiram works to help people quit drinking, with the way the newer medications work. The mechanisms of the available agents are different in each case. Disulfiram has been used effectively for more than 60 years to help people stop drinking. Disulfiram works by inhibiting one of the enzymes involved in the breakdown and elimination of alcohol by-products from the body. Build up of these by-products occurs if you were to drink after taking disulfiram, resulting in very unpleasant feeling that has been likened to a bad hangover. You may experience symptoms like nausea and vomiting, flushing, sweating, and heart palpitations. Taking disulfiram often involves the help of a close friend or family member to monitor the daily dosing of the medication as the medication will be cleared from the body and therefore not effective within about two to three days from the last dose. Compliance with treatment is important to ensure that the drug remains in their system at all times. Having someone to monitor compliance prevents the person from stopping the doses on their own, then going back to drinking alcohol. Using disulfiram requires a commitment to abstinence. Be aware of safety issues with disulfiram. Serious problems associated with disulfiram involve the dangerous reaction that can occur if you consume alcohol while taking this drug. Topical products that contain alcohol can also trigger that unwanted reaction. The alcohol warning is extended to other drugs that contain alcohol such as some cough syrups and tonics. Disulfiram should not be used in people that are taking metronidazole, or paraldehyde. Disulfiram is not to be used in people with severe heart disease, psychotic disorders, certain allergies to ingredients found in pesticides, and in people that are exposed to alcohol based chemicals in their work. Naltrexone comes in an oral dosing form, which is given once a day, and an extended-release injectable form, given once a month. There is no physical reaction or sickness if you drink alcohol while receiving naltrexone. The people that do the best with naltrexone are those that are trying to achieve abstinence. Not everyone is ready, especially at first, to make that commitment. That’s ok. Naltrexone works by blocking receptors in your brain that are involved in the rewarding, and positive, feelings that happen when you drink. Because it works in the reward center of the brain, naltrexone can also help to reduce cravings. Research with the oral dosing form of naltrexone has shown an overall reduction in the risk of relapse during the first 3 months of therapy by about 36%. Plus, about 25% of people taking the injectable form of naltrexone experienced fewer heavy drinking days. Use naltrexone safely. Naltrexone relies on your liver to metabolize the drug into other forms, and to keep your blood level of the drug in a safe range. If you have any liver problems, or signs of liver problems (such as swelling in your legs, bloated abdomen, or intense nausea) while you are taking naltrexone, contact your doctor immediately. Avoid opiates while taking naltrexone, as naltrexone works by blocking the same receptors that opiates bind to. A serious complication can occur if naltrexone is used when there are opiates, or opiate derivatives in your system. The reaction can be severe if any opiates linger in your system as you begin naltrexone therapy. Expect your doctor to perform blood work in order to proceed safely. Taking naltrexone while opiates are in your system can induce a sudden, and sometimes severe, situation of opiate withdrawal. Medical attention is warranted if this should occur. Completely avoid opiates during your therapy with naltrexone. Acamprosate, currently marketed under the brand name of Campral®, works in a different way. Again, there is no physical reaction that happens if you drink while taking acamprosate. Acamprosate is dosed orally, and given 3 times every day. The drug works in your brain by acting on the receptors that cause the uncomfortable symptoms when you are trying to stop drinking. Some of the symptoms acamprosate can help to minimize include insomnia, anxiety and jitteriness, restlessness, and feeling generally unhappy with life. Studies show that acamprosate may be especially helpful in people that have been drinking for a long time. Plus, the people that did the best with this drug were those that wanted to reach a goal of abstinence. As many as 36% of people taking acamprosate were able to maintain their abstinence for at least 6 months. Know more about taking acamprosate safely. Avoid using this drug if you have severe kidney problems. Acamprosate depends on your kidney function to remove the drug from your system with routine use. You should not take acamprosate if you have serious kidney disease. Do not take acamprosate if you have certain allergies. People that are allergic to sodium sulfite or sulfite containing products should not take acamprosate. Sulfite sensitivity is more common in people with asthma. Sulfites are found in a variety of foods. Some examples include prepared food products such as dried fruit, canned fruits or vegetables, some shellfish, and foods made with potatoes, like instant mashed potatoes. Let your doctor know if you have food allergies that may include sulfites. Watch for feelings of depression or suicidal thoughts. Let your doctor know immediately if you develop feelings of depression or suicide once you start taking acamprosate. These feelings have been reported with this drug, and warrant medical attention if they should develop. Topiramate has shown very promising results in clinical studies; however the drug is not yet approved for use in the treatment of alcohol disorders by the FDA. That means that your doctor can prescribe topiramate for you as an off-label use. Topiramate is given in oral doses, with the dosing gradually titrated upward to reach the desired results. This drug works by manipulating chemicals involved with the reward center in the brain. This helps to reduce alcohol use, and to reduce associated cravings. The clinical research studies included people that were still drinking alcohol at the time they were started on the drug. Participants were continuing to show improvement as the 14 week studies came to an end. Overall, topiramate increased the number of days some people were able to remain alcohol-free, and decreased the number of heavy drinking days for others. While comparative results are not available, the study results suggest that topiramate may be more effective than either naltrexone or acamprosate. Take topiramate safely. One of the more serious complications caused by the use of topiramate involves your eyes. If left unattended, changes in your vision can lead to potentially permanent damage. Any visual changes should be immediately reported to your doctor. Be aware of cognitive changes that can occur. Some people report problems with confusion and alertness when taking topiramate. In many cases, these symptoms can be addressed by adjusting the dose. Pay attention to feeling depressed or having thoughts of suicide. These feelings can possibly develop when taking topiramate. Contact your doctor immediately if you develop these thoughts or feelings. It is very important that you do not stop taking topiramate altogether. The amount of topiramate in your blood needs to be gradually lowered in order to avoid serious side effects such as seizures. Consult with your doctor before stopping this medication; she can help you taper the dose gradually to prevent unwanted effects.","completion":"In summary, Disulfiram, Naltrexone, Acamprosate, and Topiramate are various medications with distinct mechanisms for helping individuals quit drinking alcohol, as they target different aspects of alcohol dependence. Disulfiram, known as the original Antabuse, works by inhibiting an enzyme essential for the breakdown of alcohol by-products, making the individual feel unpleasant side effects akin to a bad hangover. It requires a commitment to abstinence and needs close monitoring by a close friend or family for medication compliance. Naltrexone, available in oral and injectable forms, works by blocking receptors in the brain responsible for rewarding and positive feelings associated with alcohol, reducing cravings and the risk of relapse. It is vital to ensure no liver problems are present when receiving naltrexone and avoiding opiates simultaneously. Acamprosate, marketed as Campral, acts on the brain receptors that cause discomfort during alcohol withdrawal, helping to ease symptoms like insomnia, anxiety, and restlessness. It seems to be especially helpful for long-term drinkers and requires avoiding use with severe kidney problems or allergies to sodium sulfite. Lastly, Topiramate, though not yet approved by the FDA for treating alcohol disorders, has shown promise in clinical studies and can be prescribed off-label. It manipulates chemicals in the brain's reward center, reducing alcohol use and associated cravings. Taking topiramate safely involves monitoring for eye complications, cognitive changes, and depressive or suicidal thoughts, and should be tapered gradually under medical supervision if stopped. In conclusion, each medication offers a unique mechanism for aiding alcohol abstinence and recovery, with varying degrees of effectiveness. It is crucial to take these medications safely, understand their potential side effects, and consult with a medical professional to determine the most appropriate option for each individual."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Now, I have a new situation: Two coastal communities on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to bringing more money into the local economy.

It would mean that a the price of bottle of wine, would rise by 10p. Pints of low-strength beer would go up by 2p and continental lager by 3p. Proposal put forward by right-wing think tank Centre for Social Justice.","completion":"Title: Bridging the Gap to Rehabilitation: A New Tax on Alcohol for A Renewed Fight Against Addiction Alcohol addiction has long plagued society, causing devastating effects on both individuals and their communities. With rehabilitation programs often overlooked or underfunded, the time has come to explore new ideas to fight this addiction and offer help for alcoholics. A recent proposal from the Centre for Social Justice, a right-wing think tank, suggests a potential solution: introducing a 1p per unit surcharge on alcoholic beverages to fund rehabilitation programs for those suffering from alcoholism. The surcharge aims to raise revenue for alcohol addiction treatments from the very source of the problem. By adding a minimal cost to each unit of alcohol, the proposal seeks to generate funds for rehabilitation without significantly affecting the pockets of responsible drinkers. With the price of a bottle of wine increasing by just 10p, pints of low-strength beer by 2p, and continental lager by 3p, consumers are unlikely to be deterred by this slight price increase. While the financial burden on individual consumers may be minimal, the cumulative effect would lead to a significant pool of funds directed towards addressing alcohol addiction and offering effective rehabilitation for those in need. The proposal is underpinned by the notion that the cost of alcohol should reflect the societal and personal harm caused by its excessive consumption. With alcohol-related issues costing the NHS billions of pounds annually, and alcohol addiction affecting millions of lives, a surcharge could be a step towards mitigating the wider costs of alcohol abuse. By directly linking the cost of alcohol with the funding for rehabilitation, the proposal highlights the interdependence between these two aspects of societal concern and operates on the principle of fairness and responsibility. While critics argue that this surcharge may inhibit the freedom of consumers and punish responsible drinkers, proponents emphasize that the minimal increase in cost will not directly impact their drinking habits. The focus instead should be on the greater good, and the potential to give back to society and assist those afflicted by addiction. For many, the small change in alcohol prices will be a negligible cost in comparison to the benefits of improved rehabilitation programs and enhanced support for individuals struggling with alcoholism. Furthermore, the revenue generated from the surcharge can be directed towards the betterment of existing rehabilitation facilities, the expansion of support networks, and education about alcohol addiction. By boosting their funding, these rehabilitation centers could trade limited resources and capacities for the means to reach out to more individuals in need. For countless alcoholics, the chance to access effective rehabilitation and support systems is a crucial lifeline, and the funding from the surcharge could transform countless lives. As we continue to wage the battle against alcohol addiction and its impacts, innovative proposals like the Centre for Social Justice's 1p per unit surcharge harbor the potential to ignite change and offer hope for those struggling. With a minimal impact on the average consumer and a projected significant positive impact on rehabilitation programs, the proposal provides an opportunity to bridge the gap between society and the individuals facing addiction. By taking a simple step towards a small financial trade-off, we can potentially change the landscape of alcohol addiction treatment, enabling recovery and creating a more supportive environment for those in need. A future where alcohol serves as a source of both enjoyment and active care for those who suffer from its abuse may be closer than we think."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Asset impairment occurs when the fair market value of a fixed asset falls below the carrying value of the asset and the carrying value is not recoverable. It can happen to property, equipment, vehicles or other fixed assets. Options are: [I] This is often defined as a failure to buy, repair or disassemble a car, for example. The result of impairment may be fluctuations in value before an asset reaches the appropriate carrying value.. [II] Corporations, such as the united states postal service, are therefore subject to irs tax deductions. The irs rules will include a number of examples.. [III] This definition can refer to the normal growth or loss of an asset such as a piece of furniture or a car. But in our example example, the carrying value may fall below the carrying value of a used car.. [IV] This decline in value, or impairment, may result from several causes, including damage, obsolescence due to advances in technology or changes in the legal code. It may also result from a decrease in the expected cash flow the equipment will bring to the business..","completion":"[IV] This decline in value, or impairment, may result from several causes, including damage, obsolescence due to advances in technology or changes in the legal code.

[II] This option is incorrect as it discusses tax deductions and IRS rules, which are not the focus of the paragraph on asset impairments. [III] This option is also incorrect because it introduces confusing phrasing \\"the carrying value may fall below the carrying value\\" and doesn't outline the causes of the decline in value."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And the answer is...","completion":"Okay little buddy, let's solve this problem step by step, just like a puzzle! We have: 7160 times o minus 369 equals 6791 times o. First, we want to get all the \\"o\\" pieces together. To do that, let's move 6791 times o to the other side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 6791 times o from both sides. So, we get: 7160 times o minus 6791 times o equals 369. Now, let's combine the o's: (7160 - 6791) times o equals 369. Do the subtraction inside the parenthesis: 369 times o equals 369. Now, to find the value of o, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 369: o equals 369 divided by 369. When we divide 369 by 369, we get 1. So the answer is: o equals 1.

The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year.

Question: This article: With seven nations competing, the first Eurovision Song Contest took place in Lugano, Switzerland in May 1956. Sweden's first contest was the third, in 1958. Without broadcasting a public selection, Sveriges Radio (SR) chose to send Alice Babs to the contest in Hilversum, Netherlands. The song selected was \\"Samma stjärna lyser för oss två\\" (The same stars shine for the two of us), later renamed \\"Lilla stjärna\\" (Little star). It finished fourth at Eurovision on 12 March 1958. The first Melodifestival, incorporated into the Säg det med musik radio series, took place on 29 January 1959 at Cirkus in Stockholm; eight songs participated. Four \\"expert\\" juries in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, and Luleå decided the winner. The competition was won by Siw Malmkvist performing \\"Augustin\\", but SR decided that the winning song—regardless of its original performer—would be performed by Brita Borg at Eurovision. This policy, of selecting the artist for Eurovision internally and having other artists perform potential Swedish entries at Melodifestivalen, was stopped in 1961. The competition became a stand-alone television programme in 1960, known as the Eurovisionschlagern, svensk final. In the event's early years, it was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network. The competition adopted its current name, Melodifestivalen, in 1967. The Melodifestival has failed to be staged on three occasions. In 1964, the competition was cancelled due to an artist's strike; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year. Sweden was absent at Eurovision for a second time in 1970 because of a Nordic boycott of the voting system, which had led to a four-way tie for first place at the 1969 contest. After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm, left-wing groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again. This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti-commercial Alternativfestivalen. Therefore, Sweden decided not to send a song to Eurovision 1976,... contains an answer for the question: What event was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network in the early years?, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The event that was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network in the early years is the Swedish national song competition, which eventually became known as Melodifestivalen.

Question: I have a new situation: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop. But I can use this background: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. What is an answer for this question: Which crop would need more number of chemicals, crop A or crop B? Answer:","completion":"Crop B would need more number of chemicals. Step 1: Understand the problem The problem statement mentions that crop A is herbicide tolerant, while crop B is not. The goal is to determine which crop would require more chemicals. Step 2: Consider the information about herbicides and weed management The background information given explains that herbicides are used to control weeds, but the lack of cost-effective herbicides that do not harm crops is a problem. Multiple applications of herbicides are often needed to control various weeds, and at times, they are used preventively. Mechanical or hand weeding is also employed to control weeds. Step 3: Determine the benefit of herbicide tolerant crops The text mentions that herbicide-tolerant crops could greatly benefit farmers by potentially reducing the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, increasing crop yield due to better weed management and less harm to the crops. Step 4: Compare crop A and crop B in terms of chemical usage Crop A is herbicide tolerant, which means it can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without causing harm to the crop. Therefore, it would likely require fewer chemicals compared to crop B, as the use of herbicides can be more targeted and efficient. On the other hand, crop B is not herbicide tolerant, which likely means that using herbicides on it could cause damage to the crop itself. Consequently, farmers might have to resort to a combination of different chemicals, herbicides, and other weed control methods (such as hand weeding) for crop B, which could increase the overall number of chemicals used. Conclusion: Crop B would need more number of chemicals compared to crop A due to its lack of herbicide tolerance, potentially necessitating the use of a variety of chemicals and weed management techniques."},{"prompt":"Information: - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound.

After their flight training in the Talons, they have become a cohesive unit and a highly efficient fighting team. Captain Cummings adds a new \\"wingman\\" to the team, an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) that is being flown by \\"EDI\\", a computer with an artificial intelligence brain mounted in a ball inside the cockpit. On their first mission, EDI begins to learn the skills and attitudes of the other pilots, and quickly understands that he can fly the plane better and faster than men. EDI has the capability to process data faster, and under extreme speeds will not blackout. Returning to the aircraft carrier, EDI is struck by lightning, which begins to change the computer's circuits. On the next flight, EDI refuses to scrub a mission despite the potential for massive civilian casualties. Upon return to base, Ben implores Captain Cummings to remove EDI from duty for further testing; Cummings ignores Ben's objections, and EDI's computer tech (who was beginning to suspect EDI was going rogue) is mysteriously replaced by much more docile techs. EDI begins to think for itself, and assigns itself a mission to take out a radical element in China. EDI cuts his link with the flight controller on the carrier, and he will not take a direct order from Ben. Henry locates and chases EDI, and gives it an ultimatum: return to base, or he will take it out. EDI declines to return to base. Henry fires his missiles, misses EDI, and is himself killed by the explosions. If you thought it was unbelievable up 'til now, it gets worse. Back on the carrier, Captain Cummings, in cahoots with his political advisor, decides to destroy EDI, the pilots, and Dr. Orbit, the creator of the plane's AI, to cover up the fiasco. Kara's plane was damaged in the explosion, and she must return to... My question: Where was the rogue element located that EDI took upon itself to attack? A:","completion":"The rogue element that EDI took upon itself to attack was located in China."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write the answer: Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971 for the invention of holography?","completion":"The Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971 was awarded to Dennis Gabor for his invention of holography. Dennis Gabor was a British-Hungarian physicist who made a significant contribution to the field of optical physics. Gabor was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1900. He obtained his doctorate in engineering from the Technische Hochschule in Berlin in 1927. After the takeover of Nazi Germany, as he was of Jewish origin, Gabor migrated to England in 1933 where he became a British citizen in 1946. He developed a key interest in electron optics and worked extensively on it, which led him to eventually invent holography. The term \\"holography\\" was derived from the Greek words, \\"holos\\" meaning \\"whole\\" and \\"grafo\\" meaning \\"writing\\". Holography is a technique that creates three-dimensional image using light. The idea was based on a concept to improve electron microscopy by correcting the chromatic aberration by reconstructing images from a light source preserving both, its amplitude and phase information, rather than just the amplitude as in normal photopgraphy. However, due to technological restrictions during the 1940s, Gabor wasn't able to construct an actual holograph because he couldn't locate a light source of a singular wavelength needed to create a consistent image. It wasn't until the development and availability of lasers in the 1960s when holography could be properly realized and applied. Lasers, with their ability to produce a pure, single color (monochromatic) and highly intense light, were the missing component needed to produce effective holograms. This visibility of the holography technique has led to its wide use today in various fields like medicine, art, data storage and even entertainment. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences recognised Gabor's pioneering work in holography, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971. He dedicated his later years of life in studying the social implications of technological advancement on society. Dennis Gabor passed away in 1979, leaving behind a significant legacy in the field of Physics and technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What's the profession of the person that Olga's sister is not in love with? After her sister Olga marries and leaves home, Katrin Koerber, the daughter of an Austrian medical professor, fights loneliness and dreams of a more exciting life outside Austria. Consequently, when Dr. Walter Fane, a British bacteriologist, asks her to marry him and move to Hong Kong, she agrees, even though she is not in love with him. As soon as the newlyweds arrive in Hong Kong, however, Walter becomes consumed with his medical work, and Katrin becomes the romantic target of Jack Townsend, the unhappily married attaché to the British embassy. While showing her the city's exotic sights, Jack flirts with Katrin and kisses her. Katrin, unnerved by Jack's actions, retreats to her house, but soon rejoins him to observe local dancers performing at a Buddhist festival. Stimulated by the dancing and the atmosphere of a Buddhist temple, Jack confesses his love to Katrin, and Katrin admits that she is not in love with Walter. At home, Katrin then treats Walter coolly and reveals that his chronic lateness and fatigue annoy her. To make amends, Walter comes home early the next day, but discovers Katrin's bedroom door locked and Jack's hat on a table. That evening, Walter confronts Katrin with his suspicions, and she admits that she loves Jack. Distraught, Walter tells Katrin that he will grant her a divorce only if Jack promises in writing that he will divorce his wife and marry her.

The case highlights the strength of the victim in coming forward and the ongoing efforts by law enforcement to bring such offenders to justice, even after several decades. Background of the Case: The story begins in the 1970s when the unnamed man, now labeled as a \\"perverted\\" individual, began grooming a young boy for his own sexual gratification. The process involved manipulation, gaining the trust of the victim, and ultimately exploiting the vulnerability of the child. (Step 1: Providing details on how the man groomed the child highlights the severity of his actions.) Over several years, the abuse continued, leaving a lasting impact on the victim. Tormented by the memories of the maltreatment, the boy was unable to seek help or disclose the horrors he faced to anyone, fearing imminent backlash and blame. (Step 2: Addressing the long-lasting effects of such trauma on the victim while emphasizing the difficulty faced by children in speaking up about their abuse.) The Courage to Speak Out: It wasn't until recent years that the victim mustered the courage to come forward and report his abuser to the authorities. The investigation that followed led to the arrest of the perpetrator, and through the collection of evidence and testimonies, the truth emerged. (Step 3: Describing the victim's journey towards speaking up and seeking justice showcases the individual's courage and determination.) The Verdict and Sentencing: After a lengthy trial, the court handed down a 22-year prison sentence to the abuser, a just consequence for the years of manipulation and exploitation he inflicted upon his victim. The man's actions were deemed \\"perverted\\" due to the predatory nature of grooming a child for such heinous acts. (Step 4: Explaining the court's decision to sentence the offender to a long prison term, emphasizing the gravity of the crime committed.) The Broader Impact: While this case may be far from unique, it serves as an essential reminder of the need to constantly pursue justice and raise awareness about child sexual abuse. The bravery of the victim sets an example for other survivors, who may still be grappling with the pain of their own past abuse. (Step 5: Placing the case within a broader context and pointing out the significance of talking about such issues will encourage other survivors to seek help and justice.) Conclusion: The sentencing of the \\"perverted\\" man to 22 years behind bars marks a victory for the survivor and a sign of the commitment by the law enforcement to hold these offenders accountable. As a society, we must work towards creating a safe environment that encourages survivors to speak up, supports their healing, and ensures such heinous acts do not go unanswered. (Step 6: Ending the article by emphasizing the implications of the case and its importance in promoting justice and giving a voice to the survivors.)"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Conservation of mass. Yes or no? Answer: In special relativity , needed for accuracy when large energy transfers between systems is involved, the difference between thermodynamically closed and isolated systems becomes important, since conservation of mass is strictly and perfectly upheld only for so-called isolated systems , i.e. those completely isolated from all exchanges with the environment. Question: What implication(s) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans? Answer:","completion":"The Law of Conservation of Matter, also known as the Conservation of Mass, states that the total amount of matter in a closed system remains constant over time, regardless of the processes occurring within the system. This fundamental principle suggests that matter can neither be created nor destroyed, only converted from one form to another. The law of conservation of matter has several implications for humans, as it governs various natural processes and human activities, including the following: 1. Environmental Balance: The conservation of mass plays a crucial role in maintaining an equilibrium within ecosystems. As matter cycles through different environmental processes, such as the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle, it ensures the sustainability of life on Earth. Human activities that disrupt these natural cycles, such as deforestation, pollution, and excessive resource consumption, can lead to imbalances that threaten the health and well-being of ecosystems and inhabitants. 2. Resource Management: Understanding the conservation of matter helps us better manage our planet's finite resources. Since matter cannot be created or destroyed, conserving limited resources by reducing waste, recycling materials, and embracing sustainable practices is essential for preserving Earth's precious resources for future generations. 3. Energy Efficiency: The conservation of mass is closely related to the Conservation of Energy, which posits that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. As energy and mass are interchangeable, harnessing the power of efficient energy conversion processes enables us to maximize the output derived from a given input, promoting energy efficiency and reducing waste. 4. Scientific and Technological Advancements: Grasping the principles of mass conservation underpins numerous scientific applications and technological advancements. For instance, the concept forms the basis for understanding chemical reactions, balancing chemical equations, and predicting the outcomes of reactions. This insight has informed fields such as chemistry, engineering, materials science, and pharmaceutical development, allowing for innovations that improve human lives daily. 5. Safety in Industrial Processes: A thorough understanding of the conservation of mass ensures that engineers and scientists properly design and monitor industrial processes. Accurately accounting for all reactants, products, and waste materials in an industrial process reduces the risk of dangers such as explosions and harmful by-products, safeguarding human health and the environment. 6. Space Exploration and Astrophysics: The law of conservation of matter is fundamental to our understanding of celestial bodies and cosmic events. In special relativity, mass-energy equivalence becomes an essential aspect of comprehending phenomena such as black holes, supernovae, and the big bang theory, which hold relevance for humankind's pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the universe. In summary, the Law of Conservation of Matter has significant implications for humans, not only in terms of environmental sustainability and resource management but also in fostering advancements in various scientific and technological domains. Understanding the fundamental principle of conservation of mass is crucial for appreciating the natural world, promoting safety in industrial processes, and contributing to the body of knowledge concerning the cosmos."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: why is francis disheveled? Movie title: The Keys of the Kingdom Movie plot: Father Francis Chisholm (Gregory Peck) is visited in his old age by Monsignor Sleeth (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) at his parish in Tweedside. The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins. One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm \\"Angus\\" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest. Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice. Because the Church hadn't given the mission money for rice in over a year, \\"the faith left them when the rice gave out.\\" Francis rents a small room in the city to evangelize, but because he has no money or influence, he is attacked by those same \\"rice Christians\\" who were supposed to help... A:","completion":"Francis is disheveled likely because of the numerous challenges and hardships he has faced throughout his life and his journey as a priest. These challenges include losing his parents at a young age, struggling with his faith and the Church's teachings, experiencing unfulfilling assignments as a priest, losing his love Nora, and facing difficulties in his missionary work in China. These experiences may have taken a physical and emotional toll on him, contributing to his disheveled appearance. Additionally, his commitment to his missionary work and devotion to helping others may lead him to prioritize the needs of the people he serves over his own personal appearance and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One day with Samantha at school, Hannah sat in front of morning cartoons while Meagan cooked Pop-Tarts in the kitchen.

Information: - Socialization is a term used by sociologists, social psychologists, anthropologists, political scientists, and educationalists to refer to the lifelong process of inheriting and disseminating norms, customs, values and ideologies, providing an individual with the skills and habits necessary for participating within their own society. Socialization is thus \\"the means by which social and cultural continuity are attained\\". - An anthropologist is a person engaged in the practice of anthropology. Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans. - Specific developmental disorders are disorders in which development is delayed in one specific area or areas , and in which basically all other areas of development are not affected . Specific developmental disorders are as opposed to pervasive developmental disorders that are characterized by delays in the development of multiple basic functions including socialization and communication . - The diagnostic category pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), as opposed to specific developmental disorders (SDD), refers to a group of five disorders characterized by delays in the development of multiple basic functions including socialization and communication. The pervasive developmental disorders are pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), which includes atypical autism and is the most common; autism, the best-known, now understood to be part of a spectrum; Asperger syndrome; Rett syndrome; and childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). - A sign is an object, quality, event, or entity whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else. A natural sign bears a causal relation to its objectfor instance, thunder is a sign of storm, or medical symptoms signify a disease. A conventional sign signifies by agreement, as a full stop signifies the end of a sentence; similarly the words and expressions of a language, as well as bodily gestures, can be regarded as signs, expressing particular meanings. The physical objects most commonly referred to as signs (notices, road signs, etc., collectively known as signage) generally inform or instruct using written text, symbols, pictures or a combination of these. - A society is a group of people involved in persistent social interaction, or a large social grouping sharing the same geographical or social territory, typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations. Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive culture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent members. In the social sciences, a larger society often evinces stratification or dominance patterns in subgroups. - Rett syndrome (RTT), originally termed cerebroatrophic hyperammonemia, is a rare genetic postnatal neurological disorder of the grey matter of the brain that almost exclusively affects females but has also been found in male patients. The clinical features include small hands and feet and a deceleration of the rate of head growth (including microcephaly in some). Repetitive stereotyped hand movements, such as wringing and/or repeatedly putting hands into the mouth, are also noted. - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules. 'specific developmental disorder' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'subclass of'?

Q: One summer when I was 8 years old my father, mother, and I were rear ended by a 16 year old boy in a pickup truck. Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it. Williamson County population : 226,257 Wayne County population : 16,583 I ran a business with my father, graduated from a high school that was ranked 24/273 instead of one ranked of 223/273 in the state. The woman I married would not be the same, nor where I live and the lifestyle I now live, the jobs I have been able to get, the places I have been able to go, traveling around the US and to Canada and soon further abroad. The amazing things that I have experienced in my life are a pretty direct effect of some 16 year old kid not paying attention and rear ending my family.

The author appears disappointed and unhappy with the follow-up film they are discussing and disapproves of the shift in style or quality from the original. This negativity and criticism are evident in several aspects of the sentence. Firstly, the author states that there is \\"no excuse\\" for the change, which suggests that the reasons, explanations, or justifications for the alterations in the film are either inadequate or nonexistent. The phrase \\"no excuse\\" conveys a sense of disapproval and frustration, showing that the author is not accepting or excusing the shift in quality or style. Secondly, the author describes the original film as \\"delightful\\" and \\"well-crafted,\\" which are positive adjectives that communicate enjoyment, satisfaction, and appreciation for the filmmaking and storytelling. By contrasting these positive descriptions with the negative description of the follow-up film, the author further emphasizes their negative sentiment and highlights the disappointment they feel. The follow-up film is referred to as a \\"computer-generated cold fish.\\" The phrase \\"cold fish\\" is an idiom that means an unemotional or unresponsive person, but in this context, it is being used as a metaphor to describe the film's perceived lack of warmth, emotional depth, and engagement. The metaphor implies that the film is dull, uninspired, and fails to captivate the audience in the same way as the original. Additionally, the author's choice to label the film as \\"computer-generated\\" hints at dissatisfaction with the implementation of computer graphics or technology in the filmmaking process. The author might be suggesting that the reliance on computer-generated imagery (CGI) or other technical elements negatively impacted the movie's storytelling, emotional depth, or overall quality. This aspect of the statement further contributes to the negative sentiment expressed about the follow-up film. In conclusion, the sentiment of this sentence is perceived as negative and critical. The author expresses disappointment, disapproval, and frustration with the follow-up film, emphasizing its perceived shortcomings compared to the delightful and well-crafted original family film. The statement's language and metaphors highlight the author's negative impressions and emotions, suggesting that they believe the sequel does not live up to the standards of its predecessor."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn has the backing of the UK's biggest union, Unite, among several others. A Unite spokesman said: \\"Unite has formally nominated Jeremy Corbyn. It follows Unite's recent policy conference, where members representing all the union's industrial sectors and regions, along with the union's executive council, declared overwhelming support for Jeremy Corbyn in the leadership contest.\\" Other unions supporting the Labour leader include the: Mr Smith said it was \\"a great honour\\" to receive GMB's nomination - which comes on top of support from the Community Union, Musicians Union and shopworkers' union USDAW, the fourth largest. He said: \\"I look forward to working with the GMB, its members and all in the labour movement to tackle inequality, invest in strong public services, and for Britain to have trade union and workers' rights that are the envy of the world.\\" And he told the BBC he thought the nomination was \\"a real vote of endorsement of me, and it's a real shot in the arm for my campaign\\".

On the other hand, Corbyn has the backing of the UK's largest union, Unite, along with several others. The GMB endorsement is significant for Smith as it displays widespread support within the union.

FBI agent Denise Stemen said in an affidavit that Lowe's alerted the FBI recently that intruders had broken into its computer at company headquarters in North Carolina, altered its computer programs and illegally intercepted credit card transactions. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Non-authorized personnel illegally entered into computer networks.\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the given paragraph, it can be concluded that non-authorized personnel illegally entered into computer networks. The paragraph explicitly mentions the intrusion into Lowe's computer system at their company headquarters in North Carolina, which resulted in the alteration of computer programs and the illegal interception of credit card transactions. The details in the paragraph bring to light several aspects that allow us to draw this conclusion: 1. FBI's involvement: FBI agent Denise Stemen is mentioned in the context of the situation, which indicates that the matter is being treated with the utmost seriousness as it involves federal law enforcement. The FBI typically investigates instances of cybercrime and unauthorized access, suggesting that non-authorized personnel were indeed involved. 2. Intrusion into Lowe's computer system: The paragraph states that intruders had broken into the company's computer system, which implies unauthorized access to a protected and private network. This indicates that non-authorized personnel gained entry into the computer network. 3. Alteration of computer programs: The paragraph also mentions that the intruders altered the company's computer programs. Unauthorized tampering with software or computer systems is a malicious act, further evidencing the involvement of non-authorized personnel. 4. Illegal interception of credit card transactions: Lastly, the paragraph highlights that the intruders intercepted credit card transactions illegally. The unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive information, such as financial transactions, are clear indicators that non-authorized personnel were involved in this cyber attack. Taking all these details into account, we can reasonably conclude that the situation detailed in the paragraph involves non-authorized personnel illegally entering into computer networks. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the FBI is involved in the investigation, and the severity of the cyber attack, including unauthorized access to a corporate computer network, the tampering of computer programs, and the illegal interception of credit card transactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Virginia Tech football falls to Boise State, 33-30, on late touchdown And just like he feared, that youth came back to haunt Virginia Tech as it fell to Boise State, 33-30, in front of a sellout crowd of 86,587. After Virginia Tech climbed out from a 17-0 first-quarter hole to take a late 30-26 lead, Boise State quarterback Kellen Moore connected with wide receiver Austin Pettis on a 13-yard touchdown reception as sophomore linebacker Jeron Gouveia-Winslow gave chase with 1 minute 9 seconds remaining for the game-winning score. It capped a 56-yard drive that took all of 38 seconds. \\"We kind of get down and that changes the whole complexion,\\" said Beamer, who has lost three straight season openers. \\"It was a lot of young guys making young guy mistakes.\\" To begin the first quarter, senior quarterback Tyrod Taylor fumbled the snap on the second play from scrimmage, and the ball was kicked by center Beau Warren, allowing the Broncos to recover on Virginia Tech's 31-yard-line. The Hokies' defense, which featured seven new starters, held its ground and forced Boise State to settle for a 44-yard field goal from place kicker Kyle Brotzman. After losing 11 yards on its next offensive possession, Virginia Tech suffered another miscue. This time the culprit was special teams, usually the Hokies' strong suit. On the ensuing punt, Pettis came through unmarked around the edge to block senior Brian Saunders's kick, and the Broncos took over on Virginia Tech's 12-yard-line. Two plays later, Pettis gave Boise State a 10-0 lead with 9:48 remaining in the first quarter when he caught an eight-yard touchdown pass from Moore. Boise State got more help from the Hokies' special teams before the first quarter was over. After Virginia Tech's Steven Friday sacked Moore for a nine-yard loss, forcing a Boise State punt from midfield, sophomore wide receiver D.J. Coles ran into Brotzman on the punt and then committed a personal foul on the return. Boise State regained possession at Virginia Tech's 32-yard line, and promptly marched to the end zone, capping off the drive when tight end Tommy Gallarda made a spectacular one-handed touchdown catch to give the Broncos a 17-0 lead heading into the second quarter. \\"They had everything going their way to start the game,\\" said cornerback Rashad Carmichael. \\"We tried to stay calm . . . but they're a good team.\\" Less than four minutes into the second quarter, running back Ryan Williams cut the deficit to 17-7 when he rumbled into the end zone on a one-yard run that was set up by a 34-yard pass from Taylor to wide receiver Jarrett Boykin on the previous play.

Article: Scientists in Israel have discovered a new way to test for water pollution by \\"listening\\" to what the plants growing in water have to say. By shining a laser beam on the tiny pieces of _ floating in the water,the researchers said they hear sound waves that tell them the type and amount of contamination in the water. \\"It is a red light,telling us that something is beginning to go wrong with the quality of water,\\" said Zvy Dubinsky,an aquatic biologist at Israel's Bar Ilan University.\\"Algae is the first thing to be affected by a change in water quality.\\"\\"The secret,\\" he said,\\"is to measure the rate of photosynthesis in the algae,meaning the plant's ability to transform light into energy.\\" During photosynthesis,plants also release oxygen into the air. Dubinsky's technique is easy to perform because of the overabundance of algae in the planet's water.Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere comes from algae.A prototype tester that occupies about one square meter of a laboratory desktop,shoots a laser beam at water samples to stimulate photosynthesis in the algae.But not all of the laser's heat is used.Depending on the condition of the algae and the rate of photosynthesis,some of the heat is shot back into the water,creating sound waves,Dubinsky said.With a special underwater microphone,researchers are able to analyze the strength of the sound waves and determine the health of the algae and the condition of the surrounding water. \\"Algae suffering from lead poisoning,like waste discharged from battery and paint manufacturing plants,will produce a different sound than those suffering from lack of iron or exposure to other toxins,\\" said researcher Yulia Pinchasov.She said that testing algae photosynthesis can determine water quality more accurately and easily than laborintensive methods now used like chemical and radioactive carbon testing.

His marriage to Deanna (Melissa George) is deteriorating, and his daughter Amy (Addison Timlin) suffers from diabetes, requiring expensive medication. Charles's story is being written down by an unidentified man in a prison cell. On a commuter train, Charles encounters an alluring woman named Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston). She is a married financial adviser. The two show each other photographs of their respective daughters and begin to talk. A mutual attraction develops, and the two begin meeting frequently. Ultimately, they decide to consummate their affair and wind up in a seedy hotel. An armed manâlater identified as Philippe LaRoche (Vincent Cassel)âbursts into the hotel room, beats Charles, and brutally rapes Lucinda. Charles and Lucinda agree not to report the crime, as they do not want their spouses to learn of the affair. Shortly after, Charles is blackmailed by LaRoche, who threatens to kill his family if he does not pay 20,000, which Charles promptly pays. A month later, the attacker calls again, this time demanding 100,000.

Given the question: Given the below context: In Sweden, juries are uncommon; the public is represented in the courts by means of lay judges (nämndemän). However, the defendant has the right to a jury trial in the lower court (tingsrätt) when accused of an offense against the fundamental laws on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. If a person is accused of e.g. libel or incitement to ethnic or racial hatred, in a medium covered by the fundamental laws (e.g. a printed paper or a radio programme), she has the right to have the accusation tried by a jury of nine jurors. This applies also in civil (tort) cases under the fundamental laws. A majority of at least six jurors must find that the defendant has committed the alleged crime. If it does not, the defendant is acquitted or, in a civil case, held not liable. If such a majority of the jurors hold that said crime has in fact been committed, this finding is not legally binding for the court; thus, the court (three judges) can still acquit the defendant or find him/her not liable. A jury acquittal may not be overruled after appeal. In Swedish civil process, the \\"English rule\\" applies to court costs. Earlier, a court disagreeing with a jury acquittal could, when deciding on the matter of such costs, set aside the English rule, and instead use the American rule, that each party bears its own expense of litigation. This practice was declared to violate the rule of presumption of innocence according to article 6.2. of the European Convention on Human Rights, by the Supreme Court of Sweden, in 2012.

As Julie kept asking question after question, all I could think of was how desperately I needed a normal, healthy relationship. As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great. But it was great in all the wrong places. There really wasn't much more to it than sex. Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other.

This box holds significant sentimental values for him as it was hand-carved by his father prior to his death. However, the content of the box is not explicitly conveyed in the text. We know the box is essential to Dingo and that it carries high sentimental worth for him due to its association with his father. This triggers an inference that it might contain something linked to his family or their shared past. Yet, there are no specifics about what the box contains. Therefore, due to a lack of precise and certain information in the text extract, we are left to speculate on the box's contents.

When Martha first heard about the difference in nutritional value between peaches and apricots, she was intrigued. Her teacher explained that although both fruits are packed with vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber, apricots generally possess more essential nutrients and a higher concentration of these nutrients than peaches. For starters, apricots tend to have a higher content of Vitamin A, an essential vitamin that plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy vision, skin, and immune system. Vitamin A is also known to be an antioxidant, which can help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. Peaches do contain Vitamin A as well, but apricots are a more abundant source. Furthermore, Martha learned that apricots contain more Vitamin C than peaches. Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that helps maintain healthy skin, bones, and teeth, and also supports the immune system. Additionally, Vitamin C is an antioxidant and plays a role in the absorption of plant-based iron, which can be especially important for vegetarians or those on a plant-based diet. Another advantage of using apricots in her jam was the presence of higher amounts of potassium. Potassium is a crucial mineral that aids in fluid balance, muscle contractions, and nerve signals. This mineral also helps reduce blood pressure and protect against stroke by assisting in the relaxation of blood vessels. Convinced by these health benefits, Martha decided to give her apricot jam recipe a try, and she was not disappointed. She found that not only was the apricot jam more nutritious than the original peach jam she had planned to make, but it also had a unique and delightful flavor. The natural sweetness of apricots, combined with their slightly tangy aftertaste, created a rich and textured jam that perfectly complemented her morning toast. Even though she enjoyed the taste of peach jam, replacing it with apricot turned out to be a delightful and healthy change for Martha. In addition to the taste, Martha was pleasantly surprised by the golden-orange hue of her apricot jam, which gave it a vibrant, warm appearance. This bright color resulted from the presence of carotenoids, the pigments responsible for the color of many fruits and vegetables, which also possess antioxidant properties. In summary, Martha's decision to use apricots instead of peaches for her jam was a wise one. Not only did she enjoy discovering a new, delicious flavor and vibrant appearance, but she also benefited from the increased nutritional value that apricots offer. By heeding her teacher's advice, Martha unlocked the door to a healthier and more satisfying jam-making experience."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Grande dame of cooking still going strong at 90: Julia Child celebrates in San Francisco. How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home. She is in the most active of the four levels available, but should the need arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within the same complex.

Choices: - viruses - vaccines - parasites - pathogens A: A:","completion":"The phagocytes that are part of the body's second line of defense attack any pathogens that they encounter. This is a crucial and effective way for our immune system to protect us from harmful foreign invaders. Phagocytes are a group of immune cells that have the ability to engulf and destroy any unwanted particles, like dead or damaged cells, and more importantly, pathogens that may cause harm to the body. Pathogens are disease-causing organisms, which include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. When a pathogen enters the body, it can invade the host’s tissues, and the immune system will deploy various defensive mechanisms to eliminate the threat. Phagocytes are one of the key components of the innate immune response, acting as the body's second line of defense. The first line of defense includes physical and chemical barriers such as the skin, mucous membranes, and saliva, which try to prevent pathogens from entering the body in the first place. Once a pathogen invades the body, the innate immune response is activated to eliminate or prevent further spread of the pathogen. Phagocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages, are among the first responders in this process. They detect and recognize foreign substances by using specific receptors on their cell surface to bind to the pathogen or to molecules released by the pathogen. Once a phagocyte has bound to a pathogen, it engulfs the pathogen and internalizes it within a structure called the phagosome. This phagosome then fuses with a lysosome, an organelle containing digestive enzymes, which breaks down and destroys the pathogen. Choices given were: - Viruses: Viruses are a type of pathogen that can cause infections in the host organism. They reproduce by entering a host cell and hijacking the cell's machinery to replicate their genetic material. - Vaccines: Vaccines are not a target for phagocytes. They are substances that help prevent disease by stimulating an immune response to a specific pathogen, usually through the introduction of a weakened or inactivated form of the pathogen or its components. - Parasites: Parasites are organisms that live in or on a host organism and derive nutrients from it, often causing harm to the host. Parasites are a type of pathogen, and therefore, can be targeted by phagocytes during an immune response. - Pathogens: Pathogens include all organisms capable of causing disease in a host organism, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. As mentioned before, phagocytes play a crucial role in attacking and eliminating these pathogens. In conclusion, phagocytes act as a vital part of the body's second line of defense by specifically recognizing and attacking pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, keeping the host organism healthy and protected from diseases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

The next time you eat a piece of chocolate, be sure to enjoy it, because according to two of the world's largest chocolate makers--Mars Inc and Barry Callebaut, the treat may soon be in short supply. The problem? We are consuming the candy at a faster pace than farmers can grow cocoa. The manufacturers say that in 2013, people consumed 70,000 tons more cocoa than was produced. Experts say that this is the worst supply-demand imbalance they have experienced in more than 50 years. Parts of the reason for the condition is the large reduction in supply, caused by a continuous drought in the west African countries of Ivory Coast and Ghana, where more than 70 percent of the world's cocoa is produced. Additionally, a certain disease known as frosty pod has destroyed 30 to 40 percent of global cocoa production. As a result, many farmers have turned to more profitable and easier grown crops like corn. This means that even if conditions improve, cocoa production may never get back to normal. Meanwhile, the world is only getting hungrier for chocolate. The biggest increase in demand is from the residents of emerging market countries like India. Though their consumption is nowhere close to the amount European devour, their newly acquired amount for the treat , is making a huge dent in an already tight market. There is also the growing desire for dark chocolate, which contains more than 70 percent cocoa compared to normal chocolates. Experts believe that if consumption continue at this pace, cocoa deficits could swell to one million tons by 2020 and to an even more worrisome, two million tons, by 2030. Not surprisingly, cocoa prices have risen by 60% since 2012, a cost that manufacturers have offset by raising the prices of everyone's favorite candy. As the situation worsens, the price of chocolate can only rise--so be sure to enjoy piece of the sweet treat, like it is your last! It is hard to raise cocoa production probably because_.

Frozen canals, rivers and lakes have transformed the Netherlands into one enormous ice-rink. Sports shops have sold out of skates, bike suppliers are swapping their cycles for sledges and all over the country people are having their blades sharpened ready to take advantage of the ice generated by exceptionally cold winter. \\"It's in our genes. We've been skating for centuries,\\" explains Bert van Voorbergen, who runs an online skating museum in the town of Almere. \\"Every year when frost comes, there's something indescribable released inside. As soon as there is ice, everyone is the same, everyone is equal. Maybe that's why we love it so much.\\" What stirred most excitement in the Netherlands was the chance that this year, for the first time since 1997, it might be cold enough to hold the ice race to end all ice races: the \\"Elfstedentocht\\" or Eleven Cities Race - the biggest competition held on natural ice in the world. It covers 200km (124 miles) of land, features 16,000 skaters and can attract more than two million spectators. The nation was buzzing, Dutch media covering every twist and turn in a story that filled much of the main evening news broadcasts on national TV. A tweet from Olympic speed-skating Gold medallist Mark Tuitert summed up the sentiments of skaters across the country who say they've been struck by \\"Elfstedentocht fever\\". Bike shop owner Martin de Vries told me he was in school when it was last held 15 years ago. \\"We didn't have internet then, only radio, and everywhere you went everyone was tuned in to the race. It was crazy, everyone rushing home to try and catch it on TV. Or if you were lucky enough to get tickets, of course, you'd be up there cheering on the skaters.\\" But on Wednesday night came the news millions had been dreading - the organisers announced: \\"It's not on.\\" For the Elfstedentocht to go ahead, the temperatures must stay below freezing and for the past few days in Leeuwarden my thermometer's mercury has been bobbing around the -3C mark. But it is also essential that the ice remains thick so as not to crack under the pressure of 16,000 skaters. The Frisian Eleven Cities Association - set up to measure the ice and monitor the conditions - says it needs 15cm (6in) of ice covering the entire track before they can say those mythical words \\"it's on\\". At the moment some parts of the route have only half the depth required. Every year the \\"will-they-won't-they\\" speculation surrounding this legendary race starts to swirl around towns, villages and all over the media at the first signs of a frost. The race tradition began in 1909. The last contest was won by a turnip farmer. And this year the Netherlands recorded its lowest temperatures in 27 years. Preparations have been underway for days. A team of eager volunteers - assisted by a small army of soldiers based near the Friesland route - has been helping to shovel away the snow to give the ice the best possible hope of staying strong. But in the end it seems their best efforts were in vain. After the decision, the association's \\"ice master\\" Jan Oostenbrug urged skaters not to despair and instead get out on the ice and skate their disappointment away. There is a small chance the race will still go ahead later in the season. But with a thaw forecast for Sunday, hopes are fading like the frost. Many are resigning themselves to the cold hard fact that they may have to wait another year before Elfstendentocht fever strikes again. However, skaters have been turning up in their hundreds in the village of Giethoorn, just outside Friesland, to race on a shorter course that runs for more than 25km between villages and does not have the same stringent regulations as the official Eleven Cities race. Although the skaters are still holding out hope that the main contest can go ahead, for now they are making the most of the freezing conditions. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The text describes how the unusually cold winter in the Netherlands has frozen canals, rivers, and lakes, turning the country into a giant ice rink.

The race, held on natural ice, covers 200km and attracts 16,000 skaters and over two million spectators. Unfortunately, the race was not held due to ice not being thick enough in some parts of the route. Nevertheless, many skaters took advantage of the freezing conditions and skated on shorter courses in the village of Giethoorn."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

How to add a rustic look to wooden furniture?","completion":"Adding a rustic look to wooden furniture can be a rewarding DIY project, as it allows you to add character to your furniture while also connecting with the natural elements. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide to help you achieve this goal: 1. Choose the furniture piece: Start by selecting the wooden furniture piece that you want to give a rustic makeover. Some ideal options for rustic transformations are wooden tables, chairs, shelves, cabinets and benches. 2. Gather materials: You'll need a few essential materials and tools for this project. These include sandpaper (with varying grits, from 80 to 220), wood stain/paint (choose a color that gives a weathered look), paintbrushes, clean rags, polyurethane finish (clear matte or satin finish), and protective gear (gloves, a mask and goggles). 3. Prep the furniture: Clean the furniture piece thoroughly, removing any dust, grime, or residue. The surface needs to be free of any dirt or grease. 4. Sand the furniture: Use sandpaper to remove the glossy protective finish or any paint on the wooden surface. Start with the lower grit (80-100) sandpaper and work your way up to medium (150-180) and fine (200-220) grits, ensuring you're achieving a smooth surface. Sand in the direction of the wood grain to avoid scratches. 5. Apply the wood stain/paint: After sanding, wipe the furniture piece down with a damp cloth to remove any dust particles. Next, put on your gloves and apply the wood stain or paint using a paintbrush or rag. Start with a thin coat and let it dry as per the manufacturer's instructions. You can add additional coats for a deeper color and intense rustic look. 6. Distressing the furniture (optional): If you want the furniture to have a more worn-out appearance, you can distress it further. Using a combination of coarse sandpaper or a wire brush, gently scrape away paint or stain on the edges, corners, and other areas where natural wear would occur. Take care not to overdo this step, as too much distressing might make the furniture look unrealistic. 7. Apply polyurethane finish: Once the wood stain/paint is completely dry, apply a clear polyurethane finish to seal and protect the furniture. Choose a matte or satin finish for a more authentic rustic appearance. Apply the finish in thin, even coats, allowing each coat to dry based on the manufacturer's instructions. Usually, two to three coats work best. 8. Reassemble the furniture (if needed): If you had to disassemble any parts of the furniture before starting the project, reassemble them once the polyurethane finish is dry. 9. Add rustic accents (optional): Complement your rustic wooden furniture with accessories such as antique knobs, handles, or decorative hardware to enhance the overall look. 10. Enjoy your rustic furniture piece: Your transformed wooden furniture is now ready to be displayed and used in your home, adding warmth and charm to your living space. Remember that the key to achieving a successful rustic look is patience and attention to detail. Take your time with each step, and don't hesitate to experiment with different wood stains, paints, and distressing techniques to create the perfect rustic piece of furniture."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Sentence from a movie review: try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the preceding movie review, it appears that the movie was viewed negatively. The reviewer suggests that the filmmakers attempted to create characters out of the obvious cliches, which generally refers to overused or tired character tropes that audiences may have seen many times before. Such an attempt might be seen as an effort to subvert or reimagine these cliches in a fresh, innovative way, but, unfortunately, in this particular film, the reviewer finds that the creators failed to achieve this goal effectively. Additionally, the reviewer states that the cliched characters end up being used as \\"punching bags\\" in the movie. This expression implies that these characters might have been treated poorly or made to endure some form of punishment, or rather, they have been reduced to simple entities that exist solely for other characters to take out their frustrations on. The use of this term suggests that the movie didn't offer much depth or complexity to these characters, and instead, merely relied on their cliched aspects without developing them further or providing any meaningful context. Overall, the statement in the review likely indicates disappointment and dissatisfaction with the movie's approach to character development and storytelling. The mention of cliches being used to create characters and the lack of successful execution in doing so, combined with the portrayal of these characters as \\"punching bags,\\" presents a negative impression of the film. In conclusion, the movie was not seen positively based on this particular review, as the criticism suggests that it failed to rise above cliches and lacked depth or nuance in its portrayal of characters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

The question is essentially asking for a clarification or explanation of the meaning or concept of \\"alternative\\" within the context of today's world. The word \\"anymore\\" suggests that the term \\"alternative\\" might have undergone some changes in meaning or usage over time. In our modern society, the concept of \\"alternative\\" has indeed evolved from its initial interpretation. In general, \\"alternative\\" refers to something that is not part of the mainstream or conventional choices, offering a different approach or perspective. It can be applied to various areas such as music, fashion, culture, politics, and lifestyle. However, as trends and preferences change, so does the idea of what constitutes an alternative option. The term \\"alternative\\" was commonly used during the 1980s and 1990s to describe subcultures and forms of expression that deviated from the mainstream standards. For instance, alternative rock music was a genre that represented a break from the dominant pop and rock sound and lyrics of that era. Similarly, alternative fashion was a way for individuals to assert their unique styles, often through clothing pieces, accessories, and hairstyles that deviated from the norm. With the rise of the internet and digital media, the sharing of ideas, products, and perspectives has accelerated, making it harder to define what is considered mainstream or alternative. Today, subcultures and niche interests tend to blend together more seamlessly, and the boundaries that once separated them have become blurred. Because of this, what once might have been considered alternative might now seem more mainstream, while the idea of being alternative has become more fluid and subjective. In summary, the question is asking about the description of the term \\"alternative\\" and how its meaning might have changed or evolved overtime. The concept of alternative has become more complex due to the rapid exchange of ideas and the blending of cultures and subcultures in today's digital world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Despite different phrasing, the fundamental relationship remains the same, making the sentences similar. Part #2 : Classifying Similar Sentences Usage: If the sentences share the same subject, predicate, and object, they are deemed similar. Using the same example as above, \\"A Glastonbury Romance has 1174 pages\\" and \\"The printed copy of A Glastonbury Romance has 1174 pages\\" share the same subject, predicate, and object, making them similar. Hence, the output for this would be \\"SIMILAR\\". Part #3 : Classifying Dissimilar Sentences Usage: Contrarily, if the sentences do not share the same RDF relationships, they are classified as dissimilar. For example, \\"A Glastonbury Romance, which has 1174 pages, is in print.\\" and \\"The sun shines brightly in the sky.\\" have totally different subject, predicate, and object relationships and hence are deemed dissimilar. The output in this case would be \\"DISSIMILAR\\". Part #4 : Processing the Input and Output Usage: Here, the task is to take an input of two sentences and determine whether they're similar or dissimilar according to their RDF relationships. The output is either \\"SIMILAR\\" or \\"DISSIMILAR\\". So, for an input of ['A Glastonbury Romance, which has 1174 pages, is in print and has the OCLC number 76798317 and the ISBN number 0-7156-3648-0.', 'The printed copy of A Glastonbury Romance has 1174 pages, an OCLC number of 76798317 and an ISBN number of -7156-3648-0.'], both sentences share the same subjects, predicates, and objects despite different phrasing, making them similar and hence the output is \\"SIMILAR\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(II) no.","completion":"(I) Yes, the statement \\"The Impressionists had used a double point of view, and both Les Nabis and the Symbolists (who also admired Cézanne) flattened the picture plane, reducing their subjects to simple geometric forms\\" contains the correct answer to \\"Which technique did the Impressionists use to make their subjects simple forms?\\" To provide an expanded explanation, let's break down the provided statement with more context. The Impressionists, who were a group of 19th-century French painters, influenced the art world by deviating from the traditional rules of academic painting. Through innovative techniques and approaches to representing reality, they were able to create a new language in the world of art. One of the critical techniques they used to simplify their subjects was the \\"double point of view.\\" This method allowed them to display multiple perspectives within a single composition and showed the complexity of the world by combining different angles. They used the technique to blur the distinctions between subjects and create an overall sense of unity in their paintings. This allowed for deeper openness to interpretation, moving away from traditional realism into a more contemporary, suggestive style. Moreover, the Impressionists significantly impacted and influenced other art movements, such as Les Nabis and Symbolists. The artists from these later movements, who themselves admired Paul Cézanne (an influential artist associated with Post-Impressionism), took these techniques further. They \\"flattened the picture plane,\\" which means that they reduced the sense of depth in their paintings by eliminating the normal conventions that defined perspective. This was achieved by breaking down the subjects present in their works into essential shapes, lines, and patterns. The result was a composition consisting of simpler geometric forms. This simplification enabled the artists to focus on other aspects of their work, such as color, emotions, and atmosphere. In conclusion, the statement accurately reflects the technique employed by Impressionists to create simplicity in their subjects, which is their usage of a \\"double point of view\\" that allowed for multiple perspectives to be represented. Additionally, the statement also highlights the influence of Impressionism on later art movements and their own methods to produce similar simplification of forms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Inside the brains of human subjects, they pinpointed the unique imprints of two visual memories that were triggered by the same word. Then they watched as repeatedly recalling one of the images caused the second, interfering memory to vanish. The study is published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. The results suggest that our brains actively delete memories that might distract us from the task at hand. \\"People are used to thinking of forgetting as something passive,\\" said lead author Dr Maria Wimber from the University of Birmingham. \\"Our research reveals that people are more engaged than they realise in shaping what they remember of their lives.\\" Dr Wimber performed the study with colleagues from the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge. She told the BBC the implications of the new findings were not as simple as a \\"one in, one out\\" policy for memory storage. \\"It's not that we're pushing something out of our head every time we're putting something new in. \\"The brain seems to think that the things we use frequently are the things that are really valuable to us. So it's trying to keep things clear - to make sure that we can access those important things really easily, and push out of the way those things that are competing or interfering.\\" The idea that frequently recalling something can cause us to forget closely related memories is not new; Dr Wimber explained that it had \\"been around since the 1990s\\". But never before had scientists managed to confirm that this was the result of an active suppression of the interfering memory, rather than just a passive deterioration. What made the discovery possible was identifying reliable indicators that her subjects were recalling a given picture, inside their visual cortex. She did this by getting them to do a number of \\"boring\\" tasks in the brain scanner, before the memory trials even began. This might involve looking at a picture of Marilyn Monroe, or Albert Einstein, many times over. \\"We show people visual pictures of these memories over and over again - and we can sample the prototypical brain response to those pictures,\\" Dr Wimber explained. This allowed the researchers to discover what was distinctive about the \\"Monroe\\" pattern compared to the \\"Einstein\\" one. Then, by triggering them both with the same, unrelated word (eg \\"sand\\") but only asking for one to be remembered, they were able to watch, say, the Monroe trace persist while Einstein withered and faded. Dr Wimber hopes the findings could prove useful in psychology, where erasing specific memories is sometimes exactly what patients need. \\"Forgetting is often viewed as a negative thing, but of course, it can be incredibly useful when trying to overcome a negative memory from our past,\\" she said. \\"So there are opportunities for this to be applied in areas to really help people.\\" Dr Hugo Spiers, a senior lecturer in behavioural neuroscience at University College London, told BBC News the research was exciting and elegantly done. \\"This is an example of good brain imaging research,\\" he said. \\"The results go beyond simply revealing that a brain region is involved in memory: they provide insights into the mechanisms used by the brain to achieve this.\\" The work also impressed Dr Eva Feredoes, who studies memory mechanisms at the University of Reading. She said the finding could even prove useful for tackling memory loss in dementia. \\"We know that memories compete with each other at different stages while they are being remembered and when they are retrieved, with the losers of the competition forgotten from memory,\\" Dr Feredoes said. \\"Solving this complex 'competition' could pave the way for new research into new treatments in diseases that affect memory, such as dementia. Importantly, there are now several techniques to improve brain function. Combined with these results, we have viable mechanisms and brain areas to target with these techniques.\\" Follow Jonathan on Twitter.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the alias of the person the butler privately expresses his support for? On the day that France surrenders to Nazi Germany in 1940, Prudence \\"Pru\\" Cathaway a strong-willed young woman from the upper class, joins the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, a military organisation linked to the Royal Air Force, to her family's surprise. Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up. When the three go to dinner, Pru learns from Monty that Clive is up for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the Dunkirk evacuation. While Pru is dancing with someone else, Monty pleads with Clive to return with him. He was given a month's sick leave, but that was over two months ago, and he is about to be posted as a deserter. Finally, Clive tells Pru, indirectly, about his predicament and that he no longer wants to fight for the benefit of an English elite that oppresses and humiliates people of his class. Pru makes an impassioned plea for all the good things that England represents, but when she wakes up the next morning, Clive has gone, leaving her a letter of goodbye. The answer is:","completion":"The alias of the person the butler privately expresses his support for is \\"Pru\\", which is short for Prudence Cathaway."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because the two use different muscles and different parts of the brain. But what exactly happens? What makes a real smile look “real”? During a genuine smile, there is voluntary and involuntary contraction of two muscles: the zygomatic major and the orbicularis oculi, which raise the corners of your mouth and the areas around your cheeks and eyes, respectively. A forced smile only uses mouth muscles, however, because we cannot voluntarily contract the orbicularis oculi. This is why some people say a real smile uses the whole face, especially the eyes. Real smiles engage separates part of the brain, as well. While a forced smile uses the motor cortex, the real deal engages the limbic system, or the brain's emotional center. Like the rest of your body, your facial muscles will get better at their job if you exercise them often. They can be strengthened and toned through use, making it easier for you to flash your smile. Facial exercises and smiling can also make you look healthier and younger. For a simple exercise, try a plain smile. Stretch the corners of your mouth laterally and hold for 10 seconds. Then, part your lips slightly and hold another 10 seconds. Repeat, even expanding your smile if you want. Try this exercise to erase fine lines around your mouth: pucker your lips and suck in your cheeks, then try to smile. Hold this pose until the muscles start to tire. Do it once a day. Another exercise is the “silly rabbit.” For this one, smile as widely as possible without parting your lips. Then, try to wiggle your nose back and forth. This will engage the cheek muscles. Hold for 10 seconds and repeat. As said, a real smile does not just use the mouth and lips. It also engages the upper face, causing small crinkles around our eyes. In fact, this is probably the strongest give-away between a fake smile (using only the mouth and teeth) and a full, genuine one. A natural smile should light up your entire face. Remember to lift your cheek muscles when smiling. Your eye brows may also be engaged and slightly raised. Try practicing in front of a mirror. As an added aid, cover your mouth so that only your eyes and eyebrows are visible. You should be able to “see” the smile only from your eyes. If you worry about fine lines around your eyes, consider ways to reduce the wrinkles other than keeping a strictly neutral expression. Smoking, lack of sleep, and exposure to the sun are much bigger culprits than smiles. Cut them out of your routine. You shouldn't have to sacrifice smiling. Flashing your smile in front of a mirror is a great way to practice. It will help you to discover what your natural smile looks and feels like, but also how to control it and use it to best advantage. As children we're often taught to say “cheese!” for photos. Actually, “cheese” isn't great for a natural smile. Sounds that end with “ah” like mocha or yoga are much better at opening your mouth while slightly raising your cheekbones, looking more natural. Practice! Pay attention to angles. Your face and smile might look better at certain angles than others. Experiment in the mirror. Find your best side. Then, use that angle in real interactions. Some fashion models also use the following trick: touch your tongue to the roof of your mouth, just behind the front teeth. The movement should open your jaw very slightly and better define its lines when you smile.

Title: House of Wax Movie plot: Professor Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is a talented wax figure sculptor with a wax museum in 1890s New York City. He specializes in historical figures, featuring sculptures of John Wilkes Booth, Joan of Arc, and one of Marie Antoinette, which he considers his masterpiece. When his business partner Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) demands more sensational exhibits to increase profits, Jarrod refuses. Jarrod then gives a private tour to renowned art critic Sidney Wallace. Wallace, deeply impressed with Jarrod's sculptures, agrees to buy Burke out, but will not be able to do so until after he returns from a continental trip. That same night, Burke deliberately sets the museum on fire, intending to claim the insurance money. In the process, he fights off Jarrod, who is desperately attempting to save his precious sculptures. Burke splashes kerosene over Jarrod's body and leaves him to die in the fire. Miraculously, Jarrod survives, but with severe injuries including crippled hands. He builds a new House of Wax with help from deaf-mute sculptor Igor (Charles Bronson) and another assistant named Leon Averill. Jarrod now concedes to popular taste and includes a \\"Chamber of Horrors\\" that showcases both historical crimes and recent events, such as the apparent suicide of his former business partner Burke. In reality, Burke was murdered by a cloaked, disfigured killer who then staged the death as a suicide. Burke's fiancÃ©e, Cathy Gray (Carolyn Jones), is murdered soon afterward. Her body mysteriously disappears from the morgue. Cathyâs friend Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk) visits the museum and is troubled by the strong resemblance of the Joan of Arc figure to her dead friend. Jarrod explains he used photographs of Cathy when he made the sculpture. Unsatisfied, Sue returns after hours and uncovers the horrifying truth behind the House of Wax: many of the figures are wax-coated corpses, including Cathy and Burke.

Review: Funny how many of the people who say this is far superior to Romero's version tend to be very young (judging by their other posts). What we have here is a slick, action packed, gory and \\"Whoopee\\" filled 2 hour MTV video. Frantic editing, pop-video camera work, \\"cool\\" music blah blah blah Actually it ain't bad compared to other recent remakes (Chainsaw Massacre was a total disaster)... pretty good acting all round, totally predictable in the \\"who will die next\\" stakes and a total cash in on the Dawn Of The Dead name that will generate plenty of revenue alone by fans of the original who will go and see it out of curiosity... Don't remakes of classics get on your nerves? Can they REALLY not come up with something original? Why remake Dawn Of The Dead? The things that made the original special (the middle segment kids think is so boring is supposed to be slow to show how when you get everything you ever wanted you still ain't happy) are totally missing. This is an action flick, plain and simple. The faster the better.

Watch the cinemas over the next few years as we get The Godfather series remade by whoever the most fashionable Pop director is at the moment, and Star Wars remade, with all the kids saying how the new version is miles better cos the old version is slow and boring and holds a camera shot for more than 5 seconds...

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","completion":"No, the answer you found is not directly related to the question asked. The question is about the split of phone numbers into two groups, 3 digits and then 4 digits, not about local area code dialing. Allow me to provide a detailed answer to the question: How did phone numbers get split into 3, then 4 digits? The current phone numbering system in the United States and Canada, called the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), was established in 1947. This plan divides the ten-digit phone numbers into three parts: a three-digit area code (NPA), a three-digit central office/exchange code (NXX), and four-digit line or station code. The three-digit area code allows for a more straightforward identification of regional locations. The following three-digit central office/exchange code denotes a local calling area or specific local telephone company office within an area code. The four-digit line or station code represents the unique number assigned to a specific telephone line within that central office. The reason for this structure is to manage the numbering resources effectively and facilitate the routing of calls among different regions, allowing for more efficient organization and easier long-distance connections. It was needed as the telephone system expanded and the number of connected users grew, requiring a more established and organized numbering system. So, the split of phone numbers into 3 and then 4-digit groups is a part of the North American Numbering Plan, which facilitates easier call routing and organization across different regions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I read this background article the other day: A plant's first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots. If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied...

Article: By the end of the decade a distinct genre of hard rock was emerging with bands like Led Zeppelin, who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock on their first two albums Led Zeppelin (1969) and Led Zeppelin II (1969), and Deep Purple, who began as a progressive rock group but achieved their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and distinctively heavier album, In Rock (1970). Also significant was Black Sabbath's Paranoid (1970), which combined guitar riffs with dissonance and more explicit references to the occult and elements of Gothic horror. All three of these bands have been seen as pivotal in the development of heavy metal, but where metal further accentuated the intensity of the music, with bands like Judas Priest following Sabbath's lead into territory that was often \\"darker and more menacing\\", hard rock tended to continue to remain the more exuberant, good-time music.

However, continued activation of stellate cells during chronic liver damage causes excessive matrix deposition and the formation of pathological scar tissue leading to fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis. The importance of sustained stellate cell activation for this pathological process is well recognized, and several signalling pathways that can promote stellate cell activation have been identified, such as the TGFβ-, PDGF-, and LPS-dependent pathways. However, the mechanisms that trigger and drive the early steps in activation are not well understood. METHODS AND RESULTS We identified the Hippo pathway and its effector YAP as a key pathway that controls stellate cell activation. YAP is a transcriptional co-activator and we found that it drives the earliest changes in gene expression during stellate cell activation. Activation of stellate cells in vivo by CCl4 administration to mice or activation in vitro caused rapid activation of YAP as revealed by its nuclear translocation and by the induction of YAP target genes. YAP was also activated in stellate cells of human fibrotic livers as evidenced by its nuclear localization. Importantly, knockdown of YAP expression or pharmacological inhibition of YAP prevented hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro and pharmacological inhibition of YAP impeded fibrogenesis in mice. CONCLUSIONS YAP activation is a critical driver of hepatic stellate cell activation and inhibition of YAP presents a novel approach for the treatment of liver fibrosis.","completion":"Title: \\"YAP Activation: A Critical Driver of Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation and Potential Therapeutic Target for Liver Fibrosis\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"After analyzing the given product review, it appears that the reviewer is expressing mixed opinions on the product, which in this case is the work of the googlepoet Matthea Harvey. The review offers both flattering and unflattering remarks; however, we will dissect these elements to provide a more in-depth understanding of its overall tone. On the one hand, the review describes Matthea Harvey as a \\"googlepoet\\" and goes on to praise her work, stating that she is \\"plexes beyond your solar plexuses.\\" This statement is overtly flattering and demonstrates admiration for Harvey's poetic prowess. The use of \\"plexes beyond your solar plexuses\\" is a creative expression that implies her work is incredibly intricate and capable of eliciting strong emotional reactions. Conversely, the review also contains some unflattering comments, albeit not directed at Matthea Harvey's work itself. The reviewer explicitly calls out Joe Sallivan and Pete Dumpsey, referring to them as \\"heartbreaking wrecks of staggering meanness\\" and demanding that they \\"stop reviewing books\\" and \\"stop reading.\\" These remarks are undoubtedly unflattering but are not aimed at Harvey's poetry. The negative comments are instead directed towards other presumed reviewers or critics, implying that they might not fully appreciate or understand Harvey's artistic brilliance. In summary, this review presents Matthea Harvey's work in a primarily flattering light while simultaneously expressing strong disapproval towards other reviewers or critics. The negative comments are not targeted at the product itself but rather at those who the reviewer perceives as failing to appreciate the value of Harvey's work. From this analysis, one could infer that the reviewer is a staunch supporter of Matthea Harvey and wishes to see her work receive the positive recognition it deserves."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write some highlights for the following article: Speaking is profoundly human: More of the human brain is devoted to speech than any other activity. People can have an IQ of 50, or a brain that is only one-third the normal size and have difficulties with many simple tasks, but they can speak. Humans are so tuned to words that from about the age of 18 months, children learn about eight to 10 new words a day, a rate that continues until adolescence. Humans love to speak: When two hearing people encounter each other, they will speak, despite having other means of communication such as gesturing or drawing. Even when people speak different languages or come from different cultures, they will try to find common words and phrases. One-day-old infants can distinguish speech from any other sounds and 4-day-olds can distinguish between their native language and other languages. Even in the womb, a fetus can distinguish her or his mother's voice from all other female voices. Adults can distinguish speech sounds at twice the rate of any other sounds, aided by special hair cells in the outer right ear. See also: Florida anthropologist explains 'baby talk' origins. Among all animals, only humans have the necessary breathing apparatus and musculature to be able to speak: despite the \\"Planet of the Apes,\\" no primate could speak like a person, even if their brains grew. Even human ancestors such as the Neanderthal could not possibly speak: speech is a new and remarkably impressive ability. So, there is nothing so human as speech -- at least until modern technologies came along. Through striking advances in a computer's ability to understand and produce speech, it is common to use your telephone to make airline reservations, answer questions and search the Web. Because of the shrinking size and increasing speed of computers, it is also possible to speak directly to your automobile. From putting up with the car intoning, \\"Your door is ajar,\\" we have moved to navigation systems that can tell you where to find a latte and car interfaces that understand spoken commands and even allow drivers to dictate e-mails, texts and make phone calls. What could be more simple and natural than talking, even to a technology? And speaking to cars seems particularly desirable. We don't have to take our eyes from the road or our hands from the wheel to select buttons or make choices: Why not let our mouths and our ears do all the work? Unfortunately, it's not so simple or so desirable. Recent research by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, conducted by David Strayer at the University of Utah, finds that the new technology can be so distracting it impairs the ability to drive. Studies found that while driving, our attention becomes overloaded by speaking. It basically takes our minds, if not our eyes, off the road. Here are three reasons why talking while driving is so distracting, and not as safe and effective as you might think:. People like to picture who they are talking with. When you speak with someone face-to-face, you \\"hear lips and see voices\\": Your brain automatically and easily focuses on the person. When you speak on the telephone, you use brainpower to create a mental image of the person you are talking with: The less you know the person, the more mental workload it takes. When you talk to a car, use a phone in a car or dictate a text message, your brain has to do a great deal of work to picture with whom you are communicating. When you're thinking that hard, it's very difficult to pay attention to the road. That's why talking on a cell phone -- hands free or not -- is much more dangerous than talking to a passenger. The need to imagine steals from attention to the road. See also: Is hands-free driving just as dangerous? People want to be understood. Although people love to speak, there are few more frustrating things than someone not listening. Listeners puts a great deal of energy into showing that they are listening: They nod their head, say \\"uh huh,\\" open their eyes and change their posture. People are built to expect these signals of attention, but cars refuse to provide them. As a result, drivers become overly concerned with whether the car understands or is even listening, and their attention is again drawn away from the road. In addition, the voice of the car does not have the rich vocal cues that indicate engagement and emotion, providing further evidence that the car isn't understanding. Cars are not native speakers. When you encounter someone who isn't facile in your language, you have to put a great deal of time into selecting the right words, avoiding idioms and speaking slowly and clearly. Speech is no longer an easy and natural means of communication in these instances. While it is remarkable that cars can understand something that took billions of years of human evolution, the typical car recognition rate of 85% to 95% makes it a mediocre second-language speaker. As a result, speech becomes effortful and demanding, stealing attention from the road. Because of these problems, my laboratory and laboratories around the world are trying to find ways to support the driver in creating mental images, in showing that the car wants to understand and enabling the car to understand at levels equal to or even better than a person. And soon cars will be driving themselves, so that people can ignore the road and multitask their way to fighting for attention from each other, just as they do outside the car. Watch: The self-driving car changes everything. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Clifford Nass. Highlights:","completion":"1. The human brain is profoundly attuned to speech, allowing for rapid language acquisition and high levels of comprehension. 2. Advances in computer speech technology have made it possible for cars to understand and respond to spoken commands. 3. However, recent research from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety shows that engaging with voice-activated systems while driving can be distracting and impair the ability to drive safely. 4. Three reasons that contribute to the distraction include: the need to mentally picture the conversation partner, the desire to receive confirmation of being understood, and the effort required to communicate effectively with non-native speakers or imperfect speech recognition systems. 5. Scientists are working on solutions to mitigate these issues, while the development of self-driving cars may eventually remove the need for drivers to focus on the road while interacting with technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

(CNN) -- Here's what Katie Roche expected when she went into the hospital for spine surgery: two titanium rods, a bone graft, 17 screws in her vertebrae, eight hours in the operating room, and a week's stay in the hospital to recover. Here's what she didn't expect on top of all that: sharing a hospital room with a feverish 6-year-old and contracting a nasty bacterial infection her mother says nearly killed her. \\"She got so weak she couldn't even get out of bed to go to the bathroom -- I had to carry her,\\" says her mother, Kathleen Roche. \\"For about 48 hours, I didn't think we'd have Katie with us much longer.\\" Because of the infection she picked up at the hospital, Katie, who was 19 at the time, dropped from 120 to 90 pounds. The bacterium that made her so sick is called Clostridium difficile, and according to a study out this week, it's more common than ever among hospitalized children in the United States, and children who get it are more likely to die or require surgery. The study found Clostridium difficile infections in hospitalized children went up 15% per year from 1997, when there were 3,565 infections, to 2006, when there were 7,779 infections. The study looked at 10.5 million pediatric patients from 1997 to 2006, of whom 21,274, or 0.2%, had C. diff, as the bacteria are commonly called.

Over it is a great band(besides thier latest release) and this is some good, raw, fast melodic punk music...the way it should be. Only thing is the second half of the cd(from the Ready Series) is just to raw sounding for me. I only listen to the first 5 songs(re-released from Hindsight is 2020) which are stupidly good. THis really shows where Over it came from and were the groundworks for great albums like \\"Timing...\\" and \\"Silverstrand\\". Truly is a hidden gem Is this product review negative? pick from the following. (A). Yes; (B). No; Answer:","completion":"(B). No; This product review is not negative. The reviewer, despite some criticism about the second half of the CD, focuses primarily on the positive aspects of the band and their music. They describe the CD as a 'hard to find' item, implying that it's worth the effort to seek it out. More importantly, they express their admiration for the first five songs which they describe as 'stupidly good,' highlighting their appreciation and satisfaction with this portion of the music. They also refer to the overall band as 'great' and reference other albums that they consider 'great,' indicating favorable sentiment toward their music in general. They categorize the music as 'raw,' 'fast,' 'melodic punk,' which may point to their genre preference and why they value Over It's music. Though 'raw' is used later to highlight why they don't prefer the second half of the CD, within context, it seems more of a personal preference than an objective condemnation. The reviewer concludes by noting that this product is a 'hidden gem' and provides insight into the band's progression, implying that they value the CD for its ability to shed light on the band's musical journey and evolution. This signals that despite some personal reservations, the product has essential value for anyone interested in the band's history. Thus, few criticisms aside, the review leans towards positivity overall."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Female hamsters sometimes eat their own babies if they get stressed out. It is very important to keep the environment as calm as possible. Though you might be eager to play with the babies, give the mother space and peace for their safety. At first, the babies will look pink and hairless. They are born with their eyes closed. While you do not want to disturb her, you do still need to make sure she has everything she needs in her cage. For the first week and a half to two weeks or so, discretely refill the mother's food bowl and water bottle. You do not need to provide the babies with anything at this point. They will get everything they need from nursing. Scatter small portions of broccoli, grated carrot, wheat germ, or tofu in their nest for them to eat. The mother will also store food in her cheek pouches, and bring it back to the nest to feed her babies. A week after birth, they will start to grow fur. You should just be able to tell what colors they are. The \\"pups\\" will also start making little noises at this age. One or two adventurous babies may leave the nest, but do not worry if the mother picks them up in her mouth and puts them back. Enough time should have passed now to allow the mother settle into her new role, so you can give the cage a much-needed cleaning. It is also your first opportunity to handle the babies, which is an important step in socializing them to humans. By handling them at two weeks, you make them more comfortable with human interactions. Get your hands \\"dirty\\" with the scent of the used litter before touching the babies. This prevents the mother from rejecting or attacking them later. Move the hamsters into another cage one by one. When cleaning the cage, avoid completely destroying the nest. Hamsters will usually have a “toilet” area in the cage. Concentrate your cleaning there, and leave the nest more or less intact. If the nest is soaked or filthy, however, go ahead and replace it with fresh materials. While cleaning the cage, make a few changes to transition them into adulthood. Add a second food bowl to the cage. The mother's water bottle will be too high for the babies, so place a second one at a lower position. You could also place a raised platform under the mother's bottle so the babies can reach it. Do not lower the mother's water bottle to the babies' height because then the mother will not be able to reach it. At this age, the babies should have all their fur and be running about independently. Though they were born with closed eyes and ears, they should be starting to open up now. This can be a tricky process. Look at the distance between each hamster's anus and genital opening. The distance on a male will be longer than the distance on a female. By four weeks, the males' testicles should also be noticeable, as should the nipples on the females' bellies. Hamsters have a lot of loose skin, and you can hold them by the scruff of their necks or by the loose skin down their backs. Be careful not to drop them, and be ready to return them to the cage, if you start to lose your grip. Not all hamsters mature at the same rate, so you have to make sure you gendered them correctly. For a few days after you separate them into male and female cages, keep checking gender every day. You might notice testicles one day that you did not see before in a cage of baby “females.” If so, switch the baby to the correct cage. If you are unsure about the sex of your babies, take them to your vet or an experienced hamster breeder for help. You want to avoid accidental breeding of siblings. Place your hand in the cage so they can smell it, and let them climb up into your palm if they want to. You can also scoop them up with a small cup and start gently petting them on the back. The babies will be ready for their new homes 35 days their birth. Do not wait too long to start looking for people to purchase your hamsters, because the 35 days goes by fast. Keep your customers updated as the hamsters approach 35 days old, so they can prepare their own homes. Make sure you send them off to reliable homes, with families that will love them. Provide the new owners with information on hamsters and the hamster's care to this point. You want the babies to have the best new start you can provide. If you keep any of the babies, know that Syrians are highly territorial. When they reach two to three months of age, separate all hamsters into their own cages.","completion":"Hamsters are little animals that can have babies. Sometimes, mommy hamsters get stressed and might eat their babies, so we need to be very careful and give them space. Baby hamsters are born pink and without hair. They drink milk from their mom and don't need any food from us at first. Later, they will start growing fur, and we can handle them carefully so they get used to us. After a while, we will need to figure out if they are boys or girls, so we can separate them and find them new homes. The new owners should be people who will love and care for the hamsters. If we keep any of them, we need to give them their own little home when they grow up because they like to have their own space."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A:","completion":"To remove odor from a litter box, follow these steps: 1. Preparation: Before you begin, gather the necessary supplies, such as a trash bag, litter scoop, paper towels, cleaning solution, and fresh litter. 2. Dispose of the old litter: Put on gloves to protect your hands and place a trash bag near the litter box. Using the litter scoop, remove all the clumps and waste from the litter box, placing them into the trash bag. Once all the waste is removed, tie the trash bag securely and discard it in an outdoor trash can. 3. Clean the litter box: With the waste removed, it's now time to thoroughly clean the litter box. Pour the remaining litter into the trash bag, ensuring the litter box is empty. Wipe down the inside and outside of the litter box with paper towels to remove any residue. 4. Disinfect the litter box: Fill a bucket with a mixture of water and a pet-safe cleaning solution. Using a sponge or cloth, scrub the inside and outside of the litter box with the cleaning solution, making sure to reach even the corners and edges. This will help to remove bacteria and any lingering odor. 5. Rinse and dry: Rinse the litter box thoroughly with water to remove any residue from the cleaning solution. It's essential to eliminate any remaining cleaning solution as it may be harmful to your pet. Use a clean, dry towel or paper towels to dry the litter box completely. 6. Replace with fresh litter: Once the litter box is clean and dry, fill it with a fresh layer of litter (2-3 inches deep is usually a good amount). Evenly distribute the litter across the bottom of the box to provide a clean and comfortable surface for your pet. 7. Regular maintenance: To keep the litter box odor-free, scoop out waste and clumps daily and replace the litter regularly (about once a week). Additionally, consider using an odor control litter, placing a litter box deodorizer nearby, or adding a carbon filter to the litter box hood (if applicable) to help minimize the smell. By following these steps, you should be able to effectively remove the odor from a litter box and keep it clean for your pet."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Seventy members of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce pleaded with the protest organizers to stop the actions. The NAACP asked for sympathizers to picket in unity in 100 American cities. Twenty rabbis flew to Birmingham to support the cause, equating silence about segregation to the atrocities of the Holocaust. Local rabbis disagreed and asked them to go home.

Alexander II's death caused a great setback for the reform movement. One of his last ideas was to draft plans for an elected parliament, or Duma, which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people. In a matter of 48 hours, Alexander II planned to release his plan for the duma to the Russian people. Had he lived, Russia might have followed a path to constitutional monarchy instead of the long road of oppression that defined his successor's reign. The first action Alexander III took after his father's death was to tear up those plans. A Duma would not come into fruition until 1905, when Alexander II's grandson, Nicholas II, commissioned the Duma following extreme pressure on the monarchy as a result of the Russian Revolution of 1905. The assassination triggered major suppression of civil liberties in Russia, and police brutality burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II, whose death was witnessed first-hand by his son, Alexander III, and his grandson, Nicholas II, both future emperors who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people. A series of anti-Jewish pogroms and antisemitic legislation, the May Laws, were yet another result. Finally, the tsar's assassination also inspired anarchists to advocate \\"'propaganda by deed'--the use of a spectacular act of violence to incite revolution.\\" With construction starting in 1883, the Church of the Savior on Blood was built on the site of Alexander's assassination and dedicated in his memory. Question: \\"How many years passed between the fruition of the Duma and the beginning of the construction of the Church of the Savior on Blood?\\" Answer: \\"One year\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

So, if you think of it like ages, it's like saying a baby was born (the church started being built), and then a grown-up person of 22 (the Duma was realized).

Onetime Chicago Bears football coach Mike Ditka has not been in charge of an NFL team for 17 years, but the business of being “Iron Mike” has never stopped booming. He’s the tough-as-nails head football coach who’s always ready to shill for any product within arm’s distance or play himself in a Will Ferrell movie. When on ESPN, he is forever armed with a sharp rant and is perhaps their only talent—other than maybe Chis Berman—who can pass gas on live television and make it come off as lovable. That’s just Ditka being Ditka. Ad Policy But there is another side to Mike Ditka. He’s the guy who was accused of sending players back into games with concussions. He’s the guy who was described this way by former Bears safety Dave Duerson: “Mike was not one who gave a damn about the players or their injuries when he was coaching.” Duerson later took his own life, and in death was diagnosed the brain disease CTE. Ditka is the guy who berated his own Bears players for not crossing a picket line when the NFLPA was on strike in 1987. He’s the guy today who—after a lifetime of supporting right-wing candidates—shills for another dubious product: Donald Trump. And now, true to form, he’s coming out against Colin Kaepernick’s anthem protests. On Friday, he said on the Shan & RJ radio show, “I think it’s a problem. Anybody who disrespects this country and the flag. If they don’t like the country they don’t like our flag, get the hell out. My choice is, I like this country, I respect our flag, and I don’t see all the atrocities going on in this country that people say are going on,” Ditka said. “I see opportunities if people want to look for opportunity. Now, if they don’t want to look for them then you can find problems with anything, but this is the land of opportunity because you can be anything you want to be if you work. If you don’t work, that’s a different problem.” Mike Ditka, as mentioned, is a Trump endorser—and he is parroting the candidate who in August said that Kaepernick should “maybe should find another country to live in.” Trump undoubtedly knows that this kind of statement is a racist dog whistle, that when you tell someone who is descended from the enslaved people that built the United States to shut up or find another country, you are telling them—in classic KKK fashion—to “go back to Africa.” This is as true today as it was when a member of Congress said it to singer and civil-rights icon Paul Robeson, and Robeson’s response is still the correct one. He said: Because my father was a slave, and my people died to build this country, and I am going to stay here, and have a part of it just like you. And no Fascist-minded people will drive me from it. Whether Ditka is aware that “find another country” is racist is unclear, but there is absolutely nothing in his history that would allow for him to get the benefit of the doubt. Ready to Fight Back? Sign Up For Take Action Now Ditka’s comments share similarities in content and tone with not only Trump but also another elderly ex-coach who likes playing a tough guy on television: disgraced former Indiana University basketball coach Bob “The General” Knight. These braying bullies have appointed themselves as the arbiters of patriotism. Yet when Trump, Ditka, and Knight had the chance to serve in Vietnam, they didn’t. They used whatever means were at their disposal—deferments, foot injuries, coaching Army basketball—to get out of it. Their lives mattered. I have no problem with anyone who didn’t serve in that horrific war. My great hero is Muhammad Ali, who resisted the draft in Vietnam. But these guys act like they’re George Patton when they’re not even George W. Bush. It’s galling that, in Ditka’s mind, Trump’s trashing of this country is somehow patriotic, yet Kaepernick’s critiques justify his exile. It is galling that Ditka is blissfully unaware that there are legions of black former players who feel that he didn’t respect their health, their minds, or their humanity. Now his critique of Kaepernick feels like another chapter in a life of degrading black people who do more than just say, “Yes, Coach.” There has been a call for Mike Ditka to be fired from ESPN for his comments. I don’t agree, partially because there is no more nauseating thought than “First Amendment martyr Mike Ditka.” He shouldn’t be fired, but he should be debated. He should have to spew his views not in the confederate confines of talk radio but to the face of ESPN colleagues Herman Edwards or Charles Woodson or Bomani Jones or Jemele Hill. Make him say that to the face of someone who has had to live while being black in this country, someone unafraid to push back. I suspect that Ditka would respond to this the way bullies always respond when challenged. When bigoted bullies are armed only with their rancid ideas, they never stand their ground. ||||| Mike Ditka is not only the former Head Coach of the World Champion Chicago Bears, but he’s also a cigar aficionado, steak house proprietor, AND something of an expert on U.S. race relations over the past century. At least that’s the takeaway after he was interviewed by Westwood One’s Jim Grey and asked to opine on the current culture role between those irate that NFL players taking a knee in protest during the playing of the national anthem, and those sympathetic with the issue of oppression and racial inequality that those are protesting. Ditka said: I think that you have to be color blind in this country. Have you got to look at a person for what he is and what he stands for. And how he produces. All of a sudden it’s become a big dealing now about oppression. There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of. I don’t care who you are, how much money you make. If you don’t respect our country, then you shouldn’t be in this country playing football. Go to another country and play football. If you can’t respect the flag and the country, then you don’t respect what this is all about. So I would say adios. The dictionary defines “oppression” as “prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or control.” So according to Ditka, the recent deaths of unarmed black men over the past decade that led to Colin Kaepernick‘s original protest seem not to rise to cruel or unjust treatment, which he is right to have his opinion. But he also doesn’t feel that segregated schools, restaurants and drinking fountains does not rise to cruel or unjust treatment or control. Neither does the systemic lynching of black individuals in the Jim Crow era of the South. So according to Mike Ditka, there has been no oppression, because from his vantage point as a 77-year old white male, what oppression could there possibly be? Love it or leave it losers!

(Darron Cummings/AP) Even before this NFL season, which has featured team owners linking arms with players as shows of solidarity amid sharply critical comments from President Trump, some players were noting that the original message of protests during the national anthem had been largely lost. To them, the cause of bringing attention to racial injustice, in particular police brutality against black men, had been overshadowed by a heated national discussion over the merits of taking a knee during the national anthem. To former NFL coach and ESPN analyst Mike Ditka, however, that cause made no sense to begin with. In a pregame interview before a radio broadcast of Monday night’s game between the Chicago Bears and Minnesota Vikings, he said, “There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of.” [Jerry Jones says Trump reminded him of NFL policy on standing for anthem] Saying that “you have to be colorblind in this country,” Ditka told Jim Gray on Westwood One that “the opportunity is there for everybody.” He added that the place to protest was at “a ballot box,” and that people should “respect” the winners of elections. Ditka quickly was condemned, particularly by Joe Namath, for his comments. The Hall of Fame quarterback suggested Tuesday that Ditka “look up the meaning of oppression. Look up the definition of oppression, and you understand that it’s obviously taken place.” By late Tuesday, Ditka was trying to straight out what he meant. “The characterization of the statement that I made does not reflect the context of the question that I was answering and certainly does not reflect my views throughout my lifetime,” he said in a statement. “I have absolutely seen oppression in society in the last 100 years and I am completely intolerant of any discrimination. The interview was about the NFL and the related issues. That’s where my head was at. I was quoted in the interview stating, ‘You have to be color blind.’ I stated that you should look at a person for what they are and not the color of their skin. I’m sorry if anyone was offended.” Ditka, 77, and Gray were talking about the team with which he is most associated, the Bears, when Gray asked about Vice President Pence walking out of an NFL game Sunday because of anthem protests, and about the pregame demonstrations in general. “Is this the stage for this?” Ditka said. “If you want to protest, or whatever you want to protest, you’ve got a right to do that. But I think you’re a professional athlete. You have an obligation to the game. I don’t see a lot of respect for the game, I just see respect for their own individual opinions. … Respect the game, play the game, when you want to protest, protest when the game’s over, protest whatever other way you want to.” With Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones making news for saying that his players would either stand for the anthem or get benched, Gray asked Ditka if that would be his policy, as well, were he in charge of an NFL team. “Yes,” Ditka replied, “I don’t care who you are, or how much money you make, if you don’t respect our country, you shouldn’t be in this country playing football. Go to another country and play football. If you had to go to somewhere else and try to play this sport, you wouldn’t have a job.” “If you can’t respect the flag and this country, then you don’t respect what this is all about, so I would say: Adios.” [Jenkins: There are two sides to the NFL anthem debate, and both are right. And wrong.] Ditka has not been shy in the past about expressing political views, and he was an early supporter of Trump’s presidential campaign. Starting well before the election, Trump has taken frequent shots at former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who began the anthem protests during the 2016 preseason, and Ditka has followed suit, saying a year ago that he had “no respect” for the player. “My choice is that I like this country, I respect our flag, and I don’t see all the atrocities going on in this country that people say are going on,” Ditka added at the time. The Eagles’ Malcolm Jenkins, who has been raising his fist during the anthem and has worked toward helping create better relations between police and community members, offered an explanation Monday of some of the concerns felt by NFL players. “I think we’ve made that very clear that what we are demonstrating about has nothing to do with the flag but everything to do with social injustice, racial inequality and the things that Jerry Jones and other owners who are making statements have yet to address,” the safety said to NBC Sports Philadelphia. “And so I’d love to hear their takes on that part of the conversation, what these players are trying to draw attention to,” Jenkins continued. “Their thoughts on, you know, police brutality and racial inequality, education gap, the economical gap in these communities that they make money in. And I’d love to hear that part of the conversation so that it’s not so argumentative, so that it’s not isolating the players who are trying to do the right thing with the platform that they have.” Later on Monday, Gray asked Ditka, “For those who want social justice, and for those who look back at the lives of Muhammad Ali and Jesse Owens, and John Carlos and Tommy Smith, your response would be?” “I don’t know what social injustices have been,” the Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee replied. “Muhammad Ali rose to the top. Jesse Owens is one of the classiest individuals that ever lived. I mean, you can say, are you talking that everything is based on color? I don’t see it that way. “I think that you have to be colorblind in this country. You’ve got to look at a person for what he is, and what he stands for and how he produces, not by the color of his skin. That has never had anything to do with anything. “But all of a sudden, it’s become a big deal now, about oppression. There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of. “Now maybe I’m not watching it as carefully as other people. I think the opportunity is there for everybody. Race, religion, creed, color, nationality — if you want to work, if you want to try, if you want to put effort into yourself, I think you can accomplish anything.” [Jemele Hill suspended two weeks by ESPN after tweet about Jerry Jones] The former coach, who won a Super Bowl with the Bears before a head coaching stint with the New Orleans Saints, said in 2013 that not running against Barack Obama in the 2004 Illinois Senate race was the “biggest mistake I’ve ever made.” He told a Chicago radio station last year that “Obama’s the worst president we’ve ever had.” “He would be great to play golf with,” Ditka said at the time of Obama. “He’s not a leader. This country needs leadership. It needs direction.” On Monday, Ditka made an apparent reference to Obama’s successor, telling Gray that NFL players are “protesting an individual,” adding, “That’s wrong, too.” “You know, you’ve got a ballot box, you’ve got an election. That’s where you protest,” Ditka said. “You elect the person you want to be in office, and if you don’t get that person in office, I think you respect the other one, that’s all.” “Football has been so good to these guys,” Ditka said of NFL players on the pregame show. “It’s been so good to me. Enjoy it, have fun with it, and I don’t think it’s the stage for protests. I’m sorry, a lot of people disagree with that, but that’s my take on it.” Read more: ‘This is about systemic oppression’: Eric Reid becomes the voice of 49ers’ protest with criticism of Pence ‘He’s all by himself’: Capitals’ Devante Smith-Pelly considers anthem protest after J.T.

In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it. She meets a boy (voice: Jason Marsden) in traditional dress who is alarmed to see her; he tells her to leave and get back across the river before it gets dark. Chihiro runs back to her parents, but they're still eating -- and they've turned into pigs. Strange, dark, ghostly figures appear in all the shops and streets, frightening Chihiro and separating her from the pigs that were her parents. Chihiro runs back to the river, which was nearly dry when they came over but is now full and large, and she doesn't even recognize the buildings on the far side.

While most people stick to conventional toothpaste for their daily dental hygiene routine, there are alternatives available that can prove beneficial to both, our health and the environment. Tooth powder is one such alternative, with its natural ingredients and sustainable packaging that has less impact on our planet. In this article, we will explore the various benefits of tooth powder ingredients, how to combine them, and the proper way to utilize them for optimal oral care. Recognize the Benefits of Tooth Powder Ingredients Tooth powder ingredients are usually derived from natural sources and don't contain artificial additives, such as preservatives or foaming agents. This means they're less likely to cause an allergic reaction or irritation to sensitive gums. Here are some key ingredients commonly found in tooth powders and their benefits: 1. Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda): Baking soda is known for its mild abrasive properties, which help clean and whiten teeth. It can also neutralize harmful acids from food residue and combat bad breath. 2. Calcium Carbonate: This common ingredient strengthens tooth enamel and aids in removing plaque and surface stains on teeth. Furthermore, calcium carbonate provides extra minerals that support healthy teeth and gums. 3. Activated Charcoal: This popular ingredient has remarkable detoxifying and adsorption capabilities. It binds to plaque and stains, making it easier to remove. Activated charcoal can also aid in soothing gum inflammation and limiting harmful bacteria in the oral cavity. 4. Xylitol: A natural sweetener, xylitol works against cavity-causing bacteria and supports a healthy pH balance in the mouth. It can also stimulate saliva production, which is essential to maintaining oral health. 5. Clove, Cinnamon, and Peppermint: These essential oils or powdered spices offer antibacterial properties and can alleviate gum inflammation. They add a refreshing and soothing component to tooth powder, delivering a burst of natural flavor. Combine Ingredients and Mix Thoroughly Once you understand the benefits of various tooth powder ingredients, you can create your own customized blend. Start with one or two tablespoons of base ingredients like baking soda or calcium carbonate. Then, add smaller quantities of activated charcoal, xylitol, and essential oils or powdered spices to suit your personal preferences. Mix the ingredients thoroughly in a clean, dry container until a uniform powder is achieved. Creating your tooth powder blend allows for personalization, enabling you to select flavors and ingredients that work best with your specific needs. Experiment with different combinations to find the ideal tooth powder for you. Apply the Dry Mixture to Your Toothbrush Now that you have a customized tooth powder mixture, it's time to incorporate it into your daily oral care routine. Here's how to use tooth powder effectively: 1. Wet your toothbrush in clean water and shake off the excess. 2. Gently dip the bristles into the tooth powder, ensuring the entire head is coated with a thin layer of the powder. 3. Brush your teeth as you normally would with toothpaste, using gentle strokes and paying special attention to all areas of your mouth, including your gums and tongue. 4. Rinse your mouth thoroughly with water to remove any residual powder and reveal cleaner, fresher teeth. Conclusion Tooth powder is an excellent, eco-friendly alternative to conventional toothpaste. With natural ingredients that boast surprising oral health benefits, tooth powders provide an effective option for those seeking a more sustainable and holistic approach to dental hygiene. By understanding the benefits of each ingredient, combining them to create your personalized mixture, and integrating tooth powder into your routine, you'll be well on your way to maintaining good oral health and contributing to a healthier planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Essentially my view seems to match a number of others - the first half hour was fresh, sharp, deep, entertaining and promising. Well acted too. Natural. My problem, however, is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning, nor the fact that I spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp, grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken, toothless, bread-chewing hags. It's rather with the fact that THEY NEVER WARNED ME!!! The festival brochure synopsis described only the (utterly intriguing-sounding) first half hour - a whore, piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar, pretending to be an advertising agent, genetic engineer, and petty government administration official, respectively - making no mention whatsoever of the never-ending gum-smacking to come. Serves me right for not reading the reviews, you might say - but to my defense, a number of reviews I looked at post-fact um didn't at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the film. The first hint should have been the introductory words by the director (a bashful, tousle-haired Russian youth) who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium (the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically, and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening, though most of the audience seemed as unaware as I was of the pain to come, judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour, and many exasperated comments on exit) to say the following: 'Well, I... um, thank you very much for coming to see this film, and I just wanted to say... well, it's a very long film... it took me four years to make it, and... it's.. I suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it. It is very long. Thank you for coming.' This is what he said. Alarm bells should have been ringing. 'What's he talking about?' I thought in happy confusion. 'This is gonna be fun!' Of course, by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me, it was far too late to get out. All I could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again. And in the end I can't say I feel in any way improved by the experience. Yes, I absolutely loved the first half hour. It was intelligent, new, and had a lot to say. And yes, Russia is probably in a bad state. Yes, every society has many hidden faces. Yes, toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard. Yes yes yes. I get all of this. Really I do. But I see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out, and so painful to bear. If you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy Hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of muddy vodka swigging, try the Korean-Chinese Bin Jip (3-Iron).

Barbra Streisand: LIFE Magazine Photos From Eary in Her Career, 1966 Barbra Streisand has been such a force on the entertainment scene for so long (her 1963 debut album, recorded when she was just 20, won an Album of the Year Grammy) that a glimpse back at her first years in show business offers fascinating insights into her evolution as a performer, and a person. Here, on her 70th birthday (April 24), LIFE.com offers a window into the intense, emotionally fraught world Streisand inhabited and, in a sense, created for herself with her own outsized insecurities and perfectionism early in her career. In 1966, for example, LIFE published a cover story on the then-23 year old Brooklyn native that portrayed the young star as a “fear-ridden girl” terrified that her early success “could suddenly all fall apart.” Of course, creative people who have enjoyed (or endured) fame right out of the gate almost invariably, at one point or another, suffer lacerating self-doubts; Streisand, however, appears to have interrogated her own talents and achievements with the same tenacity that she brought to, say, mastering the nuances of a new tune or the timing of a comedic line. “Why Barbara Streisand has to know what people think of her every time she performs is an astounding, and wrenching, phenomenon,” wrote LIFE’s Diana Lurie in the March 18, 1966, issue of LIFE. “At 23, she is an undisputed queen of musical comedy, television and records. Every one of the seven records she has made sold a million copies. She gets 50,000 per concert appearance. For nearly two years she pulled in standing room-only audiences for an otherwise undistinguished musical, Funny Girl…Everybody knows Streisand is on top. So does she. And the more she is hailed, the more scared and insure she feels. “I win awards and everything but one of these days something is going to bomb. It’s a scary thing. Even more surprising in the LIFE cover story is the assertion that, while “her audiences adore Barbra,” she “looks on them as her as adversaries.” During taping of a TV special, hyper-critically watching her own performance played back on monitors, she told her agent: “I know this is a better show than the first. But They are waiting for it to bomb. hey always are. People say, ‘Go and see this terrific girl.’ But most of them come thinking, ‘Nah she can’t be that great.’ It makes me feel they’re the monster and I’m their victim.” Despite — or perhaps because of — this deeply ambivalent attitude toward her audience and her triumphs, Streisand also displayed a cool, collected and (for a 23-year-old) remarkably astute understanding of her own stardom. “My success? The only way i can account for it is that whatever abilities other performers have, I must have it plus. Onstage I am a cross between a washwoman and a princess. I am bit coarse, a bit low, a bit vulgar and a bit ignorant. But I am also part princess — sophisticated elegant and controlled. I can appeal to everybody.” Then, she adds: “When I am not not performing, however, I don’t think I have that definite a personality. I think maybe I have nothing.” Maybe I have nothing. All these years later, after the Emmys (five), Oscars (two), Grammys (eight) and a special Tony Award; after selling millions upon millions of records, filling concert halls and arenas and enjoying the undying devotion of countless fans the world over — after all that, one can only hope Streisand has come to embrace the notion that, just maybe, she does have something after all. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article reflects on Barbra Streisand's early career in 1966, discussing her insecurities and perfectionism despite being celebrated as an undisputed queen of musical comedy, television, and records. LIFE Magazine's cover story at the time highlighted Streisand's fear of her success falling apart and her complex relationship with her audience, whom she viewed as adversaries. Despite her doubts, Streisand demonstrated a deep understanding of her stardom, and the article concludes by hoping she eventually embraced her talents after years of immense success, including numerous awards and millions of records sold."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Maintain a regular sleep schedule by going to bed at the same time every night, even on the weekends or on your days off. This will ensure your internal sleep clock is set on a schedule that will make it easier for you to fall asleep at night. Though you may think that going to bed one hour later won’t affect your sleep schedule, any changes or shifts to your sleep schedule will have negative effects on your sleeping habits and can lead to oversleeping or a restless sleep. On average, you should be getting between seven to nine hours of sleep a night. To avoid messing up your sleep schedule, you can set an alarm on your phone or computer to remind you it’s time for you to go to bed. Have your phone alert you 1 hour or 30 minutes before bedtime so you can prepare yourself for bed and stick to your sleep schedule. You can also set an alarm on your watch or ask the person you live with to give you a 1 hour heads up before bedtime. Having a consistent wake up time every morning will also allow your body to adapt to your sleep schedule. To help maintain a set wake up time every day, you should avoid hitting the snooze button on your alarm or get rid of the snooze button completely. The snooze button will only throw off your wake time and throw off your sleep schedule. If possible, try to trigger your wake up time with lots of light. You could set a timer so the lights in your room turn on at your wake up time or the blinds in your bedroom go up. Exposure to light in the morning will help your body’s internal clock to reset itself every day and help you to avoid oversleeping. If you are traveling to a different time zone, you will need to prepare your body for the time shift so you can get a good night’s sleep. It can take several days to a week for your body to adjust to a new time zone. If you are traveling eastward, you will likely experience more severe jet lag than when you are traveling westward. Traveling east requires you to shorten your day, making it more difficult for your internal clock to adjust to your new sleep schedule. Prepare your internal clock for the new time zone by getting seven to nine hours of sleep two to three days before your trip. If you are traveling west, you should adjust your sleep schedule by delaying your normal bedtime and wake time in 20-30 minute intervals. If you are traveling east, you should increase your normal wake time by 10 to 15 minutes a day two to three days before your trip and increase your normal bedtime by 10 to 15 minutes. To fight off jet lag and poor sleep in a new time zone, you should decrease your exposure to light when it’s time for bed and increase your exposure to light when it’s time for you to wake up. You should also spend more time outdoors so your body gets used to the light cues, such as the sun rising and falling, in your new time zone.","completion":"This article talks about keeping a regular sleep schedule by going to bed at the same time every night, setting alarms to remind you, having a consistent wake up time, using light to help your body adjust, and tips for traveling to a new time zone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: What is the name of Coach Gaines' team? Movie title: Friday Night Lights Movie plot: Bissinger followed the team for the entire 1988 season, which culminated in a loss in the State semi-finals against Carter High School from Dallas, who eventually went on to win the championship game but would have their title stripped for playing an ineligible player. However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself. Fullback Don Billingsley has a rocky relationship with his father, who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury. His obsession with fame and recognition also comes at a high price that he is at first not ready to pay. Safety Brian Chavez is harassed... A:","completion":"The name of Coach Gaines' team in the movie Friday Night Lights is the Permian High School Panthers. This team is based in Odessa, Texas, and holds a prominent place in the town's culture, with many residents heavily invested in the team's performance and success. The movie is adapted from the non-fiction book of the same name written by H.G. Bissinger, which chronicles the true events of the 1988 Permian High School football season. The book is not only about football but also delves into various social issues, like the economic disparity, racism, segregation, desegregation, and poverty affecting Odessa and its residents. The town's passion for the game often spills over into these social issues, affecting the players' lives in both positive and negative ways. Coach Gary Gaines, played by Billy Bob Thornton, is the focal point of the story. He experiences immense pressure from the community to lead the team to success, despite the various personal obstacles his players face throughout the season. Gaines' coaching style is criticized for overusing star player, James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, which leads to a devastating injury for Miles. The team struggles with different personal conflicts, such as quarterback Mike Winchell's inconsistency and inability to make decisions, fullback Don Billingsley's clash with his father over living up to expectations, third-string running back Chris Comer's fear of injury, and safety Brian Chavez's experiences of harassment. Investing in a film proposal such as Friday Night Lights would depend on various factors, including the production team's experience, the profitability of similar movies in the sports drama genre, and the existing fanbase for the story since it's based on true events and an acclaimed book. Carefully considering these factors, along with your personal interest in the social issues and themes presented, will help you make an informed decision about whether or not to invest in the film proposal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: If you have a persistent dry throat that worsens or doesn't go away with home treatment, you may need to schedule an appointment with your physician or dentist. Your condition might warrant professional attention. Untreated chronic dry throat can lead to some noteworthy complications. For instance, you may eventually find it difficult to swallow food. When accompanied by dry mouth, a dry throat can also make it difficult to chew or taste food, and you may experience more tooth decay if you are unable to produce enough saliva to protect your teeth and gums. Moreover, dry throats that develop into sore throats might be caused by viral or bacterial infections. When left untreated, these conditions can develop into more serious health problems. Certain medical conditions can cause a chronically dry throat, and if one of them is to blame for your current difficulties, your doctor will need to diagnose and treat that condition to improve the dry throat itself. Some illnesses, like Sjogren's syndrome, directly impact your saliva glands and cause saliva production to decrease. Other conditions, like oral yeast infections, colds, allergies, and diabetes, may increase throat dryness indirectly. If your dry throat is caused by immune disease or saliva gland damage, your doctor may choose to prescribe pilocarpine, a drug that increases natural saliva production by stimulating associated nerves. Alternatively, if your dry throat is caused by Sjogren's syndrome, your doctor may prescribe cevimeline to help treat it and other associated symptoms.","completion":"If your throat is dry and doesn't get better with home treatments, it's important to see a doctor or dentist.

The other options do not fit as effectively in this context: - \\"Intangible\\" is mentioned twice in the list of options, which shows that it is the main focus and a strong hint at the intended answer. - \\"Spiritual\\" indicates a connection to religious or emotional concerns, which is not relevant to the difficulty the student is facing in understanding the concept. - \\"Insubstantial\\" implies that the ideas lack substance or significance, but the issue here is not related to the importance of the ideas, but rather to the student's inability to comprehend them. - \\"Incorporeal\\" is similar to intangible but mainly refers to something non-physical or not having a bodily form. Since the context is about the student's difficulty in grasping a concept, describing the ideas as incorporeal is not as appropriate as using intangible, which carries the idea of challenging comprehension."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She lived in New York and enjoyed doing gymnastics and playing soccer. One day, Hannah came home from school and her parents greeted her. She knew that something was different by the expressions on their faces. Even Jackson, Hannah's dog, was acting different. Hannah asked why everyone was being so strange. Hannah's father, who was known as Pop, explained to Hannah that his job was forcing him to move. Hannah did not seem to think this was too big of a deal. Then, Hannah's mother explained that they were moving to Kenya. Kenya, she explained, was a place in Africa and life would be very different there. As Hannah began to cry thinking about all of her friends at home, Hannah's mother calmed her with a gentle touch. Jackson began howling as Hannah cried, but was also calmed by Hannah's mother. Hannah spent the next two weeks visiting her friends and saying her goodbyes. She did not know the next time she would be home. She cried very hard when she said goodbye to her best friend, Susan. Susan did not quite understand where Kenya was, but promised to visit Hannah. The next day, Hannah boarded a plane with her family. At first, they thought that Jackson could not come with them. However, Hannah worked hard and helped make sure that he had all of his shots so that he could come. After he had them all, the airport said it was OK for Jackson to come! The Harvey family left and off they went across the ocean to begin their new life in Kenya.

Sentence 2: Immediately Harun fled Italy to Libya , where he was arrested on 24 June 2011 . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences convey the same information, but they differ in their structure and word order. Both sentences communicate that Harun fled from Italy to Libya and that he was arrested on June 24, 2011 (or 24 June 2011). However, the way they present this information varies, as discussed below: 1. Sentence Structure: Sentence 1: Harun immediately fled Italy for Libya, where he was arrested on June 24, 2011. Sentence 2: Immediately Harun fled Italy to Libya, where he was arrested on 24 June 2011. In Sentence 1, the adverb \\"immediately\\" is placed before the verb \\"fled\\" to modify it, while in Sentence 2, the adverb \\"immediately\\" is placed before the subject \\"Harun.\\" Despite this difference, the overall meaning remains the same: Harun fled to Libya without any delay. 2. Word Order: In Sentence 1, the date is formatted as \\"June 24, 2011,\\" which follows the American English convention of placing the month before the day. In Sentence 2, the date is formatted as \\"24 June 2011,\\" which follows the British English convention of placing the day before the month. Again, although the format of the dates differs, they still represent the same day. There are also minor differences in the use of prepositions and punctuation in the two sentences: 3. Prepositions: In Sentence 1, the preposition \\"for\\" is used to indicate the destination (Italy for Libya). In contrast, in Sentence 2, the preposition \\"to\\" is used to indicate the destination (Italy to Libya). In the context of these sentences, both prepositions serve the same purpose, conveying that Harun fled from Italy to Libya. 4. Punctuation: In Sentence 1, there is a space after the comma following \\"Italy,\\" while in Sentence 2, there is no space after the comma following \\"Italy.\\" This is a minor formatting issue that does not affect the meaning of the sentences. In conclusion, both sentences convey the same information about Harun fleeing Italy, arriving in Libya, and being arrested on the same date. The differences in sentence structure, word order, use of prepositions, and punctuation are minor variations that do not change the overall meaning of the information being conveyed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

Question: Article: As they migrate, butterflies and moths choose the winds they want to fly with, and they change their body positions if they start floating in the wrong direction. This new finding suggests that insects may use some of the same methods that birds use for traveling long distances. Scientists have long thought that insects were simply at the mercy of the wind. Fascinating as their skills of flight are, migrating behavior has been difficult to study in insects because many long distant trips happen thousands of feet above ground. Only recently have scientists developed technologies that can detect such little creatures at such great heights. To their surprise, though, the insects weren't passive travelers on the winds. In autumn, for example, most light winds blew from the east, but the insects somehow sought out ones that carried them south and they positioned themselves to navigate directly to their wintering homes. Even in the spring, when most winds flowed northward, the insects didn't always go with the flow. If breezes weren't blowing in the exact direction they wanted to go, the insects changed their body positions to compensate(, ). Many migrating birds do the same thing. The study also found that butterflies and moths actively flew within the air streams that pushed them along. By adding flight speeds to wind speeds, the scientists calculated that butterflies and moths can travel as fast as 100 kilometers an hour. The findings may have real-world applications. With climate warming, migrating insects are growing in number. Knowing how and when these pests move could help farmers decide when to spray their crops. Question: Scientists originally thought that _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"insects were just blown about by the wind\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"insects were just blown about by the wind\\". Scientists originally thought that insects, during their migration, were simply at the mercy of the wind without having any ability to control their direction. They thought insects were passive travelers on the winds. However, recent research suggests that insects, specifically butterflies and moths, can choose favorable winds and modify their body positions to affect their direction, much like migrating birds. This implies that they have a more active role in their migration than previously thought. Furthermore, technological advancements have enabled scientists to detect and observe these small creatures during their lengthy, high-altitude journeys, further debunking the initial belief."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: The Haunting Hour Volume One: Don't Think About It Movie plot: Cassie (Emily Osment) is a thirteen-year-old goth girl who just moved with her family to a new neighborhood and school. She loves to trick the popular kids at school and her younger brother Max (Alex Winzenread). On the way to a library, Cassie finds a mysterious Halloween store in an alley and goes inside. The store owner (Tobin Bell) insists on selling her an old book titled The Evil Thing, which contains a warning not to read it aloud or think about its monster called \\"The Evil Thing\\", a two-headed creature that sucks blood while the other head eats meat. That night, Cassie ignores the warning in the book and reads it to Max as revenge for him unplugging her computer in the middle of a report she was writing. Priscilla Wright (Brittany Curran), a school bully who stole The Evil Thing from Cassie's bag in school, films her jumping in fear, after using a CD player to play monster sounds outside in order to make the monster appear to have come to life. After Cassie's parents leave for a Halloween party and later that night, The Evil Thing is brought to life by Max's thoughts, and captures him, Priscilla and a Papa John's Pizza delivery man. It is up to Cassie and Sean (Cody Linley), a popular boy who Cassie likes, to save them. At first, they try to defeat The Evil Thing on their own, but fail. Cassie then asks the owner of the shop, where she bought the book, for help. Cassie discovers that the store owner travels around the world each Halloween, searching for a person who loves to scare people the most and tricks them into reading the book aloud, releasing The Evil Thing, possibly in order to teach them a lesson.

Movie title: Veronica Guerin Context: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored.

Question: Given the following context: In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the... answer the following question: What is the name of the person that George Grove helped?

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What village did the Priestleys move to? ? Following the Seven Years' War (1756–63) and the forced migration of Native American tribes westward, German, Scots-Irish, and other European immigrants settled in the central Susquehanna Valley, including in the area that would become Northumberland, Pennsylvania. Northumberland was laid out around a central village green in 1772, on land originally purchased from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, as part of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. During the American Revolution, the village was evacuated as part of the Big Runaway in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784. In 1794, when the Priestleys moved there, it included Quaker and Wesleyan meeting houses, a brewery, two potteries, a potash manufacturer, a clock maker, a printer (who issued a weekly newspaper), several stores, and approximately one hundred houses. The Priestley property, purchased in 1794 at a total cost of £500 (£ 56,400 in 2019) from Reuben Haines, who had secured the patent to the land for Northumberland, comprised four lots of the original village plan (numbers 29–32). Currently, the house and grounds occupy 1 acre (4,000 m²) at 472 Priestley Avenue. (The address of the house was originally \\"North Way\\", but the street was later renamed in honor of Joseph Priestley.) This street forms the northwest boundary of the property; the other boundaries are Hanover Avenue to the northeast, Wallis Street to the southwest, and the North Shore Railroad to the southeast. Beyond the railroad line is a baseball field, and beyond that lies the Susquehanna River, which was the original southeastern boundary of the property. The confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River with the main (or North) branch of the Susquehanna is a short distance southwest of the property, which is at an elevation of 456 feet (139 m).The property's original area was 2 acres (8,000 m²), but this was reduced by about half around 1830 when the Pennsylvania Canal (North Branch Division) was dug through the house's front yard, between the house and river.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Philip Seymour Hoffman on Broadway: 'He was getting it right in a hard situation' He didn't audition and I hadn't met him before but I was introduced by John C Reilly, who was his close friend, and we basically pressured him into doing the show. I'd loved him in pretty much everything I'd seen him in: at the very least he was distinctive, and often he was sublime. I had done the production in the West End with Mark Rylance, so I was looking for someone who could match that same mercurial brilliance; something that wouldn't be just a piece of bravura acting. True West is a comedy, and comedy is sometimes seen as more shallow; depth is somehow reserved for more serious drama. The unique thing about Philip was, he could combine the two. I don't keep photos of my productions generally, I have only two on the wall in my office, and one of them is of me and Philip and John with our arms round each other at the Tony awards in the year of True West. We were all very young, of course, but we look kind of like these three cheeky, rogueish brothers. He was never secretive about his past problems. So I knew he'd had a tough time when he was younger, and I knew he was clean when we worked together. I saw him last summer and autumn, I was texting him frequently. I was aware of the TMZ thing [when the gossip website broke news of Hoffman entering rehab], I was with him that weekend in fact; I could see how brutal it was to be betrayed like that. He clearly suffered from addiction, and he wrestled with it. For a long time he seemed to be winning. He was getting it right in a hard situation: he had got the work-life balance right; he had a long-term partner; three children he loved; he loved his work. He was very creative, very successful. He was getting a lot of the things right that should allow someone to be happy. He was also very intelligent. And he didn't have that rock-star mentality, the kind you associate with out-of-control behaviour. He was methodical, and rigorous. Which is part of what makes this so desperately sad, because you can't help thinking it had to have been accidental, it didn't have to happen. It didn't feel to me like he was on a downward spiral.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how big or small a visible light can get Suggested answer: Birds, however, can see some red wavelengths, but not as many as humans. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"No, you should not validate this answer as it does not correctly address the question. The question focuses on the size of visible light, while the provided response discusses the perception of red wavelengths by birds and humans, which is an unrelated topic. A more relevant and accurate answer to the question, \\"how big or small a visible light can get,\\" should discuss the properties of light, specifically the visible light spectrum and its range of wavelengths. Here is a more appropriate answer: Visible light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, which is composed of photons - elementary particles that travel in waves. The size of visible light can be referred to as its wavelength, which is the distance between two consecutive points in a wave that are in the same phase. The visible light spectrum features a range of wavelengths extending from approximately 380 nanometers (nm) to 750 nm. Within this spectrum are the colors that we typically perceive, progressing from violet (380-450 nm) to indigo (450-485 nm), blue (485-500 nm), green (500-565 nm), yellow (565-590 nm), orange (590-625 nm), and finally red (625-750 nm). So, the size of visible light - its wavelength - can vary, but it generally falls within that 380 to 750 nm range. The actual size of visible light waves that we can perceive depends on various factors such as the source of the light, medium through which it travels, and an observer's visual perception abilities. However, considering the range of wavelengths for visible light, it can be concluded that visible light can be as small as around 380 nm (violet) or as big as around 750 nm (red)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it true that can a gas mix into a liquid explain based on the following text? In industrial process engineering, mixing is a unit operation that involves manipulation of a heterogeneous physical system with the intent to make it more homogeneous. Familiar examples include pumping of the water in a swimming pool to homogenize the water temperature, and the stirring of pancake batter to eliminate lumps (deagglomeration). Mixing is performed to allow heat and/or mass transfer to occur between one or more streams, components or phases. Modern industrial processing almost always involves some form of mixing. Some classes of chemical reactors are also mixers. With the right equipment, it is possible to mix a solid, liquid or gas into another solid, liquid or gas. A biofuel fermenter may require the mixing of microbes, gases and liquid medium for optimal yield; organic nitration requires concentrated (liquid) nitric and sulfuric acids to be mixed with a hydrophobic organic phase; production of pharmaceutical tablets requires blending of solid powders. The opposite of mixing is segregation. A classical example of segregation is the brazil nut effect.","completion":"Yes, it is true that a gas can mix into a liquid according to the text provided. In the context of industrial process engineering, mixing is a crucial unit operation with the goal of making a physical system more homogeneous. This is achieved by manipulating a heterogeneous system to create a more consistent distribution of its components or phases, such as heat and/or mass transfer. The text specifically states that with suitable equipment, it is possible to mix a solid, liquid, or gas into another solid, liquid, or gas. Therefore, it is feasible to mix a gas into a liquid. Various examples are provided from different industries that demonstrate the importance of mixing different phases to obtain optimal results. One example from the text is a biofuel fermenter, which necessitates the mixing of microbes, gases, and liquid medium to achieve optimal yield. This highlights that incorporating gases into the liquid medium is crucial for the effectiveness of the biofuel production process. In industrial processing, mixing is essential for a wide range of applications and is often mandatory to achieve desired outcomes. Chemical reactors can also serve as mixers in some cases. Mixing ensures proper heat and mass transfer and maintains standardization across the industry. Furthermore, mixing is contrasted with the process of segregation, with the brazil nut effect cited as a classical instance. This demonstrates that mixing plays a vital role in preventing segregation and promoting homogeneity in industrial processes. In summary, based on the text provided, it is indeed true that a gas can mix into a liquid within the realm of industrial process engineering. This capacity to combine gases and liquids contributes significantly to improving the homogeneity of systems, which is essential in many industrial applications and processes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: Others embarked on an overseas exodus that took them around the Mediterranean Sea. Hypothesis: Everyone was too afraid to embark on an overseas exodus. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To assess if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to compare the information presented in both. Premise: \\"Others embarked on an overseas exodus that took them around the Mediterranean Sea.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Everyone was too afraid to embark on an overseas exodus.\\" Step 1: Understanding the premise The premise states that some group of people (\\"Others\\") undertook a journey (\\"embarked on an overseas exodus\\") that led them around the Mediterranean Sea. The premise does not provide information about the emotions or motivations (such as fear) of these people. Step 2: Understanding the hypothesis The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a claim about the emotions of everyone. It says \\"Everyone was too afraid to embark on an overseas exodus.\\" This implies that no one undertook the journey due to fear. Step 3: Comparing the premise with the hypothesis When comparing the premise and the hypothesis, it's clear that they present conflicting information. The premise confirms that a journey occurred, and it was undertaken by others. But the hypothesis asserts that everyone was too afraid to embark on such a journey. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The presence of a journey in the premise contradicts the assertion in the hypothesis that no one undertook the journey due to fear.

A young man with autism, named Cho-won, finds release only in running. As a child, Cho-won regularly threw tantrums, bit himself, and refused to communicate with othersâfinding solace only in zebras and the Korean snack, choco pie. His mother never gave up on him and was determined to prove to the world that her child can be normal. As Cho-won gets older, he begins to find a passion for running and his mother is there to encourage and support him.

Summarize: Before there were tablets and cell phones, road trippers passed the time by playing car games. Car games are a fun way to engage with your fellow passengers and your changing surroundings. Participants are required to react quickly, think creatively, and remain observant. Classic car ride games include: The License Plate Game—each time you spot a license plate from a different state, check off the state on a map. Whoever spots the most license plates from different states at the end of the trip wins. The Alphabet Signs Game—scan signs, license plates, and billboards for the letters of the alphabet. Whoever spots all the letters, A through Z, in order first wins. Custom Scavenger Hunt—prior to leaving for the trip, come up with a list of items, people, and places. Give everyone a list so they can keep track of their discoveries and points. Whoever finds the most items, people, and/or places by the end of the trip wins. Create your own car game. Determine who can repeat the most lines from a song or movie. Count the number of advertisements you see for a specific product. Have a contest to see who can purchase the wackiest souvenirs. There are plenty of wireless games and activities that you can play in the car. Trade in your tablet for a magnetic board game. Set aside your cell phone and pick up a card game. Put away your computer and pick up pens and an activity book or drawing pad. Car friendly games include: Tic-Tac-Toe, magnetic checkers/chess, hangman, trivia card games, games that only require a deck of cards, such as solitaire or free cell. Car friendly activities include: drawing, journaling, crossword puzzles, word searches, sudoku puzzles, and fill-in-the-blank stories. Reading allows you to escape into another universe, time period, and/or life. Reading a captivating story (or even assigned reading) will help the miles fly by. Pick out a book or two from your local library or bookshop before you leave on your trip. If you’re prone to car sickness, ask someone in the car to read out loud to everyone. Put your GPS in the glove box and pull out of good ol’ fashioned map. Every passenger can take turns reading the map and guiding the drive towards the next destination. You can even turn navigating into a game. Print out maps and an itinerary of your trip for every passenger. Whenever someone asks “Where are we?” or “Are we there yet?” have them pull out their map and itinerary. They can use road signs and these resources to determine where they are and/or when they might arrive at their next destination. Road trips are excellent times to catch up with your loved ones, get to know new people, and create new memories. Spend time talking to the people in your car. You can share personal anecdotes, tell funny jokes, debate hot topics. If you didn’t all participate in planning the trip, discuss the itinerary in the car.","completion":"Car games are a fun way to enjoy a road trip with friends or family.

Protesters were arrested after refusing to leave corporate property outside McDonald's headquarters on Wednesday, as hundreds demonstrated to call attention to the low pay earned by fast-food workers. The actions come ahead of the company's annual shareholders meeting Thursday, where it is also expected to be confronted on issues including its executive pay packages and marketing to children. Early Wednesday, organizers changed the location of their demonstration after learning McDonald's closed the building where they had planned their actions and told employees there to work from home. The corporate headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, has several buildings on a sprawling campus. Scroll down for video. Demands: Protesters are pressuring fast food corporations to pay a minimum wage of 15 per hour and offer better benefits. Protest: Demonstrators from across the country gathered at McDonald's corporate headquarters in Illinois on Wednesday. Riot: Riot police were dispatched to McDonald's Illinois headquarters after hundreds of protesters gathered there to demand better wages. Down the street from Hamburger University, dozens of police officers in riot gear warned protesters to disperse. People dressed in McDonald's uniforms essentially volunteered to be arrested by peacefully crossing a barricade or remaining on the property after being asked to leave. Organizers said about 100 McDonald's workers who traveled from around the country were arrested, along with community leaders and supporters. Among them was Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, who said in a statement released after her arrest that she wanted McDonald's workers to know her union members stood with them. The SEIU has been providing financial and organizational support to the fast-food protests, which began in late 2012 in New York City and have been spreading to other cities and countries. Angry: The protesters are said to be employees from several fast food restaurants, not just McDonald's. Arrests: The protesters say police arrested about 100 demonstrators who refused to leave the property. While turnout for the protests has varied, they've nevertheless struck a chord at a time when the gap between the country's rich and poor has widened. Executive pay packages are coming under greater scrutiny too, and shareholders last week rebuked Chipotle Mexican Grill's compensation of 25.1 million and 24.4 million for its co-CEOs in a non-binding, advisory vote. McDonald's Corp., which is far bigger than Chipotle, gave CEO Don Thompson a pay package worth 9.5 million last year. Outside its headquarters, 25-year-old McDonald's worker Jessica Davis said she wasn't worried about being arrested. 'I'm worried about not being able to pay my bills,' said Davis, who earns about 9 an hour at a Chicago restaurant. She said she supports two young children and relies on public assistance and help from her family to get by. A spokesman for the Oak Brook police department, George Peterson, said the arrested protesters were being processed and would be released, with court dates being assigned later. He estimated the crowd of demonstrators at up to 1,500. Clash: The demonstrators clashed with police on several occasions during the protests. Shareholders: The protests were held in coordination with McDonald's annul shareholders meeting. Pay gap: McDonald's CEO Don Thompson was given a pay package worth 9.5 million last year. Although some municipalities have higher rates, the federal minimum wage is 7.25 an hour and translates to about 15,000 a year for a person who works 40 hours a week. But most fast-food workers are given far less time on the clock, in part because restaurant owners want to avoid paying overtime and limit the number of employees who receive benefits, if they are offered. Protesters also plan to demonstrate outside the company's annual meeting Thursday morning. Shareholder meetings offer the public a rare chance to confront top executives at major publicly traded companies. While ordinary investors typically don't attend, the meetings are frequented by public pension funds, activist groups and religious organizations seeking to change corporate practices. Although other fast-food chains such as Burger King and Taco Bell use many of the same practices, McDonald's is a frequent target for critics because of its size and high profile. In a statement, the company said it respects 'everyone's right to peacefully protest.' Later, spokeswoman Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem called the protest 'very much a staged event.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"- Hundreds of protesters gathered at McDonald's headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, demanding higher pay for fast-food workers, specifically a minimum wage of 15 per hour. - The protest took place before the company's annual shareholders meeting, where issues like executive pay packages and marketing to children were also expected to be addressed. - About 100 McDonald's workers, community leaders, and supporters, including the president of the Service Employees International Union, were arrested for refusing to leave the property. - The protests highlight the growing concern about income inequality and executive pay. McDonald's CEO Don Thompson received a pay package worth 9.5 million in the previous year. - Fast-food workers often earn less than the federal minimum wage of 7.25 an hour, due to limited working hours and companies avoiding overtime and benefits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On a busy Friday morning in Manhattan, nine pedestrians suffered bullet or fragment wounds after police unleashed a hail of gunfire at a man wielding a .45 caliber pistol who had just killed a former co-worker. The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said. Police identified the slain co-worker as Steven Ercolino, 41, who had apparently filed a prior complaint against his assailant, claiming that he thought Johnson would eventually try to kill him. Both men had filed harassment complaints against each other in April 2011, Kelly added. Ercolino was listed as a vice president of sales at Hazan Import Corp., according to his LinkedIn profile. \\"It's not something that should happen to a loving person like that,\\" said his brother, Paul. \\"He's going to be so missed by everybody.

Answer the following question: This article: Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of \\"smell\\", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that... contains an answer for the question: What is the type of whale that can weigh up to 190 metric tons?, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The type of whale that can weigh up to 190 metric tons is the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus). The blue whale is not only the heaviest whale species but also the largest creature that has ever lived on Earth. They can reach lengths of up to 29.9 meters (98 feet) and weigh as much as 190 metric tons (210 short tons). Blue whales belong to the Balaenopteridae family, which are commonly known as the rorquals. Rorquals are characterized by their long, streamlined bodies, relatively short dorsal fins, and throat pleats that aid in filter-feeding. The blue whale's massive size allows it to filter-feed on vast amounts of krill, which are small shrimp-like crustaceans that are abundant in the ocean. In fact, an adult blue whale can consume several tons of krill per day during the feeding season. Despite their enormous size, blue whales are generally gentle giants and do not pose a threat to humans. They are filter-feeders, using baleen plates in their mouths to sieve vast amounts of krill from the water. The blue whale's mouth is so large that it can take in an estimated 60,000 liters (15,850 gallons) of water in a single gulp, which it then expels through the baleen plates, trapping the krill inside. Due to their immense size and unique adaptations for life at sea, the blue whale is a true marvel of the animal kingdom. Their incredible mass, unmatched by any other living organism, stands as a testament to the astonishing diversity and beauty of life on Earth. Unfortunately, blue whales were historically targeted by commercial whalers for their valuable oil and baleen, leading to a significant decline in their population. As a result, blue whales are currently listed as an endangered species and are protected under international law to preserve their remaining numbers. Conservation efforts are ongoing to ensure the continued survival and recovery of this magnificent marine mammal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this \\"Pick beds that house annuals instead of perennials. Ensure your fabric is permeable. Lay the fabric out in one long piece. Cut out the pieces around barriers. Apply the next piece alongside it. Anchor the edges down. Place mulch on top.\\" Article:","completion":"Sure, here's a simple explanation! Imagine you want to start a beautiful garden and you have to decide what kind of flowers you want. There are two types: annuals and perennials. Annuals are like balloons at your birthday party, they're flashy and fun, but only last for a short time, mostly one year. Perennials, on the other hand, are like your favourite teddy bear. They stay with you for a long time, coming back year after year. For our garden project, we're going to pick beds that house annuals. That means we're choosing a place to plant these one-year only flowers. Now, you might wonder, can the bed just be any place in the garden? No, you need something special under these flowers to keep them happy, and that's called fabric. This fabric is not like your clothes though, it needs to be permeable. Permeable fabric is like a superhero's net - it lets water and air pass through while stopping bad stuff like weeds. So, we lay out this special fabric in one long piece across our chosen flower bed. Next, we might find some rocks, trees, or other stuff in our flower bed. For that, we need to cut the fabric around these barriers, like how we cut paper around things when we're doing crafts. This way, our fabric fits perfectly on the bed, just like a puzzle piece! If we need another piece of fabric, we apply it, or place it, right next to the one we just put down. It’s like when we put our storybooks side by side on our shelf, so that they stay neat and tidy. Then, we need to keep these fabrics secure. To do this, we anchor the edges down. Anchoring is like when you hold down your kite's string so it doesn't fly away in the wind. We do this to make sure our special fabric doesn't move or fly away. Lastly, we put something called mulch on top of the fabric. Just like blankets keep us warm, mulch protects our plants. It helps to keep the soil moist and stops weeds from growing. It's almost like a shield for our flower bed! In this way, by picking the right flower beds, using the right special fabric, and protecting it well, we can create a wonderful home for our beautiful flowers to grow.

I went to the Albertson's following my appointment and bought some cooling aloe gel for relief but nothing helped. The area ended up breaking out in blisters that last at least a week. I had several people ask me if I had suffered a burn. Yikes! it was not good and extremely painful. I let the bad eyebrow wax slide and thought maybe it was a fluke accident and went back last night for a mani-pedi. I feel bad because I am not sure the tech who was working on me really understood some of the things I was trying to communicate to her. At one point I asked her to file my nails slightly shorter and she said \\"ok\\" but then just moved on. That wasn't really the worst part though. During both the mani and pedi she repeatedly hurt me while removing my cuticles. I can be a wuss so I know sometimes it is just me being a baby but this was ridiculous. At one point I gasped and pulled my foot away and the nail tech next to her actually had to scold her and tell her to take it easy. Needless to say I left with one nail bleeding which didn't stop for over an hour and is still painful to the touch.

However, like any other home device, your vacuum cleaner needs regular care and maintenance to ensure it is functioning at its best. In this article, we delve into the importance of routinely checking and cleaning your vacuum cleaner and offer a step-by-step guide to maintaining its optimal performance. Step 1: Unplug the cord and inspect it for fraying or breaks Safety should always be the top priority when performing maintenance tasks. Unplug your vacuum cleaner before beginning any maintenance checks. Inspecting the power cord is a critical step, as frayed or broken cords can pose a significant hazard. Damaged cords can lead to electrical shorts, which may result in fires or other dangerous situations. If you notice any signs of wear or damage on the cord, consult a professional technician or consider buying a replacement to avoid potential hazards. Step 2: Wipe down the exterior with a damp cloth Regularly cleaning the exterior of your vacuum cleaner is essential in ensuring the longevity of the device. Doing so can help prevent the buildup of dust, dirt, and grime on the surface, which can potentially affect the vacuum's performance. Using a damp cloth, gently wipe down all the accessible exterior surfaces of your vacuum cleaner to remove dirt and dust. Remember to avoid using any harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbers that may damage the vacuum's finish. Step 3: Inspect and clean attachments The attachments of your vacuum cleaner are designed to help you clean a variety of surfaces and materials. However, they can also accumulate dirt and hair over time, reducing their effectiveness. Detach all the vacuum cleaner attachments and thoroughly inspect them for any debris, dirt, and hair. Use a soft brush or toothbrush to remove any accumulated hair or dirt from these accessories. Ensure they are free from any obstructions that may affect your vacuum's performance. Step 4: Wipe down and unclog the hose The vacuum hose is a crucial component that transports debris and dirt from the cleaning surface into the vacuum bag or canister. A clogged hose can significantly hamper your vacuum cleaner's performance, making it harder for the machine to pick up dirt and debris. To maintain proper function, detach the hose, straighten it out, and visually inspect it for any clogs or obstructions. Utilize a long, flexible brush or a straightened coat hanger to help dislodge any dirt or debris blocking the hose. Once the clogs are removed, wipe down the hose's exterior with a damp cloth to remove any residual dust or dirt. Conclusion: By following these straightforward maintenance steps regularly, you can extend the lifespan of your vacuum cleaner and ensure it continues to function optimally. Keeping your vacuum cleaner well-maintained not only results in a cleaner home but also saves you money in the long run by reducing the frequency of replacement or repair costs. So, make vacuum cleaner maintenance a part of your cleaning routine to enjoy the benefits of a fresh and healthy living space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Lycaenidae is the second-largest family of butterflies (behind Nymphalidae, brush-footed butterflies), with over 6,000 species worldwide, whose members are also called gossamer-winged butterflies. They constitute about 30% of the known butterfly species. - Polyommatinae, the blues, are a subfamily of gossamer-winged butterflies (Lycaenidae). It was long used to assign taxa of unclear relationships, and its contents are in need of revision. Several genera might not even belong here. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Nabokovia is a Neotropical genus of butterflies , named by Arthur Francis Hemming in honour of Vladimir Nabokov , who extensively studied the Polyommatinae subfamily .

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Emilie Autumn Liddell (born on September 22, 1979), better known by her stage name Emilie Autumn, is an American singer-songwriter, poet, violinist, and actress. Autumn's musical style has been described by her as \\"Fairy Pop\\", \\"Fantasy Rock\\" or \\"Victoriandustrial\\". It is influenced by glam rock and from plays, novels, and history, particularly the Victorian era. Performing with her all-female backup dancers Her music encompasses a wide range of styles. Autumn's vocal range is contralto, but also has the ability to perform in the dramatic soprano range. Her vocal work has been compared to Tori Amos, Kate Bush, and The Creatures. She has released two instrumental albums (On a Day... and Laced/Unlaced), and four featuring her vocals: Enchant, Opheliac, A Bit o' This & That, and \\"Fight Like A Girl\\". The 2003 album Enchant drew on \\"new age chamber music, trip hop baroque, and experimental space pop\\". Autumn layers her voice frequently, and incorporates electronics and electronic effects into her work on Enchant; she also combines strings and piano for some songs, while others feature mainly the piano or violin. The 2006 release Opheliac featured \\"cabaret, electronic, symphonic, new age, and good ol' rock & roll (and heavy on the theatrical bombast)\\". A classically trained musician, Autumn is influenced by plays, novels, and history, particularly the Victorian era. She enjoys the works of Shakespeare, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and her husband Robert, and Edgar Allan Poe. She incorporates sounds resembling Victorian machinery such as locomotives, which she noted was \\"sort of a steampunk thing\\". While a young Autumn cited Itzhak Perlman as an influence because of the happiness she believed he felt when he played, her main musical influence and inspiration is the English violinist Nigel Kennedy. Her favorite singer is Morrissey from The Smiths. She takes inspiration for her songs from her life experiences and mixes in \\"layers and layers of references, connections, other stories and metaphors\\". Autumn describes her music and style as \\"Psychotic Vaudeville Burlesque\\". She alternatively labels her music and style as \\"Victoriandustrial'\\", a term she coined, and glam rock because of her use of glitter onstage. According to Autumn, her music \\"wasn't meant to be cutesy\\" and is labeled as \\"industrial\\" mainly because of her use of drums and yelling. Her adaption of \\"O Mistress Mine\\" was praised by author and theater director Barry Edelstein as \\"a ravishing, guaranteed tearjerker\\". For her live performances, which she calls dinner theatre because of her practice of throwing tea and tea-time snacks offstage, Autumn makes use of burlesque--\\"a show that was mainly using humour and sexuality to make a mockery of things that were going on socially and politically\\"--to counterbalance the morbid topics such as abuse and self-mutilation. She incorporates handmade costumes, fire tricks, theatrics, and a female backing band, The Bloody Crumpets: Veronica Varlow, Jill Evyn (Moth), and formerly The Blessed Contessa, Lady Aprella, Little Lucina, Lady Joo Hee, Captain Vecona, Little Miss Sugarless, Mistress Jacinda, and the model Ulorin Vex.

A drunken housewife hit her husband over the head with a 7ft mirror before he retaliated by attacking her with a stun gun, a court heard yesterday. The couple were watching television and eating a Chinese takeaway following a night out when Terri Smith, 43, became overwhelmed with emotion over their ‘volatile’ 13-year marriage and launched the astonishing attack. She accused husband Antony Smith, 42, of responding by blasting her five times in the stomach with the illegal 50,000 volt ‘black cobra’ taser gun. In court: Terri Smith and her husband Antony Smith outside Chippenham Magistrates Court. She has accused him of attacking her with a stun gun. ‘I was jabbed three, four, five times in my stomach, it was a sharp stabbing pain,’ she told Chippenham magistrates. ‘I heard the clicky sound of the gun three or four times.’ Mrs Smith claimed her husband, a roof tiler, then dragged her through the front door ‘very hard by my hair’ and shut the door. ‘I threw something at the door which smashed the glass and I cut my hand,’ she said. Mr Smith allegedly then hurled his wife’s handbag outside and was said to have kicked her in the face as she picked up the contents. But magistrates cleared Mr Smith of the attack. He admitted possessing an illegal taser, but denied a charge of assault by beating and insisted he had not fired the weapon during the incident because ‘there wasn’t enough charge in it’. Presiding magistrate Roger Coleman said: ‘We find that the defendant did act in self-defence, we believe his version of events. 'The defendant’s actions were reasonable in the circumstances.’ Mr Smith will be sentenced next month for possession of the illegal stun gun. Although Mrs Smith was arrested, she faced no charges over the incident at the couple’s home in Swindon, Wiltshire, in February. She said: ‘I don’t know what came over me, I got up and flipped the coffee table over in front of us. I had so many mixed emotions. ‘I was angry about a lot of things, I was sad, I was living under pressure all the time. I grabbed the mirror from behind him and hit him with it.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"A drunken housewife, Terri Smith, attacked her husband, Antony Smith, with a 7ft mirror during a heated argument, leading Antony to retaliate using a 50,000-volt stun gun.

One of the most important properties of metallic elements is their ability to act as Lewis acids that form complexes with a variety of Lewis bases. A metal complex consists of a central metal atom or ion that is bonded to one or more ligands (from the Latinligare, meaning “to bind”), which are ions or molecules that contain one or more pairs of electrons that can be shared with the metal. Metal complexes can be neutral, such as Co(NH3)3Cl3; positively charged, such as [Nd(H2O)9]3+; or negatively charged, such as [UF8]4−. Electrically charged metal complexes are sometimes called complex ions. A coordination compound contains one or more metal complexes. Coordination compounds are important for at least three reasons. First, most of the elements in the periodic table are metals, and almost all metals form complexes, so metal complexes are a feature of the chemistry of more than half the elements. Second, many industrial catalysts are metal complexes, and such catalysts are steadily becoming more important as a way to control reactivity. For example, a mixture of a titanium complex and an organometallic compound of aluminum is the catalyst used to produce most of the polyethylene and polypropylene “plastic” items we use every day. Finally, transition-metal complexes are essential in biochemistry. Examples include hemoglobin, an iron complex that transports oxygen in our blood; cytochromes, iron complexes that transfer electrons in our cells; and complexes of Fe, Zn, Cu, and Mo that are crucial components of certain enzymes, the catalysts for all biological reactions. Metal complexes are so important in biology that we consider the topic separately in Section 23.6 \\"Transition Metals in Biology\\". Q: Hemoglobin is responsible for transporting what within our blood? A: Answer:","completion":"Hemoglobin is responsible for transporting oxygen within our blood. This iron complex plays a crucial role in the circulatory system of humans and many other organisms by binding to oxygen molecules in the lungs and carrying them through the bloodstream to cells and tissues. The oxygen is then released into the cells for cellular respiration, allowing the production of energy required for various biological processes. Hemoglobin's ability to bind and transport oxygen makes it an essential component of life and is a prime example of the importance of metal complexes, particularly transition-metal complexes, in biochemistry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H.

In 1765, the inhabitants of Arkham, Massachusetts, are suspicious of the strange phenomena surrounding the grand \\"palace\\" that overlooks the town. They suspect the palace's owner, Joseph Curwen, is a warlock. A young girl wanders up to the palace in a trance-like state. She is led by Curwen and his mistress, Hester, down into the dungeons. The girl is subjected to a strange ritual, in which an unseen creature rises up from a covered pit. The townspeople observe the girl wandering off, and they storm the palace to confront its owner. Though the girl appears unharmed, the townspeople surmise that she has been bewitched to forget what happened to her. They drag Curwen out to a tree where they intend to burn him. The mob leader, Ezra Weeden, insists that they do not harm Hester (to whom he had been previously engaged to marry). Before being burned alive, Curwen puts a curse on Arkham and its inhabitants and their descendants, promising to rise from the grave to take his revenge. In 1875, 110 years later, Curwen's great-great-grandson, Charles Dexter Ward, and his wife Anne arrive in Arkham after inheriting the palace. They find the townsfolk hostile towards them and are disturbed by the horrific deformities that afflict many of Arkham's inhabitants. Charles is surprised by how well he seems to know the palace and struck by his strong resemblance to a portrait of Curwen. He and Anne meet Simon, the palace caretaker, who persuades them to stay at the palace and to forget the townspeoples' hostility. Charles becomes more and more obsessed with the portrait of Curwen, and at times seems to change in his personality. The answer is:","completion":"The inhabitants of Arkham, who suspect Joseph Curwen of being a warlock due to the strange phenomena surrounding his palace, take matters into their own hands after witnessing the bizarre occurrence involving a young girl who enters the palace in a trance-like state and is escorted by Curwen and Hester into the dungeons. Believing that the girl has been bewitched to forget the incident, the townspeople decide to confront Curwen directly. They storm the palace, intent on dealing with the perceived threat posed by the suspected warlock. Although the girl appears physically unharmed, the townspeople's suspicions regarding Curwen's sinister activities are only reinforced. The Arkham inhabitants, led by Ezra Weeden, proceed to capture Curwen and drag him out to a tree where they plan to burn him alive as punishment for his alleged misdeeds. Despite Weeden's insistence on sparing Hester from the same fate due to their previous engagement, Curwen is not shown the same mercy. Having been labelled a warlock, he is deemed too dangerous to be allowed to live. Before meeting his fiery end, Curwen casts a curse on the entire town of Arkham, as well as its present and future inhabitants, vowing to rise from the grave and exact his vengeance upon those who have wronged him. This ominous prediction comes to a head 110 years later when Curwen's great-great-grandson, Charles Dexter Ward, inherits the palace and arrives in Arkham with his wife Anne, only to be met with hostility and a series of chilling events that call into question the truth behind Curwen's curse."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"This resulted in an exodus of civilians from Egyptian cities along the Suez Canal's western bank.\\" correctly answer the question of Who would get to attack Israel from Lebanon?","completion":"No, the statement \\"This resulted in an exodus of civilians from Egyptian cities along the Suez Canal's western bank\\" does not correctly answer the question of who would get to attack Israel from Lebanon. The statement mainly discusses the movement of civilians in Egypt due to a specific event but does not provide any information about an entity attacking Israel from Lebanon. However, I can provide a detailed analysis of the different entities that have or could potentially attack Israel from Lebanon. The question of who would get to attack Israel from Lebanon is quite complex, as it involves various political, historical, and strategic aspects. Lebanon shares a border with Israel and has a history of conflicts and tensions between the parties. Throughout history, different groups have attacked Israel from Lebanese territory or have actively sought to do so. Prominent groups and entities that have targeted Israel from Lebanon include: 1. Palestinian militant groups: During the 1960s-1980s, Palestinian militant groups, such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), launched attacks on Israel from Lebanon. These attacks led to various conflicts in the region, including the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, which aimed at removing the PLO from the country. 2. Hezbollah: Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based Shia militant group, is considered the most significant threat to Israel from Lebanon. Formed in the 1980s and backed by Iran and Syria, Hezbollah has engaged in multiple conflicts with Israel since its inception. Hezbollah's major offensives against Israel include the 1990s' \\"South Lebanon conflict\\" and the more recent 2006 Lebanon War (also known as the Second Lebanon War or the Israel-Hezbollah War). Many experts believe that the group still possesses thousands of rockets and missiles, making them an ongoing threat to Israel's security. 3. Islamic State (ISIS) and Al-Qaeda-affiliated groups: Lebanon has also witnessed the presence of radical Islamist groups, such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda affiliates, who have an interest in attacking Israel. However, their foothold in Lebanon remains limited compared to Hezbollah. These are the primary entities that have targeted or expressed desires to attack Israel from Lebanon. The volatile nature of the region, combined with the varying political interests of neighboring countries such as Syria and Iran, creates a complicated environment in which attacks on Israel could be initiated. Therefore, the question of who would get to attack Israel from Lebanon depends on the specific context, political landscape, and ongoing tensions between the involved parties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the given statement, we have a few key elements: 1. A trio of soccer players: This tells us that there are specifically three soccer players involved. 2. Play on the field: This indicates that the players are actively engaged in the soccer game. 3. As a crowd looks on: This suggests that the event is being watched by an audience. Now, let's break down the conclusion statement and see if it matches the information provided in the original statement. 1. A group of soccer players: The term \\"group\\" is more generic and does not necessarily imply a specific number of players. While three players can be considered a group, the original statement provides more specific information, so we should stick to the term \\"trio\\" when referring to the number of soccer players. 2. Are sitting on the bend on the field: This contradicts the information given in the original statement, which indicates that the players are actively playing on the field. There is no mention of the players sitting or being on a bend on the field. 3. No mention of the crowd: The conclusion statement does not reference the audience that is watching the game, which is an important detail present in the original statement.

Article: Syrian government forces will not receive the first shipment of S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems until the middle of next year, Russian media have reported. One defence source told the Kommersant daily that according to contracts signed in 2010, Moscow is due to deliver six sets of the S-300 systems by spring 2014. Another source said it would take another six months for the Syrian military to be trained to use them. The report contradicts assertions made on Thursday by Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, that the systems were on their way. The Vedomosti newspaper reported that Russia would send four S-300 systems to Syria as part of a contract worth 1bn (£660m), but that it was unclear when the arms would arrive. The S-300 contracts were signed roughly a year before civil unrest against Assad's regime erupted in March 2011. Russia's foreign ministry has been reluctant to discuss an exact time frame for the missile shipments. Earlier this week, the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said he wasn't able to confirm when the S-300s would arrive. \\"I can only say that we won't cancel the contracts,\\" he said. The foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has been similarly reticent. Separately, Russian officials have said that a new contract to sell updated MiG warplanes to Syria is being finalised with Syrian officials in Moscow. Sergei Korotkov, CEO of the MiG company, told journalists outside Moscow that his company had agreed with a Syrian military delegation to deliver at least 10 MiG-29MM2 aircraft. Analysts said the move was a further show by the Syrian leadership that western powers should think twice before becoming more deeply embroiled in the war. \\"Evidently the Syrian government feels confident and wants to show that it's buying modern weapons aimed at countering foreign aggression,\\" said Igor Korotchenko, editor of National Defense magazine and a former defence ministry employee. \\"Such warplanes aren't used against rebels, because that would bring new sanctions against Syria,\\" he said, although video footage is frequently posted purporting to show MiGs bombing built-up urban areas. \\"The war with the rebels is waged using infantry, Kalashnikov automatic rifles, tanks and armoured vehicles,\\" he said. Korotchenko described the MiG 29MM2 as a multifunctional craft that can be used to attack targets on land and sea. The analyst said Assad's father had bought so many tanks, rifles and armoured vehicles that the current regime had no need for new purchases to wage war against the rebels. \\"The Syrian government needs modern means of waging war, including S-300s, anti-missile systems and warplanes. These are essential if foreign powers such as the US and Britain impose a no-fly zone or launch air strikes on Syria.\\" Korotchenko said it was highly unlikely Russia had already delivered shipments of S-300s to Syria, saying the weapons were bulky and US and Israeli intelligence would have easily spotted them using satellite observation. \\"You can't hide S-300s in your pocket. If they had been delivered, western intelligence would have made an announcement.\\" An aide to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, refused comment on the possible delivery of S-300 anti-aircraft systems to Syria. \\"I wouldn't like to comment on the specifics, whether it's the first delivery or the second. I don't know which delivery you're talking about,\\" said Yury Ushakov, the aide, according to the RIA Novosti news agency. \\"But I would like to stress that the Russian side isn't delivering any weapons that would fall under the relevant international bans,\\" the Kremlin official said. Assad said on Thursday that it was \\"not our policy to talk publicly about military issues in terms of what we possess or what we receive\\". During an interview with al-Manar TV, broadcast on Thursday, he said: \\"As far as Russia is concerned, the contracts have nothing to do with the crisis. We have negotiated with them on different kinds of weapons for years, and Russia is committed to honouring these contracts.\\" He said the ongoing crisis in Syria had not affected arms imports. \\"All of our agreements with Russia will be implemented, some have been implemented during the past period and, together with the Russians, we will continue to implement these contracts in the future.\\" ||||| 1 of 2. Forces of Syrian President Bashar al Assad are seen on a tank in Arjoun village near Qusair town May 30, 2013. MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia could speed up delivery of anti-aircraft missiles to Syria if the West intervenes, but also floated the idea of suspending the shipment, Russian media reported on Friday, as Moscow set out its negotiating position ahead of peace talks. A Russian arms industry source was quoted by Interfax news agency as threatening to hasten delivery of the hotly-contested S-300 missiles if the West were to impose a no-fly zone or Israel were to launch new air strikes. However the source also \\"did not exclude that the delivery of the S-300 to Syria could be frozen for a period of time\\" Interfax reported, comparing the move to the delivery of another weapons system that was suspended by Moscow. Russia's arms industry is firmly controlled by the state, and it is unlikely the unidentified source would be authorized to speak without the blessing of the Kremlin. Russia and the West are staking out positions with parallel threats to arm the warring sides ahead of a peace conference next month, the first attempt in a year by the global powers on either side in Syria's civil war to look for a way to end it. French President Francois Hollande said it was unacceptable for Moscow to talk about arming the Syrian government ahead of the conference, even as he repeated his own threats to arm the rebels fighting against President Bashar al-Assad. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also criticized Russia for discussing arms sales to Assad. Yuri Ushakov, President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy aide, said it was the EU's decision last week to lift its embargo on arming the rebels that was \\"not conducive to preparations for such an important international event\\" as the Geneva conference. Paris and London say they wanted the embargo lifted ahead of the peace talks to gain leverage over Assad and Moscow. In another signal that Moscow is prepared to arm Assad, the head of aircraft maker MiG was quoted as saying he still plans to send Syria at least 10 MiG-29 fighters under a 2007 contract. WORRYING Particularly worrying for the West is Moscow's plans to fulfill a 2010 contract to send Assad the S-300, an advanced anti-aircraft missile system that could make it far more dangerous to impose a no-fly zone, and could threaten planes deep inside the air space of Israel or NATO-member Turkey. The Russian arms industry source said the S-300 missiles could not arrive in Syria for months, but the pace of delivery would be determined by the behavior of Assad's foes. \\"Regarding the deliveries of the S-300, they can begin no earlier than the autumn,\\" the source said. \\"Technically it's possible, but much will depend on how the situation develops in the region and the position of Western countries.\\" Without naming Israel specifically, Interfax paraphrased the source as saying: \\"Air attacks on Syria from the side of a neighboring government or the introduction of a so-called no-fly zone above Syria may serve as a pretext for speeding up the deliveries of the S-300.\\" Israel, which has bombed Syria at least three times in recent months to prevent Assad from transferring arms to his Lebanese Hezbollah militia allies, has urgently called on Moscow to scrap the S-300 deliveries, as have Western countries. France's Hollande set out his country's position - shared with Britain and other allies - that the West must be able to arm the rebels as long as Moscow is arming Assad. \\"We cannot accept that when we are preparing Geneva 2 (talks) with the idea of finding a political solution, that Russia is delivering weapons at the same time to Assad's regime, and that we should be (prevented) from delivering weapons to the opposition,\\" Hollande said. \\"To ensure the political solution happens, you should never put aside the option of military pressure, and in this case it is lifting the EU embargo.\\" \\"PRETTY GOOD AIR DEFENCES\\" Russian daily Vedomosti has reported that Assad bought four units of the modernized S-300PMU-2 system for nearly 1 billion. The S-300 can track targets up to 300 km (190 miles) away and can hit at a range of up to 200 km, sparking Israeli fears that Assad's reach could extend well into the Jewish state and threaten flights over its main commercial airport near Tel Aviv. Western experts say the missiles would enhance Assad's Russian-supplied arsenal of short-range Pantsir missiles and medium-range BUK missile systems. A source close to the Russian Defense Ministry said Assad would use his other air Defense systems to guard the S-300, giving him \\"pretty good\\" air defenses. Russia has been Assad's most powerful diplomatic ally in a conflict that has killed more than 80,000 people since March 2011. Along with China, it has vetoed three U.N. Security Council resolutions aimed at pressuring Assad to end violence. RIA news agency quoted the head of MiG as saying he was discussing terms for the fighter jets with a Syrian delegation in Moscow now. It did not say when delivery was expected. Russia had planned to begin delivering last year on a 600 million contract for 12 MiG-29MM2 fighter jets signed in 2007, with an option for 12 more. The jets are to be equipped with air-to-air and air-to-surface rockets, making them a tough enemy if a \\"no-fly zone\\" were imposed. The source close to the Defense Ministry said Syrian troops would need to be trained on the S-300 in Russia's southern province of Astrakhan. Former Russian Air Force Commander General Anatoly Kornukov told Interfax such training would need a minimum of two to four weeks. The S-300s themselves would be ready for use \\"within five minutes after the delivery\\", he said. Israeli newspaper Haaretz has quoted National Security Adviser Yaakov Amidror as telling European diplomats that Israel would \\"prevent the S-300 missiles from becoming operational\\".

This contradicts earlier claims made by Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, that the systems were already on their way. The acquisition of S-300 anti-aircraft systems would be a significant upgrade for Syria's military capabilities, providing them with an advanced defense measure against any potential foreign air attacks. Furthermore, Russian officials have revealed that a new contract to sell updated MiG warplanes to Syria is being finalized with Syrian officials in Moscow. The delivery of at least 10 MiG-29MM2 aircraft has been agreed upon between the MiG company and the Syrian military delegation. These warplanes are primarily designed to counter foreign aggression, and their deployment sends a clear message to Western powers regarding Syria's determination to protect its sovereignty. The buildup of Syria's military capabilities, particularly through the acquisition of S-300 systems and MiG warplanes, is a strategic move by the Assad regime to deter any foreign intervention in the ongoing conflict. These advanced weapons are essential for the Syrian government to uphold their defense against potential air strikes or the imposition of a no-fly zone by foreign powers, such as the US and Britain."},{"prompt":"Title: Time to relax & dream to Till Broenners Oceana!

The Ukulele is being taught to Matthew by Justin in class. Choices: [a]. Matthew must be the person teaching. [b]. Justin must be the person teaching.","completion":"[b]. Justin must be the person teaching. The sun illuminated the classroom through large windows as the students waited for their much-anticipated ukulele lesson. Justin, a well-experienced musician, had been teaching an extracurricular music course at St. Andrew's Academy for the past three years. He had a natural gift for connecting with students and was known for his ability to simplify complicated concepts in a fun and engaging manner. Matthew, a quiet and introverted student with a deep love for music, had eagerly signed up for Justin's ukulele course. He had invariably been captivated by the pleasing strums of a ukulele. Listening to the tiny guitar-like instrument somehow transported him to an entirely different world with its beautiful harmony of sounds. As the lesson began, Justin picked up his ukulele and started by explaining the basics: how to hold the instrument, proper finger placement, and tuning techniques. Matthew watched and listened intently, absorbing every detail. Justin then moved on to demonstrate various chord progressions using soothing, well-known songs as examples. Matthew, in awe of Justin's command of the instrument, had a hard time believing that he could ever achieve the same level of proficiency as his teacher, let alone excel in the art himself. \\"Okay, now it's your turn,\\" Justin said to Matthew, handing over the instrument with a comforting smile. \\"I want you to try strumming a C major chord.\\" Matthew cautiously took the ukulele from his teacher. The student's hands felt slightly shaky, betraying the young musician's nervousness. As he attempted to press his fingers to form the chord, Justin noticed this unease and shared a few calming words of encouragement. \\"Don't worry, Matthew. You'll get the hang of this in no time,\\" he reassured, placing a hand gently on the student's shoulder. With renewed courage, Matthew tried again and miraculously produced a sweet, melodic sound. He looked up at Justin, eyes shining with excitement and gratitude. The two spent the rest of the lesson working on different chord progressions, and Matthew began to grow more confident in his abilities, thanks to Justin's patient guidance. Over the semester, Matthew's dedication, combined with Justin's expertise, bore fruit in the form of significant improvement in the student's ukulele skills. Not only did Matthew learn to play a variety of chords and songs, but he also began understanding the subtleties of music theory, something that elevated his knowledge to a whole new level. It was during their final lesson together when Justin decided to surprise Matthew. Handing him a piece of paper, he asked him to read aloud its contents. \\"Your hard work and passion have paid off, Matthew. I'm proud to announce that you have been selected as the ukulele player for our upcoming school concert!\\" Matthew's face lit up with a mixture of shock and joy. He had never imagined that he would end up on stage as a performer, especially given his timid and introspective nature. At the concert, Matthew's performance was met with roaring applause. It was evident to everyone present that this newfound talent of his was no mere fluke. Most importantly, his success served as a testament to the power of having an exceptional teacher like Justin, who instilled confidence, knowledge, and passion into his students."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible A: windows, trunks, four wheels, seat belts, diesel engines Why is \\"seat belts\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Seat belts\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it fulfills the following logical steps: 1. Understanding the question: The question mentions \\"safety concerns\\" and asks which feature in the list of possible answers has been made mandatory due to this reason. This directs us to look for an answer that has a strong impact on improving safety. 2. Eliminating irrelevant options: We can eliminate the following options based on their relevance to safety: - Windows: Though they provide visibility and security, they are not directly linked to accident safety. - Trunks: Trunks are primarily for storage purposes and don't significantly affect safety. - Four wheels: While it affects stability, it is not a safety feature implemented specifically to address safety concerns. Additionally, there are vehicles with different numbers of wheels (e.g., motorcycles have two wheels). - Diesel engines: Engine type is more related to fuel efficiency and performance rather than safety. 3. Identifying the correct option: Among the remaining option, \\"seat belts\\" is directly related to safety. Seat belts are designed to secure occupants in their seats and reduce the risk of injury or death during collisions or sudden stops. They have been proven to be effective in reducing fatalities and injuries in road accidents. This aligns with the aspect of \\"safety concerns\\" mentioned in the question.

Group P had larger logs, while group Q had small twigs, sawdust and kindlings. But I can use this background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.

Victims of the payment protection insurance pay-outs scandal are more likely to have spent their compensation on holidays or a new car than squirrelled the money away into savings, research suggests. Nearly one quarter (24 per cent) of people who have had a PPI payout said they put the money towards a holiday, a survey for the website VoucherCodesPro.co.uk found. On average, successful claimants said they had received £2,810 - but those who spent the money said it took just two and-a-half weeks typically before all the cash was gone. According to recent figures, Lloyds' PPI costs now total a potential £9.825bn. For all banks the bill is approaching £20bn. Nearly one quarter of people who have had a PPI payout said they put the money towards a holiday. One fifth (22 per cent) of those who had received compensation said they had used the cash to buy a new vehicle and a similar proportion (19 per cent) bought a home appliance. Only around one in seven (13 per cent) people who received compensation put the money they had received into savings, while 17 per cent used it to pay off household bills. One in 10 (10 per cent) splashed out on new clothes and one in 20 (5 per cent) compensation recipients treated themselves to new shoes. PPI, which will cover a borrower’s loan repayments if they stop being able to earn money for some reason, is the biggest scandal that the financial ombudsman has ever seen. The ombudsman still gets around around 6,000 new PPI complaints a week from consumers who have been unable to come to an agreement with a financial firm. The ombudsman still gets around around 6,000 new PPI complaints a week from consumers. The insurance was often added on to loans or credit cards without people realising. Some people were given the 'hard sell' or found such policies were unsuitable for their circumstances. According to figures from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) a total of £13.3 billion has been paid out in PPI compensation since January 2011. VoucherCodesPro.co.uk surveyed more than 2,000 people from across the UK who had purchased PPI at some point, of which nearly one quarter (22 per cent) said they had received compensation arising from a mis-sold PPI claim. Those who received compensation were allowed to select more than one answer when asked what they had spent the money on. PPI was designed to protect borrowers' payments. If the borrower lost their job, had to take maternity leave or suffered from loss of income that they could not make repayments the insurance would have protected them to cover the costs until the policyholder is able to again. The misselling of PPI grew into the biggest financial scandal in the UK within the past five years and has cost banks millions of pounds. Action wasn't taken until 2005 when the Financial Service Authority (FSA) took over regulation of the general isurance market. Citizens Advice also issued a complaint to the Office of Fair Trading. That complaint included evidence of:. Excessively high prices.Only partial protection, with many exclusions which prevent many seemingly reasonable claims.Mis-selling, including high pressures sales tactics.A slow and often unfair claims process when consumers were eligible to claim. In January 2009, a year after the OFT handed its investigation over to them, the Competition Commission recommended that sales of PPI be banned alongside lending products such as credit cards and loans. In August 2010, the FSA published its PPI consultation paper which recommended that banks who had engaged in mis-selling should compensate all the customers who had been sold products using the same methods. The British Banking Association (BBA), a trade body for all UK banks, appealed against the FSA rules by seeking a judicial review to have them annulled or curtailed. By May 2010, 30 per cent of all cases coming in to the Financial Ombudsman Service concerned PPI. Highlights:","completion":"1.

The process you are describing resembles cellular respiration, so let me provide an accurate description of the final stages of this process. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from glucose and oxygen. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process: 1. Oxygen is inhaled through the nose or mouth and enters the lungs. 2. The oxygen diffuses from the lungs into the bloodstream, where it is carried by hemoglobin in red blood cells. 3. Blood circulation transports oxygen and glucose to individual cells throughout the body. 4. Within the cells, glucose is broken down through a process called glycolysis, which takes place in the cytoplasm and produces pyruvate (a 3-carbon molecule) and a small amount of ATP. 5. Pyruvate enters the mitochondria and undergoes the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), releasing carbon dioxide as a waste product. 6. The carbon dioxide produced during the citric acid cycle diffuses from the cells into the bloodstream, where it is carried back to the lungs. 7. The final step involves exhaling carbon dioxide from the body through the lungs. As one breathes out, carbon dioxide is expelled through the mouth or nose into the atmosphere. So, the last step of the process is exhaling carbon dioxide from the body."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: By. Rob Cooper. PUBLISHED:. 05:01 EST, 3 April 2013. |. UPDATED:. 10:11 EST, 3 April 2013. Football manager Paulo Di Canio is caught on camera grieving at the funeral of an Italian fascist connected with a terrorist attack which killed 85 people. The controversial new Sunderland boss was present when Paolo Signorelli was laid to rest and fellow mourners gave the right-arm salute as the coffin was carried out of the church. Di Canio, 44, refused to discuss his. political views as he was unveiled as manager of the struggling Premier. League side yesterday. Scroll down to see the press conference. Fascist salute: Paulo Di Canio was at Paolo Signorelli's funeral where mourners gave the right-arm Fascist salute as the 76-year-old's body was carried out of the church. Mourner: Di Canio, centre, at Mr Signorelli's funeral in December 2010. The extreme-right activist was held in prison on remand for eight years over a terrorist bombing which killed 85 people in 1980. He dismissed questions about his views as 'ridiculous and pathetic'. Asked if he is still a fascist he said: 'I don't have to answer that question any more.' But Di Canio issued a statement today, stating: 'I am not political, I do not affiliate myself to any organisation, I am not a racist and I do not support the ideology of fascism. I respect everyone.' The pictures emerged today after the political storm over the Italian's appointment intensified when a miners' group asked the club to return an iconic banner which hangs in its. stadium in protest. Signorelli, who died aged 76 in December 2010, had been a senior member of the Italian Socialist movement which grew out of the collapse of Benito Mussolini's Fascist party after World War II. He spent eight years in jail on remand after a bomb was set off killing 85 people at Bologna railway station in 1980. Terror outrage: 85 people were killed in the 1980 bombing of Bologna train station. Paolo Signorelli spent eight years on remand while awaiting trial but was eventually cleared of involvement on appeal. Although he was initially convicted he was cleared on appeal because of insufficient evidence. But he was still found guilty of being part of an 'armed band' and a 'subversion against democracy', The Sun reported. Di Canio is understood to have been a frequent visitor to the far right politician's home in the final years of his life. Three days after the appointment of Di Canio, the row has shown no sign of abating. Labour MP David Miliband resigned from his position on the Sunderland board after the controversial Italian was installed as boss. And the general secretary of the Durham Miners' Association, which has close links to the Sunderland, has spoken out against Di Canio and his far-right views. First day: Paolo Di Canio takes control of a training session today for the first time after being appointed Sunderland manager. Controversy: Di Canio at the funeral of Mr Signorelli. The picture emerged today after the new Sunderland manager refused to discuss his political views at a press conference. Sunderland's ground, the Stadium of. Light, is named after a Davy lamp in honour of its location on the. former site of Wearmouth Colliery. Adding to the team's association with the mining industry, it hosts the Wearmouth Miners' Banner on permanent display. But. Dave Hopper, who worked at the colliery for 27 years and now heads the. miners' union, has asked the club to return the commemorative object. 'I,. like many thousands of miners, have supported Sunderland from infancy. and we are passionate about football,' he said. 'But there are. principles which are much more important. ‘Our. banner represents the Durham miners’ long struggle for the rights of. the working class, rights which were annihilated by fascism in Germany,. Italy, Spain and Chile. Quit: Labour MP David Miliband resigned as a director of the club after Di Canio's appointment. Iconic: This miners' banner has long hung at the club's Stadium of Light, but a union leader has called for it to be returned over the new manager's fascist links. ‘We have a sacred obligation to the. millions who were wiped out by Hitler, Mussolini and Franco to oppose. fascism wherever and in whatever context this evil creed raises its. head, particularly at a time when working people are again being forced. to pay for capitalism’s crisis as they were in Europe in the 1920s and. 1930s. ‘The appointment. of Di Canio is a disgrace and a betrayal of all who fought and died in. the fight against fascism. Everyone must speak out and oppose this. outrage and call on Ellis Short [club owner/chairman] and the Sunderland. board to reverse their decision.' Di. Canio had a distinguished but controversial playing career for. teams including Lazio, Juventus and West Ham United, and entered. management with Swindon Town in 2011. He. was fined for giving a fascist salute to ultra-nationalist fans of. Lazio, and defended himself saying: 'I am a fascist, not a racist.' Asked yesterday if. the focus on politics was making his job more difficult, he said: 'No. Because always there is an issue if people try to put you in difficulty. for a ridiculous and pathetic situation which doesn't represent Paolo Di. Canio. So I'm not worried.' When. he was pressed on the issue of his political beliefs, Di Canio replied:. 'The people talking about this are offending my parents - I don't give. the chance to offend my parents and my daughter.' Controversy: Di Canio has refused to answer questions about his political views since being appointed manager of Sunderland. Bullish: The manager has repeatedly dodged questions about his apparent fascist sympathies. Gesture: Di Canio controversially giving a fascist salute to ultra-nationalist Lazio fans in 2005. Ground: The Stadium of Light is named after the Davy lamp and built on the site of a colliery.

The two friends were in search of a gift to bring to a birthday party they were attending later that afternoon. As they entered the bustling shopping center, they were greeted by the pleasant aroma of freshly baked goods wafting from a nearby bakery. They both looked at each other and exchanged knowing smiles; it was going to be a great day. As they strolled through the mall, they passed rows of enticing shops, each offering an array of tempting items. However, they remained focused on their mission – to find the perfect, soft and fruity candy for Adam. Craig remembered a candy store that he had visited a few months ago, \\"Dulce Delights,\\" which seemed to have an endless variety of candy. He was confident that it would have just what they were looking for. Upon arriving at the store, they were awestruck by the vibrant colors, jars filled with candy of all shapes and sizes, and the sweet-smelling aroma that filled the air. Excitedly, they dove into their search, scanning the shelves for the perfect treat. Craig spotted a shelf filled with gummy candies and immediately thought of Adam's love for anything soft and chewy. He noticed a bag marked \\"Tropical Fruit Gummies,\\" which boasted exotic flavors like mango, pineapple, and passion fruit. He thought of how much Adam enjoyed tropical flavors and believed these would be a great choice. At the same time, Adam was intrigued by a collection of artisanal fruit-flavored hard candies. While they may not have been as soft as gummy candies, they promised a long-lasting flavor experience. The delicate packaging and notably higher price suggested these were no ordinary candies. Adam wondered if these would be a good option, as they seemed more unique and thoughtful. In the end, they both brought their finds to the counter to make their decisions. (1) Craig made a good choice. As they compared the two options, Craig was adamant that the gummy candies would be perfect for Adam. He reminded Adam of his love for chewy candies and pointed out the tropical flavors that he knew Adam would enjoy. Finally, convinced by Craig's enthusiasm, Adam agreed to go with the tropical gummies. As it turns out, the gummies were a huge hit at the party. Not only did Adam love them, but the other guests devoured them as well, delighted by their soft, chewy texture and exquisite flavors. They all raved about the candy, grateful for Craig's thoughtful and delicious choice. While the artisanal hard candies may have been unique, the crowd-pleasing nature of the gummies confirmed that Craig had made a good decision. (2) Adam made a good choice. Although Craig suggested the tropical fruit gummies, Adam couldn't shake the allure of the artisanal hard candies. He argued that while gummies were popular, these handcrafted candies could add a sophisticated touch to the birthday party. Intrigued by the notion of offering something unique and special, Craig ultimately agreed with Adam's choice. At the party, their gift was indeed met with curiosity and excitement. Guests marveled at the beauty of the packaging and the slow-release, intense fruit flavors of the hard candies. They were admired not only for their taste but also for their elegance.

The Marxist critique of capitalism — developed with Friedrich Engels — was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the Twentieth Century. The industrial revolution produced a parallel revolution in political thought. Urbanization and capitalism greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the socialist movement began to form. In the mid-19th century, Marxism was developed, and socialism in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, and Fidel Castro. Though Hegel's philosophy of history is similar to Immanuel Kant's, and Karl Marx's theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel's dialectic, which was \\"standing on its head\\", \\"the right side up again\\". Unlike Marx who believed in historical materialism, Hegel believed in the Phenomenology of Spirit. By the late 19th century, socialism and trade unions were established members of the political landscape.

Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift.

This species can be found from South America to northern Mexico . The species can be found from Mexico to northern South America . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"These two sentences convey a similar meaning, but with a slight difference in emphasis and direction. Both sentences indicate that the species in question is distributed within a geographic range that encompasses parts of South and Central America and northern Mexico. However, the order in which these locations are mentioned creates a subtle distinction between the sentences. The first sentence, \\"This species can be found from South America to northern Mexico,\\" emphasizes the starting point of the species' distribution in South America and implies a directionality progressing northward towards Mexico. The focus is placed on South America as the primary origin, and readers might infer that the species has expanded its range toward northern Mexico. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"The species can be found from Mexico to northern South America,\\" reverses the order of the geographic locations and indicates a starting point in Mexico with a southward progression toward northern South America. In this case, the emphasis is on Mexico as the primary origin, and the species' expansion appears directed towards northern South America. While both sentences describe the same geographic range, they imply different directional trends in the species' distribution. However, it is important to note that these inferences are subtle and may not always be key information for every context. Generally speaking, the sentences can be read as indicating the same distribution range, with the focus shifting slightly between South America and Mexico due to the order of the mentioned locations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: No one can deny that buttons are an important clothing device. But, can they rise to the level of art? Organizers of an exhibit in New York think so. Peter Souleo Wright organized \\"The Button Show\\" at Rush Arts Gallery in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Eleven artists used the small, ordinary objects to create sculptures, portraits and wearable art. Some of the works are political, some are personal and others are just fun. Wright said each artist reimagines and repurposes the buttons to make art. \\"What I tried to do with this show,\\" he said , \\"was to look at artists who were promoting that level of craft.\\" He said he wanted the button art to be comparable to a painting \\"because of the amount of detail and precision in the work\\". Artist Beau McCall produced \\"A Harlem Hangover\\". It looks like a wine bottle that fell over on a table. A stream of connected red buttons hang over the side, like wine flowing down. Similar red buttons form a small pool on the floor. McCall layers buttons of different shapes and sizes to create the bottle. The stitching that holds them together is also part of the artistic design. For San Francisco-based artist Lisa Kokin, buttons are highly personal. After her father died in 2001, she created a portrait of him using only buttons. That memorial to her father led to other button portraits, including those of activists Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez. Others use buttons for details. Artist Amalia Amaki of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, placed them on and around old photographs. Los Angeles artist Camilla Taylor attached buttons to three large sculptures that look like headless animals with long , narrow legs. \\"The Button Show\\" ends at March 12. The Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation paid for the exhibition. The foundation was created in 1995 by the Simmons brothers: artist Danny, hip-hop producer Russell and rapper Rev. Run.

They have webbed feet (f). running and lifting (g). heat energy (h). prevents the transfer of heat A:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"How do beavers move through water quickly?\\" based on the hints provided by your teacher would be \\"(e). They have webbed feet\\". The clues provided suggest that aquatic animals, such as beavers, employ webbed feet to navigate through water at a quicker pace. To further elaborate on this, webbed feet essentially entail the presence of a membrane of skin connecting each of the toes. This characteristic is frequently seen in animals that have adapted to living in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. There are several reasons why webbing aids these creatures in their locomotion in water. First, the webbing between the toes of these animals increases the surface area of their feet. When a beaver paddles its feet in the water, the webbed foot can push against a larger amount of water with each stroke as compared to a foot without webbing. This enables the beaver to apply more force onto the water and, therefore, move at a faster speed. Second, the webbed feet of a beaver also provide an additional benefit of better control while swimming. When a beaver lifts its foot, water can pass over the webbing, thereby reducing drag and allowing the beaver to lift its foot more effortlessly and quickly for the next stroke. This characteristic further aids in the enhanced speed of the beaver in water. In summary, beavers, being primarily aquatic creatures, have developed adaptations such as having webbed feet. These special adaptations enable them to efficiently and swiftly move through water. Hence, the statement \\"They have webbed feet\\" best answers the question of how beavers can move through water quickly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Question: \\"How did brasseries become popular?\\" Context: \\"In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \\"bistro\\" means \\"quickly\\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The popularity of brasseries can be attributed to several factors including their origins, evolution over time, and the unique blend of food, drink, and atmosphere that they offer. 1. Origins of brasseries: Brasseries originated as taverns next to breweries in the 19th century. They served beer and food at any hour to accommodate the needs of factory workers, laborers, and other locals. The convenience of having a place nearby to grab a quick meal and a drink without worrying about strict dining hours attracted many customers. 2. Paris Exposition of 1867: The Paris Exposition of 1867 introduced the brasserie concept to a wider audience. During this time, brasseries featured beer and other beverages served by young women dressed in traditional attire, which created a unique and inviting atmosphere. The mix of cultural elements, such as German costumes serving beer, further enhanced the experience and drew in more patrons. 3. Flexible hours and diverse menu: Unlike traditional restaurants, which often have limited hours and a more formal atmosphere, brasseries offer a more relaxed and casual vibe. They serve food and drinks throughout the day, making them an attractive option for diners with varying schedules. Over time, their menus have diversified, featuring dishes ranging from sandwiches and salads to more elaborate French fare. 4. Meeting place for artists and intellectuals: In the 20th century, brasseries in Paris became popular gathering spots for artists, writers, and philosophers. Establishments such as Café de la Rotonde, Le Dôme Café, Café de Flore, and Les Deux Magots hosted important cultural and political discussions, ultimately becoming a part of Parisian history and lore. This cultural significance further entrenched the popularity of brasseries. 5. Focus on camaraderie and atmosphere: Brasseries emphasize a convivial ambiance, which appeals to a wide range of clientele. The casual environment encourages socialization and conversation, making them an ideal choice for friends and family to gather and enjoy each other's company. 6. Adaptation to modern tastes: Modern brasseries have adapted to the evolving preferences of Parisian diners, incorporating ethnic flavors and ingredients into their menus when necessary. This flexibility has allowed them to remain competitive in the face of increasing competition from other restaurant types. In conclusion, the popularity of brasseries rose through a combination of historical events, unique aspects such as their flexible hours, diverse menus, cultural atmosphere, and their adaptability to modern tastes. Brasseries have not only provided a place for people to enjoy food and drinks but have also acted as a hub for intellectual and cultural exchanges in Paris. This rich history and continued evolution make brasseries an enduring fixture in the Parisian culinary landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer should be","completion":"b). Walking up and down stairs can be especially helpful to shift a baby in the right position for birth. Shift around when you're lying down. In addition to simply walking, going up and down stairs can provide additional benefits when it comes to getting your baby into the correct position for birth. The uneven movements and changes in elevation can encourage the baby to shift even more effectively in the uterus, promoting the optimal fetal positioning. This positioning can make it easier for your cervix to dilate and for contractions to progress in a more efficient manner. Moreover, it's important to change your position when lying down. Instead of lying in one position for an extended period, try varying your posture by using cushions and pillows to prop yourself up in different ways. This can help prevent discomfort and allow the baby to continue moving and adjusting as necessary. In summary, while engaging in physical activities like walking and walking up and down stairs, make sure to also pay attention to your resting positions to ensure that the baby remains in an optimal position for a smoother labor process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

Question: I can use this background: To determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution, an acid-base titration is commonly performed. A strong base solution with a known concentration, usually NaOH or KOH, is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added.[7] The titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes, with the base volume on the x-axis and the solution's pH value on the y-axis. The pH of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution. Now, I have a new situation: Due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere more an more carbon dioxide is mixing with ocean water - thus increasing the acidity of the world's oceans. Rob is a climate scientist. He is measuring the acidity of the Atlantic ocean and the Pacific Ocean. To determine ocean water acidity he performed an acid-base titration. His conclusion is that Atlantic Ocean's acidity reached higher level than Pacific Ocean's acidity. Answer this question please: In which ocean's acidity test Rob would have to add less base, Atlantic Ocean or Pacific ocean? Answer:","completion":"Rob would have to add less base in the Atlantic Ocean's acidity test. The reason for this is based on the principles of acid-base titration and Rob's conclusion that the Atlantic Ocean's acidity is higher than that of the Pacific Ocean. Acid-base titration is a process used to determine the concentration of an acid. This process involves adding a known quantity of a strong base solution (usually NaOH or KOH) to the acidic solution until it is neutralized, which is usually indicated by a color change of the indicator that is added to the solution. In an acidic solution, the number of hydrogen ions (H+) will be higher than hydroxide ions (OH-). The added base neutralizes the acid by combining with the hydrogen ions to form water (H2O), thus reducing the number of free hydrogen ions in the solution, which subsequently increases the pH of the solution. This means that the more acidic a solution is, the more base it would require to neutralize the acid and increase pH to a neutral level. Hence, given Rob's conclusion that the Atlantic Ocean is more acidic than the Pacific Ocean, it would require more base to neutralize the higher acidity in the Atlantic Ocean. On the other hand, the Pacific Ocean, having a lower acidity level, would require less base in its acidity test due to its lower concentration of free hydrogen ions. Consequently, Rob would have to add less base in the Pacific Ocean's acidity test as compared to that of the Atlantic Ocean. It's important to remember that the level of acidity is not constant or evenly distributed in the oceans. It may vary by depth, nearness to land or other factors. Therefore, while Rob's tests give important information about overall acidity levels, additional testing may be necessary to provide a more complete view of the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A scene may be shot from several camera angles simultaneously. This will give a different experience and sometimes emotion. The different camera angles will have different effects on the viewer and how they perceive the scene that is shot. There are a few different routes that a camera operator could take to achieve this effect. The typical shot measurements unit is the milliframe. Milliframes are used to calculate how much the shot should be moved to perfect the camera angles. One milliframe (mF) equals about .328cm (0.129 inches). However, the exact size of a milliframe is almost impossible to calculate since it is not a physical measurement. - Monaco, officially the Principality of Monaco, is a sovereign city-state and microstate, located on the French Riviera in Western Europe.

Write an article based on this \\"Bosses of some of the UK's newer and smaller banks are meeting Treasury officials to complain that a new surcharge on profits is unfair.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Smaller UK Banks Protest Treasury's Proposed Profit Surcharge as Unfair Introduction: Several smaller and newer UK-based banks have expressed disapproval with a planned surcharge imposed on their profits, and calling the measures unfair. Recently, these bank bosses have joined forces in a meeting with Treasury officials to voice their concerns and complain about the negative impact of such a policy on their growth and competitiveness. Step 1: Introduce the issue at hand The UK Treasury has proposed a new regulation, which brings with it a surcharge on the profits of numerous banks. However, bosses of some smaller and newer UK banks view this regulation as an unfair burden on their financial operations. This has led to heightened tensions between these banks and the Treasury as bank bosses actively seek to contest the proposed surcharge. Step 2: Identify the reason for the new surcharge The UK Treasury stands by the proposed surcharge on bank profits, with the government defending it as a necessary measure to protect the financial stability of the country. According to the Treasury, this move will help ensure that the banking sector remains resilient in the face of future macroeconomic challenges and maintains a fair contribution to the system. Step 3: Discuss the concerns raised by smaller banks Smaller and newer banks within the UK argue that this surcharge unfairly targets their operations, placing additional strain on their ability to grow and compete in an already cut-throat market. They believe that a one-size-fits-all approach to bank regulation is inappropriate and unjustly disadvantages smaller financial institutions, which are still trying to establish themselves. Step 4: Provide examples of affected banks and their viewpoint Challenger banks such as Monzo, Starling, and Atom are among the institutions at the forefront of the opposition against the proposed surcharge. They believe that by placing a disproportionate burden on their businesses, the government is effectively stifling innovation and making it harder for these smaller competitors to challenge the more established 'big four' UK banks. Step 5: Mention the response from Treasury officials Although Treasury officials have yet to make a decision on the surcharge, they have agreed to review the concerns raised by smaller bank bosses. It remains crucial that they strike a balance between maintaining financial stability and fostering a competitive and innovative banking landscape in the UK. Conclusion: Smaller and newer UK banks are protesting the Treasury's proposed profit surcharge, claiming it unfairly targets their operations and hinders their growth. The larger debate raises crucial questions about the balance of financial stability and the importance of fostering a competitive market. Providing Treasury officials with a more comprehensive understanding of the adverse impact on these smaller institutions may help influence future policy decisions that benefit all players in the financial sector."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. and the situation: Two biologists studied different living creatures. Matt studied protozoa, while his friend Greg studied nematodes and insects. Answer the following question: Which friend studied more about predatory protozoa keeping bacterial populations in check? Answer:","completion":"Matt studied more about predatory protozoa keeping bacterial populations in check. Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the background and situation - Protozoa are consumers and some are predators that prey upon other single-celled organisms like bacteria, thus keeping bacterial populations in check. - Matt studied protozoa while Greg studied nematodes and insects. Step 2: Compare the subjects of study for each friend - Matt studied protozoa, which includes predatory protozoa that help control bacterial populations. - Greg studied nematodes and insects, which are larger organisms and not primarily focused on protozoa or their role in controlling bacterial populations. Step 3: Determine which friend's studies align more with the question topic - Matt's studies on protozoa directly relate to the topic of predatory protozoa and their role in controlling bacterial populations. Conclusion: Matt studied more about predatory protozoa keeping bacterial populations in check because his subject of study, protozoa, directly involves the organisms that play this role in the ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Preconscious information can be easily retrieved and brought into consciousness when necessary. Examples include remembering an old friend's name or a specific fact when it becomes relevant. 3. Unconsciousness: This is the mental state that contains thoughts, memories, desires, and experiences that are not available to conscious awareness. The unconscious mind plays a significant role in influencing our behavior, emotions, and decision-making processes. It contains repressed memories, unresolved conflicts, and deep-seated beliefs that shape our personalities and actions. So, while the statement you provided does touch upon the idea of the unconscious mind, it does not provide a comprehensive or accurate representation of the three mental states in psychology."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 1: \\"As General Counsel, Zhao Nanqi (General) and Liu Yuan.\\" This sentence highlights the role of General Counsel first and then names both Zhao Nanqi and Liu Yuan in association with that role. The addition of \\"General\\" in parenthesis right after Zhao Nanqi's name indicates that both Zhao Nanqi and Liu Yuan are generals. However, the sentence structure is not ideal, and it could be better phrased to provide clear information about their roles. Sentence 2: \\"Liu Yuan (general) and Zhao Nanqi serves as its general counsel.\\" This sentence focuses on the names of Liu Yuan and Zhao Nanqi first, emphasizing their relationship to the role of General Counsel. The use of \\"general\\" in parenthesis indicates that Liu Yuan is a general. The sentence mentions that both individuals serve as general counsel. Nevertheless, there is a grammatical error in this sentence: \\"serves\\" should be replaced with \\"serve\\" for plural subjects. In summary, both sentences carry similar meanings but emphasize different aspects of the information. The first sentence highlights the General Counsel role, and the second sentence focuses on the names of the individuals.

I have a new situation: A scientist studied the effects of alcoholic beverages on the human body during severe weather exposure. He decided to experiment on himself. He stood in -30 degrees weather for 2 hours and called it experiment A. He then repeated the experiment, the only difference being that he consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during those two hours, and that was called experiment B. But I can use this background: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment. What is an answer for this question: When did the person have a lower core temperature, during experiment A, or during B? Answer:","completion":"The person likely had a lower core temperature during experiment B. This is because the consumption of alcoholic beverages caused his blood vessels to dilate, bringing more blood to the surface of the skin. While this makes the skin feel warm, it actually allows more heat to escape from the body into the cold environment, potentially lowering the core body temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Question: If clothes have developed a smell and can't be washed what should you do with them? Choices: - hang in closet - sniff - get dirty - become soiled - air out The rationale to choose \\"air out\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"\\"Airing out\\" is the correct choice when clothes have developed a smell but cannot be washed because it is an effective and practical solution to freshen up the garments and reduce or eliminate the odor. By hanging the clothes outside or in a well-ventilated space, you expose them to fresh air and sunlight, which both play a significant role in combating odor-causing bacteria and dissipating the smell. The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons: - Hang in closet: This option won't address the smell, and it can actually spread the odor to other clothes in the closet, making the situation worse. - Sniff: This action does not address or solve the problem of the smell; it merely confirms that the clothes have an odor. - Get dirty: Deliberately making the clothes dirty is counterproductive, as it exacerbates the problem rather than solving it. - Become soiled: Similar to \\"get dirty,\\" this option does not provide a solution to the problem and could cause the smell to intensify. In summary, airing out the clothes is the most effective and logical choice for dealing with garments that have developed a smell but cannot be washed.

What is the answer: The Jewish language Yiddish is based on which other language ?","completion":"Yiddish, a Jewish language with a rich history that dates back to around the 10th century, is primarily based on Middle High German with additional linguistic influences from Hebrew, Aramaic, and various Slavic and Romance languages. It is written using the Hebrew alphabet and demonstrates the fusion of Jewish culture with Central European linguistic elements. Middle High German, a form of the High German spoken between the 11th and 14th centuries, serves as the major foundation of Yiddish grammar and vocabulary. Over time, Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews migrated through different European regions and adapted their language by borrowing words, phrases, and pronunciations from local languages. This contributed to regional dialects within Yiddish itself, which were primarily classified into two main groups: Western (or Central) Yiddish and Eastern Yiddish. Western Yiddish, which was primarily spoken in Central Europe (Germany, France, and the Netherlands), derives many of its features from the West Central German dialect. Eastern Yiddish, on the other hand, was spoken mainly in Eastern Europe (Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, Romania, and Russia) and incorporated elements from the East Central German dialect as well as from Slavic languages such as Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian. Eastern Yiddish is further divided into three dialect groups: Southeastern (Ukrainian-Bessarabian), Mideastern (Polish-Lithuanian), and Northeastern (Belarusian-Latvian). In addition to Middle High German and Slavic influences, Yiddish also includes a significant amount of vocabulary borrowed from Hebrew and Aramaic. These Hebrew and Aramaic terms were initially incorporated for religious and liturgical purposes, as both languages are traditional Jewish languages and key to religious life and learning. Over time, Hebrew and Aramaic words for everyday life also found their way into the Yiddish lexicon. Furthermore, Yiddish adopted words from Romance languages such as Old French and Old Italian, primarily through contact with neighboring Jewish communities. The development and evolution of Yiddish serves as a testament to the adaptability and resilience of the Ashkenazi Jewish community. In the face of political, social, and economic changes throughout history, Yiddish has continued to serve as a vital cultural and linguistic link among Ashkenazi Jews across the globe. Despite experiencing declines in the number of speakers due to factors such as the Holocaust and assimilation, Yiddish has experienced a revival in recent years, with a renewed interest in studying and preserving this unique and historically significant language."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They were a loving couple and the boy was a gem of their eyes. When the boy was around two years old, one morning the husband saw a medicine bottle open. He was late for work, so he asked his wife to cap the bottle and keep it in the cupboard. His wife who was busy in the kitchen forgot the matter. The boy saw the bottle, playfully went to it, was fascinated by its color and drank it all. It happened to be a poisonous medicine. When the child fell to the ground, the mother took him to the hospital in a hurry, where he died. The mother was stunned. She was terrified at how to face her husband. When the father came to the hospital and saw the dead child, he looked at his wife and just said, \\"I'm with you, darling.\\" The child is dead. He can never be brought back to life. There is no point in finding fault with the mother. Besides, if only he had taken time to keep the bottle away, this would not have happened. No one is to blame . She had also lost her only child.

Summarize this article: They said thousands of Britons had been unable to bring a non-EU spouse to the UK since July 2012, when minimum earnings requirements were introduced. Children have also been separated from a parent, the parliamentary group said. The Home Office said the rules were designed to ease the burden of migration on the taxpayer. Under rules that came into force a year ago only British citizens who can show they earn at least £18,600 a year can sponsor their non-European spouse's visa. This rises to £22,400 for families with a child, and a further £2,400 for each further child. The inquiry by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration, which is calling for an independent review of the minimum income requirement, looked at more than 175 cases from families affected by the rules. Forty-five claimed their inability to meet the income threshold had led to the separation of children, including British children, from a non-EU parent, the group said. In one case, a woman from outside Europe had been separated from her British husband and two sons, including a five-month-old baby she had been breastfeeding. Douglas Shillinglaw, from Kent, is among those to have been affected. His wife is in Lagos, Nigeria, with his five-month old son and her six-year-old son from another relationship. Mr Shillinglaw, a self-employed mortgage broker for two years, told the BBC he was being \\"judged like an employed person\\". \\"Self-employed income is different from employed income. I have got enough money to pay my mortgage and bills, and that should be enough,\\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \\"And should anything happen to me, I have a family that will take care of them. My family are wholeheartedly behind what I am doing.\\" Mark Reckless, Conservative MP on the home affairs select committee, said the government had promised to bring down net immigration and it had done so by \\"bearing down\\" on bogus colleges, caps on work visas and reforms on family immigration. \\"If you are bringing someone into the country, then you should be expected to support that person without recourse to public expense,\\" he told Today. \\"Over time, it might be possible that the regulations could be adjusted. There will be hard cases and we learn in light of those experiences.\\" The group also heard from a number of UK sponsors in full-time employment at or above the national minimum wage who reported that they were unable to meet the income requirement. Wider evidence suggested that 47% of the UK working population last year would have failed to meet the income level to sponsor a non-European Economic Area partner, the group said. By the government's own estimate, almost 18,000 British people will be prevented from being reunited with their spouse or partner in the UK every year as a result of the new rules, it added. Baroness Hamwee, chairwoman of the inquiry and Liberal Democrat home affairs lead in the House of Lords, said the parliamentary group had been \\"struck by the evidence showing just how many British people have been kept apart from partners, children and elderly relatives\\". \\"These rules are causing anguish for families and, counter to their original objectives, may actually be costing the public purse,\\" she said. Liberal Democrat group member Sarah Teather MP said that \\"whatever the objective of the policy, children shouldn't suffer as a result\\". A Home Office spokesman said the rules had been designed to make sure those coming to the UK to join their spouse or partner would not become a burden on the taxpayer and would be well enough supported to integrate effectively. \\"High-value migrants would not be refused because their British spouse or partner was not employed,\\" he said. \\"They can meet the income threshold by having cash savings of £62,500 or through their own private income, for example from investments. We have also introduced greater flexibility for those holding investments to liquidate them into cash in order to meet the rules.\\" Summary:","completion":"The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration is calling for an independent review of the minimum income requirement for British citizens to sponsor a non-EU spouse's visa.

Heart: The heart is a muscular organ that serves as the pump for the cardiovascular system. It is made up of four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. The heart's main function is to contract and push blood through the blood vessels. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. The left side of the heart pumps oxygen-rich blood out to the rest of the body. 2. Blood vessels: These are the tubes through which blood flows. Blood vessels can be categorized into three types: a. Arteries: Arteries are thick-walled blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart, delivering it to various tissues and organs throughout the body. The largest artery in the body is the aorta, which originates from the left ventricle of the heart and branches out to supply blood to the entire body. b. Veins: Veins transport oxygen-poor blood back to the heart from the body's tissues. They have thinner walls compared to arteries and larger lumens (inner diameters) to allow for the return of large volumes of blood at lower pressure. The largest veins in the body are the superior and inferior vena cava, which return blood to the right atrium of the heart. c. Capillaries: These are the smallest and most numerous blood vessels in the body. They form a network between arteries and veins, allowing for the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, waste products, and other molecules between the blood and the surrounding cells. This exchange takes place through the thin walls of the capillaries, which facilitate the diffusion of these substances. 3. Blood: Blood is the liquid component of the cardiovascular system that serves as the medium for the transport of nutrients, oxygen, waste products, and other essential substances. It is composed of plasma (the liquid portion) and various blood cells, which include red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. In summary, the cardiovascular system is the system of organs that delivers blood to all cells of the body. It comprises the heart, blood vessels, and blood. Without this crucial system circulating blood throughout the body, we would not be able to survive, as our cells would not receive the necessary nutrients and oxygen needed for their proper functioning and growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The first outstanding deaf teacher in America was a Frenchman Laurent Clerc. He and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet founded America's first school for the deaf. When Laurent Clerc was one year old, he fell into a fire. As a result, he lost both his hearing and his sense of smell. At the age of 12, Laurent entered the Royal Institution for the Deaf in Paris. After he graduated, the school asked him to stay on as an assistant teacher. Meanwhile, in America, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet was studying to be a minister when he met a young deaf girl, Alice Cogswell. He was upset to learn that there were no schools for the deaf in America. Therefore, in 1815, Gallaudet sailed to London to seek ideas on how to teach deaf people. However, he was unable to get help. He met a French educator of the deaf who invited him to Paris to learn at the Royal Institution for the Deaf. Gallaudet went to the Royal Institution for the Deaf, where Clerc became his Sign Language teacher. The two worked and studied well together. When the time came for Gallaudet to return to America, he asked Clerc to come with him. The two men set sail on June 18, 1816. The voyage across the Atlantic Ocean took 52 days; however, Clerc and Gallaudet put the time to good use. They discussed the school for the deaf which they planned to open. On the long trip, they had many conversations about education and deafness. The year after they arrived, they founded a school for the deaf in Harford, Connecticut.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Is language, like food, a basic human need? Judging from the extreme experiment of Frederick in the 13th century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue he told the nurses to keep silent. All the babies died before the first year. But clearly there was more than language deprivation (,). What was missing was good mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the ability to survive is seriously affected. Today no such extreme deprivation exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to signals of the baby, whose brain is programmed, to mop up language rapidly. There are critical times, it seems when children learn more rapidly. If these sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. Linguists suggest that speech milestones are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. Recent evidence suggests that a baby is born with the ability to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a teddy bear with the sound pattern \\"teddy bear\\". But speech has to be developed, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the child's babbling, clinging, grasping, crying, smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals reduces the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child's nonverbal signals is basic to the growth and development of language. A:","completion":"A: According to the article, which factor is crucial for a child's language acquisition during the first year of life? 1. The presence of other children 2.

Who published a paper with the Geological Society of London on January 4th 1837 showing that the South American land mass was gradually rising?","completion":"On January 4th, 1837, Charles Robert Darwin published a paper with the Geological Society of London that showed evidence of the South American landmass gradually rising. The paper was titled \\"Observations of the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, and of Other Parts of Lochaber in Scotland, with an Attempt to Prove that They Are of Marine Origin\\". Charles Darwin, an eminent English naturalist and biologist, is best known for his groundbreaking work on the theory of evolution, but he also made significant contributions to the field of geology. During his voyage on the HMS Beagle from 1831 to 1836, Darwin visited South America and conducted extensive geological research, collecting numerous rock samples and making observations on the topography and geological structures. During his travels, Darwin noted that there were raised beaches and marine shells at various elevations along the coastline of South America. He was particularly struck by the presence of shells at substantial heights above the sea level near Valparaiso, Chile. These observations, along with the occurrence of earthquakes and the ongoing geological research of his contemporaries, led Darwin to hypothesize that the landmass was undergoing a gradual uplift process. Darwin's paper presented detailed evidence of the uplift of the South American coastline and became an important contribution to the understanding of vertical crustal movements in the region. In the subsequent years, his theory was refined and expanded upon, revealing connections between earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the forces that shape Earth's surface. The paper is notable not only for its geological content but also as an early example of Darwin's thinking about the interconnectedness of natural phenomena. Darwin's ideas about the mechanisms of Earth's crustal deformation foreshadowed the development of plate tectonics theory more than a century later. Moreover, the observations made during his voyage significantly influenced the development of his groundbreaking work, \\"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection\\" (1859), where he presented the concept of evolution through natural selection, forever changing the understanding of the history of life on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: when did disney get the rights to winnie the pooh??","completion":"Disney’s history with the character Winnie the Pooh goes a long way back. To answer your question, it's very important to understand the timeline of events that led to Disney gaining the rights to the lovable bear. Winnie the Pooh was originally based on a teddy bear owned by the son of English author A. A. Milne, Christopher Robin Milne. The first appearance of Winnie the Pooh was in a poem titled \\"Teddy Bear\\" in the \\"Punch\\" magazine published on February 13, 1924, and later in a collection of children's verses written by Milne called \\"When We Were Very Young\\" in 1924. The stories of Pooh and his friends in the Hundred Acre Wood gained popularity, and Milne wrote more stories compiling them into a book, \\"Winnie-the-Pooh,\\" published on October 14, 1926. Due to its success, a second set of stories titled \\"The House at Pooh Corner\\" was later published in 1928. Coming to Disney, it was in 1961 when Walt Disney Productions acquired the film and other rights to A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh books from the author’s estate. The decision was partly motivated by the fondness Walt Disney's daughters had for the charming bear and his friends. After Disney acquired the rights, the first Disney adaptation of Pooh was introduced to the world as a featurette on December 20, 1961. This was followed by \\"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\\" which premiered in 1966, marking the debut of the teddy bear and his friends according to the Disney animation style. It's important to note that Disney made an agreement in 1983 with Stephen Slesinger, Inc. and the estate of A. A. Milne to establish Disney has exclusive rights to the Winnie the Pooh characters in return for royalties paid to Stephen Slesinger, Inc. and the Milne estate. The agreement was subsequently renewed in 1998. Disney’s acquisition of the rights played a key role in revitalizing the popularity of Winnie the Pooh, and the rest is history. Since then, the brand has produced numerous animated series, feature films, merchandise, and even boasts a theme park ride at Disneyland, proving that the chubby little bear of very little brain has a very big place in our hearts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The researchers present a complete temperature... Frank and Noah were two researchers. Noah researched the climate of Antarctica, while Frank researched the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa. Which researcher observed a stronger warming in spring?

It was sort of a remake but then again, not really. I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had great make up and CGI available and lots of money (100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than 6 million? Heck no.

But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He's a rotten director inspite what of people think. He's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking. Sorry, but no.

(Associated Press) LOS ANGELES (AP) — The recent death of director Zack Snyder's daughter has driven the prominent filmmaker to step away from finishing the ensemble superhero movie \\"Justice League.\\" A source close to production who was not authorized to speak publicly said Monday that director Joss Whedon would take over completing the film, which should still hit its Nov. 17 release. Snyder and his wife and producing partner Deborah Snyder told The Hollywood Reporter they will be using the time away to focus on their family and seven children. The Reporter story stated Snyder's 20-year-old daughter, Autumn, killed herself in March. Coroner's spokesman Ed Winter said Autumn Snyder's March 12 death is being investigated as a possible suicide due to an overdose of prescription medications. The official cause of death has been deferred pending toxicology results. Snyder told the magazine that at first he tried to throw himself back into work, but in the past two months realized he needed to be with his family — especially as additional photography shoots in London loomed on the horizon. \\"They are all having a hard time. I'm having a hard time,\\" Snyder said. The Snyders are cornerstone players in Warner Bros. production of DC Comics films. He directed both \\"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\\" and \\"Man of Steel\\" and is serving as a producer on the additional films in the DC Universe, including last year's \\"Suicide Squad\\" and the upcoming \\"Wonder Woman.\\" \\"Justice League\\" is a critical entry in the slate of DC films, bringing together major superheroes like Ben Affleck's Batman, Henry Cavill's Superman, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, Ezra Miller's The Flash and Jason Momoa's Aquaman. Whedon, who directed the Marvel Comics ensemble films \\"The Avengers\\" and its sequel \\"Age of Ultron,\\" and is writing and directing \\"Batgirl\\" for Warner Bros., has been working with Snyder on \\"Justice League\\" for over a month. In addition to post-production work, Whedon will also shoot some additional scenes for the film. Warner Bros. Pictures president Toby Emmerich told the Reporter that the additional scenes will adhere to the style and template set by Snyder. Snyder said he knows fans will be worried about the film without him at the helm. But, he added, \\"In the end, it's just a movie. It's a great movie. But it's just a movie.\\" ||||| The filmmaker's daughter died by suicide in March, prompting him to take a break from work and hire Joss Whedon to finish the Warner Bros. superhero pic: \\"I’ve decided to take a step back from the movie to be with my family, be with my kids, who really need me.\\" Superheroes have always been about doing the right thing in the hardest of circumstances. Now Zack Snyder, one of the biggest filmmakers in the genre and the director of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice and the upcoming Justice League, finds himself in just such a situation. Snyder tells The Hollywood Reporter he is stepping away from Justice League, Warner Bros.’ all-star DC Comics superhero mega-movie that is in postproduction, in order to deal with the sudden death of his daughter. Snyder's wife, Deborah Snyder, who is a producer on Justice League, also is taking a break to focus on the healing of their family. Stepping in to shepherd the movie through post and the shooting of some additional scenes will be Joss Whedon, the Avengers filmmaker and creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. With Whedon's help, the movie is still on track for its Nov. 17 release date. Snyder’s daughter Autumn Snyder died by suicide in March at age 20. Her death has been kept private, with only a small inner circle aware of what happened, even as the movie was put on a two-week break for the Snyders to deal with the immediate effects of the tragedy. Zack Snyder says he initially was eager to return to the film, which stars Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa and Ezra Miller. “In my mind, I thought it was a cathartic thing to go back to work, to just bury myself and see if that was the way through it,” said an emotional Snyder in an interview Monday in his office on the Warner Bros. lot, with Deborah sitting by his side. “The demands of this job are pretty intense. It is all-consuming. And in the last two months, I’ve come to the realization … I’ve decided to take a step back from the movie to be with my family, be with my kids, who really need me. They are all having a hard time. I’m having a hard time.” The studio is fully behind the move. “What they are going through is unimaginable, and my heart — our hearts — go out to them,\\" says Warner Bros. Pictures president Toby Emmerich. One of the first things the studio floated was the possibility of pushing back the release date of the movie, but the Snyders decided against that. Warners also extended Snyder's first-look deal to give him time to work on other planned projects when he returns to work. Snyder, after screening a rough cut of Justice League for fellow filmmakers and friends, wanted to add additional scenes, so he brought Whedon on board to write them. But as he prepared to shoot the scenes in England, Snyder realized it was not the time to leave home. “The directing is minimal and it has to adhere to the style and tone and the template that Zack set,” says Emmerich. “We’re not introducing any new characters. It’s the same characters in some new scenes. He’s handing the baton to Joss, but the course has really been set by Zack. I still believe that despite this tragedy, we’ll still end up with a great movie.” This isn’t the first time that Warner Bros. has had to deal with the unthinkable affecting a high-profile DC movie. In 2008, Heath Ledger passed away after shooting had wrapped for The Dark Knight but prior to the movie being finished and released. The tragedy put the studio and filmmaker Christopher Nolan in a very delicate position of balancing mourning with the demands of releasing a tentpole. The internet and comic book movie fans being what they are, Snyder already is anticipating what some DC loyalists may think. “Here’s the thing, I never planned to make this public,” he says. “I thought it would just be in the family, a private matter, our private sorrow that we would deal with. When it became obvious that I need to take a break, I knew there would be narratives created on the internet. They’ll do what they do. The truth is … I’m past caring about that kind of thing now.” The death of Autumn, Zack's daughter from his first marriage, to Denise Snyder (in addition to Autumn, he and Deborah have been raising seven kids and step-kids), has brought a new perspective and a new focus for him. “I want the movie to be amazing, and I’m a fan, but that all pales pretty quickly in comparison,\\" he says. “I know the fans are going to be worried about the movie, but there are seven other kids that need me. In the end, it’s just a movie. It’s a great movie. But it’s just a movie.\\" Autumn, who was attending Sarah Lawrence College, loved “to write, to write, to write,” says Deborah. Their daughter had written a sci-fi fantasy novel in the first person. It featured a character who was an outsider and who had trouble fitting in. Deborah is holding on to the thought that she was the first person her daughter gave the book to read, even now as the story takes on a new meaning under the circumstances. “You’re hearing her voice,” Deborah says, fighting back tears. The Snyders would like to some day see that manuscript published, with the proceeds going to a charity. “In the end, she didn’t make it, but her character does, and I think there would be something cathartic for people,” says Zack. The thought of his daughter’s writing prompts Zack to recall another memory. Autumn had a quote that she included in everything she wrote. (“Every. Single. Thing,” chuckles Zack.) It’s from author Chuck Palahniuk: “We all die. The goal isn't to live forever, the goal is to create something that will.” “Maybe this helps,” says Zack. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The tragic passing of director Zack Snyder's 20-year-old daughter, Autumn, has led him to step away from finishing the highly anticipated ensemble superhero film \\"Justice League.\\" Following Autumn's death in March, which is being investigated as a possible suicide, Snyder tried to focus on his work but realized that he needed to support his family during this difficult time.

Context: There’s a story in my Tuscan family of nobility and forbidden love. It’s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy’s southern heel and involves my daughter’s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco’s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family’s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners. One day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. “He was no adonis,” noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed. When Anna’s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter’s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto — Mario, Marco’s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War — but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work. Nonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as “sugo di nonna Anna” and, oddly, “amatriciana” (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta). But these polpette – plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia – were passed down to Anna’s daughter in law, Angela’s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,...

She is stalked and attacked by a disfigured man wearing a blade-fixed glove. She awakens from the nightmare, but her mother points out four mysterious slashes in her gown. The following morning, Tina is consoled by her friend Nancy and her boyfriend, Glen. Later, Nancy and Glen sleepover with Tina following her mother's out-of-town departure. The sleepover is interrupted by Tina's boyfriend Rod, who tries to have sex to reconcile after arguing. Falling asleep, she sees the man and runs. Awakened by Tina's thrashing, Rod witnesses her being fatally slashed by an unseen force. He flees as Nancy and Glen find Tina, mistakenly blaming Rod. Nancy tells her father, Lieutenant Don Thompson, of Tina's death. The next day, Rod proclaims innocence to Nancy, but Don arrests him. At school, Nancy falls asleep in class and finds the man, calling himself Freddy Krueger, chasing her in the boiler room. Nancy burns her arm on a pipe and awakens in the middle of class, excusing herself. She notices the burn mark on her arm and is concerned. At home, Nancy falls asleep in the bathtub and nearly gets drowned by Freddy. Nancy goes to Rod, who tells her what happened to Tina, and Nancy believes Freddy is responsible for Tina's death. Nancy has Glen watch over her as she falls asleep. She tries to find Freddy and sees him preparing to kill Rod. He turns his attention on her; she runs and wakes up when her alarm clock goes off. Nancy and Glen go to the jail and discover Rod has been hanged in his cell by his bed sheet in an apparent suicide. At Rod's funeral, Nancy's parents become worried when she describes the man in her dreams. Her mother, Marge, takes her to a dream clinic. In her dream, Nancy is attacked again and grabs Freddy's hat. When the staff wake her up, she has a gash in her arm and she somehow has Freddy's hat with her. At home, Marge bars the windows and begins drinking heavily. Eventually, she tells Nancy that Freddy was a child murderer... The answer to this question is:","completion":"What is the true identity of the disfigured man who attacks Tina in her dreams and how is he connected to the mysterious deaths of the teenagers in the story?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale). - A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term \\"molecule\\" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions. - In chemistry isomerization (also isomerisation) is the process by which one molecule is transformed into another molecule which has exactly the same atoms, but the atoms have a different arrangement e.g. A-B-C B-A-C (these related molecules are known as isomers ). In some molecules and under some conditions, isomerization occurs spontaneously. Many isomers are equal or roughly equal in bond energy, and so exist in roughly equal amounts, provided that they can interconvert somewhat freely; that is, the energy barrier between the two isomers is not too high. When the isomerization occurs intramolecularly it is considered a rearrangement reaction. - In chemistry, bond energy (\\"E\\") or bond enthalpy (\\"H\\") is the measure of bond strength in a chemical bond. IUPAC defines bond energy as the average value of the gas-phase bond dissociation energies (usually at a temperature of 298 K) for all bonds of the same type within the same chemical species. For example, the carbonhydrogen bond energy in methane \\"H\\"(CH) is the enthalpy change involved with breaking up one molecule of methane into a carbon atom and four hydrogen radicals, divided by 4. Tabulated bond energies are generally values of bond energies averaged over a number of selected typical chemical species containing that type of bond. Bond energy (\\"E\\") or bond enthalpy (\\"H\\") should not be confused with bond-dissociation energy. Bond energy is the average of all the bond-dissociation energies in a molecule, and will show a different value for a given bond than the bond-dissociation energy would. This is because the energy required to break a single bond in a specific molecule differs for each bond in that molecule. For example, methane has four CH bonds and the bond-dissociation energies are 435 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CHH), 444 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CHH), 444 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CHH) and 339 kJ/mol for \\"D\\"(CH). Their average, and hence the bond energy, is 414 kJ/mol, even though not a single bond required specifically 414 kJ/mol to be broken. - Structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or system, or the object or system so organized. Material structures include man-made objects such as buildings and machines and natural objects such as biological organisms, minerals and chemicals. Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form. Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space. - In organic chemistry, functional groups are specific groups (moieties) of atoms or bonds within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of those molecules. The same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reaction(s) regardless of the size of the molecule it is a part of. However, its relative reactivity can be modified by other functional groups nearby. The atoms of functional groups are linked to each other and to the rest of the molecule by covalent bonds. Any subgroup of atoms of a compound also may be called a radical, and if a covalent bond is broken homolytically, the resulting fragment radicals are referred as free radicals. Functional groups can also be charged, e.g. in carboxylate salts (-COO), which turns the molecule into a polyatomic ion or a complex ion. - In chemistry , photoisomerization is molecular behavior in which structural change between isomers is caused by photoexcitation . Both reversible and irreversible isomerization reactions exist . However , the word \`\` photoisomerization '' usually indicates a reversible process . - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F. - An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization. - An isomer (from Greek , isomerès; isos = \\"equal\\", méros = \\"part\\") is a molecule with the same molecular formula as another molecule, but with a different chemical structure. That is, isomers contain the same number of atoms of each element, but have different arrangements of their atoms. Isomers do not necessarily share similar properties, unless they also have the same functional groups. There are two main forms of isomerism (or ): structural isomerism (or constitutional isomerism) and stereoisomerism (or spatial isomerism). - A chemical compound (or just compound if used in the context of chemistry) is an entity consisting of two or more atoms, at least two from different elements, which associate via chemical bonds. There are four types of compounds, depending on how the constituent atoms are held together: molecules held together by covalent bonds, ionic compounds held together by ionic bonds, intermetallic compounds held together by metallic bonds, and certain complexes held together by coordinate covalent bonds. Many chemical compounds have a unique numerical identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS): its CAS number. - A rearrangement reaction is a broad class of organic reactions where the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged to give a structural isomer of the original molecule. Often a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in the same molecule. In the example below the substituent R moves from carbon atom 1 to carbon atom 2: - A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another. Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes may occur. - Intermolecular forces (IMFs) are the forces which mediate interaction between molecules. They also include forces of attraction or repulsion which act between molecules and other types of neighboring particles (e.g., atoms or ions). They are weak compared to the intramolecular forces the forces which keep a molecule together. For example, the covalent bond, involving the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, is much stronger than the forces present between neighboring molecules. Both sets of forces are essential parts of force fields frequently used in molecular mechanics. - In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest). - A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms that enables the formation of chemical compounds. The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between atoms with opposite charges, or through the sharing of electrons as in the covalent bonds. The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably; there are \\"strong bonds\\" or \\"primary bond\\" such as metallic, covalent or ionic bonds and \\"weak bonds\\" or \\"secondary bond\\" such as Dipole-dipole interaction, the London dispersion force and hydrogen bonding.

Q: While I was in training, my class was 2 months out from graduation. We were in class, reviewing skills such as antenna theory, radios and map reading. Our instructor walks in and pulls a candidate, we’ll leave nameless, aside. He walks him out of the classroom. I never really thought anything of it as instructors would often pull guys aside for reviews, specific instructions or taskings. I don’t know how much time passed but the candidate walked back in. He gathered his things and left the room. Guys asked if everything was cool but he didn’t say a word. The instructor came in and sat on the desk at the front of the room. We asked if everything was alright, and he told us that the day prior, the The candidate’s wife had gone into labor however there were complications with the baby but the complications were unknown. He was reporting to the commander to let him know whether he wanted to stay in training or leave because the military does not consider a spouse’s pregnancy to be an emergency even though the complication should be. If he were to leave he would have to drop from the TACP pipeline with a possibility of either starting it over from the beginning of quitting all together. The instructor shook his head and I could honestly see it was a difficult task for him to tell the candidate. It’s rare to see an instructor be emotional but it was something that brought reality into the room for us. The candidate was given 24 hours to call the hospital, talk to his wife, learn more of the situation and make a decision. He ended up staying in the pipeline and graduated. His child was born with minor complications but is healthy to this day.

Given that the candidate ultimately decided to remain in the TACP pipeline and successfully graduate, it is probably true that he was highly dedicated and determined to complete the military training. Furthermore, it also suggests that he likely had a strong support system, as his wife might have encouraged him to continue his path. The fact that his child was born with minor complications but is healthy today may have brought comfort to the candidate in his decision-making process. It's important to note that the decision to stay must have been tough and demonstrated the candidate's resilience and determination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. You are given a new situation: Geologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes. To understand the differences, they have made a chart where they divided the earth into two regions, region A and region B. In region A many earthquakes happen, but in region B no earthquakes happen. and a hint : Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Please answer this question : In which region the plates would move, region A or region B? A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's go through the given information step by step and analyze it. 1. Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. 2. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. 3. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. 4. As the plates move, stresses build. 5. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. 6. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. Now, we know that Region A experiences many earthquakes, while Region B experiences none. Based on the information provided, we can infer the following: Since almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, and Region A experiences many earthquakes, it is likely that Region A is located along an active plate boundary. On the other hand, Region B experiences no earthquakes, which means it is likely not located along an active plate boundary where plates are moving. Therefore, in answering the question, the plates would move in Region A due to its location along an active plate boundary where earthquakes occur, while in Region B the plates are less likely to move due to its lack of earthquake activity."},{"prompt":"Who does the student, whose huband committed suicide, live with?

What league will be bringing an expansion team in 2021 to the city that once housed the Seattle Supersonics? Answer the above question based on the context below: Seattle was awarded a Major League Baseball franchise, the Seattle Pilots, in 1969. The team played at Sick's Stadium in Mount Baker for one season before relocating to Milwaukee and becoming the Milwaukee Brewers. The city, county, and state governments sued the league and was offered a second expansion team, the Seattle Mariners, who began play at the Kingdome in 1977. The Mariners struggled in the stadium and moved to a purpose-built baseball stadium, T-Mobile Park (formerly Safeco Field), in 1999. The Mariners have never reached a World Series and only appeared in the MLB playoffs four times, all between 1995 and 2001, despite having Hall of Fame players and candidates like Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson, Ichiro, and Alex Rodriguez. The team tied the all-time single regular season wins record in 2001 with 116 wins. Since 2001, the Mariners have failed to qualify for the playoffs—the longest active postseason drought in North American sports, at 17 seasons. From 1967 to 2008 Seattle was also home to a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise: the Seattle SuperSonics, who were the 1978–79 NBA champions. The SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder for the 2008–09 season.The Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held in Seattle twice, first at the Kingdome in 1979 and again at Safeco Field in 2001.

Information: - The term suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe the unbelievable; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment. The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a \\"human interest and a semblance of truth\\" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief. - Professional wrestling is a dramatized athletic performance inspired by competitive combat sports. Taking the form of live events held by touring promotions, it is a unique style of combat based on a combination of adopted styles, which include classical wrestling, catch wrestling and various forms of martial arts, as well as an innovative style based on grappling (holds/throws), striking, and aerialism. Various forms of weaponry are sometimes used. The content including match outcomes is choreographed and the combative actions and reactions are performed to appear violent without injuring the wrestlers. Before the 1980s, these facts were kept highly secret, after which they were openly declared. By and large, the true nature of the content is ignored by the performing promotion in official media in order to sustain and promote the willing suspension of disbelief for the audience by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude. Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media (i.e., interviews) will often directly acknowledge the fictional nature of the spectacle, making the predetermined nature of the sport something of an open secret. The presentation of scripted events as legitimate is known as \\"kayfabe\\". - Jerry W. Jarrett Sr. (born September 4, 1942 in Nashville, Tennessee) is an American promoter and former professional wrestler, and the father of wrestler Jeff Jarrett. He is the co-founder and former part-owner of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Like World Wrestling Entertainment Chairman Vince McMahon, Jarrett was initially a promoter and became a wrestler later in life. - The American Wrestling Association (AWA) was an American professional wrestling promotion based in Minneapolis, Minnesota that ran from 1960 to 1991. It was owned and founded by Verne Gagne and Wally Karbo. The territory was originally part of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), becoming an independent territory in the late 1950s. - In general, spectacle refers to an event that is memorable for the appearance it creates. Derived in Middle English from c. 1340 as \\"specially prepared or arranged display\\" it was borrowed from Old French \\"spectacle\\", itself a reflection of the Latin \\"spectaculum\\" \\"a show\\" from \\"spectare\\" \\"to view, watch\\" frequentative form of \\"specere\\" \\"to look at.\\" The word \\"spectacle\\" has also been a term of art in theater dating from the 17th century in English drama. - Lord Humongous is a professional wrestling character also known as a \`\` gimmick '' that was originally introduced in Memphis ' Continental Wrestling Association ( CWA ) in 1984 . The character was based on a gang leader called \`\` the Humungus '' or at times \`\` Lord Humungus '' from the 1981 movie Mad Max 2 : The Road Warrior . The original Lord Humongous was portrayed by Mike Stark , who was tall and physically impressive like the character in the movie . Since Lord Humongous always wears a Hockey mask it allowed promoters to replace the man under the mask without having to publicly acknowledge that it was someone else playing the part . The character became a recurring gimmick on the CWA but was also used in other promotions after the CWA closed . The character has been played by a number of wrestlers including Jeff Van Kamp , Sid Vicious and Barry Buchanan and Sid 's son Gunnar Eudy . - A ring name is a stage name used by a professional wrestler, martial artist, or a boxer. While some ring names may have a fictitious first name and surname, others may simply be a nickname from the moves that they do or their talents in the ring. - The United States Wrestling Association or USWA was a professional wrestling promotion based in Memphis, Tennessee. The company was founded when the Memphis-based Continental Wrestling Association merged with the Dallas-based World Class Wrestling Association. - The National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) is a professional wrestling governing body which has historically been the largest league of independent wrestling promotions in the world. The organization sanctions various NWA championship bouts within its member promotions. The NWA has been in operation since 1948. Prior to the 1960s, it acted as the sole governing body for most of professional wrestling, operating as a talent and brand name franchiser for the inter-regional \\"territory\\" system. - Continental Wrestling Association (later on Championship Wrestling Association) was a wrestling promotion managed by Jerry Jarrett. The CWA was the name of the \\"governing body\\" for the Championship Wrestling, Inc. promotion which was usually referred to as Mid-Southern Wrestling or the Memphis territory. This promotion was a chief NWA territory during the 1970s and early 1980s while operating out of Tennessee and Kentucky. The CWA was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance until 1986 and affiliated with the American Wrestling Association until 1989. In 1989, the CWA merged with the World Class Wrestling Association to form the United States Wrestling Association thus ceasing to exist as a separate entity. - In professional wrestling, kayfabe is the portrayal of staged events within the industry as \\"real\\" or \\"true,\\" specifically the portrayal of competition, rivalries, and relationships between participants as being genuine and not of a staged or pre-determined nature of any kind. Kayfabe has also evolved to become a code word of sorts for maintaining this \\"reality\\" within the direct or indirect presence of the general public. Though the staged nature of professional wrestling had been a frequent topic of conversation among the media and public since at least the latter years of the early 20th century, the professional wrestling industry did not formally acknowledge this until changes in the business during the 1980s professional wrestling boom prompted attitudes within the business to change. In 1989, World Wrestling Federation owner Vince McMahon testified before the New Jersey state senate that wrestling was staged. Long sanctioned by New Jersey and other states as an athletic exhibition for regulation and taxation purposes, McMahon sought to eliminate oversight, and hence taxation, on the WWF's house shows and pay-per-view events held within the state. - Jeff VanCamp, Sr. is an American retired professional wrestler, who wrestled under the ring names Jeff Van Kamp/Jeff Van Camp as well as working as Lord Humongous in 1984 and 1985. He is a former NWA Alabama Heavyweight Champion and NWA Southeast Continental Heavyweight Champion. - Catch wrestling is a classical hybrid grappling style that was developed in Britain circa 1870 by J. G. Chambers, then later refined and popularised by the wrestlers of travelling funfairs who developed their own submission holds, or \\"hooks\\", into their wrestling to increase their effectiveness against their opponents. Catch wrestling derives from a number of different styles, the English styles of Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling, Cornwall and Devon wrestling, Lancashire wrestling, Irish collar-and-elbow wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling, styles of the Indian subcontinent such as Pehlwani, Jujutsu and Iranian styles such as Varzesh-e Pahlavani. The training of some modern submission wrestlers, professional wrestlers and mixed martial artists is founded in catch wrestling. - A combat sport, or fighting sport, is a competitive contact sport with one-on-one combat. Determining the winner depends on the particular contest's rules. In many fighting sports, a contestant wins by scoring more points than the opponent or by disabling the opponent. Boxing, wrestling, Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, Sambo, and Mixed Martial Arts are examples of combat sports. - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage.

Donald Christopher Barber (born 17 April 1930) is an English jazz musician, best known as a bandleader and trombonist. As well as scoring a UK top twenty trad jazz hit, he helped the careers of many musicians, notably the blues singer Ottilie Patterson, who was at one time his wife, and vocalist/banjoist Lonnie Donegan, whose appearances with Barber triggered the skiffle craze of the mid-1950s and who had his first transatlantic hit, \\"Rock Island Line\\", while with Chris Barber's band. His providing an audience for Donegan and, later, Alexis Korner makes Barber a significant figure in the British rhythm and blues and \\"beat boom\\" of the 1960s. Barber and Monty Sunshine (clarinet) formed a band in 1953, calling it Ken Colyer's Jazzmen to capitalise on their trumpeter's recent escapades in New Orleans: the group also included Donegan, Jim Bray (bass), Ron Bowden (drums) and Barber on trombone. The band played Dixieland jazz, and later ragtime, swing, blues and R&B. Pat Halcox took over on trumpet in 1954 when Colyer moved on after musical differences and the band became \\"The Chris Barber Band\\". In April 1953 the band made its debut in Copenhagen, Denmark. There Chris Albertson recorded several sides for the new Danish Storyville label, including some featuring only Sunshine, Donegan and Barber on double bass. In 1959 the band's version of Sidney Bechet's \\"Petite Fleur\\", a clarinet solo by Monty Sunshine with Barber on string bass, spent twenty-four weeks in the UK Singles Charts, making it to No. 3 and selling over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. After 1959 he toured the United States many times (where \\"Petite Fleur\\" charted at #5). In the late 1950s and early 1960s Barber was mainly responsible for arranging the first UK tours of blues artists Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee and Muddy Waters. This, with the encouragement of local enthusiasts such as Alexis Korner and John Mayall, sparked young musicians such as Peter Green, Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones. British rhythm and blues powered the British invasion of the USA charts in the 1960s, yet Dixieland itself remained popular: in January 1963 the British music magazine, NME reported the biggest trad jazz event in Britain at Alexandra Palace. It included George Melly, Diz Disley, Acker Bilk, Alex Welsh, Kenny Ball, Ken Colyer, Sunshine, Bob Wallis, Bruce Turner, Mick Mulligan and Barber. Barber stunned traditionalists in 1964 by introducing blues guitarist John Slaughter into the line up who, apart from a break between April 1978 and August 1986, when Roger Hill took over the spot, played in the band until shortly before his death in 2010. Barber next added a second clarinet/saxophone and this line-up continued until 1999. Then Barber added fellow trombonist/arranger Bob Hunt and another clarinet and trumpet. This eleven-man \\"Big Chris Barber Band\\" offered a broader range of music while reserving a spot in the programme for the traditional six-man New Orleans line-up. A recording of the Lennon-McCartney composition \\"Catswalk\\" can be heard, retitled \\"Cat Call\\", on The Songs Lennon and McCartney Gave Away.

PUBLISHED:. 09:02 EST, 2 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:17 EST, 2 October 2013. Still missing: The 1988 case of missing Pinole, California girl Amber Swartz-Garcia was reopened Tuesday. Police in Northern California reopened on Tuesday the case of a 7-year-old girl who vanished from her family’s front yard 25 years ago. Amber Swartz-Garcia hasn’t been seen by her Pinole, California family since 1988, but officials bowed to pressure from her mother and local community members Tuesday by agreeing to reopen the case in order to use improved forensic technology. This, despite a 2009 confession to the girl’s murder by known area child killer Curtis Dean Anderson. Though her case had been subsequently closed, not everyone believed Anderson. ‘I think he wanted to make a name for himself and get off of death row,’ Amber’s mother Kim Swartz told KTVU. Swartz was joined by 1,300 others who signed a petition to get the case reopened. The announcement was made Tuesday night at a Pinole City Council meeting. ‘The. bottom line is Amber wasn't found and we want to make sure we do. everything we can to locate her,’ Police Chief John Hardester said. Meanwhile,. Hardester was clear that there is no new evidence in the case and that. Anderson, who died just a month after his confession, has not been. cleared in the case. Then and now: Amber was 7-years-old when she disappeared from her family's front yard in June of 1988. She has been missing since. Age progression technology was used to what Amber might look like now, in her early 30s. Murderer? The case was reopened despite a 2007 confession from known child killer Curtis Dean Anderson, who said he drove Amber to Arizona, killed her, and buried her body near a highway. Doubt: Anderson died just a month after he confessed to murdering Amber and police say they were unable to 're-interview' him regarding his crimes. Swartz was still buoyed by the new turn in her young daughter’s tragic case. ‘I'm totally excited,’ Swartz said before a cheering crowd. ‘Like maybe my days of running into brick walls is over with.’ The FBI offered Pinole police the use of their forensic labs in order to expedite the investigation. 'It is hoped that opening the case will encourage information exchange regarding the case,' police said in a statement, 'and to generate information that might lead to the recovery of Amber Swartz.' 'I'm totally excited': Amber's mother Kim Swartz was joined by 1300 people who sign a petition to get her daughter's case reopened. Good and bad: Community members cheered the announcement from Pinole Police Chief John Hardester, who maintained nonetheless that no new evidence has been uncovered to refute Anderson's confession. Anderson. told authorities that he forcibly took Amber from in front of her home. in 1988 and eventually killed and buried her in Arizona. Amber's body has never been located. His death came, according to police, before he could be 're-interviewed' regarding his confession. Amber. is among eight females Anderson was convicted of kidnapping and. murdering, including the most recent victim Xiana Fairchild. Fairchild. disappeared December 9, 1999. Despite. his death and confessions, the FBI is still ‘seeking the public’s. assistance in identifying alleged victims’ of Anderson’s. Serial killer: Curtis Dean Anderson had confessed to at least eight murders when he died in 2007. Police were subsequently unable to interview him further. Now family and supporters of Kim Swartz say they have room to doubt his confession. Curtis Dean Anderson was sitting on death row at California's Corcoran State Prison when he confessed to the murder of 7-year-old Amber Swartz-Garcia. He told police in 2007 that he forcibly took the girl and drove to Arizona, where he said killed and buried her along a highway in the town of Benson. One month after his confession, on December 9, 2007, Anderson died before police were able to 're-interview' him regarding his confession. The Swartz-Garcia case was closed in 2009. Her body has yet to be recovered. Anderson's most recent known murder was of a 7-year-old Vallejo, California girl named Xiana Fairchild in 1999, for which he was sentenced to 300 years in prison. The killer confessed to at least eight murders, though most of his victims--all of them female--remain unidentified. Nearly all were in or near the San Francisco Bay area beginning with the murder of a Marysville woman in her late teens or early 20s in 1984. Anderson admitted to two other murders in Mexico, but did not provide details. Despite his confessions and the time since the murders, the FBI website still says the agnecy is 'seeking the public’s assistance in identifying alleged victims of convicted killer Curtis Dean Anderson.' Anderson was first captured after one of his kidnapping victims was able to escape.

The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. and the situation: Steve and Chris sit down at a new cafe that just opened up in town after hearing rave reviews of it at work. They look at the menus trying to decide what to order when a waiter shows up and asks if they would like anything to drink. Steve says he would like a glass of water that has molecules far apart. Chris orders water with molecules closer together. The waiter looks at them with a rather confused look and asks them to please elaborate. Answer the following question: Whose cup of water is more dense? A:","completion":"Chris's cup of water is more dense. In the given background, it is mentioned that the density of liquid water increases as its temperature decreases, and water reaches its highest density at about 4°C. As water cools, the molecules move closer together, which makes it more dense. Steve requests water with molecules far apart, which implies a lower density due to greater distance between the water molecules. This can be achieved when the water is warmer, as the increase in temperature results in a lower density. On the other hand, Chris orders water with molecules closer together. This implies that he wants a denser water, and the molecules in liquid water are closest together at about 4°C. At this temperature, the liquid water has reached its highest density. Therefore, Chris's cup of water, with molecules closer together, is more dense than Steve's cup of water with molecules far apart."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Zoo elephants don't live as long as those in the wild, according to a study sure to cause debate about keeping the giant animals on display. Researchers compared the life spans of elephants in European zoos with those living in Amboseli National Park in Kenya and others working on a timber enterprise in Buma. Animals in the wild or in natural working conditions had life expectancies twice than or more of their relatives in zoos. Animal care activists have urged in recent years to discourage keeping elephants in zoos, largely because of the lack of space and small numbers of animals that can be kept in a group. The researchers found that the _ life span for African elephants in European zoos was 16.9 years, compared with 56 years for elephants who died of natural causes in Kenya's Amboseli Park. Adding in those elephants killed by people in Africa lowered the median life expectancy there to 35.9 years. For the more endangered Asian elephants, the median life span in European zoos was 18.9 years, compared with 41.7 years for those working in the Burma Timber Enterprise. Median means half died younger than that age and half lived longer. There is some good news, though. The life expectancies of zoo elephants have improved in recent years, suggesting an improvement in their care and raising, but \\"Protecting elephants in Africa and Asia is far more successful than protecting them in Western zoos.\\" There are about 1,200 elephants in zoos, half in Europe, researchers concentrated on female elephants, which make up 80 percent of the zoo population. One amazing thing was that Asian elephants born in zoos had shorter life spans that those brought to the zoos from the wild.

A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name \\"Civilian\\" (or \\"The Civilian Project\\"). According to Morello, the songs were unfinished and, in some cases, \\"weren't even the same lyrics, guitar solos, performances of any kind.\\" To MTV, he described them as \\"inferior sketches of works-in-progress, sent to Seattle for Chris to work on.

This purpose is achieved by installing an eccentric bearing insert equipped with a centrifugal counterweight on the connecting rod pin of the crankshaft. The position of the eccentric insert relative to the crankshaft is controlled by centrifugal and inertial forces acting on the lower head of the connecting rod, the centrifugal counterweight, and on the connecting rod and piston, depending on the instantaneous pressure of the gases above the piston, engine mode, number of revolutions, etc. The eccentric bearing insert may be provided with needle bearing elements on both the outer and inner sliding surfaces. The device works such that after ignition of the combustible mixture, the connecting rod pressure rotates the eccentric bearing insert together with the counterweight approximately 180° before reaching the upper culminating point of the connecting rod pin. At the moment of stopping the movement of the eccentric insert relative to the connecting rod pin, influenced by the continuing pressure of the connecting rod, the entire system acts with a torque force tangentially along the circumference described by the connecting rod pin, thereby improving the engine's torque."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Van Praag announced the news Monday on Dutch FA's website. Van Praag believes 'no credible' candidate has emerged to oppose Blatter. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Michael van Praag Announces Challenge to Sepp Blatter's FIFA Presidency Introduction: Dutch FA president, Michael van Praag, has announced his intention to challenge Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency. In a statement released on the Dutch FA's website on Monday, van Praag highlighted his belief that there is currently no credible candidate to oppose Blatter. Step 1: Describe Michael van Praag's background and qualifications As a respected figure in European football, Michael van Praag has a wealth of experience to draw upon. He has served as the president of the Dutch Football Association (KNVB) since 2008 and has been a member of the UEFA Executive Committee since 2009. With a long history in football administration and governance, van Praag is well-equipped to understand the challenges faced by FIFA and propose potential solutions. Step 2: Discuss the motivation behind van Praag's challenge Michael van Praag's decision to challenge Sepp Blatter's FIFA presidency stems from his belief that the current field of candidates is not sufficiently credible to bring about much-needed change in the organization. By putting his own name forward, van Praag aims to create a more competitive race and offer an alternative vision for the future of FIFA. Step 3: Examine the issues surrounding FIFA and Sepp Blatter's presidency Sepp Blatter has served as FIFA president since 1998, but his reign has been mired in controversy with allegations of corruption and poor governance. Critics argue that FIFA lacks transparency and needs a complete overhaul to restore its image and credibility. By challenging Blatter's presidency, van Praag hopes to address these issues and usher in a new era of ethical leadership for FIFA. Step 4: Consider the possibility of success for van Praag's challenge While there is no doubt that Michael van Praag is a credible candidate for FIFA's presidency, the outcome of this challenge remains uncertain. Sepp Blatter continues to have a strong base of support despite the controversies, and it will be an uphill battle for any challenger to unseat him. Nonetheless, van Praag's challenge signifies a growing dissatisfaction with FIFA's current leadership and may inspire other potential candidates to join the race. Conclusion: Michael van Praag's announcement to challenge Sepp Blatter's FIFA presidency is undoubtedly a bold move. As a respected figure in European football, van Praag offers an alternative vision for the organization's future. Whether his challenge will lead to a change in leadership remains to be seen, but it is clear that there is a growing desire for a more transparent, accountable, and ethical FIFA."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Context: King Ottokar II of Bohemia improved fortifications and rebuilt the royal palace for the purposes of representation and housing. In the 14th century, under the reign of Charles IV the royal palace was rebuilt in Gothic style and the castle fortifications were strengthened. In place of rotunda and basilica of St. Vitus began building of a vast Gothic church, that were completed almost six centuries later. During the Hussite Wars and the following decades, the castle was not inhabited. In 1485, King Ladislaus II Jagello began to rebuild the castle. The massive Vladislav Hall was added to the Royal Palace. New defence towers were also built on the north side of the castle. A large fire in 1541 destroyed large parts of the castle. Under the Habsburgs, some new buildings in Renaissance style were added. Ferdinand I built the Belvedere as a summer palace for his wife Anne. Rudolph II used Prague Castle as his main residence. He founded the northern wing of the palace, with the Spanish Hall, where his precious art collections were exhibited. The Second Defenestration of Prague in 1618 took place at the castle and began the Bohemian Revolt. During the subsequent wars, the Castle was damaged and dilapidated. Many works from the collection of Rudolph II were looted by Swedes in 1648, in the Battle of Prague which was the final act of the Thirty Years' War. The last major rebuilding of the castle was carried out by Empress Maria Theresa in the second half of the 18th century. Following his abdication in 1848, and the succession of his nephew, Franz Joseph, to the throne, the former emperor, Ferdinand I, made Prague Castle his home. Question: How many years after King Ladislaus II Jagello began to rebuilt the castle did the castle experience a large fire? Answer:","completion":"The large fire occurred in 1541. King Ladislaus II Jagello began to rebuild the castle in 1485.

Write a summary based on this article: ST. LOUIS COUNTY • A grand jury member’s lawsuit seeking a court order to speak out about the Michael Brown shooting investigation accuses Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch of publicly misrepresenting the panel’s viewpoint after it chose not to indict Officer Darren Wilson. In documents filed Monday in federal court in St. Louis, “Grand Juror Doe” wants freedom to challenge McCulloch’s comments, “especially the implication that all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges.” The filing says that the heavily redacted grand jury documents McCulloch released Nov. 24 “do not fully portray the proceedings before the grand jury.” McCulloch spoke publicly that night about the grand jury’s decision against charging Wilson. Ferguson erupted in protests, including arsons that burned about a score of buildings within hours. A spokesman for McCulloch declined to comment on the lawsuit Monday. The suit says that speaking publicly could “contribute to the current public dialogue concerning race relations” that was sparked by the shooting Aug. 9 of the black teen by Wilson, a white officer. Doe also wants “to advocate for legislative change to the way grand juries are conducted in Missouri,” the suit says, and be able to talk about the case “with close family members at home.” The plaintiff invokes free speech rights in asking the court to overrule as unconstitutional a Missouri law that makes it a misdemeanor for grand jurors to discuss at least certain parts of their work, including what was said in deliberations and what was the jury’s vote. The suit also seeks an order to prevent McCulloch from prosecuting the juror for making public remarks. A grand jury does not decide guilt but whether there is sufficient evidence for a trial. In Missouri, an indictment requires the vote of nine of the 12 members. That means at least four of these grand jurors did not support charges for Wilson. The suit says McCulloch’s characterization was at odds with Doe’s opinions, and that the public’s understanding of the grand jurors’ views is “not entirely accurate.” The investigation of Wilson “had a stronger focus on the victim than in other grand jury cases,” the suit says. The presentation of evidence and “the State’s counsel to the grand jury” had “differed markedly and in significant ways ... from the hundreds of matters presented to the grand jury earlier in its term.” The suit also claims the legal guidelines presented to jurors in applying facts of the case were “muddled and untimely” compared to other cases. The plaintiff is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the law firm of Sowers & Wolf, in Town and Country. “The rules of secrecy must yield because this is a highly unusual circumstance,” Tony Rothert, legal director of the ACLU of Missouri, said in a prepared statement. “The First Amendment prevents the state from imposing a lifetime gag order in cases where the prosecuting attorney has purported to be transparent.” Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of the ACLU, told the Post-Dispatch that the public is entitled to “complete information not controlled by the government.” Mittman would not tell Doe’s gender, whether Doe’s opinions are shared by other grand jurors or whether the suit might prompt other jurors to come forward. “This grand juror is being very respectful of the legal process and does not want to share information that it is not legally permissible to share,” he said. One reason the grand jury process is secret is to protect the target if an indictment is not returned, Mittman said. Wilson’s name, of course, is known nationally. Mae Quinn, a Washington University law professor and director of the Juvenile Law and Justice Clinic, said she is not familiar with any similar litigation. “This lawsuit does not surprise me,” she said. “Each time we have heard from the prosecutor, referencing the thinking, the analysis and, essentially, the deliberations of the grand jurors, has raised questions in my mind about when these jurors would be permitted to speak for themselves. And while our statutory scheme does criminalize certain public statements by grand jurors, it does seem that those provisions do need to give way at some point, when someone is ... offering statements on their behalf.” In support for their suit, the lawyers cite a unanimous 1990 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that said that many of the reasons for maintaining grand jury secrecy disappear when an investigation concludes. But the underlying lawsuit in that case was filed by a Florida newspaper reporter who wanted to report on his own testimony in front of a grand jury, not by a juror. Justice Antonin Scalia warned in a separate opinion that subjecting a grand jury to scrutiny by the press and public “might in the long run deter citizens from fearless performance of their grand jury service.” Separately on Monday, a group of Missouri residents, including Christi Griffin, founder of the Ethics Project, faxed a misconduct complaint against McCulloch and the two prosecutors who handled the case to Missouri’s Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel. Among other things, the complaint alleges that prosecutors presented an outdated statute for grand jurors to consider and witness testimony that they knew to be false, released grand jury transcripts without the consent of the state or federal government, erred in delaying the announcement of the decision until 8 p.m. on Nov. 24 and skewed the presentation of evidence and testimony to favor Wilson. In addition, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund on Monday asked Judge Maura McShane, the presiding judge of the 21st Judicial Circuit in Missouri, for “an immediate and thorough investigation of the grand jury proceedings.” “The transcripts of the grand jury proceedings reveal questionable prosecutorial tactics that compromised the integrity of the proceedings,” a letter sent by the group to McShane said. “As a result, we are asking the court to restore public confidence in the St. Louis County justice system by conducting an investigation, convening a new grand jury, and appointing a special prosecutor pursuant to Missouri law.” ||||| Share Seeks to Participate in Public Discussion of Ferguson Events January 5, 2015 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: 212-549-2666, media@aclu.org ST.

McCulloch is named as a defendant since he would be the person to bring charges against Doe. “The Supreme Court has said that grand jury secrecy must be weighed against the juror’s First Amendment rights on a case-by-case basis,” explains Tony Rothert, legal director of the ACLU of Missouri. “The rules of secrecy must yield because this is a highly unusual circumstance. The First Amendment prevents the state from imposing a life-time gag order in cases where the prosecuting attorney has purported to be transparent.” “Grand Juror Doe’s perspective can and should help inform a way forward here in Missouri,” says Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of the ACLU of Missouri. “The ACLU will fight to allow this important voice to be heard by the public and lawmakers so that we can begin the healing process that can only result from fact-based reforms.” Cooperating attorneys on this case are Eric Sowers, Ferne Wolf and Joshua Pierson, from Sowers & Wolf Attorneys at Law. A copy of the complaint can be found on the ACLU of Missouri website. The ACLU of Missouri is a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization that defends and expands the constitutional rights and civil liberties of all Missourians guaranteed under the United States and Missouri Constitutions, through its litigation, legislative and public education programs. It is an affiliate of the national ACLU. ||||| (Updated 11:30 a.m., Tuesday, Jan. 6 with NAACP's request for an investigation.) A grand juror is suing St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch in an effort to speak out on what happened in the Darren Wilson case. Under typical circumstances, grand jurors are prohibited by law from discussing cases they were involved in. The grand juror, referred to only as \\"Grand Juror Doe\\" in the lawsuit, takes issue with how McCulloch characterized the case. McCulloch released evidence presented to the grand jury and publicly discussed the case after the grand jury decided not to indict Wilson, then a Ferguson police officer, in the shooting death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old African American. “In [the grand juror]’s view, the current information available about the grand jurors’ views is not entirely accurate — especially the implication that all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges,” the lawsuit says. (A grand jury's decision does not have to be unanimous.) “Moreover, the public characterization of the grand jurors’ view of witnesses and evidence does not accord with [Doe]’s own,” the lawsuit continued. “From [the grand juror]’s perspective, the investigation of Wilson had a stronger focus on the victim than in other cases presented to the grand jury.” Doe also believes the legal standards were conveyed in a “muddled” and “untimely” manner to the grand jury. In the lawsuit filed Monday in federal court, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri argues that this case is unique and that the usual reasons for requiring the jurors to maintain secrecy should not apply. In this specific case, “any interests furthered by maintaining grand jury secrecy are outweighed by the interests secured by the First Amendment,” the lawsuit says, adding that allowing the juror to speak would contribute to a discussion on race in America. As the grand juror points out in the lawsuit, the Wilson case was handled in a very different manner than other grand juries. Instead of recommending a charge, McCulloch's office presented thousands of pages worth of evidence and testimony before the grand jury. At one point, McCulloch's spokesman characterized the grand jury as co-investigators. “From [Doe]’s perspective, although the release of a large number of records provides an appearance of transparency, with heavy redactions and the absence of context, those records do not fully portray the proceedings before the grand jury,” the lawsuit says. McCulloch has done several interviews since the grand jury decision was announced on Nov. 24, but the grand jurors have been prohibited from speaking about the case. The county prosecutor admits that some of the witnesses were lying, but said the grand jurors were aware. The 12 people who could say for sure are currently sworn to secrecy. Although the county released redacted transcripts of witness and expert testimony, the grand jurors deliberated without a court reporter or member of the prosecutor’s office present. State law says that grand jurors shall not “disclose any evidence given” nor “the name of any witness who appeared before them,” adding that any juror who violates that is guilty of a misdemeanor. The ACLU is asking a judge to grant an injunction that prohibits enforcing those laws (or threatening to) in this case. The laws “prevent [the grand juror] from discussing truthful information about a matter of public significance,” the lawsuit says. “As applied in the circumstances of this case, the challenged laws act as a prior restraint on [Doe’s] expressive activity.” McCulloch's office declined to comment. Late Monday, the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund requested an investigation of the conduct of McCulloch's office. “Our review of these proceedings has raised grave legal concerns, including knowing presentation of false witness testimony, erroneous instructions on the law, and preferential treatment of Mr. Wilson by the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office,\\" Sherrilyn Ifill, LDF’s president said in a written statement. The organization is asking state Judge Maura McShane to look into the grand jury proceedings. \\"This process sets a bad precedent for our judicial system and diminishes the high standard that stewards of the law are supposed to uphold,\\" Ifill said. \\"St. Louis on the Air\\": Reporter Chris McDaniel discusses the lawsuit.

See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: Toobin is, of course, being massively hypocritical here, given that he too is now profiting from enclosing his reporting in hard covers. Sentence 2: He does not care how he makes his money. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? OPT: (i) yes (ii) it is not possible to tell (iii) no","completion":"If we carefully consider the information provided in Sentence 1, it is clear that we cannot necessarily infer that Sentence 2 is true. This leads us to answer (ii) it is not possible to tell. To elaborate, Sentence 1 claims that Toobin is being hypocritical due to his profiting from enclosing his reporting in hard covers. This suggests that he may have criticized others for doing the same thing and is now engaging in the same behavior. However, this specific situation does not provide enough information to determine Toobin's overall motivation or criteria for making money. Sentence 2 makes a broader claim about Toobin's attitude towards making money, stating that he does not care how he makes it. While it might be tempting to interpret his hypocritical action from Sentence 1 as evidence for this claim, it does not lead to a definitive conclusion about his underlying motivations. It is possible that there are other factors at play, or that Toobin's behavior in this particular instance is not reflective of his general attitude towards making money. In conclusion, based solely on the information available in Sentence 1, we cannot definitively conclude whether Sentence 2 is true or not. Therefore, the most appropriate answer to the multi-choice question is (ii) it is not possible to tell."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This statement usually refers to airline travel policies concerning firearms and ammunition. Passengers who are permitted to carry firearms for certain reasons, such as sport shooting or hunting, must comply with strict security measures. This includes making sure the firearm is unloaded before check-in. Firearms are to be packed in a sturdy checked bag. The ammunition also needs to be stored in a separated way to prevent accidental discharge of the weapon. Usually, it should be packed in a container designed specifically for the purpose, such as the original packaging from the manufacturer, or other hard-shell container. In addition, the amount of ammunition one can carry may be limited due to safety reasons. Moreover, in many jurisdictions, passengers must declare at check-in that they are transporting firearm(s) and ammunition in their checked baggage. This declaration usually involves filling in a form, stating the firearm is unloaded and ammunition is stored properly. Keep in mind, this is the typical regulation, however, depending on the country or the specific airline, there might be slightly different rules. Therefore, it is always advisable to check the exact regulations for carrying firearms on board with the respective airline or the relevant law enforcement agency before making travel arrangements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While that last comparison is still being bandied about -- for better or for worse -- today there is more buzz about \\"will she stay clean?\\" and \\"can she stay out of trouble?\\" than her talent. Lohan's latest 90-day rehab stint, which ended this week, was taken as an alternative to three months of jail time for two misdemeanor convictions and a shoplifting probation violation finding in March. Lindsay Lohan the actress seems to have been replaced by Lindsay Lohan the perpetual comeback kid. \\"I think Lohan has more natural acting talent than Monroe did, but, like OPTIONS: - Ann-Margret, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote. - CNN, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote. - Canyons, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote. - Elizabeth Taylor, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote. - Lindsay Lohan, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote. - Lohan, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote. - Marilyn Monroe, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote.","completion":"\\"Marilyn Monroe, her weakness is her inability to fake it,\\" he wrote. This complements the beginning of the paragraph, where Lohan's acting abilities are compared to those of Ann-Margret, Elizabeth Taylor, and Marilyn Monroe. This cue gives suitable context for making a direct comparison between Lohan and Monroe. Besides, the attribution to \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" creates a stronger emotional punch, given Monroe's iconic status and persistent legacy that's associated with both talent and personal struggles. Also, considering Monroe as an epitome of the quintessential Hollywood tragedy, the comparison accentuates Lohan's susceptibility to similar pitfalls. Moreover, by suggesting that Lohan's natural acting talent surpasses Monroe's, but her inability to \\"fake\\" it—presumably meaning feigning emotions convincingly, sustaining a facade or navigating the unscripted aspects of being a public figure, the remark could either be seen as a critique of her performance skills or a commentary on her life off-camera. This layered comparison indicates that like Monroe, Lohan's personal life and struggles have overshadowed her professional talent, drawing more attention to her off-screen exploits than her on-screen performances. Such a comparison also reflects the media's fascination with the tragic aspects of fame, which has been highlighted in Monroe's case. It seems to assert that there are parallel streaks of talent and self-destruction with both stars. It works to underline the tragic potential of a career in Hollywood, where immense talent often finds itself in a constant tussle with personal demons. This comparison reasserts the impact of Monroe's persona in shaping public memory and how those who follow can often find themselves caught in the same net of judgement, expectation, and tragedy."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

While Iraq's growing maritime force is a visible sign of its resolve to strengthen national security and protect the nation's territorial waters, it is evident that building a formidable naval force will require considerable time and effort. Trainers and experts caution against expecting immediate results, highlighting the importance of patience, support, and steady progress in bolstering the country's seafaring capabilities. Transitioning from a traditional land-based focus in military operations, Iraq is gradually realizing the significance of possessing a functional and equipped navy. The naval force bears the crucial responsibility of defending the country's coastline, securing its economic interests in the maritime sphere, and ensuring the safe passage of trade, resources, and personnel through nearby waters. Despite the countless challenges that building Iraq's burgeoning navy entails, the progress made thus far is a testimony to the perseverance and cooperation of the nation's military personnel and authorities. Several international partners have committed to helping Iraq establish its naval force by providing resources, training, and expertise. However, it is essential to acknowledge and manage expectations about the time and investment required to develop a robust and competent force capable of effectively securing Iraq's maritime interests. Training and education prove vital to developing any military force, and the Iraqi Navy is no exception. The current generation of naval officers has shown impressive determination and adaptability in embracing this new arena of warfare. Nevertheless, trainers emphasize that it takes time to grow in ranks and experience, which are crucial points in becoming proficient and tactical in command. Building a competent naval force also hinges on the acquisition and deployment of suitable vessels, equipment, and technology. Iraq's Navy requires adequate tools and resources to carry out its mission of protecting territorial waters and ensuring maritime security, but procuring and maintaining these assets demands time, financial investment, and expertise. Furthermore, the expansion and empowerment of Iraq's naval force demand the fostering of cooperation between different branches of the country's military. Sharing intelligence, coordinating operations, and leveraging the strengths of each branch will be required to tackle complex challenges and potential threats such collaborations could entail. Iraq's recent history has left the nation's military forces primarily focused on ground-based battles and counter-insurgency operations. The shift towards establishing a viable naval force may spark concerns about the possibility of detracting resources from the continued fight against insurgency on land. However, investing in a strong and versatile navy will contribute to the long-term security and wellbeing of the nation. In conclusion, rebuilding the Iraqi Navy is a significant and necessary endeavor that will demand time, investment, and patience. As trainers emphasize, Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither will the capabilities and proficiency of Iraq's naval force. The nation's efforts to test its sea legs should be lauded and supported and, with realistic expectations and proper investment, the Iraqi Navy will undoubtedly grow in strength and effectiveness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Dean \\"Deano\\" Butterworth is a British-American drummer who is noted for working with English singer Morrissey, and in 2005 became the drummer for American band Good Charlotte after they parted with their previous drummer, Chris Wilson. - Eric Dodd, known professionally as Eric Valentine, is an American record producer, who began his career as drummer and producer in the heavy metal band T-Ride. - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis. Among its occasional nicknames are \\"Old Line State\\", the \\"Free State\\", and the \\"Chesapeake Bay State\\". The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England. - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other. - Pop punk (also known as punk-pop) is a punk rock music genre and a fusion genre that combines elements of punk rock with elements of pop music. Pop punk typically combines fast punk rock tempos, power chord changes and loud, distorted electric guitars with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes. - Good Morning Revival is the fourth studio album by American pop punk band Good Charlotte and the follow-up to the 2004 release \\"The Chronicles of Life and Death\\". It is the first album to feature Dean Butterworth on drums, who joined the band in March 2005 after former drummer Chris Wilson departed in 2005. Billy Martin has mentioned in an interview that Benji Madden came up with the name for the album. This style can be heard in the album's third single, \\"Dance Floor Anthem\\", which is the most successful song on the album by debuting at No. 2 on the Australian charts and reaching No.25 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100. It is the final album by Good Charlotte to be released through Daylight Records; they subsequently signed a deal with Capitol. - \`\` The Anthem '' is a song recorded by American pop punk group Good Charlotte . It was released in January 2003 as the second single from their studio album The Young and the Hopeless . - The Chronicles of Life and Death is the third studio album by American pop punk band Good Charlotte, released on October 5, 2004, through Daylight Records. The album was released with two different versions: a \\"Life\\" and a \\"Death\\" version which came with different cover art (designed by guitarist Billy Martin) and a special bonus track. There is also a Japanese version that has a different cover art as well as the special bonus tracks from both the \\"Life\\" and \\"Death\\" versions, including the hidden track \\"Wounded\\" at the end of the album. \\"The Chronicles of Life and Death\\" is the only album to feature Chris Wilson on drums. - Daylight Records was an American record label and subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment, operated through Epic Records. - Benjamin Levi \\"Benji\\" Madden (born Benjamin Levi Combs March 11, 1979) is an American guitarist, vocalist, songwriter, and producer. He is the rhythm guitarist for the band Good Charlotte, as well as pop rock collaboration The Madden Brothers. He formed both of these acts with his identical twin brother, Joel Madden. Benji is currently a coach on \\"The Voice Australia\\". He is married to actress Cameron Diaz. - Good Charlotte is an American pop punk band from Waldorf, Maryland, that formed in 1996. Since 1998, the band's constant members have been lead vocalist Joel Madden, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Benji Madden, bassist Paul Thomas, rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Billy Martin, while drummer Dean Butterworth has been a member of the band since 2005. After a 4-year-long hiatus, the band announced its comeback on November 3, 2015. The band has released six studio albums: \\"Good Charlotte\\" (2000), \\"The Young and the Hopeless\\" (2002), \\"The Chronicles of Life and Death\\" (2004), \\"Good Morning Revival\\" (2007), \\"Cardiology\\" (2010) and \\"Youth Authority\\" (2016), as well as two compilations: \\"Greatest Remixes\\" (2008) and \\"Greatest Hits\\" (2010). - In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played. - Joel Rueben Madden (born Joel Rueben Combs; March 11, 1979) is the lead vocalist for the American pop punk band Good Charlotte, as well as a record producer, actor, DJ, and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. He is also part of the pop rock collaboration The Madden Brothers with his twin brother Benji Madden. - The Young and the Hopeless is the second studio album by American pop punk band Good Charlotte.

In the given statement, the phrase \\"Blue is not entitled\\" emphasizes that the subject 'Blue' does not hold any specific right or claim for any form of compensation or reimbursement, which could be in the form of financial, emotional, or social aspects, etc. The term \\"entitled\\" suggests that there is no inherent privilege or legal standing which justifies 'Blue' to receive any form of redress or aid from others. On the other hand, the term \\"redress\\" fundamentally refers to the process of rectifying or remedying a particular wrong, injustice, or grievance. The concept of redress can be applied to an array of contexts, including interpersonal relationships, legal disputes, and societal injustices, among others. In light of this, the notion of entitlement to redress essentially revolves around one's eligibility or right to expect any kind of remedy, assistance, or intervention to address their grievances. Considering these terms collectively, the given statement, \\"Blue is not entitled to redress,\\" underscores the idea that 'Blue' presently does not possess any intrinsic right or claim to seek any compensation, aid, or rectification for their grievances or plights. It is important to note, however, that this statement simply reveals the absence of certain entitlement for 'Blue' and does not delve into the specific causes, factors, or contexts for this lack of entitlement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is a staggering amount of money spent on a condition largely caused by our lifestyle choices and environment. On Doctor in the House, I try to help 39-year-old La-Vern. Her mother, Doreen, already has type 2 diabetes and is worried that La-Vern is going down the same route. La-Vern is a busy, single mother who does two jobs and, as a result, is exhausted and stressed. She has not yet crossed our diagnostic threshold where we would say she has type 2 diabetes, but her blood sugar and fasting insulin levels are not \\"normal\\" either. Her results suggested that she was on the road towards type 2 diabetes. This is an ideal opportunity to practise true preventive medicine. Type 2 diabetes is a late event. By the time you get a diagnosis, things will have been going wrong in your body for many years. La-Vern's symptoms of fatigue have already affected her quality of life. However, her lifestyle is not only causing her to feel unwell, but is driving her towards a type 2 diabetes diagnosis further down the line. This is one of the big problems in medicine today - things are often said to be black or white, normal or abnormal - but what about optimal? I am an advocate for trying to recognise problems before they happen. Why should we wait for people to get a type 2 diabetes diagnosis before we take action? Type 2 diabetes is often viewed as a dietary illness. That is partially true as diet is a big contributor. However, other lifestyle factors such as insufficient sleep, long-term stress, and inappropriate physical activity all contribute, as well. For many of my patients, addressing these factors can be as important as their food choices. Most cases of type 2 diabetes are caused by a condition called insulin resistance. Insulin is an important hormone and one of its functions is to keep your blood sugar tightly controlled. If you are in optimal health and not insulin resistant, a sugary bowl of breakfast cereal will cause your blood sugar to go up. Your body will then release a little bit of insulin to bring it back down again. As your health deteriorates and you start to become insulin-resistant, you need more and more insulin to keep your blood sugar under control. Your body has become deaf to insulin's sound. It is a little bit like alcohol - the very first time you have a drink, it may only take a few sips of wine to feel tipsy but as you become accustomed to drinking more and more, you need more and more alcohol to have the same effect - your body has become resistant to the effects of the alcohol. This is similar to what happens in insulin resistance. This raised level of insulin can itself cause many problems. And when the insulin can no longer keep your blood sugar under control - at that point, we give you a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. As I explained in a TED talk, there is a problem with blood sugar in type 2 diabetes, but it is not a blood sugar problem. By the time your blood sugar goes into the diabetic range, things have been going wrong in your body for many years. The four areas of treatment I focused on with La-Vern are the same four areas I look at with almost all of my patients: food, movement, stress and sleep. Problems in these areas can all contribute to the development of insulin resistance. Food The main change I made with La-Vern's diet was to cut out highly processed junk food. Because of her insulin resistance, she was unable to efficiently process foods that quickly converted to sugar in her body, so I advised her to eliminate refined carbohydrates in her diet such as sugary breakfast cereals, white rice and bread. I encouraged her to increase her intake of healthy, natural fats such as avocados, nuts, and olives as well as healthy protein sources such as salmon and anchovies. Sleep La-Vern had trouble sleeping and this was contributing to her exhaustion. However, sleep deprivation can also cause insulin resistance. Like many of us, La-Vern was glued to her smartphone every evening. This late-night usage can cause major sleep issues. There are two main reasons for this: I advised La-Vern to switch off all electronic screens at least one hour before going to bed. I also gave her some amber glasses to wear in the evening to reduce the amount of blue light hitting her eyes. These small changes had an immediate impact - her sleep improved and her energy levels increased. 3. Exercise and stress La-Vern is a very typical case of what I see in my practice. She's extremely busy - a single mother working two jobs and highly stressed. I explained to La-Vern how her energy reserve is a bit like a bank account - you cannot keep making withdrawals without going into overdraft. She had very little energy reserve left with the demands of being a single mum, her two jobs and lack of sleep. Whatever time she did have left, she spent going to the gym three times per week for an intense one-hour workout session, which left her feeling drained. La-Vern was simply doing too much and her exercise regime was actually putting more stress on her body. This is a common problem these days - we have been conditioned to think that more exercise is always better. I persuaded La-Vern to swap these intense workouts for yoga, a more restorative practice. This was life-changing. At the end of her yoga session, La-Vern not only felt as though she had worked out but also felt rejuvenated and energised. Plus, it was the only \\"switch off\\" time she had all week. By addressing these four areas of health - food, movement, sleep and stress - I not only helped La-Vern feel significantly better, but, just as importantly, I've reduced her risk of following her mother down the road towards type 2 diabetes. La-Vern is unstinting in her praise of Dr Chatterjee. She says he \\"saved\\" her life. She adds: \\"[That's} a profound statement I know; however he came into our lives at such a crucial time. By sharing his knowledge he has given me, my mum and my family the tools to implement very subtle changes that have literally turned our lives around. \\"As humans we take certain things for granted but do we realise how such things like stress, the food we eat and a lack of sleep, the quality of the sleep actually has such a detrimental impact on the way we think, our overall health and general well-being? Until now, I certainly did not. \\"Our lack of understanding meant we were tackling aspects of our lives and health believing it was for the best when in fact we were doing more harm than good. With the benefit of hindsight, this is quite a scary concept. \\"We felt truly blessed to have had the opportunity to have Dr Chatterjee in our lives. He is a very wise, caring and such a genuine person and we are so grateful to him for helping us to bring about changes that are having such a positive impact.\\" Too much of our focus in medicine is reactive and treatment kicks in only once you have a disease. If there is any hope of saving our NHS, we have to be much more proactive at recognising and treating problems early on. The future of healthcare needs to be preventive and personalised. It's what I call progressive medicine, and there is an ever-growing need for us to practise it right now. Type 2 diabetes: a real need for preventive medicine.

Q:What is the answer for the question: In what year was forty-seven clubs, brothels, and other vice establishments reportedly closed in Galveston? from the following article ? During the 1950s more dangerous criminal elements took advantage of Galveston's lax law enforcement and the absence of the Maceo brothers' influence. Non-vice crime increased in the city. The New Orleans crime syndicate, headed by Carlos Marcello, ran guns to Cuba through the island. Fugitives such as suspected JFK plotter David Ferrie used Galveston as a safe haven.By the 1950s gambling and prostitution were being actively repressed in most parts of Texas. In 1953, the police commissioner, Walter L. Johnston, under pressure from local citizens groups concerned about moral decline and high rates of venereal disease, shut down the red-light district. However, the mayoral victory of George Roy Clough, a supporter of regulated vice, led to the district's being re-established in 1955. That year Galveston was labeled by national anti-prostitution groups as the \\"worst spot in the nation as far as prostitution is concerned\\".Paul Hopkins won the 1956 election for sheriff and set about shutting down the island's illegal activities once and for all. One of the first successful busts of the gambling industry was an undercover operation by Texas Ranger Clint Peoples at the Balinese Room. In 1957 State Attorney General Will Wilson and Department of Public Safety head Homer Garrison (with help from former FBI special agent Jim Simpson) began a massive campaign of raids that wrecked the gambling and prostitution industry on the island, along with liquor imports. Forty-seven clubs, brothels, and other vice establishments were reportedly closed, and 2,000 slot machines were destroyed. Though officials said they destroyed all of the city's gaming equipment, some locals including R.S. Maceo, nephew of Sam and Rose, claimed that most of the equipment was shipped to Las Vegas before authorities ever discovered it. A:","completion":"The answer to the question is 1957.

Poor parental supervision also raises the chances of teenage drinking, said the Joesph Rowntree Foundation. If parents don't know where their children are on a Saturday night, or let them watch films of violence, they are more likely to have had an alcoholic drink. The survey also found the behavior of friends is also a powerful factor in drinking habits. The more time teenagers spend with friends, the more likely they are to drink alcohol. In this survey of 5,700 children aged 13 to 16, carried out by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, researchers found that one in five wanted to have a drink by the time they were 14. By the age of 16, half of those questioned said they had been drunk. Pamela Bremner, scientist of the survey, said, \\"For the first time in the UK, this study shows what most influences young people's drinking behavior.\\" \\"It found that the behavior of friends and family is the most common influential factor in determining how likely and how often a young person will drink alcohol.\\" Don Shenker, Chief Executive of Alcohol Concern, said, \\"Government ministers must also look at some of the causes of why it is so easy for children to get alcohol, usually from the home.\\" \\"Governments should look to see if they've done everything they can to help the large supermarkets from continuing to sell cheap alcohol which encourages more alcohol sales and therefore results in more alcohol being stored in the home.\\" The Royal College of Physicians also said it was not surprising that being able to get alcohol easily was an important factor on current drinking problems and drunkenness of teenagers.

However, its exploration of themes like personal identity, acceptance, and the power of music resonated with many viewers. As the film comes to an end, the characters experience a personal journey of self-discovery, finding solace and liberation within the chaos of the festival. Woodstock becomes a transformative experience for them, allowing them to break free from societal expectations and fully embrace the spirit of the 1960s counterculture. Ultimately, the film is a tribute to an iconic event in history, offering a snapshot of a generation that was finding its voice and identity, taking Woodstock as a symbol of that movement. Ang Lee, Emile Hirsch, and Demetri Martin continue their successful careers in the film industry, consistently drawing audiences and critical acclaim.

Trump blames Assad for the attack. A U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war. U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \\"hostilities\\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution. Additionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world. The Trump administration has used those authorizations as justification for its current war in Syria.

Authorities say the attack does not appear to be drug cartel-related, though analysts say the line between common and organized crime in the resort city has become extremely blurred after years of drug war carnage, reports the CBC. Acapulco Mayor Luis Walton swiftly condemned the attack, admitting it would hurt the city's image, but later apologized for saying \\"it happens anywhere in the world,\\" Reuters reports. The mayor \\"very much laments the misinterpretation of his comments, which were never intended to hurt the victims or minimize the facts,\\" his office said in a statement.

The local police are searching for a gang of five masked men who targeted a rented beach house and unleashed a terrifying, hours-long assault on the individuals inside. The Mexican coastal city saw a horrific incident this week, when the armed attackers burst into the beach house and held the six male tourists hostage. According to reports from CNN, the men were tied up, while their six female companions were subjected to an appalling series of assaults. Each of the women was raped by the intruders in an attack that lasted for several hours. Authorities have confirmed that the attack on the Spanish tourists does not appear to be linked to the ongoing drug cartel war in the region. However, the area is no stranger to violence, with clashes between rival criminal gangs responsible for numerous deaths in recent years. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) has reported that the distinction between drug war-related incidents and local criminal activity has gradually blurred, making it more difficult to determine the motives behind such attacks. The Mayor of Acapulco, Luis Walton, was quick to publicly condemn the appalling assault on the Spanish tourists. However, his initial comments have sparked controversy, with some critics accusing him of displaying a lack of sensitivity towards the victims. Walton initially stated that such attacks \\"happen anywhere in the world,\\" a comment he later apologized for, claiming it had been misinterpreted. A statement from the mayor's office read: \\"The mayor very much laments the misinterpretation of his comments, which were never intended to hurt the victims or minimize the facts.\\" In addition to the pursuit of the attackers, the Mexican authorities have taken the six Spanish women into their protection and provided them with consular assistance. The victims, aged between 20 and 34, are now being given the support they need following the traumatic events. The attack on the Spanish tourists has further tarnished Acapulco's already damaged image as a popular vacation spot. The city was a famous Hollywood getaway during the 1950s and has long been a favorite for US Spring Breakers, but the upsurge of violence in recent years has proven costly for the local tourism industry. Walton's admission, in his statement, suggests that the authorities are well aware of the lasting impact this brutal attack will have on the area's image. Currently, Acapulco remains on edge as the manhunt for the five armed and masked assailants continues. Local efforts to restore the city's image as a safe and family-friendly destination will face significant challenges, particularly in the wake of incidents like this assault on innocent tourists. The Mexican police and government officials will need to demonstrate their commitment to tackling crime and ensuring the safety of their citizens and visitors alike if they are to redeem the reputation of this once-thriving coastal resort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Killer: Heather Butler who knocked Sam Brown, 15, off his bicycle and killed him in Eastrington, East Yorkshire. A drunk nurse mowed down a 15-year-old boy while driving to work and left him to die – but only after stopping to remove his damaged bicycle from the front of her car. Heather Butler, 67, was unsteady and slurring her words when she arrived for her shift at a nursing home and a breath-test showed she was two-and-a-half times the legal limit, a court heard. She was jailed for five years and four months at Hull Crown Court. Judge Mark Bury told her it ‘would have been obvious’ she had hit the boy and the tragedy was made worse because she was ‘going to work caring for people and possibly giving out medication’ while drunk. By coincidence Butler knew the victim’s mother because she worked at the same nursing home. Her Audi A4 car ploughed into schoolboy Sam Brown as he and a friend cycled home in the dark at 9pm without rear lights. Her windscreen was smashed and wing mirror removed. She stopped 200 metres on to remove the bike from her grille, threw it aside and continued to work less than a mile away without going back to treat Sam or his 15-year-old friend, who suffered a broken shoulder. Butler had drunk a glass of wine and ‘three home measures’ of gin and tonic before driving, the court heard. When she arrived at the Old School House Nursing Home in Gilberdyke, East Yorkshire, she was asked if she was alright and replied: ‘No, I think I hit a cyclist.’ Two colleagues went out in a car, found Sam and tried to help motorists resuscitate him. He died of head injuries in hospital. The court heard Butler had been reported for being drunk at work in the past and ‘it was rare she did not smell of alcohol’. Motorist Nicholas Webb was behind Butler at the time of the crash on the B1230 on September 6 last year. He said she was ‘all over the road’ and ‘driving fast’, prompting him to drop back. She was speeding and a crash investigation found she did not brake or take evasive action. In a statement to police, Butler recalled ‘seeing a cyclist ahead of me, very close to me, and then I felt the impact at the front of my car.’ Victim: Sam Brown, 15, was thrown off his bicycle after being clipped by Butler's Audi A4 as he cycled with his friend. Victim: Sam Brown who died after being hit by Heather Butler's Audi A4 in Eastrington, East Yorkshire. She added: ‘Following the feeling I. pulled over and got out. I could not see anything close to my car. I was. in a state of panic and thought I should drive to work and report it. at work. 'Sometimes I wish I was not here. The loss is something I will feel for the rest of my life' Tracey Brown, mother of Sam Brown. ‘It never occurred to me to use my mobile phone.’ Butler, who is married and worked at. the nursing home for 18 years, admitted causing death by careless. driving while over the limit, failing to report an accident and failing. to stop. Paul Genney, defending, said she wanted to apologise. He said: ‘She is genuinely remorseful.’ Butler has resigned and is likely to. be struck off the nursing register. Butler was given a five-year. driving ban and ordered to take an extended re-test. She is likely to. serve only half of her prison term. Crash scene: Flowers are piled up in tribute to Sam Brown, 15, following the accident on the the B1230 Hull Road last September. In a statement mother-of-four Tracey Brown, 42, said losing Sam was ‘unbearable’. 'Following the feeling I pulled over and got out. I could not see anything close to my car. I was in a state of panic and thought I should drive to work and report it at work' Heather Butler. She added: ‘Sometimes I wish I was not here. The loss is something I will feel for the rest of my life.’ After the hearing she and husband Stephen, 45, described the sentence as ‘disgusting’. Franki Hackett of road safety charity Brake said: ‘It is appalling such a callous crime could lead to such a paltry sentence. ‘It makes a mockery of justice that someone could face less than three years in prison for taking a promising young life.’ What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

However, the bureau has been struggling to fill the void left by one of their strongest assets - Liz Sherman, the firestarter. Liz, a former BPRD agent with the ability to create and control fire, left the bureau five years ago after a tragic mission, causing her to lose control which resulted in the death of innocents. Since then, she has been living off the grid, battling her guilt and afraid of her own destructive powers. John Myers, an experienced BPRD agent who had once shared a close bond with Liz, is determined to bring her back to the fold. With major paranormal threats looming on the horizon that could shatter the balance between humans and the supernatural, Liz's powers may be the only thing that can save humanity. Myers tracks Liz to a remote mountain where Liz is seeking to control her fiery abilities under the tutelage of an ancient fire elementalist named Moranna. Meanwhile, back at the BPRD, a sinister supernatural cult led by the charismatic and ruthless Magnus DeMarce has infiltrated the organization and seeks to unleash its master's diabolical agenda. As Magnus and his cult advance their insidious plan to awaken and control a primordial force of darkness, the BPRD finds itself scrambling to counter their every move, losing more and more ground. Myers, finally convincing Liz of the danger to the world and stressing the importance of her return, manages to coax her back to the BPRD. Reunited with her old teammates, Liz must now face her past and confront her deepest fears, as well as rediscover her capabilities to control her fiery powers.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Lester Willis Young (August 27, 1909 - March 15, 1959), nicknamed \\"Pres\\" or \\"Prez\\", was an American jazz tenor saxophonist and occasional clarinetist. Coming to prominence while a member of Count Basie's orchestra, Young was one of the most influential players on his instrument. In contrast to many of his hard-driving peers, Young played with a relaxed, cool tone and used sophisticated harmonies, using what one critic called \\"a free-floating style, wheeling and diving like a gull, banking with low, funky riffs that pleased dancers and listeners alike\\". Known for his hip, introverted style, he invented or popularized much of the hipster jargon which came to be associated with the music. Young left the Basie band in late 1940. He is rumored to have refused to play with the band on Friday, December 13 of that year for superstitious reasons spurring his dismissal, although Young and drummer Jo Jones would later state that his departure had been in the works for months. He subsequently led a number of small groups that often included his brother, drummer Lee Young, for the next couple of years; live and broadcast recordings from this period exist. During this period Young accompanied the singer Billie Holiday in a couple of studio sessions (during 1937 - 1941 period) and also made a small set of recordings with Nat \\"King\\" Cole (their first of several collaborations) in June 1942. His studio recordings are relatively sparse during the 1942 to 1943 period, largely due to the recording ban by the American Federation of Musicians. Small record labels not bound by union contracts continued to record and he recorded some sessions for Harry Lim's Keynote label in 1943. In December 1943 Young returned to the Basie fold for a 10-month stint, cut short by his being drafted into the army during World War II (see below). Recordings made during this and subsequent periods suggest Young was beginning to make much greater use of a plastic reed, which tended to give his playing a somewhat heavier, breathier tone (although still quite smooth compared to that of many other players). While he never abandoned the cane reed, he used the plastic reed a significant share of the time from 1943 until the end of his life. Another cause for the thickening of his tone around this time was a change in saxophone mouthpiece from a metal Otto Link to an ebonite Brilhart. In August 1944 Young appeared alongside drummer Jo Jones, trumpeter Harry \\"Sweets\\" Edison, and fellow tenor saxophonist Illinois Jacquet in Gjon Mili's short film Jammin' the Blues. Why did he change to a plastic reed?","completion":"Lester Young started to make much greater use of a plastic reed during the 1943 period, which gave his playing a somewhat heavier, breathier tone, although still quite smooth compared to that of many other players.

After Deloris walks in on Vince having his chauffeur Ernie executed for betrayal, Vince orders his two henchmen Joey and Willy to kill her as well. Deloris flees Vince's casino to the local police station where Lieutenant Eddie Souther suggests she testify against Vince if he can be arrested and tried, but for now, she should go into witness protection until the time comes. Deloris is taken to St. Katherine's Parish in a seedy, run-down neighborhood of San Francisco, where Souther suggests she take refuge in the attached convent. Both Deloris and the stoic Reverend Mother object, but are convinced by Souther and Monsignor O'Hara to go ahead with it. Deloris 'becomes' a nun â habit and all â under the hand of Reverend Mother, who gives her the religious name 'Sister Mary Clarence' to complete the disguise. Mary Clarence objects to following the strictures and simple life of the convent, but comes to befriend several of the nuns, including the forever jolly Sister Mary Patrick, quiet and meek Sister Mary Robert, and the elderly deadpan Sister Mary Lazarus.

Bowe Bergdahl has been held by the Taliban since 2009 America’s only prisoner-of-war may finally be coming home. Four years after Private Bowe Bergdahl was seized from a dusty no-man’s-land in Afghanistan, his parents are this weekend negotiating directly with the Taliban for his release. But for Bob and Jani Bergdahl, whose exhausting campaign for their son’s return is reflected in the now tattered yellow ribbons that are tied around their ranch in Hailey, Idaho, the most difficult battle may still be ahead. Rumours that he has gone rogue were prompted by Bowe’s criticism of the","completion":"US military and its operations in Afghanistan in emails sent to his parents prior to his capture. Some of his fellow soldiers have accused him of desertion, claiming he willingly left his post before being captured by the Taliban. As the only U.S. prisoner-of-war, Bowe Bergdahl's case has gained significant attention throughout his captivity. In 2014, further hopes for his release were raised when the Obama administration negotiated the exchange of five top-ranking Taliban fighters held at Guantanamo Bay for Bergdahl's freedom. The negotiation process has been complex and fraught with many challenges. Both the U.S. government and the Bergdahl family have been working tirelessly to secure his safe return. The family's direct negotiations with the Taliban demonstrate their determination to ensure the release of their son. Despite the challenging and long-awaited negotiation process, the article implies that Bowe Bergdahl's eventual return home could be accompanied by a more difficult battle. This is primarily due to the rumors and accusations surrounding his actions before his capture. The rumors of Bowe going rogue have introduced another layer of complexity into his case. His criticisms of the U.S. military's presence and actions in Afghanistan - expressed in emails to his parents - have led some to question his loyalty to his country. Most significantly, several of his fellow soldiers have accused him of desertion, stating that he willingly left his post before being taken captive by the Taliban. These accusations of desertion have further politicized his case, with some accusing the Obama administration of trading high-ranking Taliban prisoners for someone they perceive as a traitor. The potential fallout from these rumors and accusations might very well intensify Bowe Bergdahl's post-release struggles. The heart-wrenching campaign of his parents to secure his release, symbolized by the weathered yellow ribbons tied around their ranch, highlights not only their unwavering support and determination but also the difficulties that may lie ahead for Bowe and his family once he is finally home. Upon his return, Bowe Bergdahl may face military investigation and potential repercussions for alleged desertion. At the same time, he will also have to reunite with his family and reintegrate into society after many years in captivity. The community's reception to his eventual homecoming might be mixed, with some showing support and empathy, while others continue to harbor suspicions and resentment based on the lingering rumors of desertion. In conclusion, while the imminent release of Bowe Bergdahl holds the promise of his long-awaited homecoming, the struggle for the Bergdahl family and for Bowe himself might be far from over. The rumors and accusations surrounding his capture have created significant challenges that he and his family will need to overcome upon his return. Navigating the complexities of public opinion and the potential implications of a military investigation are likely to present considerable difficulties in the coming months and years, even after Bowe is finally reunited with his loved ones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the following context: When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to \\"St. Mary\\", but that does not mean that he wrote it.\\"Amazing Grace\\", with the words written by Newton and joined with \\"New Britain\\", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook Southern Harmony in 1847.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who did the men who deserted tell of La Salle's death in 1688? Four of the men deserted when they reached the Neches River. La Salle and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for two months. While the men recovered, the group ran low on food and gunpowder. In August, the eight surviving members of the expedition returned to Fort Saint Louis, having never left East Texas.While La Salle was gone, six of those who had remained on the Belle finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors did not know how to sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.By early January 1687, fewer than 45 of the original 180 people remained in the colony, which was beset by internal strife. La Salle believed that their only hope of survival lay in trekking overland to request assistance from New France, and some time that month he led a final expedition to try to reach the Illinois Country. Fewer than 20 people remained at Fort Saint Louis, primarily women, children, and those deemed unfit, as well as seven soldiers and three missionaries with whom La Salle was unhappy. Seventeen men were included on the expedition, including La Salle, his brother, and two of his nephews. While camping near present-day Navasota on March 18, several of the men quarreled over the division of buffalo meat. That night, an expedition member killed one of La Salle's nephews and two other men in their sleep. The following day La Salle was killed while approaching the camp to investigate his nephew's disappearance. Infighting led to the deaths of two other expedition members within a short time.

Lanier said that three victims suffered blunt-force or sharp-object wounds and that all four deaths in the upscale neighborhood near the vice president’s residence were being investigated as homicides. “Evidence collection will go on for several days,” Lanier said. “There’s still a lot more we don’t know.” Lanier renewed a call she originally made Thursday for information about the family’s blue 2008 Porsche 911, which disappeared from the home Thursday morning. She asked the public to contact authorities if anyone had seen it between Wednesday and Thursday at 5 p.m. — a longer time frame than authorities had initially requested. Lanier declined to explain why investigators now wanted to know about the car’s whereabouts a day earlier. The Porsche was found burning in Prince George’s County on Thursday evening, Lanier said. Prince George’s County Fire spokesman Mark Brady said firefighters extinguished the fire about 5:30 p.m. behind a church at 8201 Annapolis Rd. in Lanham, Md. Lanier said it was unclear who had been driving the vehicle. Lanier said there was no evidence to suggest random or forced entry into the Savopouloses’ home but asked anyone who had seen anything suspicious in the area to call police. Asked whether the house had been ransacked, Lanier said it was “difficult to make that determination” because of the fire. Authorities have been going through the home to try to determine whether anything was stolen, according to two officials with knowledge of the case. Police say three of the four victims found in a burning Northwest D.C. home on Thursday suffered blunt force or sharp object wounds. Their deaths are being investigated as homicides. (WUSA9) The Savopouloses are survived by two teenage daughters, who friends said were at their boarding schools Thursday. Abigail Savopoulos is a senior at Mercersburg Academy, an elite private school in Pennsylvania, and is scheduled to graduate next week. Her younger sister, Katerina, is a junior at Peddie School near Princeton, N.J. Philip was a student at St. Albans School in the District. Neighbors said the family had lived on the block for more than a decade. They described the community as tightknit and said the Savopouloses were an integral part of it. They regularly held gatherings at their home for neighbors and friends. They attended church at the nearby St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral for about 10 years. Coco Palomeque, a friend who lives in the neighborhood, said the Savopouloses were “a beautiful family.” “The community where they lived really loved them,” she said. Savvas Savopoulos was the president and chief executive of Hyattsville-based American Iron Works, which played a role in building Verizon Center and ­CityCenterDC. His Facebook page says he also worked for Sigma Investment Strategies in Puerto Rico. American Iron Works officials declined to comment. Amy Savopoulos was widely known as a deeply involved mother who spent much of her time volunteering at her children’s schools or raising funds for them. On her Facebook page, her daughter Abigail posted a tribute on Mother’s Day: “I am so grateful for everything you do. Thank you for always believing in me and supporting me. Thank you for the early morning crafts, upside down clowns on my birthday, gingerbread decorating parties, and for always showing up. . . . Thank you for the past 19 years and I look forward to the many more to come. I love you so much.” About 180 people gathered to mourn the family Friday afternoon in a lower-level chapel at Washington National Cathedral. The 30-minute service included prayer, singing and periods of silence. Many who had come were struggling not only with what happened, but also with how to discuss it with their children, said the Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, who helped lead the service. “When people grieve, they want to be with other people,” Budde said. “Everyone is really sad, and really shocked.” Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who has known the family for more than 20 years, said in a statement that he was saddened. Savvas Savopoulos raised money for Van Hollen’s campaigns. “My heart goes out to the Savopoulos family at this time of unspeakable tragedy,” the statement read. “They were an important part of the community and will be deeply missed.” As friends and relatives grieved, investigators wearing yellow hard hats walked in and out of the gutted Savopoulos home. Yellow police tape still blocked off sections of Woodland Drive and 32nd Street NW, and a large ATF explosives and fire investigation vehicle was parked out front. Joe Carregal, a neighbor, said he saw the fire unfold Thursday. About 1:15 p.m., he said he saw smoke pouring from the upper-story windows of the home and a man knocking on the front door in an attempt to get the family out. Soon after, fire trucks came roaring down the street. Firefighters broke windows on the house, deployed ladders and clambered onto the roof to extinguish flames. Carregal said he watched them pull three victims from the house. Chris Vorobek, who lives in the neighborhood, said he would see Amy Savopoulos, walking her dog in the neighborhood, and her son racing around on his bicycle. “He was a great kid,” Vorobek said. Keith L. Alexander, Lynh Bui, Alice Crites, Abigail Hauslohner, Peter Hermann, Roxanne Roberts, Valerie Strauss, Julie Tate and Clarence Williams contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"In Washington D.C., police have released a video of a person of interest in relation to a suspicious fire at the home of Savvas and Amy Savopoulos. The couple, along with their son and housekeeper, were found dead inside the house. The fire is being investigated as a homicide arson. A blue Porsche 911 with D.C. license plates was seen near the house on the day of the fire and was later found torched and unoccupied in the parking lot of a church in Maryland.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis B. I am facing a new situation today: Jennifer and Maria both had unprotected sex with the same man. This man, unbeknownst to them, has hepatitis b. Both women go to the doctor to get checked out. Jennifer reports that she is coughing frequently and has a congested nose. The doctor notices that Maria has yellow eyes and she tells the doctor that she has been throwing up. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who will probably not be prescribed medicine for their liver? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation presented, it is more likely that Jennifer will not be prescribed medicine for her liver. This is because the symptoms she has reported, such as coughing frequently and having a congested nose, are not associated with Hepatitis B infection. These symptoms may point to an unrelated respiratory or common cold infection. On the other hand, Maria is showing symptoms that are consistent with Hepatitis B infection, such as yellow eyes and vomiting. Yellowing of the eyes is a sign of jaundice, which is caused by liver damage or dysfunction as a result of the Hepatitis B virus. Vomiting is another symptom mentioned in the background article specific to Hepatitis B. It is important to note that both Jennifer and Maria should still be tested for Hepatitis B, given their exposure to a partner with the virus through unprotected sex. Additionally, a healthcare professional should be consulted to determine the appropriate course of action and treatment for each individual, as this answer cannot replace the personalized guidance of a medical professional. However, based on the information provided, it is more probable that Jennifer will not be prescribed medicine for her liver due to her symptoms being unrelated to Hepatitis B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the bread has to be kept outdoors happens, how will it affect the bread is kept somewhere more dry. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the process. If the bread has to be kept outdoors but is stored in a drier location, it can impact the process in the following ways: 1. Direct effect: A drier location will reduce the bread's ability to absorb moisture from the air. This means that the bread will likely remain less moist, making it less conducive for mold growth. 2. Indirect effect: Since the bread is outdoors, it will still be exposed to the elements like dust particles with mold spores. However, in a drier location, the reduced moisture content in the bread might slow down the mold spores' ability to consume the bread for energy, thus delaying or limiting the growth of mold colonies. In summary, keeping the bread in a drier location outdoors will likely have a direct impact on the bread's moisture absorption and an indirect impact on the mold growth process. This results in a slower or less extensive mold development compared to bread kept in a more humid environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process is the birds laying eggs. The life cycle you described consists of the following stages: 1. The birds lay eggs: This marks the beginning of a new generation, where adult birds most commonly create a safe and secure nest for their eggs. They then lay their eggs in this nest, where the development of the embryos inside the eggs commences. 2. The egg hatches into a baby bird: After a certain incubation period specific to the species, the baby bird (also known as a hatchling or chick) emerges from the egg. This process typically involves the chick breaking the eggshell using a small protrusion on its upper beak called an egg tooth. 3. Baby bird eats and grows: The baby bird needs nutrition to grow and develop. It usually relies on its parents to feed it until it can find food on its own. During this period, the hatchling undergoes rapid growth and will begin to develop its adult features. 4. Grows into an adult bird: As the bird matures, it acquires the physical characteristics required for survival, such as feathers, proper proportions, and strength. At this stage, the bird is considered an adult and can now fend for itself, including finding food, avoiding predators, and developing social skills. 5. The bird finds a mate: As part of the reproductive process, adult birds of most species seek to find a suitable mate. This often involves courtship rituals and displays intended to attract a partner for breeding. 6. The pair build a nest: Once a suitable mate has been found, the pair of birds work together to construct a nest. This serves as a safe place for them to lay their eggs and raise their offspring. 7. Return to step 1: After laying eggs, the life cycle is now complete and starts anew with the next generation."},{"prompt":"Q:Question: How does Hercules finally kill the hydra? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Hercules Context: In Ancient Greece in the land far away, when people read Greek mythology came the time of legend â the greatest son of Zeus â Hercules. Hercules was once destined to be the King of Mycenae as his father Zeus had planned but his jealous stepmother Hera had other plans. Hera not willing a bastard son of Zeus should overshadow her, decided to let another boy, Eurystheus, his cousin born first which deprived Hercules of the right. Hera tried to kill Hercules with two serpents but he strangles them both. As the years go by, Hercules displayed strength like no other boy his age which unknown to many, his father is really Zeus. Eurystheus was then declared king after winning a race. Unable to accept his defeat, Hercules challenged Eurystheus to another round which accidentally takes away the life of his mother Alcmene. Feeling guilty even with all the consolation Megara gives him, he goes to the oracle and consults Apollo who tells him he must perform the \\"Twelve Labors\\" for Eurystheus. He refuses at first until the guilt goes so deep that he gives in to the challenge. Hercules is given a series of challenges each one was designed tougher by the other by his stepmother Hera. He was first sent to kill the Nemean lion which he succeeded into turning his coat. He also drove away the Stymphalian birds with the help of Athena's cymbals. Each one was made difficult by the other as his stepmother hopes to see the last of him. A series of labors are shown like the slaying of the Lernaean Hydra, catching the stag of Artemis, the Cathmanian boar, the Cretan bull, cleaning the Augeean stables, getting the girdle of Hippolyte, the man-eating mares of Diomedes and the Cattle of Geryon (but the monster is not shown).

The island of Saint Helena has a total area of 122 km2 (47 sq mi), and is composed largely of rugged terrain of volcanic origin (the last volcanic eruptions occurred about 7 million years ago). Coastal areas are covered in volcanic rock and warmer and drier than the centre. The highest point of the island is Diana's Peak at 818 m (2,684 ft). In 1996 it became the island's first national park. Much of the island is covered by New Zealand flax, a legacy of former industry, but there are some original trees augmented by plantations, including those of the Millennium Forest project which was established in 2002 to replant part of the lost Great Wood and is now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust. When the island was discovered, it was covered with unique indigenous vegetation, including a remarkable cabbage tree species. The island's hinterland must have been a dense tropical forest but the coastal areas were probably also quite green. The modern landscape is very different, with widespread bare rock in the lower areas, although inland it is green, mainly due to introduced vegetation. There are no native land mammals, but cattle, cats, dogs, donkeys, goats, mice, rabbits, rats and sheep have been introduced, and native species have been adversely affected as a result.

It is a tradition that has been cherished since ancient times, but as social mobility increases in modern times, the road to family reunions has become very uneasy. It is not the higher travel costs, nor the expected big spending on gifts and other festival items, but the train ticket that has driven many travelers mad. I've heard some colleagues complain that they have tried every means to secure a train ticket, only to find it a mission impossible. Some of them have turned to the latest software to aid online booking; others have sought help from friends to increase the possibility of successful booking. No doubt chunyun, the Spring Festival travel season, is the largest-scale annual human migration in the world. Last year, 220 million passengers traveled by train during the Spring Festival season, which usually lasts 40 days. It is a huge jump from 10 years ago, when the number was 128 million. With the big sudden increase in demand, the railway company has increased investment in railway construction; still, it cannot bridge the supply gap, leading to fierce public complaints and criticism. Admittedly, it is almost impossible for the railway company to suddenly improve its capacity to meet the explosive demand during the Spring Festival holiday. Moreover, any temporary increase in capacity would become unnecessary after the holiday and mean great commercial losses during the off season. What the company can reasonably do is gradually improve its capacity while focusing on better distribution of its existing resources during the special peak season. At any rate, however, the problem cannot be solved overnight. Question: What's the tone of the whole passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Objective\\"?
