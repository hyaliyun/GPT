You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: In addition to cardio exercises, you can also include some strength training exercises using the stairs as well. Working your legs and glutes is particularly easy with stairs. Lunges are an easy exercise to adapt to a staircase. Lunges really work your legs and glutes without the addition of stairs, so doing them on stairs will really up the intensity. To do lunges, you'll take the stairs two or three at a time. Going for more stairs than this will increase your risk of overstraining. Step your right foot up two or three stairs. Focus on pulling yourself up the stairs using your right leg. You will notice this in your thigh muscles. Push yourself up until your left leg comes to meet the right leg on the step. Repeat either on the same side or do alternating lunges. Aim for 10 lunges per side or do as many as you're able. Running or jogging up the stairs is pretty taxing on your legs, glutes, heart, and lungs. If you want to get a balanced workout, you're going to want to include some upper body work as well. The elevation of the actual stairs also allows you to work the backs of the arms and triceps. To start, face away from the staircase. Rest your arms on the second or third stair with your fingers facing away from the stairs. Grab the corner of the stair for this exercise and keep arms shoulder width apart. Keep your feet flat on the ground in front of you. Press your hips up so that your arms are in a straight, extended position. Slowly lower your body down using your triceps to allow your body to dip down toward the stairs. Lower down until your arms are bent about 90-degrees. Push yourself up back to the starting position. Try to do three sets of 15 to 20 reps. Like tricep dips, you can also use the stairs to do push-ups as well. These work your arms, chest and core muscles.. Start by facing the stairs and placing your hands on the first or second step. Keep your legs extended behind you so you're almost in a plank-like position. The higher the stair you use to place your hands, the easier this exercise is. While keeping your hands shoulder width apart, slowly bend your elbows so that your upper body and face slowly lower down towards the stairs. Lower down until your nose is almost touching the stairs. Hold this position here for a few seconds and then slowly push yourself up to the starting position. Do a decline push-up variation by placing your feet on the bottom or second step and your hands on the floor at ground level. Similar to lunges, doing side steps up the staircase can help strengthen your legs, but more specifically the inner and outer muscles of your thighs. Start this exercise by standing next to the stairs with your right shoulder facing the stairs. Step up 1 or 2 steps with your right leg and bring your left leg up to the step below it. Repeat until you get to the top and then do it again, this time leading with your left leg. This exercise can really make your calves pop. It works the gastrocnemius, which is likely what you think of when you imagine a calf muscle. Start by standing on the edge of the stair. Only about the first fourth of each foot should be on the stair; your heels should be hanging off the edge. Rise up on your toes as high as you can. Keep your back, legs, and feet straight and don't allow yourself to lean forward or backwards. Slowly lower your body as far as possible. Keep one hand on the banister if balance is a concern. Try doing this on one leg for an even more effective exercise, but only do so if you have a banister or wall to hold.","completion":"The article discusses how stairs can be used as an effective tool for a variety of cardio and strength training exercises, focusing especially on leg, glute, and upper body toning. The first exercise explained is lunges, which can be done with the aid of stairs. Lunges are generally an effective exercise for the legs and glutes, but doing them on stairs increases the intensity and effectiveness. The instruction for executing a lunge involves taking the stairs two or three at a time to avoid overstraining, stepping a foot up two or three stairs, and then pulling one's self up the stairs using the leg on the stair. This is repeated alternately and it's recommended to aim for 10 lunges on each side. The second exercise is for upper body work, specifically the backs of the arms and triceps, which involves utilizing the elevation of the stairs. This exercise entails first facing away from the staircase, then resting arms on the second or third stair, grabbing the corner of the stair, pressing hips upward, and next lowering the body down using triceps until the arms are bent about 90-degrees. Finally, you push yourself back to the starting position. Three sets of 15 to 20 reps are suggested. Push-ups using the stairs is another upper body work exercise that targets the arms, chest, and core muscles. The directions include facing the stairs, placing hands on the first or second step, bending the elbows to lower the body towards the stairs, and holding this position before pushing back up to the original position, with variations including a decline push-up. The article mentions side steps as strengthening for the legs, with specific benefits to the inner and outer muscles of the thighs. To execute this exercise, one starts standing next to the stairs and steps up one or two steps with one leg, and then brings the other leg up to the step below it, alternating with each leg. The last exercise is calf raises, which work the gastrocnemius and can visually enhance the appearance of your calves. To perform this exercise, one starts by standing on the edge of the stairs, rises up on your toes, keeps back, legs, and feet straight, and then lowers the body down. This can be performed either on two legs or one leg at a time if one's balance is good or using a banister for support. Overall, the article illustrates how stairs can be utilized as an all-inclusive exercise tool that helps to integrate balance, coordination, and strength training, particularly for the legs, glutes, and upper body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Keywords: seat, toilet, wood What is a sentence that includes all these keywords?","completion":"A wooden toilet seat is a type of toilet accessory made from wood, which serves as a practical and aesthetic addition to any bathroom, with its natural, organic texture providing both comfort and style. Known for its durability and warmth, wood has been used as a material for toilet seats for centuries. It offers a distinct aesthetic appeal that isn't replicated in plastic seat models, forming an ambiance of refinement and elegance for your bathroom. Wood is a very sturdy material, and this durability is reflected in the wooden toilet seats as well, which can last for years if carefully maintained. Not only does a wooden seat lend a chic, rustic charm, it also helps eliminate the unpleasant chill you might experience with plastic or ceramic toilet seats, particularly in colder climates. Among the variety of woods used, oak, mahogany, walnut, and bamboo are popular choices due to their natural resistance to water damage and their visual appeal. However, the key to a durable and long-lasting wooden toilet seat lies in its finishing. It must be properly sealed and treated to withstand the moisture-rich environment of bathrooms. High-quality wooden toilet seats will usually come with a high-gloss finish that not only protects the wood from water damage but also makes it easier to clean and maintain. Wooden toilet seats come in a variety of shapes and sizes to fit most standard toilets and bathroom designs. They are often equipped with sturdy hinges for durability and easy installation. Despite their numerous advantages, wooden toilet seats can be a bit more expensive than their plastic counterparts, and they do require a bit more care to keep them in good shape. Regular cleaning with mild, non-abrasive cleaners and avoiding harsh chemicals can help maintain the finish and prolong the life of a wooden toilet seat. Finally, wooden toilet seats are a testament to the versatility of wood as a material. From houses and furniture to toilet seats, wood has always been an important part of human life. The sense of warmth and comfort provided by a wooden toilet seat seems to reaffirm this bond with nature. In conclusion, a wooden toilet seat is more than just a utility item; it is a statement of style and sustainability that can make a great impact on your bathroom's design and your own comfort."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN)Before a deadly fire that burned a home in Annapolis, Maryland, technology executive Don Pyle and his wife, Sandra, spent a day with their four grandchildren. The day included shopping for costumes, dinner at the Medieval Times restaurant and a sleepover at Pyle's waterfront mansion. Monday was a school holiday, and the children -- Alexis (Lexi) Boone, 8; Kaitlyn (Katie) Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8; and Wesley (Wes) Boone, 6 -- stayed over, a family spokeswoman said. Pyle, his wife and the four grandchildren are now feared dead after a suspicious fire destroyed the mansion early Monday morning. Authorities have recovered four bodies from the ruins. They continue to search for the others. \\"On behalf of the Boone and","completion":"Pyle families, we would like to express our gratitude to everyone who has reached out to support us during this tragic time. The loss of Don, Sandra, and our precious grandchildren has left a void that will never be filled, and our family is absolutely devastated,” the family spokeswoman said in a written statement. The day the Pyles had spent with their grandchildren was described as one filled with love, laughter, and cherished memories to last a lifetime. The children, who each had a vibrant and unique personality, enjoyed every moment spent with their doting grandparents, who shared their passion for adventure and fun. The Annapolis community has been a pillar of strength for the family throughout this time, with locals rallying together to offer support, comfort, and assistance in any way possible. From organizing fundraisers and toy drives to honor the memory of the four young children, to providing meals and emotional support to both the Boone and Pyle families, the outpouring of love has been tremendous. The fire investigation has been a top priority for local authorities, who have worked tirelessly to determine the cause of the blaze that so tragically ended the lives of the Pyles and their beloved grandchildren. Firefighters, police, and federal investigators have sought out every available resource and poured over the charred remains of the once-iconic mansion in an effort to bring closure and answer the many questions still lingering. The families have been briefed on the findings of the investigation thus far, and though the fire has been deemed suspicious, there is a reluctance to jump to conclusions without concrete evidence. The search for the remaining bodies continues, while the community holds its breath, hoping for answers that will bring peace to the Boone and Pyle families. In memory of Don, Sandra, and their four precious angels, a trust fund has been set up to benefit local schools, children's programs, and other causes that were near and dear to the hearts of the Pyles and their grandchildren. The families hope that the legacy of love and joy that these six individuals brought into the world will be channeled into making a difference in the lives of others. As they begin the long and painful process of healing, the Boone and Pyle families will forever hold onto the cherished memories of the time they had spent with their loved ones. They ask the media and the public to remain respectful of their privacy during this trying time and to join them in remembering Don, Sandra, Lexi, Katie, Charlotte, and Wes not just for the manner in which they died, but for the vibrant lives that they lived and the love that they shared."},{"prompt":"Two islands were situated in different oceans.

One way is being unselfish, not wanting everything from our friends. Another way is to look for good points, not bad points in other people. It is surprising how successful this treasure hunt can be. You do not have to be spineless in order to be popular. In fact, you will be liked or loved if you are not afraid to stand up for your rights . But do it politely and pleasantly. Being friendly and polite to your group, to other people and to strangers and especially to those who do not look important or do not interest you is one way to develop a good character. You cannot expect to be perfect, and you must learn not to be unhappy when you make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and no one is to be blamed if he does not refuse to learn from them. Many young people become discouraged when they know in themselves qualities that they do not like--selfishness, laziness, and other unpleasant qualities. Just remember that we all have some of these faults and have to fight against them. At the same time, it is important to remember that while you are probably no worse than others, the best way to be happy is to think yourself above other people. When something is wrong, it is good sense to try to make it right. Perhaps you do not like a teacher or a classmate. Try to see why, and look at yourself, too, to be sure that you are not doing anything to make that person dislike you.

Installing deck tiles typically involves several steps. To provide more depth to this answer, let's review this process in detail: Step 1: Initial Assessment and Planning Before the contractor starts installation, they'd probably carry out an inspection of the deck surface to ensure it's flat and free of any defects that might disrupt the tile installation process. In the tutorial video, after the inspection, the contractor will likely take measurements to determine how many interlocking wooden tiles are required for the deck area. Step 2: Preparing the Surface After the planning and getting necessary materials, the contractor would then move on to preparing the deck surface. This might mean cleaning the surface thoroughly of any debris which could interfere with the tiles' installation, ensuring the surface is dry, and possibly grinding down any uneven areas to ensure a flat surface. Step 3: Laying out the Tiles With a clean, flat surface, the contractor is then able to begin laying out the interlocking wooden tiles on the concrete deck surface. This is where the selected next event comes in: \\"begins installing the interlocking wooden tiles on a concrete deck surface.\\" To do this, the contractor would position a tile in one corner of the deck and then work outward along the edge, snapping the tiles together and ensuring they're aligned correctly. Step 4: Installing the Tiles Once the tiles layout is satisfactory, the contractor would then proceed to actually secure the tiles to the concrete deck surface. This step might involve using adhesives, screws, or special clips depending on the tile type and the specific installation guide. Step 5: Finish and Clean up After all tiles have been placed and secured, the contractor might check all tiles for stability, make any necessary final adjustments to ensure a proper finish, then clean up. So, in the context of a tutorial about installing deck tiles, it is most logical to assume that after the inspection, preparation, and planning, the contractor would now begin the actual installation of the interlocking wooden tiles on the concrete deck surface."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Megan cared for many more patients than Katrina because","completion":"Megan was a head nurse at a bustling hospital in the heart of the city, while Katrina was a part-time nurse in a more tranquil suburban healthcare clinic. The differences in their work environments and their respective roles within those environments often dictated the number of patients they handled daily. Megan’s hospital was like the beating heart of the city, always throbbing and never still. It catered to a dense population of urban dwellers, including both residents and transient city workers. Every day, there were at least a few dozen patients who needed the attention of the medical staff. Every hour brought forth a new challenge, from emergency trauma cases to the persistent line of patients seeking treatment for chronic illnesses. Given the high number of patients, sometimes there were backlogs and bottlenecks that stretched Megan's capacity and skills to the limit. Contrarily, Katrina worked in a serene, suburban clinic. Here, the pace of life was far slower, and the healthcare needs were less complex and urgent. They saw fewer patients per day, with a slant towards routine check-ups, minor illnesses, and follow-up cases related to ongoing treatment plans. The demand was much less when compared with the city hospital where Megan worked, making the number of patients Katrina cared for notably lesser. At the city hospital, Megan led a team of nurses. With her experience and rank, she was assigned the most number of cases. Her team admired her for her tenacity and dedication, working round the clock during her shifts. Her role required a deeper and more direct involvement with each patient. She made challenging decisions and intricate judgements, each weaving a different narrative in the overall story of providing healthcare to the endless stream of patients. On the other hand, Katrina, being a part-time nurse, had a more streamlined and limited set of responsibilities at the clinic. Her work hours were shorter, and the procedures less complex. The small-to-medium scale of operations allowed her to provide care to fewer patients but she could get involved more personally in each case. The reduced number of patients allowed Katrina to potentially create stronger empathic bonds with her patients, charting their progress meticulously over weeks and months. Additionally, the patient to nurse ratio was a significant factor. In the city hospital, the massive influx of patients meant that Megan had to take care of more patients even if resources could be extended. However, Katrina, in her quiet suburban clinic, generally had fewer patients under her care which allowed for longer interactions but translated into lesser patient numbers. Both Megan and Katrina performed their duties diligently and each spent a considerable amount of time providing care to their patients. However, due to the largely different nature of their workplaces, and the patient demographic that they catered to, Megan ended up caring for many more patients than Katrina."},{"prompt":"Q:June and I were both poor when we were young. At that time, June always said, \\" If I got rich, I would buy a bigger apartment and a new wardrobe .\\" Of course, she said this just for fun and she never imagined that she would really become rich. A few years ago, June was surprised and excited when she came into a fortune from her uncle, who had been single. After receiving it, she made a shopping list. On it she wrote down all the ways she could use to spend the money. Every time I told her not to spend all of the money and to save some, she would always say impatiently , \\" I know, I know!\\" One day, when I was in June's home, she passed a piece of paper to me. \\"I thought over your suggestion for several nights.

What type of thing is the question \\"Who invented the game Scrabble ?\\" asking about?","completion":"The question \\"Who invented the game Scrabble?\\" is asking about the origin and creator of the popular word-based board game known as Scrabble. To provide a detailed and long answer to this question, we can discuss various aspects such as the history of Scrabble, the inventor's background, the game's original design, its evolution over time, and its impact on popular culture. Scrabble is a much-loved word game that requires players to form words using individual letter tiles placed on a game board resembling a crossword puzzle. The game's objective is to accumulate points based on the letter tiles' values and premium features on the board. It is an intellectually stimulating game that sharpens language and strategic thinking skills and is enjoyed by a wide range of age groups around the world. The invention of Scrabble dates back to 1938 when an American architect named Alfred Mosher Butts created the game as a blend of anagrams and crossword puzzles. Its initial name was \\"Criss-Crosswords,\\" and Alfred Butts handcrafted the original set by himself, paying particular attention to its overall design, ease of play, and educational value. An important facet of the game's creation was the determination of letter values, which he did by analyzing the frequency of letters in the English language, using resources such as newspapers and books. In 1948, a friend of Butts named James Brunot decided to manufacture the game, seeing its potential for success. Together, they modified and refined the design, including switching to smaller wooden tiles and renaming it \\"Scrabble,\\" which means 'to grope frantically.' The game initially struggled to gain popularity and went through a few disappointing years. The turning point for Scrabble came when the president of Macy's department store, Jack Straus, discovered the game while on vacation in 1952. He was surprised to learn that his store didn't sell Scrabble, and once he placed a large order for the game, it gained exposure and skyrocketed in popularity. By 1954, it was a must-have household item, and its sales soared to millions of units per year. Today, Scrabble is a globally recognized board game with local editions and adaptations available in several languages and countries. It continues to maintain an active community, with clubs, organizations, and competitive leagues fostering connections among players. The game has also made a successful transition into the digital space, given the rise of technology, with digital versions and online platforms maintaining its relevance to newer generations. In summary, the question \\"Who invented the game Scrabble?\\" is essentially asking about the person responsible for inventing the popular word game called Scrabble as well as its history and background. Alfred Mosher Butts, an American architect, initially developed it in 1938. The game endured its share of struggles before rising to fame and becoming a staple in homes around the world, enhancing the social, educational, and recreational experiences of countless players throughout the years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following passage \\"Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth.

Write an article based on this summary: A Londonderry musician has said that physical barriers in music venues are hindering performers with disabilities.","completion":"Title: Londonderry Musician Calls for Accessible Music Venues for Performers with Disabilities Introduction Music is a universal language that transcends all barriers and boundaries. However, for some musicians, especially those with disabilities, challenges can be daunting. A Londonderry musician recently spoke out against the physical barriers present in many music venues that hinder the performances of artists with disabilities. The Issue of Accessibility When discussing the accessibility of music venues, it is important to consider not only the audience but also the performing musicians. As a musician with a disability, the Londonderry artist has firsthand experience with these challenges and is now using their platform to raise awareness about the issue. Physical barriers can include inaccessible stages, lack of ramps, narrow doorways, and inadequate backstage facilities, which might seem insignificant to some but can be insurmountable hurdles for musicians with disabilities. These obstacles not only make it difficult for disabled musicians to perform but also exclude them from participating in the wider music community. The Impact on the Music Community The difficulties faced by disabled musicians are not just limited to stage accessibility. The lack of inclusivity can have a ripple effect on the industry as a whole, leading to a loss of unique talent and diversity in the music community. When musicians with disabilities cannot access venues or participate in events, their creative voices are silenced, and their contributions are missed. Greater Awareness and Changes Needed Increased awareness and dialogue around this issue are crucial for change. Venue owners and event organizers should acknowledge these challenges and work to develop solutions that make their spaces more accessible for all musicians. This can include investing in ramps, wider doorways, and adaptive backstage facilities, as well as partnering with disability advocacy groups to better understand the needs of disabled musicians. The Londonderry musician's experience highlights the need for more concerted efforts to make music venues disability-friendly. However, the responsibility should not fall solely on the institutions – other musicians and audiences can also play a role in fostering inclusive environments, by advocating for and supporting accessibility improvements. Conclusion Ultimately, the goal is to create a music community where everyone, regardless of their physical abilities, can perform and share their art. By addressing these accessibility issues and breaking down barriers for disabled musicians, the music industry can benefit from the wealth of talent, creativity, and perspective that lies within this often-overlooked group. It is time for the music community to not only listen to the tune of inclusivity but also to actively participate in orchestrating change. By doing so, we can ensure that all individuals have the opportunity to express themselves through the power of music – a language that should truly know no barriers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Objective: Where can I learn to play the flute Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Choices: [a]. Lookup online in your area dancers for it. [b]. Lookup online in your area tutors for it.","completion":"In the given context where the objective is to learn to play the flute, comparing the two choices based on naive physics reasoning, it can be concluded that choice [b] is more sound. Reasoning: Choice [a] suggests looking up \\"dancers\\" in your area. While dancers perform an art form that involves music, they typically don't have the expertise required to teach a musical instrument, especially not a specific one like the flute. The focus of their art lies in physical movement and expressing emotions through dance moves rather than mastering and teaching the technical aspects of playing an instrument. Choice [b] recommends searching for tutors in your area specializing in teaching flute. This is a more reasonable solution because tutors are trained and experienced in teaching the precise nuances of their respective fields. In this case, a flute tutor would typically have more in-depth knowledge of the instrument, its playing techniques, and methods to help students quickly grasp the art of playing the flute. In conclusion, to achieve the objective of learning to play the flute, choice [b] is more appropriate within the framework of naive physics reasoning. To further elaborate on where you can learn to play the flute, consider these additional options: 1. Music schools or conservatories: Enroll in a program or course that may offer flute lessons as part of a broader curriculum or as a specialized class. 2. Online tutorials or courses: Websites and platforms like YouTube, Udemy, Coursera, or Skillshare could offer videos and tutorials specifically tailored to learning how to play the flute. Online lessons provide the flexibility of learning at your own pace. 3. Workshops and masterclasses: Keep an eye out for workshops and masterclasses organized by professional flutists, orchestras, or music schools. These events can offer valuable learning experiences by having direct interactions with experts. 4. Join a community or ensemble: Look for local flute-focused communities, orchestras, or ensembles that offer mentorship and practice opportunities to improve your skills. Collaborating with others can enhance your learning experience and provide motivation.

Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The process you've mentioned describes the rock cycle, which is a natural process that occurs over geologic time. The increased demand for aluminum products would have no direct effect on the cooling of magma in this cycle. The production and consumption of aluminum primarily impact the processes of aluminum mining, refining, and recycling. These activities may have environmental consequences, but they do not influence the cooling of magma, which is a geologically-driven process related to the Earth's internal heat and plate tectonics. As a result, the proposed perturbation of more people buying aluminum products would have no effect on the cooling of magma as described in the second step of the rock cycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Joe Biden on Tuesday said he can't believe President Bush hasn't known for months about a recent intelligence estimate that downplays the nuclear threat from Iran. Other Democratic candidates also slammed Bush for continuing to ratchet up the rhetoric against Tehran. On Tuesday the president acknowledged he had given a speech warning that Iran's nuclear development risked \\"World War III\\" about two months after his intelligence chief told him a reassessment of Tehran's nuclear ambitions was under way. Bush told reporters during a White House news conference that he was not told the details of the new assessment until last week and he said the new report, which found that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons work in 2003, will not change U.S. policy toward Iran. \\"Are you telling me a president that's briefed every single morning, who's fixated on Iran, is not told back in August that the tentative conclusion of 16 intelligence agencies in the","completion":"United States is that there may not be an active nuclear weapons program in Iran?\\" Biden asked incredulously during a campaign event in Iowa. \\"I refuse to believe that. If that's true, he has the most incompetent staff in modern American history, and he's one of the most incompetent presidents to occupy the White House.\\" Other Democratic candidates, including Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama, joined Biden in criticizing the administration's handling of the intelligence report. They argued that the new findings highlight the need for diplomatic engagement, rather than military confrontation, with Iran. In response to the criticism, White House Press Secretary Dana Perino defended the president's position, stating that the intelligence report was still being finalized when Bush gave his speech about the potential threat posed by Iran. She emphasized that the president prioritizes national security and that the administration's focus has always been on preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Despite the reduced threat assessment, the U.S. and its allies will continue to monitor Iran's nuclear program closely and maintain pressure through sanctions and diplomacy, officials said. The new intelligence report has sparked debate over the effectiveness of U.S. policy on Iran, but it remains clear that the issue will remain a central topic for discussion among presidential candidates and policymakers alike."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Historical studies reveal that policing agents have undertaken a variety of cross-border police missions for many years (Deflem, 2002). For example, in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook cross-border surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals. A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by Prussian police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London. The interests of public police agencies in cross-border co-operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in Europe, which eventually led to the establishment of Interpol before the Second World War. There are also many interesting examples of cross-border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century (Nadelmann, 1993). It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception. It is also generally agreed that in the post–Cold War era this type of practice became more significant and frequent (Sheptycki, 2000).

Article: Some days, don't you think, \\"Wouldn't it be nice if the laundry would just do itself?\\" Self-cleaning clothes may sound crazy. But Australian researchers have found a way to make something like this possible! A team at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, found a way to put special nanostructures into clothing, which can then clean the clothes. When sunlight hits the nanostructures, they break down the dirt and stains that don't belong on your clothes. The nanostructures don't break down the actual clothing because cotton and the other clothing materials are too strong to be broken down. According to CNN, the researchers cover the clothing in a solution made of silver and copper nanostructures. All it takes is 40 minutes of sunlight and your clothes will look as good as new. So if you spill on yourself during lunch, you can step outside for a walk, and it will be clean by the time you go inside. It not only makes your life easier, but it can also be good for the environment. According to the US Department of Energy, the average load of laundry uses about 25 gallons (about 94 liters) of water. Water is a very important resource, so using less of it to wash clothes is better for the environment. But one of the scientists at RMIT University knows more needs to be done. \\"There's more work to do before we can start throwing out our washing machines,\\" said Dr Rajesh Ramanathan, \\"but this is a strong foundation .\\" So what's the next step?

Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20.

The lead up to the war began with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 which was met with immediate economic sanctions by the United Nations against Iraq. The coalition commenced hostilities in January 1991, resulting in a decisive victory for the U.S. led coalition forces, which drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait with minimal coalition deaths. Despite the low death toll, over 180,000 US veterans would later be classified as \\"permanently disabled\\" according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (see Gulf War Syndrome).

Land combat did not expand outside of the immediate Iraq/Kuwait/Saudi border region, although the coalition bombed cities and strategic targets across Iraq, and Iraq fired missiles on Israeli and Saudi cities.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question, \\"Many suffered from Gulf War Syndrome even though this tragedy was kept to a minimum?\\" is indeed located in the given text. The Persian Gulf War, a conflict between Iraq and a global, United States-led coalition of 34 nations, followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Responding to Iraq's aggression, the United Nations imposed economic sanctions. By January 1991, the coalition initiated hostilities leading to a decisive victory. They successfully expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait, marking a significant win. However, this victory came at a cost, even if initially it may have seemed minimal, given the relatively low death toll during the actual conflict. In the aftermath of the war, many veterans experienced significant health problems, now known as Gulf War Syndrome. Despite the conflict being geographically restrained to Iraq, Kuwait and the immediate Saudi Arabia border region, and despite the warfare resulting in minimal coalition deaths, the impact of the war extended far beyond the battlefield. Over 180,000 U.S. veterans were later classified as \\"permanently disabled\\" by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The term 'Gulf War Syndrome' is used to describe a wide range of illnesses and symptoms ranging from fatigue, muscle pain and cognitive problems, to loss of coordination, gastrointestinal and respiratory issues experienced by veterans of this war. Therefore, even though the tragedy of mass deaths was kept to a minimum during the Persian Gulf War, the hidden tragedy unfolded later with the emergence of the Gulf War Syndrome. The high incidence of this condition amongst veterans reveals a long-term, wide-scale health crisis, often debilitating for those affected. This recognises how the effects of warfare reach beyond immediate casualties, impacting the physical and psychological health of soldiers, even years after the fighting ends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Negative. To understand the reasoning behind this classification, let's analyze the sentence more deeply. The statement focuses on a director who is said to be resembling someone's crazy French grandfather. Here are some key points to consider in determining the sentiment: 1. The word \\"crazy\\" generally carries a negative connotation. It implies a lack of stability, rationality, or unpredictability, which are not desirable traits, especially for a director. 2. \\"Resemble\\" suggests that the director's qualities or behaviors are similar to those of the crazy French grandfather. This comparison to a potentially undesirable character paints a negative image of the director. 3. The sentence also seems to imply that the director is showing signs of change or deterioration over time, moving away from their previous state or position. This can be seen as a decline or unfavorable development in the way people perceive the director. Taking these points into consideration, it is clear that the sentiment of the sentence is negative. The comparison with an erratic figure and the implied decline in the director's reputation contribute to this sentiment. Thus, the correct answer is A).

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"To answer these questions, I will first define and explain each term and then compare whether they are asking the same thing or not. Question 1: What is anti Ackerman steering geometry? Step 1: Define Anti-Ackerman steering geometry Anti-Ackerman steering geometry is a variation of Ackerman steering geometry in which the outer wheel turns more sharply than the inner wheel during a turn. It is designed to provide different tire grip and steering responses depending on the vehicle's speed and other factors. Step 2: Explain the concept In traditional Ackerman steering geometry, the inner wheel turns more sharply than the outer wheel to maintain the proper turning radius for each tire. This helps to prevent tire scrubbing and uneven tire wear. However, in some high-performance vehicles and race cars, better handling and grip can be achieved with anti-Ackerman geometry, where the outer wheel turns more sharply than the inner wheel. This geometry can better optimize the tire contact patch and cornering capabilities at high speeds. Question 2: What is a steering ratio and how do you calculate it? Step 1: Define steering ratio Steering ratio is a measure of how much the steering wheel needs to be turned in order for the wheels of a car to turn a set amount. It is an indication of the responsiveness and sensitivity of a vehicle's steering system. Step 2: Explain how to calculate steering ratio The steering ratio is calculated by dividing the number of degrees the steering wheel must be turned by the number of degrees that the wheels turn as a result. For example, if turning the steering wheel 18 degrees causes the wheels to turn 1 degree, the steering ratio would be 18:1. Now, let's compare the two questions: Question 1 asks about a specific type of steering geometry (Anti-Ackerman) and its characteristics. Question 2 asks about steering ratio and how to calculate it. These two questions are related, as they both discuss aspects of a vehicle's steering system, but they are not asking the same thing. Anti-Ackerman steering geometry is a design concept, while steering ratio is a numerical measure of the responsiveness of a vehicle's steering."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is happening because the population is getting older, with lots of over-65 years old people, who are not working anymore. Also, there are more men than women in the age group of 25 to 40 years, which makes it difficult for families to have babies, making the population even older.

Make yourself look as large as you can. You can do this by opening your jacket if you're wearing one, or even raising up your arms. Imagine how you try to look like a big scary monster for playtime; that's what to do. 2. Make lots of noise. Shout, yell or make loud noises just like when you are playing with your toys in the other room. This can frighten the big Puma away. 3. Maintain eye contact. Just like when you play staring contest. 4. Always move slowly, never try to run or turn your back towards it. This could make the Puma want to chase you like in a game of tag, and Pumas are very, very good at tag. These steps can help anyone if they unexpectedly meet a Puma.

Q:American English is full of colorful expressions. One such expression is to touch all bases. There are four bases in baseball - first, second, third and home plate. When a baseball player hits the ball, he must run to each base - in order - and touch it with his foot. It is the only way to get a point. If the player hits the ball and fails to touch all the bases, the point will not be counted. The importance of touching all the bases was shown at the start of the 1974 baseball seasons. Hank Aaron was a player with the Atlanta Braves team. He was trying to find the record for hitting the most home runs . Aaron needed just one home run to be well matched with the record held by Babe Ruth, the greatest hitter in baseball history. Aaron got that home run the very first time he had a chance to hit the ball. That gave him 714 home runs - the same as Babe Ruth. After that day, baseball fans held their breath every time when it was Hank Aaron's turn to hit. When would he hit home run number 715? The wait was not long. In the second week of the season, Aaron again hit the ball over the wall. He had beaten Babe Ruth's record. But first, he had to run around the four bases. The other players on his team watched carefully to make sure he touched each one. So, to touch all bases means to do what is necessary to complete an activity. The expression is used to business and politics. No business deal or political events are really complete until you discuss all the problems involved. Or, as it is said, until you touch all bases. When was the importance of touching all the bases shown? A) At the start of the 1974 baseball seasons. B) At the end of the 1974 baseball seasons. C) Before the baseball rules made. D) In the second week of 1974. A:","completion":"The importance of touching all the bases was shown at the start of the 1974 baseball seasons.

For most people, it is a picture of a person wearing unusual clothes with a hat on his head, dancing to the music in a cool way. For example, a person who wears a large T-shirt dances on the street. Clearly, clothes those street dancers wear show their personalities and clothing styles. Now let us take a look at street dancers' clothing styles. Tops If you look into the clothing styles of street dancers, you will notice that there is a large difference between the tops that men and women wear. For men, they often wear a large T-shirt with probably a jacket at times. However, for women, they often wear tank tops (T) . Bottoms Today, the street dancers still prefer wearing large jeans and a lot of men also wear Capri pants . However, women start to wear mini skirts or shorts. Nowadays knee-high socks are also a popular new look for the women. Footwear For any street dancer, shoes are important. Any pair of shoes that produces the slightest sound can destroy the performance. So they need a pair of shoes that allows them to move freely. In fact, street dancers' clothing has to be something that allows for a lot of comfort and that shows personalities. The two points are important for any street dancer. Without those things, it is difficult for street dancers to perform well and show their personalities. What do you think about the clothing style of street dancers?

Answer a question about this article: In the Hesiodic Catalogue of Women, Graecus is presented as the son of Zeus and Pandora II, sister of Hellen the patriarch of Hellenes. Hellen was the son of Deucalion who ruled around Phthia in central Greece. The Parian Chronicle mentions that when Deucalion became king of Phthia, the previously called Graikoi were named Hellenes. Aristotle notes that the Hellenes were related with Grai/Greeks (Meteorologica I.xiv) a native name of a Dorian tribe in Epirus which was used by the Illyrians. He also claims that the great deluge must have occurred in the region around Dodona, where the Selloi dwelt. However, according to the Greek tradition it is more possible that the homeland of the Greeks was originally in central Greece. A modern theory derives the name Greek (Latin Graeci) from Graikos, \\"inhabitant of Graia/Graea,\\" a town on the coast of Boeotia. Greek colonists from Graia helped to found Cumae (900 BC) in Italy, where they were called Graeces. When the Romans encountered them they used this name for the colonists and then for all Greeks (Graeci.) The word γραῖα graia \\"old woman\\" comes from the PIE root *ǵerh2-/*ǵreh2-, \\"to grow old\\" via Proto-Greek *gera-/grau-iu; the same root later gave γέρας geras (/keras/), \\"gift of honour\\" in Mycenean Greek. The Germanic languages borrowed the word Greeks with an initial \\"k\\" sound which probably was their initial sound closest to the Latin \\"g\\" at the time (Goth. Kreks). The area out of ancient Attica including Boeotia was called Graïke and is connected with the older deluge of Ogyges, the mythological ruler of Boeotia. The region was originally occupied by the Minyans who were autochthonous or Proto-Greek speaking people. In ancient Greek the name Ogygios came to mean \\"from earliest days\\". Where do modern theorist believe the name of Greek originated from ?","completion":"Modern theorists believe the name \\"Greek\\" (Latin Graeci) originated from \\"Graikos,\\" which means \\"inhabitant of Graia/Graea\\" - a town on the coast of Boeotia.

An ideal gas would have a value of 1 for that ratio at all temperatures and pressures and the graph would simply be a horizontal line. As can be seen, deviations from an ideal gas occur. As the pressure begins to rise, the attractive forces cause the volume of the gas to be less than expected and the value of drops under 1. Continued pressure increase results in the volume of the particles to become significant and the value of rises to greater than 1. Notice, that the magnitude of the deviations from ideality is greatest for the gas at 200 K and least for the gas at 1000 K. Now, I have a new situation: Marcus is working with a sealed container of oxygen. He is trying see how temperature effects its deviations from ideality. He slowly increases the temperature of the oxygen and continues to measures its deviations. Answer this question please: Will increasing the pressure cause the expected volume be more or less?

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts. Which friend learned less about animals that survive in greater numbers? Hint: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.

The first time they won the title was during the 1993-1994 season, and the second championship came in the following 1994-1995 season. The Rockets made history with these back-to-back titles and solidified their position as one of the best teams in the league during that period. In the 1993-1994 NBA season, the Houston Rockets were led by their star player Hakeem Olajuwon, who played center. At the helm as head coach was Rudy Tomjanovich, who guided the Rockets to a regular-season record of 58 wins and 24 losses. They entered the playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference, where they faced challenging series against the Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns, and the Utah Jazz en route to the NBA Finals. In the NBA Finals, the Rockets found themselves matched up against the Eastern Conference champions, the New York Knicks, who were led by Patrick Ewing. The series was intense and competitive, extending to seven games. The Rockets emerged victorious, clinching their first NBA Championship with a 90-84 victory in Game 7 on June 22, 1994. Hakeem Olajuwon was named the Finals MVP for his outstanding performance throughout the series. The Rockets' second title victory during the 1994-1995 NBA season came in an even more dramatic fashion. They finished the regular season with a 47-35 record, earning them the sixth seed in the Western Conference playoffs. Despite facing an uphill battle during the playoffs, the Rockets played with determination and resilience, defeating higher-seeded teams such as the Utah Jazz, Phoenix Suns, and the San Antonio Spurs to reach the NBA Finals. Strong performances from Hakeem Olajuwon and the arrival of Clyde Drexler, an NBA All-Star acquired in a mid-season trade, were crucial for the Rockets' playoff success. In the 1995 NBA Finals, the Houston Rockets faced off against the Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic, who were led by young superstar Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway. The Rockets showcased their championship pedigree, dominating the Magic to secure a 4-0 series sweep. Hakeem Olajuwon once again shined in the Finals, receiving the Finals MVP award for the second consecutive year. The victory on June 14, 1995, marked the Rockets' second NBA Championship title and solidified their place in NBA history as back-to-back champions during the 1990s."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"After numerous lifetimes of spiritual striving, they have reached the end of the cycle of rebirth, no longer reincarnating as human, animal, ghost, or other being.\\" a good answer to the question \\"A person can awaken from the \\"sleep of ignorance\\" by acknowledging the true nature of what?\\"","completion":"The given statement, \\"After numerous lifetimes of spiritual striving, they have reached the end of the cycle of rebirth, no longer reincarnating as human, animal, ghost, or other being,\\" does not directly answer the question \\"A person can awaken from the 'sleep of ignorance' by acknowledging the true nature of what?\\" The statement refers to the concept of the end of the cycle of rebirth, or the attainment of spiritual enlightenment, which is a result rather than the process itself. To answer the question, it is important to focus on the means by which a person can awaken from the \\"sleep of ignorance\\" and gain a deeper understanding of the nature of reality. Answer: A person can awaken from the \\"sleep of ignorance\\" by acknowledging the true nature of reality, the interconnectedness of all things, and the impermanent, insubstantial, and interdependent nature of existence. This awareness is achieved through a combination of self-reflection, meditation, and ethical conduct. In Buddhist philosophy, this process of awakening involves the cultivation of wisdom, or \\"prajna,\\" which enables one to see the true nature of reality and overcome the cycle of rebirth and suffering, known as \\"samsara.\\" To cultivate wisdom and awaken from the sleep of ignorance, a person must first develop samadhi, or mental concentration. This involves learning to quiet the mind through mindful, purposeful meditation and developing awareness of one's thoughts, emotions, and actions. Samadhi helps to cultivate mental clarity and focus, which allows one to penetrate the deeper truths of existence. The practice of ethical conduct, or \\"sila,\\" also plays a crucial role in the process of awakening. By acting in ways that promote harmony, compassion, and selflessness, a person can begin to purify negative mental states and cultivate positive qualities, such as generosity and patience. Ethical conduct helps to create the conditions necessary for the development of wisdom and the dismantling of attachment, aversion, and ignorance. Through the cultivation of samadhi and sila, a person can begin to develop insight and direct understanding of the true nature of reality, or \\"vipassana.\\" This process involves recognizing the impermanent nature of all phenomena, the inherent suffering and dissatisfaction present in the cycle of birth and death, and the lack of a permanent, independent self. By cultivating this understanding, a person can gradually overcome ignorance and attachment, develop true compassion for all beings, and ultimately attain enlightenment, freeing themselves from the cycle of rebirth and suffering. So, a more appropriate answer to the question \\"A person can awaken from the 'sleep of ignorance' by acknowledging the true nature of what?\\" would be: A person can awaken from the sleep of ignorance by acknowledging the true nature of reality, impermanence, interconnectedness, and the illusion of a separate self through the cultivation of samadhi, sila, and prajna, which lead to spiritual enlightenment and release from the cycle of rebirth and suffering."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thomas Jacob \\"Tommy\\" Hilfiger (born March 24, 1951) is an American fashion designer best known for founding the lifestyle brand Tommy Hilfiger Corporation in 1985. After starting his career by co-founding a chain of record stores in upstate New York in the 1970s, he began designing preppy sportswear for his own eponymous menswear line in the 1980s. The company later expanded into women's clothing and various luxury items such as perfumes, and went public in 1992. In 1997, Hilfiger published his first book, titled All American: A Style Book, and he has written several since, including Tommy Hilfiger through Assouline in 2010. After Tommy Hillfiger went through several iterations, in 1984 Hilfiger's first wife Susie Cirona became pregnant with their first child. Searching for more stability, Hilfiger was relieved to be offered a design position with Calvin Klein. However, after he accepted the Calvin Klein position but before he had begun working, he was approached by businessman Mohan Murjani, to pursue his goal of designing and heading a men's sportswear line. Murjani backed the necessary investment for Hilfiger to establish his own brand. Later Hilfiger oversaw the design of the Coca-Cola clothing line for Murjani. \\"[Waiting to form my own eponymous line] came from a desire to create something that wasn't out there already. I was really in tune with the market--I knew what existed, and I wanted this to be different. Maybe it's the small-town boy in me, but I've always loved the prep school look, traditional Ivy League, and the clothes that sailors and jocks wear. I wanted to take these familiar old things and give them a more laid-back attitude, to make them modern and cool....[with Tommy Hilfiger Corporation in 1985], finally, I felt like I was doing work that felt natural, that felt good. The brand we were building felt so honest, so true to who I am, that it didn't feel like a struggle at all.\\" In 1985, he founded the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation with support from The Murjani Group. The new clothing line made its debut with a high-profile marketing campaign, for example setting up a large billboard in Times Square designed by George Lois. Hilfiger left Murjani International in 1989, with Silas Chou instead providing financial backing to the Hilfiger brand, and former executives of Ralph Lauren brought on board as executives of the newly formed company Tommy Hilfiger, Inc. The Tommy Hilfiger Corporation went public in 1992, introducing Hilfiger's signature menswear collection. Hilfiger was named Menswear Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 1995. After licensing Pepe Jeans USA in 1995, in 1996, Tommy Hilfiger Inc. began distributing women's clothing. By the end of the next year Hilfiger had opened his first store in Beverly Hills, which was followed by a store in London in 1998. Hilfiger was serving as the company's co-chairman by 1997, and that year he published his first book, titled All American: A Style Book.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Hudson River is a 315-mile (507 km) river that flows from north to south, primarily through the eastern regions of New York in the United States. The river originates in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York, near the hamlet of Lake Tear of the Clouds. As it flows southward, the Hudson River runs along or clearly separates the border established between New York and New Jersey, particularly in its lower section. The Hudson River flows through several iconic and historically significant locations such as the Hudson Valley, which has played an essential role in the early history and settlement of the United States. This area is also known for its lush landscapes, wineries, and agricultural diversity. It passes by notable landmarks and cities such as Albany, the capital of New York State, and West Point, home to the United States Military Academy. As it proceeds south, the river makes its way through the Hudson Highlands, which is characterized by a series of highlands, steep cliffs, and rugged landscapes. The river then continues south, reaching the Tappan Zee, a widened and tidal section of the river in the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow and Tarrytown. The Hudson River's lower section flows through the New York metropolitan area where it passes Yonkers, the Bronx, and Manhattan Island. As it reaches further south, the river flows between the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx on the New York side and the New Jersey Palisades on the New Jersey side. Finally, the river culminates at the southernmost tip of Manhattan, at Battery Park, before emptying into Upper New York Bay. This portion of the river holds the iconic Statue of Liberty and provides access to the historic Ellis Island. As it enters Upper New York Bay, the Hudson River converges with the East River and meets the New York Harbor, forming a crucial estuary that merges with the Atlantic Ocean. This extensive waterway has been essential to the continued success and development of the New York City region and the overall eastern seaboard of the United States. In summary, the Hudson River is a significant and iconic river that flows from the Adirondack Mountains in Upstate New York to the Upper New York Bay, passing through important landmarks and cities along its course and playing a crucial role in the history and development of the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is appropriate for referring to a person, thus meeting the linguistic criteria for a grammatical subject. 2. Auxiliary verb: The auxiliary verb \\"might\\" is used here to express possibility, indicating that there's a chance that the subject could potentially engage in the action described. \\"Might\\" is a modal auxiliary verb and is used correctly in this context. 3. Main verb: The main verb of the sentence is \\"eat,\\" indicating the action that the subject may perform. Since \\"eat\\" refers to the action of consuming food, it is appropriately used in the context of discussing \\"deep fried muffins\\" as the potential object being consumed.

Adjective + direct object: The direct object in this sentence is \\"deep fried muffins,\\" which describes what the subject might eat.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Company X stopped taking on more debt, and decided to file for bankruptcy, while company Y, kept benefiting from the tax benefits of debt, having a lower debt level. But I can use this background: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2] An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing. What is an answer for this question: Which company had fewer costs than benefits related to debt, company X or company Y? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Company Y had fewer costs than benefits related to debt. This is because Company Y continued to benefit from the tax benefits of debt while maintaining a lower debt level, which suggests that they have effectively managed to balance the benefits and costs associated with debt. On the other hand, Company X stopped taking on more debt and filed for bankruptcy, indicating that their debt costs might have outweighed the benefits, leading to financial distress and eventually bankruptcy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact 2: Weather changes rapidly in all seasons. Given the two facts above, earth's tilt on it's rotating axis causes rapid what? Answer:","completion":"Given the two facts, Earth's tilt on its rotating axis actually causes rapid changes in weather conditions. However, it's important to note that the tilt does not lead to immediate changes, but rather gradual transitions between the seasons. The tilt of Earth's axis (towards or away from the Sun) results in variations in the intensity and duration of sunlight received by various parts of the Earth at different times of the year, leading to the changing seasons. These seasonal changes, in turn, influence weather patterns, creating the potential for rapid weather changes within these broader, season-long trends. For example, the transition period between seasons can often bring bouts of unstable or rapidly changing weather. Nevertheless, many other factors also contribute to the dynamic nature of Earth's weather, such as atmospheric pressure differences, humidity, and geographical location."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I don’t know how this rates as “shocking”, I guess it might depend on the culture in which you live, but, it is at the least “repulsive” or disgusting. There was a huge corporation in which I had a contract with. I was called in, to help them uncover what they considered “a very serious series of incidents”. Their own “in house” attempts were fruitless. It turned out, they had an over-sized engineering department, and that it had been announced that this would be scaled back due to completion of contracts. Someone though, within the engineering department, was sabotaging the continued work, slowing the completion. I was to go undercover, posing as a visiting engineer from a distant plant, and find out who the perpetrator/s were, as they wished to file legal action. So, this is at the corporate headquarters, in the late 1980’s. These people were making 6 figure incomes easily. That being said, you kind of expect a bit more of a dignified behavior here than you would with a construction laborer or dishwasher. I completed my job in four days, giving them the evidence and name of the lone individual respsonsible for the sabotage. What exactly was he doing? He carried rubber gloves in his back pocket, and he would periodically use the restroom, and remove his feces from the toilet and smear it all over the walls, covering as much surface as he could. He would also visit restrooms in different departments and do the same. This would cause the unionized individuals, who only had that restroom to use in their area, to walk off their work stations. Seriously, a butt-hurt guy fearing a layoff, so he decided to smear his shit all over the place before it even happened. He readily confessed when confronted by HR, further destroying his work record/career. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: If you want to earn a girl's trust back, the very first thing you should do is to apologize sincerely about lying and hurting her. Whether you cheated on her, lied about spending a weekend with your friends in Vegas instead of at your grandmother's, or lied about a significant personal detail, it's inevitable that she's feeling hurt, confused, and like she doesn't know you anymore. Let her know that you understand how difficult you have made things for her, and that you deeply regret what you've done. Take FULL responsibility, show her you know you were wrong. She's not going to go for a half-hearted apology. It needs to be sincere and real. Don't just say \\"I'm sorry\\" because you think it's the right thing to do -- say it because you mean it. If you're not sincere, she'll be able to tell. When you tell her you're sorry, look into her eyes, speak slowly, and face your body toward her so she knows she has all of your attention. You don't have to say that you're sorry a hundred times -- it's about quality, not quantity. Let her know that you understand all of the pain and suffering that you've caused her. If she doesn't think you understand her pain, she won't want to listen to you. Though you shouldn't make this all about you, let her know that you're feeling real pain because of your mistake. You don't have to go in too much graphic detail if you think it'll only hurt her more, but you should be honest about why you told the lie. Maybe you wanted to protect her, maybe you knew that the truth would hurt her, or maybe you were even embarrassed about the truth and wanted to cover it up. Whatever your reason, let her know why you did it -- this will show that you're already maturing and trying to reflect, and that you're not just going to move on without gaining some perspective. Being honest about why you lied will make her feel like you're more likely to be honest in the future. Letting her know your motives will help her understand your perspective. Know when it's better not to be honest. If you just wanted to get with another girl because you were feeling bored or restless, then it's better to keep that to yourself. First, you have to make sure that it really won't happen again. If you doubt yourself or your future self and think you may make the same mistake, then spare the girl and work on fixing yourself before you get entangled with anyone else. If you don't think that you should be trusted, then why should anyone else disagree? Once you're certain that it won't happen again, then you should promise her that you're determined not to repeat your mistakes. Be sincere when you tell her this. Don't make an empty promise. Let her know that you understand that actions speak louder than words, but make it clear that from now on, your actions will match your promises. Tell her that you're going to work on becoming a better, more complete person who wouldn't lie to her. Be open about the fact that you know that this is a process and that you won't change overnight, but let her know that you're willing to try to change for her. If you have a concrete plan for how you'll change, whether it's by keeping a journal, going to therapy, or just trying to be a more honest, more reflective person, then let her know what you'll do so you'll sound more sincere. Again, make it clear that you know this won't happen overnight, but that you want to put in the work because earning her trust back is the most important thing to you. Summary:","completion":"If you want to earn a girl's trust back after lying and hurting her, you should say sorry from your heart and mean it. Let her know you understand how much pain you caused her and share the reason why you lied. Promise her you won't do it again and that you'll work on becoming a better person. Make sure you have a plan to change and show her you really care about earning her trust back. But remember, it takes time to make things better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The information gathered will help researchers understand the geological and orbital history of Rhea, as well as provide insights into the formation of Saturn's other moons. As the Cassini spacecraft approached Rhea's surface, it captured breathtaking images of the icy moon, unveiling the deep scars of countless impacts on its imperfect surface. Scientists eagerly analyzed the images and data collected, uncovering valuable information about the moon's composition and structure. After its successful mission to study Rhea, the Cassini spacecraft continued its journey through the Saturnian system, gathering vital information about other moons and the ringed planet itself. By transmitting this data back to Earth, Cassini allowed scientists to unlock secrets of the solar system and further expand human knowledge of the universe. The story of Cassini's journey around Saturn comes to a poignant end on September 15, 2017. After nearly two decades of exploration and groundbreaking discoveries, the spacecraft plummeted into Saturn's atmosphere, burning up like a shooting star in its final moments. This dramatic conclusion was part of the Cassini mission's planned 'Grand Finale,' ensuring that the spacecraft would not cause any potential contamination to Saturn's moons, which may harbor conditions suitable for life. And so, the story ends with the lasting legacy of the Cassini spacecraft, its findings, and the impact it has had on our understanding of Saturn and its moons."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Everyone needs friends.

But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake. and the situation: Two sister villages, both situated near volcanoes, experience daily earthquakes. Green village started recording an increased size and number of earthquakes one day. Blue village didn't experience a change in the number of earthquakes. Answer the following question: Which village had less magma pushing upward into the magma chamber near them? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background and situation, Blue village had less magma pushing upward into the magma chamber near them. As mentioned, an increase in the size and number of earthquakes near a volcano is often a result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion puts pressure on the surrounding rock and causes it to crack and move, resulting in an increase in the frequency and intensity of earthquakes. In the scenario provided, Green village experienced an increased size and number of earthquakes one day, likely indicating that there is more magma pushing upward into the magma chamber near them. On the other hand, Blue village did not experience any change in the number or size of earthquakes, which suggests that there is less magma pushing into the magma chamber near Blue village. Therefore, Blue village can be considered to have less magma pushing upward into the nearby magma chamber as compared to Green village.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound has led them to be cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal. Their style drew from a wide variety of influences, including blues, psychedelia, and folk music. Context: In November 1978, the group recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The resulting album, In Through the Out Door, featured sonic experimentation that again drew mixed reactions from critics. Nevertheless, the album reached number one in the UK and the US in just its second week of release. With this album's release, Led Zeppelin's entire catalogue returned to the Billboard Top 200 in the weeks of 27 October and 3 November 1979. In August 1979, after two warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing to a crowd of approximately 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert came to an abrupt halt in the middle of the third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten. A North American tour, the band's first since 1977, was scheduled to commence on 17 October 1980. On 24 September, Bonham was picked up by Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (from 16 to 24 US fl oz (470 to 710 ml)), with a ham roll. After taking a bite of the ham roll he said to his assistant, \\"breakfast\\". He continued to drink heavily after arriving at the studio. The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page's house--the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor. After midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45 pm the next day, Benji LeFevre (Led Zeppelin's new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead. The cause of death was asphyxiation from vomit; the finding was accidental death. An autopsy found no other recreational drugs in Bonham's body. Although he had recently begun to take Motival (a cocktail of the antipsychotic fluphenazine and the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline) to combat his anxiety, it is unclear if these substances interacted with the alcohol in his system. Bonham's remains were cremated and his ashes interred on 12 October 1980, at Rushock parish church, Worcestershire. The planned North American tour was cancelled, and despite rumours that Cozy Powell, Carmine Appice, Barriemore Barlow, Simon Kirke, or Bev Bevan would join the group as his replacement, the remaining members decided to disband. A 4 December 1980 press statement stated that, \\"We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend, and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were.\\" The statement was signed simply \\"Led Zeppelin\\". Question: It says no other, what was the initial drug? Answer:","completion":"The initial drug mentioned is Motival, which is a combination of fluphenazine and nortriptyline. It was taken by John Bonham to help with his anxiety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. If nitrogen oxides harms the respiratory and circulatory systems, then harm to the respiratory and circulatory systems can come from? Answer choices: - Greenhouse gases - hydrocarbons - Sulfur dioxide - nitrogen oxides - burning coal - fossil fuels - emissions - Greenhouse gasses The answer to this question is:","completion":"Harm to the respiratory and circulatory systems can come from multiple sources, including: 1. Nitrogen oxides: As mentioned, these gases can cause significant harm to the respiratory and circulatory systems. Nitrogen oxides are formed during high-temperature combustion processes, such as those in vehicles and industrial plants. They can cause inflammation and irritation in the lungs, worsening asthma and other respiratory conditions. 2. Sulfur dioxide: This gas is primarily produced by burning fossil fuels that contain sulfur, such as coal and oil. Sulfur dioxide can irritate the respiratory system and worsen existing respiratory diseases, such as asthma and bronchitis. 3. Greenhouse gases: Some greenhouse gases, most notably ozone, can also harm the respiratory and circulatory systems indirectly. Ground-level ozone is formed when pollutants in the air, like nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), react in the presence of sunlight. Breathing in ozone can cause chest pain, coughing, and shortness of breath. 4. Hydrocarbons: Some hydrocarbons, especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs), can negatively affect human health. They may cause irritation to the eyes and respiratory system and can exacerbate respiratory conditions like asthma. Additionally, some hydrocarbons are known carcinogens. 5. Burning coal: Coal combustion releases various harmful pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, which can all contribute to respiratory and circulatory system issues. 6. Fossil fuels: Burning fossil fuels may emit harmful pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and VOCs, that can cause harm to the respiratory and circulatory systems. 7. Emissions: Some emissions, such as vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions, can contain pollutants like nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. These pollutants can damage the respiratory and circulatory systems by exacerbating respiratory diseases and increasing the risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events. In conclusion, harm to the respiratory and circulatory systems can come from nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, greenhouse gases, hydrocarbons, burning coal, fossil fuels, and emissions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following title sequence moves through space and eventually reveals the planet Krypton, the home world of a highly-evolved race resembling humans and bearing a unique molecular density and structure, a result of the planet's gravitational strength and the radiation of its adjacent red sun. The planet is ruled by a Council of Elders, each representing a particular \\"clan\\" and bearing a crest of that particular House. The planet's greatest scientist, Jor, bears an S-shaped crest, the House of El. Jor-El is supervising the trial of three criminals caught attempting to overthrow the planet's government - General Zod, the planet's former defense chief; his henchman Non, a hulking killer unable to speak; and Ursa, a woman determined to exterminate men other than the man she loves, Zod. As the elders render a guilty verdict, Zod notes that the verdict must be unanimous, so Jor-El ultimately holds the key to their fate. Despite his disillusionment with the Council of Elders, Jor-El renders a conviction. The vast dome of the planet's capital city opens to the night, and a small extra-dimensional prison - the Phantom Zone - tumbles out of the sky and pulls the three criminals out of the trial room and into an eternity in dimensional limbo through space. While a frightened Ursa begs for forgiveness, Zod defiantly swears that he will have his vengeance on the House of El, even if it takes him a thousand years.However, Jor-El's more pressing concern lies in the orbital shift of Krypton; this shift is putting the planet into the fatal gravitational pull of its central star, a fact blithely ignored by the Council Of Elders.

Information: - Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called \\"sketches\\", commonly between one and ten minutes long. Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy. - Lorne Michaels (born Lorne Lipowitz; November 17, 1944) is a Canadian-American television producer, writer, comedian, and actor, best known for creating and producing \\"Saturday Night Live\\", and producing the \\"Late Night\\" series (since 1993), and \\"The Tonight Show\\" (since 2014). - A variety show, also known as variety arts or variety entertainment, is entertainment made up of a variety of acts (hence the name), especially musical performances and sketch comedy, and is normally introduced by a compère (master of ceremonies) or host. Other types of acts include magic, animal and circus acts, acrobatics, juggling, and ventriloquism. The variety format made its way from Victorian era stage to radio to television. Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from its early days (late 1940s) into the 1980s. - A humor magazine is a magazine specifically designed to deliver humorous content to its readership. These publications often offer satire and parody, but some also put an emphasis on cartoons, caricature, absurdity, one-liners, witty aphorisms, surrealism, neuroticism, gelotology, emotion-regulating humor, and/or humorous essays. Humor magazines first became popular in the early 19th century with specimens like \\"Le Charivari\\" (18321937) in France, \\"Punch\\" (18412002) in the United Kingdom and \\"Vanity Fair\\" (18591863) in the United States. - The New Yorker is an American magazine of reportage, commentary, criticism, essays, fiction, satire, cartoons, and poetry.

K. Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series. First mentioned in \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\\" the Ministry makes its first proper appearance in \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\". Throughout the books, it is generally depicted as either corrupt, incompetent, or both, with its high officials blind to actual events and dangers. It reaches a nadir of corruption before being effectively taken over by Lord Voldemort. At the end of the final book, following Voldemort's death, Kingsley Shacklebolt takes over the ministry, changing it for the better. By the time of \\"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\\", Hermione Granger is the Minister for Magic. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, shortened Hogwarts, is a fictional British school of magic for students aged eleven to eighteen, and is the primary setting for the first six books in J.K.

On a television program, for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in dramas than in comedies, especially in soap operas. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format. Webcomics are more likely to use story arcs than newspaper comics, as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on. Although story arcs have existed for decades, the term \\"story arc\\" was coined in 1988 in relation to the television series \\"Wiseguy\\", and was quickly adapted for other uses. - The Yale Record is the campus humor magazine of Yale University.

Shows broadcast live include newscasts, morning shows, awards shows, sports programs, and, occasionally, episodes of television series.

Because of the prohibitive cost, adoption was slow, and some television show remained live until the 1970s, such as soap operas. To prevent unforeseen issues, live television programs may be delayed, which allows censors to edit the program. Some programs may be broadcast live in certain time zones and delayed in others. - A cold open (also called a teaser) in a television program or movie is the technique of jumping directly into a story at the beginning or opening of the show before the title sequence or opening credits are shown.

A cold open may summarize events in previous episodes or storylines that will be revisited during the current episode. - Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J. K.

This was the only western made by Mankiewicz, director of such notable films as \\"All About Eve\\", \\"Guys and Dolls\\" and \\"Cleopatra\\". It was written by David Newman and Robert Benton, their first script after \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\". Can we infer the following? There Was a Crooked Man is a 1970 western film","completion":"Yes, we can certainly infer that \\"There Was a Crooked Man\\" is a 1970 western film. The information provided states that the movie was released in 1970 and included prominent elements and themes associated with the Western genre, distinguishing it as such. The Western cinematic style is unique, characterized by a rustic setting, primarily in the American West during the late eighteenth to late nineteenth century. The genre carries specific aesthetic and moral standards, traditionally stressing the ethical clear-cut between good and evil. It starred well-known actors of the time, Kirk Douglas and Henry Fonda. Kirk Douglas was a prevalent figure in the 'Golden Age of Hollywood', with his numerous appearances in the film noirs, dramas, and westerns cementing his position as an eminent American film star. Henry Fonda, another significant figure, exhibited a versatile acting range, demonstrated in his varied roles in genres such as drama, western, war films, and crime. Moreover, the film was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, a celebrated director known for his works in \\"All About Eve,\\" an insightful drama that won him an Academy Award, the musical \\"Guys and Dolls,\\" and the historical epic \\"Cleopatra\\". Despite Mankiewicz's reputation and broad repertoire, \\"There Was a Crooked Man\\" was his only Western film, making it a unique entry in his distinguished career. The screenplay was penned by David Newman and Robert Benton, marking their first script after \\"Bonnie and Clyde,\\" a critical and commercial success that refashioned the crime genre and cemented their place in the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking. Their involvement likely added another layer of depth to the film. To recap, we can infer that \\"There Was a Crooked Man\\" is a 1970 western film. The year of release, the involvement of esteemed personnel such as Kirk Douglas, Henry Fonda, Joseph Mankiewicz, David Newman, and Robert Benton, and the genre elements mentioned allow us to categorize the film as a Western released in 1970. Hopefully, this gives you a detailed perspective on the film's categorization."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible answers: embarrassed as a result, planning the office meetings, trying to get back together Answer:","completion":"To determine how Jordan would feel afterwards, we should consider each of the possible answers step-by-step: 1. Analyzing the situation Breaking up can be uncomfortable and seeing each other afterward might evoke various emotions. Therefore, it's essential to assess the circumstances and reasons behind their meetings. 2. Examining the first possibility: embarrassed as a result If Jordan is seeing Bailey three times a week without a valid reason, it could lead to embarrassment, as it might indicate an inability to move on from the relationship. 3. Examining the second possibility: planning the office meetings If Jordan and Bailey work together, the reason for seeing each other three times a week might be due to planning office meetings. In this case, Jordan's feelings might be more neutral or focused on their professional relationship. 4. Examining the third possibility: trying to get back together If Jordan is intentionally seeking out Bailey three times a week in an attempt to get back together, it would suggest that Jordan is feeling regret or longing for the relationship to resume. 5. Weighing the possibilities - If Jordan's meetings with Bailey are mainly for work purposes, embarrassment or longing for the relationship might not be the primary emotions. - However, if there is no work-related reason or if Jordan is actively trying to get back together, then it would be more likely that Jordan feels embarrassed or longing for the relationship. Given the context provided, it is not possible to definitively determine how Jordan feels after meeting with Bailey because the reason for their meetings is not clear.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

Quintanilla played bass guitar for the group, while Martínez, husband of international artist Alicia Villarreal, played keyboards. Both co-wrote songs for the Kumbia Kings.

Gone are original members Frankie J and DJ Kane, both of whom have gone on to significant success as solo artists, as well as the group K1 (Kingz One), a collaboration of founding members of Kumbia Kings who have defected from the group for reason of \\"internal dissension\\". Quintanilla, Irvin \\"Pee Wee\\" Salinas, as well as Selena's widower Chris Pérez, also decided to leave the group due to that same \\"internal dissension\\". Martínez kept Los Kumbia Kings but changed the name to Los Super Reyes for legal issues.

The latter proposes a risky operation to rescue Julius Limbani (Winston Ntshona), the imprisoned leader of a Southern African nation who is due to be executed by General Ndofa, the man who deposed him. Limbani is currently being held in a remote prison in Zembala, guarded by a unit of Ndofa's personal troops known as the \\"Simbas\\".

Surprisingly, his innovative playing initially received greater attention and appreciation among European critics than those in the country of his birth. The British music trade magazine \\"Melody Maker\\" published a number of reviews of his recordings and assessments of his cornet playing. In the April 1927 issue, bandleader Fred Elizalde stated: \\"Bix Bidlebeck (sic) is considered by Red Nichols himself and every other trumpet player in the States, for that matter, as the greatest trumpet player of all time\\". The magazine's editor, Edgar Jackson, was equally fulsome in his praise: \\"Bix has a heart as big as your head, which shines through his playing with the warmth of the sun's rays\\" (September 1927 issue); \\"The next sixteen bars are a trumpet solo by Bix, and if this doesn't get you right in the heart, you'd better see a vet….\\" In Blackboard Jungle, a 1955 film starring Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier, Beiderbecke's music is briefly featured, but as a symbol of cultural conservatism in a nation on the cusp of the rock and roll revolution. Brendan Wolfe, the author of Finding Bix, spoke of Beiderbecke's lasting influence on Davenport, Iowa: \\"His name and face are still a huge part of the city's identity. There's an annual Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival, and a Bix 7 road race with tens of thousands of runners, Bix T-shirts, bumper stickers, bobble-head dolls, the whole works.\\" In 1971, on the 40th anniversary of Beiderbecke's death, the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival was founded in Davenport, Iowa, to honor the musician.

Answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who left the atelier after a week? Answer the above question based on the context below: Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that \\"I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy\\" and complaining of \\"the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth\\" which he considered \\"such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it\\". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student. Etty was disqualified from the competition, but the high quality of his... Answer:","completion":"Etty"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: 11:14 Movie plot: The film involves a series of interconnected events that converge around two car-related accidents at 11:14 p.m. The connections between the events are not apparent at first, but are gradually revealed by a series of progressively receding flashbacks: Part 1[edit] 11:13 - 11:33 Jack (Henry Thomas), who has been drinking, is seen driving along a road at night talking on his cell phone. The clock on the dashboard reads 11:14 p.m. Suddenly, as he drives under an overpass, something smashes across the windshield, causing him to skid off the road. He stops by a deer crossing sign and gets out to inspect the damage, and finds a human body with a badly mutilated face lying close to his car. When he sees another car approaching, he panics and drags the body out of sight. The car pulls up next to him, and the driver, Norma (Barbara Hershey), assumes that he hit a deer. She offers to call the police over Jack's protests, insisting that it is no trouble because she has a new cell phone that she \\"never uses\\" and because she is friends with the Chief of Police. Norma offers Jack a ride to her house to wait for the police, but he declines. When she drives off, Jack decides to hide the body in the trunk of his car. He gets back into the car to pull away, but a police officer pulls up behind him. Officer Hannagan (Clark Gregg) speaks with Jack and, noting his odd behavior, asks him if he would submit to a breathalyzer test. Jack requests a sobriety test instead, which Hannagan administers, getting him to recite the alphabet in reverse from Z to A. When the officer checks with dispatch, he finds that Jack's license has been revoked for driving under the influence. Hannagan tells Jack that he is under arrest and that his car will be impounded. When he finds the body in the trunk, Hannagan handcuffs Jack with a cable tie and tells the two people already in the back of the cruiser, Duffy (Shawn Hatosy) and Buzzy (Hilary Swank), to move over so that Jack will fit.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: A political decoy is a person employed to impersonate a politician, to draw attention away from the real person or to take risks on that person's behalf. This can also apply to military figures, or civilians impersonated for political or espionage purposes. Hypothesis: A political decoy is an actor that pretends to be another in order to be a distraction.","completion":"The hypothesis states that a political decoy is an actor that pretends to be another in order to be a distraction. Based on the given paragraph, this hypothesis appears to be true. The paragraph describes a political decoy as a person employed to impersonate a politician, which suggests that the decoy takes on the role of another individual, much like an actor does. The primary purpose of this impersonation is to draw attention away from the real person, indicating that the decoy serves as a distraction for the public, the media, or even potential adversaries. Furthermore, the decoy may also be employed to take risks on behalf of the politician, providing an additional layer of protection and security for the individual being impersonated. The concept of political decoys can be extended to include military figures and civilians who are impersonated for political or espionage purposes. This extension still aligns with the idea of an actor pretending to be someone else in order to create a distraction. In these cases, the decoy may be used not only to draw attention away from the real individual but also to deceive opponents, gather intelligence, or facilitate covert operations. In summary, the hypothesis that a political decoy is an actor that pretends to be another in order to be a distraction is supported by the information provided in the paragraph. The utilization of decoys represents a strategic approach to protecting high-profile individuals such as politicians and military figures while also enabling a variety of tactical maneuvers for intelligence gathering and espionage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, Lin Zexu, to curb smuggling. This resulted in the First Opium War (1839–42). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Nanking and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations. The Jardines and Apcar and Company dominated the trade, although P&O also tried to take a share. A Second Opium War fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the Treaty of Tientsin, which legalised the importation of opium. Legalisation stimulated domestic Chinese opium production and increased the importation of opium from Turkey and Persia. This increased competition for the Chinese market led to India reducing its opium output and diversifying its exports.

In the 1990s, he was also a member of the short-lived supergroup the Best. Walsh has also experienced success both as a solo artist and prolific session musician, being featured on a wide array of other artists' recordings. Walsh is active in charity work and has performed in a number of concerts to raise money for charitable causes. He has also been a personal contributor to a number of charity causes including halfway houses for displaced adult women in Wichita, Kansas. Walsh funded the first talent-based scholarship at Kent State University in 2008. Walsh's love of Santa Cruz Island grew into a lifelong commitment to conserve the environment there, and he has been active in preserving the island's parks. He is President of the Santa Cruz Island Foundation, and has served on the Foundation's board since the 1980s. Walsh had often joked about running for office, announcing a mock presidential campaign in 1980 and a vice presidential campaign in 1992.

Question: The pawn was hand carved, it was a fine what? Options: - scheme - elephant - chess game - north carolina - chess set Explain why a human would choose \\"chess set\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"chess set\\" to answer the question because the context provided in the question refers to a pawn, which is a piece in the game of chess. Hand-carved suggests that it is a tangible object and part of a crafted collection of similar pieces. Therefore, the pawn in question is most likely part of a meticulously designed chess set. A brief explanation of why the other options are not suitable: 1. Scheme: A scheme generally refers to a plan or course of action. In the context of the question, a hand-carved pawn is not a plan but a physical object. 2. Elephant: Although some chess pieces might be designed to resemble animals or other figures, a pawn is a specific chess piece and not typically carved in the shape of an elephant. 3. Chess game: A chess game involves the actual competition between two players. While a pawn is used in the game, it is just one of the game's components, not the game itself. 4. North Carolina: This is a US state and is irrelevant to the context of the question which is about a hand-carved pawn. Considering the context and the options provided, \\"chess set\\" makes the most sense as the correct answer because it is the only option that directly relates to a hand-carved pawn being a part of a larger collection of hand-carved chess pieces."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Video is a visual medium, and while voice overs and text are great to get information across they are not incredibly compelling. If you're shooting alone you will not be able to use dialog, actors, or a ton of sound to tell your story. What you have, however, is all the time in the world to set up great shots, capture good video, and work on creating compelling angles. Have the mind of a photographer on every shot. Ask yourself if, on its own, the image is interesting. A storyboard is just the comic book version of your movie. They are invaluable ways to design your film, allowing you to \\"see\\" the movie before shooting. It then acts as your guidebook to the film. You can find and print templates online, or simply draw out your basic shots in advance with pen and paper. Improvising for the camera has it's place, of course. But storyboards are a good way to plan where the camera should go. Camera microphones are notoriously bad, and they become useless when the camera is far away from the action. An external microphone will make a huge difference in your production quality, since most audiences notice bad sound before rough video. Make discrete, compelling \\"scenes\\" instead of turning the camera on and letting it run while you move around. This ensures that you think about each scene individually and it makes editing much easier. Focus works by sharpening the image at one particularly distance from the camera. If you move around the camera will struggle to keep up, shifting focus or becoming blurry. Put down a small piece of tape that tells you where you need to sit or stand for each take. Films of any lengths are built in the editing booth.The more raw material, or film, that you have to work with the happier you will be, and the easier it will be to make a great movie. Grab different angles of the same shot, run through different lines, or videotape your environment for atmospheric shots. Every extra shot counts. Experiment with shots. Take crazy angles, get weird, abstract shots of everyday objects, and really explore your area with the camera. You may not use the footage, but even grabbing one compelling shot out of 100 will be worth it.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of setting up great shots, using storyboards, investing in external microphones, creating discrete scenes, focusing on sharpening images, gathering ample raw material, and experimenting with different angles to create compelling and high-quality videos."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I carry these thoughts in the back of my head.","completion":"In the two given sentences, the word \\"carry\\" is used in a figurative sense and shares similar underlying meanings with subtle differences. In both sentences, \\"carry\\" conveys the idea of continually having something in one's awareness or consciousness and maintaining it within their thought processes. However, the way \\"carry\\" is used in each sentence slightly differs when considering their nuanced implications. In the first sentence, \\"I carry her image in my mind's eye,\\" the word \\"carry\\" denotes holding onto a mental picture or visual memory of a person (in this case, \\"her\\"). It implies that the speaker regularly pictures or thinks about this person, and the image is continuously present within their mental faculties. The phrase \\"mind's eye\\" specifically refers to an individual's ability to visualize or imagine, and the use of \\"carry\\" in this context emphasizes the continuous presence of this visualization in the speaker's thoughts. In the second sentence, \\"I carry these thoughts in the back of my head,\\" the word \\"carry\\" signifies maintaining certain thoughts, ideas, or considerations within one's consciousness but not necessarily at the forefront of their mind. The phrase \\"in the back of my head\\" suggests that these thoughts are not always actively being considered. They are present but in a more passive or subdued manner compared to the constant visualization implied in the first sentence. In summary, the word \\"carry\\" has a similar underlying meaning in both sentences, indicating the act of holding onto or maintaining something within one's thoughts or awareness. However, the nuances of how \\"carry\\" functions within the context of each sentence are different. In the first sentence, \\"carry\\" emphasizes the continual visualization or mental picturing of someone, whereas, in the second, it conveys the idea of holding onto thoughts that may not always be at the forefront of the speaker's mind but still impact their consciousness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation of having less aluminum leached from the soil due to already leached aluminum will have a direct effect on the process of acid rain harming the ecosystem. If less aluminum is leached from the soil, it means that the acidic waters would absorb reduced amounts of aluminum. Consequently, the water running off into lakes and streams will have lower concentrations of aluminum. This can lead to a potential decrease in the harmful effects of aluminum on fish, their eggs, and other aquatic organisms, as well as on frogs, plants, and insects living near the affected water bodies. As a result, there might be a smaller impact on the ecosystem and the balance within it. However, it is important to note that while the perturbation hypothesis may lessen the direct effects of aluminum on the aquatic ecosystem, it does not entirely eliminate the negative consequences of acidic waters, as other factors and chemical compounds in acid rain can also cause harm to the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Leonhard Euler ( ; ; ; 15 April 170718 September 1783) was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, logician and engineer who made important and influential discoveries in many branches of mathematics like infinitesimal calculus and graph theory while also making pioneering contributions to several branches such as topology and analytic number theory. He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, particularly for mathematical analysis, such as the notion of a mathematical function. He is also known for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics, optics, astronomy, and music theory. Euler was one of the most eminent mathematicians of the 18th century, and is held to be one of the greatest in history. He is also widely considered to be the most prolific mathematician of all time. His collected works fill 60 to 80 quarto volumes, more than anybody in the field. He spent most of his adult life in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia. A statement attributed to Pierre-Simon Laplace expresses Euler's influence on mathematics: \\"Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.\\" Leonhard Euler was born on 15 April 1707, in Basel, Switzerland to Paul III Euler, a pastor of the Reformed Church, and Marguerite Brucker, a pastor's daughter. He had two younger sisters: Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena, and a younger brother Johann Heinrich. Soon after the birth of Leonhard, the Eulers moved from Basel to the town of Riehen, where Euler spent most of his childhood.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the last names of the French critics who promoted the painter who had only a few copies of his works produced? from the following article ? El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism. El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers. Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex iconography. Some of these commentators, such as Antonio Palomino and Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, described his mature work as \\"contemptible\\", \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"worthy of scorn\\". The views of Palomino and Bermúdez were frequently repeated in Spanish historiography, adorned with terms such as \\"strange\\", \\"queer\\", \\"original\\", \\"eccentric\\" and \\"odd\\". The phrase \\"sunk in eccentricity\\", often encountered in such texts, in time developed into \\"madness\\".With the arrival of Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century, El Greco's works were examined anew. To French writer Théophile Gautier, El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme. Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero (the \\"gifted\\", the \\"misunderstood\\", the \\"mad\\"), and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco's later technique. French art critics Zacharie Astruc and Paul Lefort helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting. In the 1890s, Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor. However, in the popular English-speaking imagination he remained the man who \\"painted horrors in the Escorial\\" in the words of Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia in 1899.In 1908, Spanish art historian Manuel Bartolomé Cossío published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works; in this book El Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School.

The only force of protection is the Judges - the city's highly-trained and well-equipped law enforcement officers, who are given the authority to dispense justice on the spot. Their word is law, and their sentences are absolute. Joe Dredd, the city's most notorious and respected judge, has faithfully upheld the law for decades, striking fear and respect into the hearts of both criminals and citizens alike. However, after a series of troubling revelations, it becomes clear that Dredd is not quite the paragon of justice everyone believed him to be. Having spent his entire life devoted to upholding the law, Dredd finds himself accused of manipulating the judicial system for personal gain and suppressing evidence to maintain his own near-perfect record. Standing trial in the very same court he's presided over for so long, Dredd is ultimately found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. He is sent to the highest-security prison within the city, a place reserved for only the most dangerous criminals and those deemed beyond redemption. Despite being stripped of his badge and gun, the unstoppable force of law that Dredd once represented urges him to continue fighting. Initially ostracized by his fellow inmates, Dredd forms an unlikely alliance with a group of prisoners who share a common goal - exposing the deeply ingrained corruption within the city's justice system. Together, they work to chip away at the conspiracy, bringing just retribution to the crooked politicians and corrupt guards who profit from the current state of affairs. As the investigation progresses, the enemy's forces both inside and outside of the prison begin to take notice, and Dredd quickly realizes that this sentence may well be his most challenging assignment yet. It will take all of his years of hard-won experience and unyielding determination to break down the walls of secrecy and bring the truth to light. In the end, Dredd must struggle with his own values and beliefs, questioning whether his commitment to the law truly had his city's best interests at heart. Will he be able to remedy the mistakes of his past and reclaim his title as the city's greatest judge?

Answer:","completion":"Michael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players of all time, had a remarkable career in the NBA, particularly when it came to playoff performances. Across his entire playoff career, which spanned 13 seasons from 1985 to 1998 and 2001 to 2003, Jordan appeared in 179 playoff games and scored a total of 5,987 points. To calculate Jordan's average points per game in the playoffs, we can use the following formula: Total Points Scored (5,987 points) / Total Playoff Games (179 games) = Points Per Game (PPG) When we apply this formula, we get: 5,987 points / 179 games ≈ 33.45 points per game. So, on average, Michael Jordan scored approximately 33.45 points per game in the playoffs throughout his illustrious NBA career. It is important to note that these numbers are subject to rounding and may vary slightly depending on how the math is carried out, but it provides a clear picture of Jordan's outstanding scoring abilities during high-stakes playoff games."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I knew that my daughter’s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred.

SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made...

In later years, his poetry became filled with imagery and emotion. - A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area.

Radcliffe Tower is all that remains of an early 15th-century stone-built manor house. The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Scheduled Monument. The construction of a nearby tithe barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720. It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farm's produce). Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building. The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century, and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War. Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings. St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee. Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871. The building cost £7,273, (£670 thousand today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£160 thousand today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher. Radcliffe's first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road. It was presented to the town by a Mrs Noah Rostron in memory of her husband, and erected in August 1896. The fountain no longer exists at this location. Built in 1911 the town hall was on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane. For many years after the town lost its urban district status, the building was unoccupied. It was converted to private accommodation in 1999.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the room that a classical apse gives it an almost temple air?, using the article: Inside the house, the Palladian form reaches a height and grandeur seldom seen in any other house in England. It has, in fact, been described as \\"The finest Palladian interior in England.\\" The grandeur of the interior is obtained with an absence of excessive ornament, and reflects Kent's career-long taste for \\"the eloquence of a plain surface\\". Work on the interiors ran from 1739 to 1773. The first habitable rooms were in the family wing and were in use from 1740, the Long Library being the first major interior completed in 1741. Among the last to be completed and entirely under Lady Leicester's supervision is the Chapel with its alabaster reredos. The house is entered through the Marble Hall (though the chief building fabric is in fact pink Derbyshire alabaster), modelled by Kent on a Roman basilica. The room is over 50 feet (15 m) from floor to ceiling and is dominated by the broad white marble flight of steps leading to the surrounding gallery, or peristyle: here alabaster Ionic columns support the coffered, gilded ceiling, copied from a design by Inigo Jones, inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. The fluted columns are thought to be replicas of those in the Temple of Fortuna Virilis, also in Rome. Around the hall are statues in niches; these are predominantly plaster copies of classical deities. The hall's flight of steps lead to the piano nobile and state rooms. The grandest, the Saloon, is situated immediately behind the great portico, with its walls lined with patterned red caffoy (a mixture of wool, linen and silk) and a coffered, gilded ceiling. In this room hangs Rubens's Return from Egypt.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Why did Houston's economy have problems in the late 1980's? Answer: Since the increase of oil prices in the 2000s, the petroleum industry has again increased its share of the local economy. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? (1). yes. (2). no.","completion":"(2). no. Answer: Houston's economy confronted a multitude of problems in the late 1980s due to several interrelated factors. The primary causes can be attributed to the decline in oil prices, a collapse in commercial real estate, and the spillover effects that exacerbated the negative consequences on other industries and the local economy. 1. Decline in oil prices: A vital factor that destabilized Houston's economy in the late 1980s was the drastic fall in oil prices. From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, the region experienced an oil boom, driven by high global oil prices, which fueled growth and led to a surge in demand for related industries, services, and jobs in the Houston metropolitan area. However, oil prices began to fall in 1986, primarily due to oversupply in the global market, improved energy efficiency, and a shift towards alternative energy sources. The decline in oil prices deeply impacted the petroleum industry and reduced the demand for related services and products, leaving many oil and gas companies to suffer large scale revenue losses, resulting in layoffs, bankruptcy, or consolidation to stay afloat. 2. Collapse in the commercial real estate market: Alongside the oil boom, Houston witnessed rapid growth in its commercial real estate sector as investors and developers were optimistic about the future of the region's economy. This led to the construction of new office buildings, housing complexes, and other commercial properties, which were heavily reliant on the continuing success of the oil and gas industry. However, as oil prices plummeted, many of these projects were left unfinished, over-supplied, or unoccupied. This oversupply led to a sharp decline in property values and rental rates, which left banks, developers, and investors exposed to significant financial risks. As a result, many banks and financial institutions faced insolvency, and the commercial real estate market in Houston collapsed, further aggravating the city's economic crisis. 3. Spillover effects on other industries and the local economy: The impacts of the decline in oil prices and the collapse of the commercial real estate market extended to other sectors in Houston, such as manufacturing, construction, banking, retail, and professional services. The loss of jobs in the petroleum industry and the real estate sector decreased consumer demand for goods and services, causing multiple businesses to either cut back on their workforce, reduce salaries, or close their doors entirely. This, in turn, led to higher unemployment and underemployment rates, resulting in reduced tax revenue for the city and adding further strain on local government's capacity to provide social services and public infrastructure. Moreover, the credit crunch caused by bank failures and increased fiscal conservatism affected financing for new projects or existing businesses. In conclusion, the problems faced by Houston's economy in the late 1980s were primarily rooted in its heavy dependence on the oil and gas industry and an over-optimistic commercial real estate market. When the oil industry faltered due to falling oil prices, the impacts rippled through the local economy, resulting in a slowdown of growth, job losses, and reduced consumption. The collapse of the commercial real estate market further aggravated the financial situation as banks failed, and the credit environment tightened, placing even non-energy-related businesses in distress. As the city overcame these economic challenges, it has since worked towards diversifying its industry base and investing in alternative sectors to reduce its vulnerability to future economic shocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: The classic Key West-style house just off Fleming looked much like the rest of the residences on the block - two-story wooden frame walls and peaked roofs with shallow porches nearly butting up against the sidewalk. Chloe's rusting blue Vespa was tucked away beside the house, in the narrow space separating it from the neighbors. To anyone walking by outside, everything looked quiet and peaceful. Inside, Chloe was pissed. Everything had been going great and then those stupid fuckers had decided to show up a week early, forcing her to scramble to pack a week's work into a single day. She wore a black bandana wrapped around her head, covering her buzz cut pink hair. Numerous smudges of dirt on her cheeks and the tip of her nose testified to the heavy-duty cleaning she'd been doing for the past five hours. She wore loose fitting shorts and a tight-fitting tank top that had once been white. In her bare feet she pushed a mop across the hardwood floors, grumbling to herself. She heard the door open and looked up to see Paul standing in the doorway. Even though it wasn't his fault, she glared at him as he came in. As much as Chloe liked a clean house, she hated housework, and this wasn't even her house. This particular space was sparsely decorated with just a few worn pieces of furniture and some bad condo art on the walls. After six months of being sealed up tight with the air conditioner off, it smelled of dust and mildew and needed a good airing out. \\"What are you doing?\\" asked Paul, closing the door behind him. \\"Mopping,\\" she said, her voice flat. \\"Right. But why are you mopping here? Whose house is this anyway?\\" \\"It's one we just added to the roster last week. The cleaning service hasn't had a chance to get in here yet.\\" \\"I see that,\\" said Paul. \\"So why're you cleaning it tonight?\\" \\"We're cleaning it tonight because the Guidarizzi's decided to make a surprise visit to their winter home in Key West. They're coming in tomorrow afternoon. Every other decent place is filled up, so we have to use this one instead.\\" According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is probably true about Chloe? Options: - not enough information - She has a close relationship with Paul - She is angry that Paul is making her do so much work - She is a member of the Guidarizzi family Answer:","completion":"She is angry that Paul is making her do so much work"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Veronica, already predisposed to dislike her new daughter-in-law, is further disappointed to find that she, like Jim, speaks fluent French. Larita also meets John's former girlfriend and neighbour Sarah Hurst, who is gracious about the marriage. Larita makes some inadvertent gaffes, accidentally killing the family chihuahua and giving some joking advice to Hilda that unfortunately results in embarrassment to, and enmity from, the sisters. Sarah comes to the Whittakers' parties, and to play tennis, accompanied by her brother Philip, on whom Hilda has a crush. Philip, however, is infatuated with Larita, which further angers Hilda. Larita reveals she has been previously married and remains calm in the face of her mother-in-law's disdain. To Larita's disappointment, John is not eager to leave the estate so that they can find a home of their own. Larita is bored and miserable in the countryside and hates blood sports like hunting, and any of the entertainment that country English people seem to enjoy. She reads Lady Chatterley's Lover, shocking the female relatives, and she will not play tennis.

Movie title: Stargate Movie plot: Egyptologist and linguist Daniel Jackson, Ph.D. (James Spader) is invited by Catherine Langford (Viveca Lindfors) to translate Egyptian hieroglyphs on cover stones that her father had unearthed in Giza, Egypt in 1928. Jackson is taken to a U.S. Air Force installation, and told the project is classified information by its commander Special Operations Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell). Jackson determines that the hieroglyphs refer to a \\"stargate\\" which uses constellations as spatial coordinates. On this revelation, Jackson is shown that the base has this Stargate, also discovered by Langford's father. They use Jackson's coordinates to align the Stargate's metal ring with markings along its outside, and once all seven are locked in, a wormhole opens, connecting the Stargate with a distant planet. Jackson joins O'Neil and other soldiers as they pass through the wormhole, though expresses concern at a nuclear bomb they brought as a last resort. On the arid desert planet, they find themselves in a pyramid-like structure. Jackson locates the Stargate and its controls, but lacks the coordinates to return home. O'Neil orders some men to stay behind to guard the Stargate. Nearby, they discover a tribe of humans working to mine a strange mineral from the planet. Jackson is able to communicate with them as they speak a variation of Ancient Egyptian, and finds the tribe sees them as emissaries of their god Ra (Jaye Davidson). The tribe's chieftain Kasuf (Eric Avari) presents Jackson with his daughter Sha'uri (Mili Avital) as a gift, and though Jackson initially refuses her, he becomes romantically attached to her.

This is illustrated in Figure below . Q: What characteristic of particles determines how they are carried by flowing water? A: Options: A). density. B). color. C). texture. D). size. Answer:","completion":"D). size The characteristic of particles that determines how they are carried by flowing water is their size. The paragraph specifically states that \\"The size of particles determines how they are carried by flowing water.\\" In this context, it is clear that the size of particles plays a crucial role in their ability to be transported and dispersed by the flowing water. The transportation and deposition of particles by flowing water is a vital process in the natural world and is an essential component of the water cycle. Different sizes of particles can be carried by water in various ways, depending on factors such as the velocity of the water and the properties of the particles themselves. As the size of a particle increases, the gravitational force acting on it becomes stronger, and it is more likely to settle at the bottom of the stream or river bed. Conversely, smaller particles, like silt and clay, are more likely to be suspended in the water and carried by the flow. It is important to note that while density, color, and texture might affect certain properties of particles, like how they interact with their environment and each other, they do not have the same direct influence on their transportability by flowing water as their size does. Dense materials, for example, may be more difficult to erode and transport, but this is still largely determined by the size of the individual particles. Similarly, the texture of a particle may influence its ability to adhere to other materials, but, again, this will be secondary to the size of the particle in determining how it is carried by flowing water. In summary, the key characteristic of particles that determines how they are carried by flowing water is their size, as outlined in the provided paragraph. It is the primary factor that influences how particles are transported, suspended, or deposited in water bodies. While other properties like density, color, and texture may also play a role in the overall behavior of particles in a water environment, their contribution to the transportability of the particles is comparatively smaller than the size of the particles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Article:","completion":"Title: Controversial Neuroscience Research in Nairobi: A Glimpse of Hope for Stroke Patients or Ethical Dilemma? Introduction: The quest for modern medicine to unravel the mysteries of neurological disorders has led to numerous discoveries and breakthroughs in recent years. Despite these advancements, certain research methods continue to ignite ethical debates related to animal testing. This article will delve into the recent controversy surrounding British neuroscientist Stuart Baker, who has been accused of bypassing British law by conducting research on baboons in Nairobi. The research itself could have significant implications on potential treatments for stroke patients and could also provide insights into motor neurone disease and Alzheimer's. Bypassing British Law: Dr. Stuart Baker's Travel to Nairobi: Dr. Stuart Baker, a renowned neuroscientist, has sparked an ethical debate as he was accused of bypassing British law to perform his research. Dr. Baker has taken his work to Nairobi, where he conducts research on baboons captured on the plains of Africa. The choice of conducting research on wild animals, specifically baboons, in a foreign country has alarmed animal rights activists and concerned citizens, questioning the legality of his actions. The Potential Impact of Dr. Baker's Research: Despite the controversy surrounding his work, Dr. Baker's research has the potential to pave the way for vital new treatments for stroke patients. Strokes, caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain or a burst blood vessel, often result in severe disability or death. Dr. Baker's work aims to provide breakthrough solutions to rehabilitating patients suffering from the after-effects of a stroke. Moreover, his research may offer valuable insights into other neurological disorders, including motor neurone disease and Alzheimer's. Motor neurone disease comprises a group of conditions that cause the nerves in the spine and brain to progressively lose function. Alzheimer's, on the other hand, is a progressive disease that affects memory, thinking skills, and eventually, the ability to carry out simple tasks. Both of these debilitating conditions have yet to find a cure, and Dr. Baker's work may provide the much-needed understanding to expedite their treatments. The Ethical Dilemma: Animal Rights and Neuroscience Research: Animal testing has been a longstanding ethical issue when it comes to neuroscience research. As society progresses toward a more humane approach to scientific research, the use of animals in such studies becomes increasingly controversial. Dr. Stuart Baker is not exempt from these discussions as his work with wild baboons has raised concerns regarding the ethical treatment of animals. Animal rights activists argue that it is unjust to subject animals to various procedures, regardless of the potential benefits for humans. Additionally, concerns surrounding the legality of his actions in Nairobi and the possibility of bypassing British law fuel the debate of whether the ends justify the means. Conclusion: The controversy surrounding Dr. Stuart Baker's neuronal research in Nairobi highlights the ongoing struggle between scientific advancement and ethical considerations. While his research could potentially lead to groundbreaking discoveries and treatment options for stroke patients and other neurological disorders, the means by which these results are obtained continue to ignite ethical debates. As we continue to push the boundaries of modern medicine, striking a balance between ethical research and medical advancement becomes increasingly challenging. It is crucial to ensure that scientific research is conducted under a scrutiny of moral and legal guidelines while continuing to explore and develop new solutions to humanity's most pressing medical challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If more magma rises from deep within the Earth, several changes may occur in the process you described: 1. Increased magma volume: The increased amount of magma will cause a higher volume of magma to be present in the volcanoes. This will result in more pressure building up within the volcano as the magma accumulates. 2. Faster rate of eruptions: The increased magma supply and pressure may lead to more frequent volcanic eruptions, as the pressure build-up will likely cause the magma to push through the surface of the volcano at a quicker pace. 3. Larger volume of lava produced: During volcanic eruptions, the increased amount of magma will result in a greater volume of lava being released. This will lead to more lava cooling and forming new rock on the Earth's surface. 4. Larger rocks formed and faster land formation: With more lava cooling and solidifying, there will be a larger amount of new rock formations. This may lead to faster land formation or expansion in areas where volcanic activity is prevalent. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of more magma rising from deep within the Earth will have a direct effect on the process. This will lead to increased pressure within volcanoes, more frequent eruptions, a larger volume of lava being produced, and faster land formation. It will ultimately result in more lava cooling and forming new rock surfaces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the actor from Chadderton who acted in the production of Hush?, using the article: People from Chadderton are called Chaddertonians. Historically, Chadderton was chiefly distinguished by the presence of ruling families, including the Asshetons, Radclyffes, Hortons and Chaddertons. Within the extended Chadderton/Chaderton family, two ecclesiastically notable persons were William Chaderton (medieval academic and bishop) and Laurence Chaderton (the first Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, a leading Puritan and one of the original translators of the Authorised King James Version of the Bible). John Ashton of Cowhill and Thomas Buckley of Baretrees in Chadderton were two victims of the Peterloo Massacre in 1819. Samuel Collins, 'The Bard Of Hale Moss', was a 19th-century poet and radical who lived at Hale Moss in southern Chadderton.Lydia Becker was a pioneer in the late 19th century of the campaign for Women's Suffrage and founder of the Women's Suffrage Journal, born in Chadderton's Foxdenton Hall. Chadderton born scientist Geoff Tootill helped create the Manchester Baby in 1948, the world's first electronic stored-program computer. Terry Hall was a pioneering ventriloquist and early children's television entertainer born in Chadderton in 1926. He was one of the first ventriloquists to perform with an animal (the \\"cowardly and bashful\\" Lenny the Lion) as his puppet, rather than a traditional child doll. Other notable people from Chadderton include Woolly Wolstenholme, the Chadderton-born vocalist and keyboard player with the British progressive rock band Barclay James Harvest, David Platt, former captain of the England national football team, and supermodel Karen Elson, who grew up in the town and attended North Chadderton School.

The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Nikki Clan was a Mexican Pop rock band from Nogales, Sonora and Mexicali, Baja California, The band is formed by Yadira Gianola (lead vocals), Alberto Espinosa (bass guitar), José Antonio Dabdoub (guitar), Ángel Yáñez (guitar), and José Carlos Fausto Monroy (drums).

His eyes were open and his head bobbed around at an impossible angle. He was sitting in about forty feet of water, stone dead, one arm pinned between the rocks. As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it.

He was speaking as the northern city of Aleppo endured a day of relentless air strikes, with the Syrian military determined to retake rebel-held areas. A seven-day US-Russian brokered truce collapsed on Monday. Mr Lavrov laid the blame on the US for failing to control the rebel groups it backs. He said a key condition of the truce was for moderate rebel groups backed by the US to separate themselves from militants. \\"Unfortunately the coalition led by the United States, which committed itself to make sure that this separation happens, has not been able to do this,\\" Mr Lavrov said, although he said his \\"good friend\\" Secretary of State John Kerry had indicated this remained the commitment of the United States. Mr Lavrov said that if the location of militants of the Nusra Front could be pinpointed, he remained convinced a cessation of hostilities and a delivery of humanitarian aid would be possible. He said it was \\"now essential to prevent a disruption\\" of the US-Russia agreements. Mr Lavrov also spoke of a \\"bleeding Middle East and North Africa\\", the result of \\"arrogant attitudes and feelings of infallibility in pushing unilateral and reckless solutions\\". Mr Kerry said he had met Mr Lavrov earlier in the day and that there was \\"a little bit of progress\\" on resolving differences on Syria. \\"We're evaluating some mutual ideas in a constructive way, period,\\" Mr Kerry said. But the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins in New York says there appears to be little hope of any diplomatic progress and that, with the violence in Syria this week, jaw-jaw has absolutely lost out to war-war. The head of a hospital in the rebel-held east told Reuters news agency that 91 people had been killed in Friday's bombardment. In between the raids, White Helmet volunteers frantically searched for those trapped in the rubble of demolished buildings, often with bare hands. One video showed a screaming girl being pulled out alive, another was of a toddler with no signs of life. \\"In many areas, the wounded and sick have nowhere to go at all - they are simply left to die,\\" said Carlos Francisco, Medecins Sans Frontieres head of mission in Syria. One White Helmet volunteer reported air strikes as he gave an interview to the BBC World Service. Another rescue worker described what was happening as \\"annihilation\\". Unicef said that nearly two million people were again without running water after an attack on a pumping station that served the rebel-held east of the city, and the retaliatory shutdown of a station serving the government-controlled west. The White Helmets said centres set up to help victims of bombardments were being targeted, and three out of four had been put out of action. Islamic State and the crisis in Iraq and Syria in maps Ammar al-Selmo, the head of civil defence in eastern Aleppo, told Reuters that at least 40 buildings had been destroyed. Activists said both Syrian and Russian warplanes were taking part in the offensive, though Russia has not confirmed its involvement. Announcing the new offensive on state television late on Thursday, the Syrian government warned Aleppo residents to \\"stay away\\" from \\"terrorist positions\\". Syrian military sources said a ground offensive would follow. One told Agence France-Presse that the bombardment \\"could go on for hours or days before the ground operation starts. The timing of the ground operation will depend on the results of the strikes\\".

Question: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work.

Sentence 1 does not provide information about any other encounters or the circumstances that led to their meeting with Dubya. Sentence 2 states that if it wasn't for Jane Pauley, the speaker would never have met Dubya. This sentence suggests that Jane Pauley played a role in the meeting between the speaker and Dubya. Given only the information from Sentence 1, we cannot determine whether it was specifically due to Jane Pauley's actions that the speaker met Dubya for the first time. We only know that Jane Pauley took the speaker to an event where they saw Dubya once since graduation. There could have been other circumstances or events where the speaker met Dubya, but these were not mentioned.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Flowers of War Movie plot: In 1937, Japan invades China, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre. As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their convent at a Western-run Roman Catholic cathedral. Here, John Miller (Bale), an American mortician on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls. He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape. After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a chorale for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the virginal schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13. When the de facto leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan (Xinyi), convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo (Ni), convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party.

Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I really have no major complaints about my Garmin eTrex (lovingly called \\"the yellow eTrex\\"). The interface is simple, and the unit is small and light.Some may wish they had gone a step up to a model with the thumb-stick for easier interface navigation. I was one such person, and I have to admit that the thumb stick is much easier to use than the up/down buttons that you're limited to with the yellow eTrex.Buyer beware when it comes to USED yellow eTrex models. Many versions of it were sold that were not WAAS enabled. You can ask a seller if the system menu has an option to disable/enable WAAS. If not, you're looking at a slightly less accurate model (but if the price is right for you, it shouldn't matter too much). Answer:","completion":"Based on the given review, it seems that the user would most likely recommend the Garmin eTrex, also known as \\"the yellow eTrex\\". There are a few factors that hint at a positive recommendation, despite a couple of minor concerns. The user mentions that they have no major complaints about the product and appreciates the simplicity of its interface as well as its small size and light weight. These qualities indicate a general satisfaction with the product. Moreover, while the absence of a thumb-stick is raised as a concern, the reviewer acknowledges that the up/down buttons remain functional, just less convenient than the thumb-stick. The buyer beware note in the review appears to be more of a helpful tip for potential buyers than a negative criticism of the product itself. The user advises checking if the item is WAAS enabled in case of used models and suggests that even if a model is less accurate due to lack of WAAS, the price may still make it worth considering. This information seems to demonstrate an overall positive view of the product, as the reviewer provides additional guidance that could enhance the buying experience for others. In conclusion, while the review does mention a few drawbacks, the overall tone and content suggest that the user is largely satisfied with the Garmin eTrex and would likely recommend it to others, especially if they have considered these minor concerns and determined that they are acceptable trade-offs for the attractive features described."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which continent was inhabited by fewer turtles? Two continents were known for the strange discrepancies in animal populations. Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles. Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... A:","completion":"The continent that was inhabited by fewer turtles is Africa. The paragraph mentions that Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles. Since turtles are a type of reptile, it can be inferred that there were fewer turtles in Africa as compared to Asia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Barbara's portrait may have been completed soon after, when she would have been around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, and would soon leave for Nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons Dürer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older.The sitters are presented in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown.

Here is a goal: How do you open your hood? How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"The process to open the hood of a car doesn't vary much from vehicle to vehicle. Here's a general step-by-step process you can follow: 1. **Locate Hood Release Handle**: The first step is to locate the hood release handle of your car. Usually, it's found in the driver's side footwell, under the dashboard. It might also be situated on the lower left-hand side of the dashboard where the door meets it when closed. In some cars, it might be by the driver's door. Most likely, it will have an icon of a car with an ‘upward-looking’ arrow or the term \\"Hood\\" written on it. 2. **Pull Hood Release Handle**: Once you've located the hood release, you'll need to pull it. Normally it will require a firm pull to activate the release mechanism. This will partially open the hood, allowing you to open it fully from outside of the vehicle. 3. **Locate Hood Catch**: After you have pulled the hood release handle from inside, step out of the vehicle and proceed to the front of it. Depending on how your hood release is designed, you may see a small portion of your hood that has risen. 4. **Release the Hood Catch or Hood latch**: Some cars have a secondary latch that you'll need to locate, this separate handle or latch usually takes the form of a lever or push-button that you need to slide or push. Slide your fingers underneath the partially opened hood and feel around for the latch. It is typically positioned in the center beneath the hood and above the logo on the grille. 5. **Open the Hood**: Once you've disengaged the latch, you can now lift the hood. Do this by holding onto the sides of the hood and raising it all the way up. 6. **Secure the Hood with the Prop rod**: Some hoods will have hydraulic or spring-loaded struts that hold the hood open once you lift it. If your car doesn't, it likely has a prop rod — a thin rod attached to the underside of the hood or the car’s chassis. Lift this rod and fit it into the hole on the underside of the hood designed to hold the rod. This keeps the hood securely open while you’re working in the engine compartment. Remember to be gentle while handling the hood to avoid any damage. Do not force it if it doesn't open; there might be some mechanical issues which you need professional help to handle. Also, make sure the car is turned off before popping the hood to prevent any accidents. This process can slightly differ depending on your car model, so it's a good idea to check the vehicle's manual for the exact process."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

This method is largely autonomous and isn't directly influenced by weather changes such as rain. However, it's important to point out that while the rain itself does not directly increase or decrease the amount of oxygen that reaches the body, it can affect factors that do have an impact on respiration. For example, rain often leads to cleaner air due to the effect of rain \\"washing\\" away pollutants in the air.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States.

AFSOC provides Air Force Special Operations Forces ( SOF ) for worldwide deployment and assignment to regional unified combatant commands . AFSOC was initially established on 10 February 1983 as Twenty - Third Air Force ( 23 AF ) , a subordinate numbered air force of the Military Airlift Command ( MAC ) , with 23 AF headquarters established at Hurlburt Field , Florida . On 22 May 1990 , 23 AF was redesignated as AFSOC and became a separate major command ( MAJCOM ) responsible for all USAF special operations forces ( SOF ) , aircraft and personnel in the Regular Air Force , Air Force Reserve , and the Air National Guard ( ANG ) . - Special forces and special operations forces are military or police units trained to conduct special operations. NATO defines special operations as \\"military activities conducted by specially designated, organized, trained, and equipped forces, manned with selected personnel, using unconventional tactics, techniques, and modes of employment\\". - Air Combat Command (ACC) is one of ten Major Commands (MAJCOMs) in the United States Air Force, reporting to Headquarters, United States Air Force (HAF) at the Pentagon. - Special operations (S.O.) are military operations that are \\"special\\" or unconventional and carried out by dedicated special forces and other special operations forces units using unconventional methods and resources. Special operations may be performed independently of or in conjunction with, conventional military operations. The primary goal is to achieve a political or military objective where a conventional force requirement does not exist or might adversely affect the overall strategic outcome. Special operations are usually conducted in a low-profile manner that aims to achieve the advantages of speed, surprise, and violence of action against an unsuspecting target. Special ops are typically carried out with limited numbers of highly trained personnel that are adaptable, self-reliant and able to operate in all environments, and able to use unconventional combat skills and equipment. Special operations are usually implemented through specific, tailored intelligence. - Aerial warfare is the use of military aircraft and other flying machines in warfare.

Article: Renault's new Twizy could be the future of motoring ... or at least a big part of it. This is not some crazy future concept -- this is a real vehicle, fully electric, and on sale now. Prices for the Twizy start at PS6,690, with battery hire from PS45 a month. But is it a car? Technically no, it' s classified under UK law as something closer to a moped . A two-seater (the passenger sits behind the driver), the Twizy runs on electric power only, and is designed to cover all those little trips we do. And as 87 percent of Europe's drivers do less than 37 miles a day -- 50 per cent less than 12--there's really no need to be burning gas for that sort of journey. The Twizy is arguably the most unusual vehicle in this country. Other cars have been beautifully designed, others have been small, but no car has turned motoring on its head in quite the same way. The Twizy's batteries have a range of 62 miles, and it plugs into a standard socket like any other electrical equipment, going from flat to full power in three and a half hours. There are no full doors on the vehicle, so think of it like a covered moped with four wheels, but no noise and no need for a helmet. There's also a lower-powered type being designed, the Twizy 45, for which you don' t need a license. Seeing the Twizy in the flesh, you' re surprised by how striking it looks. Sit in it and everything feels right --just car enough to be easy, but different enough to be exciting. With the battery underneath you, the vehicle is suckered to the road, and the electric power means it accelerates with real energy up to about 50 mph. You don't feel you need any more. In the UK, the weather alone may make it a good buy, but the lack of easy access to outdoor sockets is the biggest challenge. Only time will tell if this brave move answers enough problems to find a place in our lives.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who replaced Zack de la Rocha? , can you please find it? Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.\\" The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues.

Question: Ptolemy was an ancient astronomer who thought Earth was the center of the universe. When he made observations that were inconsistent with this, he proposed a phenomenon called \\"epicycles\\" to explain the observations. How was Ptolemy's process similar to the modern scientific process? OPT: (1). Ptolemy based his model partly on a belief system. (2). Observations inspired Ptolemy to modify his explanations. (3). Ptolemy tried to describe the universe instead of explaining it. (4). Experiments were the basis of Ptolemy's model of the universe. Answer:","completion":"(2). Observations inspired Ptolemy to modify his explanations. Step 1: Understanding the context of the question To address this question, it is essential to recognize that it asks for a comparison between Ptolemy's process and the modern scientific process. Step 2: Comparing the options with the modern scientific process Now, let's evaluate each option against the modern scientific process, which generally involves observation, hypothesis formation, experimentation, and refining explanations based on new evidence. Option 1: Ptolemy based his model partly on a belief system. While it is true that Ptolemy's geocentric model was based on the belief that Earth was at the center of the universe, modern science relies on evidence-based findings rather than belief systems. Therefore, this option does not align with the modern scientific process. Option 2: Observations inspired Ptolemy to modify his explanations. This option demonstrates adherence to the modern scientific process. Ptolemy made observations, which led him to modify his theory by introducing epicycles. This is in line with the modern scientific method, where observation leads to the testing and refining of theories. Option 3: Ptolemy tried to describe the universe instead of explaining it. This statement does not align with the modern scientific process. Ptolemy did try to explain the universe by presenting a model that accounted for his observations. The modern scientific method also seeks to understand and explain the world around us. Option 4: Experiments were the basis of Ptolemy's model of the universe. Ptolemy's model was based on observations rather than experiments since technology and methods at the time were limited. In contrast, experiments form a core component of the modern scientific process. Step 3: Choosing the best answer Based on the comparison, option (2) Observations inspired Ptolemy to modify his explanations is the most closely related to the modern scientific process. Ptolemy observed inconsistencies, formed a hypothesis with the introduction of epicycles, and refined his model accordingly - all of which aligns with modern scientific methodology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Simple single-celled eukaryotes have relatively small amounts of such DNA, whereas the genomes of complex multicellular organisms, including humans, contain an absolute majority of DNA without an identified function. This DNA has often been referred to as \\"junk DNA\\".

Hill farm practiced conventional agriculture, while Dew farm practiced permaculture design within the context of organic farming. But I can use this background: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. What is an answer for this question: Which farm generated more marine litter?","completion":"Based on the given situation and background information, it appears that Hill farm, which practiced conventional agriculture, would likely generate more marine litter. Conventional agriculture often involves the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. These chemicals can cause nutrient pollution in the nearby river when they are washed off the fields during rain or irrigation. The polluted river water then flows into the ocean, contributing to marine pollution, hypoxia, and the creation of dead zones. On the other hand, Dew farm practices permaculture design within the context of organic farming. Permaculture is a sustainable agricultural approach focused on creating a harmonious integration of the landscape, plants, animals, and people. It generally avoids the use of synthetic chemicals and instead relies on natural methods for soil fertility and pest control. Organic farming also utilizes environmentally friendly practices, such as cover cropping, crop rotation, and the use of organic fertilizers like compost and manure. These practices help in reducing the risk of nutrient pollution in water bodies, thus minimizing the potential for marine litter generation. In conclusion, it is more likely that Hill farm, with its conventional agriculture practices, generated more marine litter compared to Dew farm, which practiced sustainable permaculture and organic farming methods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was a worldwide hit for Nicki French, reaching No. 2 in America and No. 1 in seven countries selling over 2 million copies. In 1994 Simon Cowell asked Stock to produce the record for the popular kid's TV show 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers' which was a top 5 hit in the UK. Cowell had worked with Stock on previous occasions with artists such as Sinitta, for whom Stock wrote and produced various hits like Toy Boy in 1987. Stock again collaborated with Cowell in 1993 on the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) album Wrestlemania which spawned the No. 4 hit 'Slam Jam'. In 1994 Stock produced several artists for Simon Cowell including Kym Mazelle, Jocelyn Brown and Robson and Jerome. Their cover of Unchained Melody produced by Stock and Aitken became the highest selling non-charity single of the decade, remaining at No. 1 for 7 weeks in 1995 selling 2.5 million copies. Stock produced a further two No. 1 singles with Robson and Jerome and two No. 1 albums. After several years producing hits for Stock's own label 'Love This Records' and with Simon Cowell for BMG/RCA, the structural integrity of Stock's studio became compromised by the tunnelling of the Jubilee Line extension, and the damage forced Stock to pursue legal action against London Underground. As a result, Stock was forced to pull out of a joint deal with Cowell and BMG to produce several artists including the band Westlife in 1996. In 1998 Stock and Aitken teamed up with Steve Crosby who had created the group Steps, to form the band Scooch.

As they increased their skill, they translated their English back into Latin without referring to the book and then compared their translation with the original.

Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation.

Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out.

George Orson Welles was born May 6, 1915, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, son of Richard Head Welles (b. Richard Hodgdon Wells, November 12, 1872, near St. Joseph, Missouri; d. December 28, 1930, Chicago, Illinois) and Beatrice Ives Welles (b. Beatrice Lucy Ives, September 1, 1883, Springfield, Illinois; d. May 10, 1924, Chicago). Breaking with the Federal Theatre Project in 1937, Welles and Houseman founded their own repertory company, which they called the Mercury Theatre. The name was inspired by the title of the iconoclastic magazine, The American Mercury. Welles was executive producer, and the original company included such actors as Joseph Cotten, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Arlene Francis, Martin Gabel, John Hoyt, Norman Lloyd, Vincent Price, Stefan Schnabel and Hiram Sherman. \\"I think he was the greatest directorial talent we've ever had in the [American] theater,\\" Lloyd said of Welles in a 2014 interview. \\"When you saw a Welles production, you saw the text had been affected, the staging was remarkable, the sets were unusual, music, sound, lighting, a totality of everything. We had not had such a man in our theater. He was the first and remains the greatest.\\" The Mercury Theatre opened November 11, 1937, with Caesar, Welles's modern-dress adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy Julius Caesar -- streamlined into an anti-fascist tour de force that Joseph Cotten later described as \\"so vigorous, so contemporary that it set Broadway on its ear.\\" The set was completely open with no curtain, and the brick stage wall was painted dark red. Scene changes were achieved by lighting alone. On the stage was a series of risers; squares were cut into one at intervals and lights were set beneath it, pointing straight up to evoke the \\"cathedral of light\\" at the Nuremberg Rallies. \\"He staged it like a political melodrama that happened the night before,\\" said Lloyd. Beginning January 1, 1938, Caesar was performed in repertory with The Shoemaker's Holiday; both productions moved to the larger National Theatre. They were followed by Heartbreak House (April 29, 1938) and Danton's Death (November 5, 1938). As well as being presented in a pared-down oratorio version at the Mercury Theatre on Sunday nights in December 1937, The Cradle Will Rock was at the Windsor Theatre for 13 weeks (January 4-April 2, 1938). Such was the success of the Mercury Theatre that Welles appeared on the cover of Time magazine, in full makeup as Captain Shotover in Heartbreak House, in the issue dated May 9, 1938--three days after his 23rd birthday.","completion":"This text is about George Orson Welles, a very talented man who was an actor, writer, director, and producer.

The clash of metal rang through the forest. An arrow pierced through the darkness, its barbed head tearing through flesh and muscle. A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \\"Did it get either of you?\\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \\"No\\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \\"Are you hurt?\\" \\"Mm...My hand.\\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \\"Did he claw you or bite you?\\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge. Ranur paused and then spoke low. \\"He bit me.\\" Char picked Lorfel and Ranur as his hunting partners for their speed and sharpness in battle. They had hunted beasts of the deep woods all of their lives. They hunted the beasts that hunted men. They all knew the risks of battling such creatures. The old man dropped his curved sword, drew his bow, and fired. The arrow hammered into Ranur's chest, burying itself in his heart. Lorfel saw the gleaming arrow head sticking almost a foot out of his companion's back. Ranur fell face first to the ground. From what or whom did the roar came from? A. Char B. not enough information C. A beast D. Ranur Answer:","completion":"The roar mentioned in the given context came from C. A beast. This inference is made from contextual cues such as Char standing over a pile of black fur and red blood, suggesting they have just defeated a creature or beast. The reinforcement of this idea comes from the detailed description of the hunters preparing to face and defeat dangerous woodland creatures. Finally, the bitten hand sets the scenario for a typical beastly attack, further confirming that the roar was from a beast."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. Now, I have a new situation: Two friends liked studying about the Earth's atmosphere. Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect. Answer this question please: Which friend studied less about short wavelength solar energy? A:","completion":"The friend who studied less about short wavelength solar energy would be Vick. In the information you provided, Vick is noted to have studied more about the troposphere, which is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere. The troposphere is where weather occurs and contains about 75% of the atmosphere's mass and 99% of its water vapor and aerosols. Studying the troposphere indeed requires understanding about temperature, pressure, wind, weather patterns, and other atmospheric conditions. However, while it would involve some understanding of how solar energy influences these conditions, it might not delve deeply into the specifics of solar energy wavelengths per se. On the other hand, Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect which directly involves the concept of short wavelength solar energy. Understanding the Greenhouse Effect requires knowledge about how the Sun's shortwave radiation—or short wavelength solar energy— penetrates Earth's atmosphere and is absorbed by the Earth's surface. This process is crucial to understanding how the Earth's temperature is regulated and what happens when additional greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, trapping more of this heat and contributing to global warming. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vick, who focused his studies on the troposphere, is likely to have studied less about short wavelength solar energy compared to Frank, who studied the Greenhouse Effect."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: If Thomas wanted the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, should he increase or decrease the temperature of his reactions? Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.","completion":"Based on the hint provided, it is clear that higher temperatures lead to faster reaction rates due to particles having more energy and colliding more frequently and with greater force. Since Justin is conducting his reactions at a high temperature and Thomas wants the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, Thomas should increase the temperature of his reactions. By doing so, he will increase the energy of the reactants, resulting in a faster reaction rate that is more comparable to Justin's."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye","completion":"The sentiment of the given sentence can be considered as mostly positive with a touch of neutrality. Let me break down the reasoning for this classification. The sentence is discussing the depiction of schizophrenia in a film, which is a sensitive and complex topic. The expression \\"stylish film\\" suggests that the film possesses visual or stylistic appeal, which is a positive aspect. Additionally, the phrase \\"able to visualize schizophrenia\\" acknowledges the film's effectiveness in portraying this illness. Such a portrayal can be considered successful and praiseworthy since it's not easy to depict mental health issues accurately in film format. Furthermore, the mention of the film being \\"confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye\\" indicates that the film approaches the subject matter with sensitivity and respect. The use of the term \\"confident\\" connotes a sense of self-assurance, which can be perceived as a positive attribute. The sentence implies that the film does not exploit the character's mental health condition for sensationalism, but rather, it responsibly examines the character's situation. Such a measured and thoughtful approach demonstrates the film's maturity and depth, which can also be perceived as commendable. Although the subject matter of the sentence, i.e., schizophrenia, might be considered negative due to the challenges it presents to those who have this condition and their loved ones, the overall sentiment of the sentence leans towards positive, as it appreciates the film's effectiveness and the techniques employed in portraying this sensitive issue. To conclude, the sentiment of the sentence should be classified as predominantly positive with a touch of neutrality, given the appreciation for the film's style, portrayal, and handling of a sensitive and complex subject like schizophrenia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They divided the universe into 3600 sectors, with one Green Lantern per sector. One such Green Lantern, Abin Sur of Sector 2814, defeated the malevolent being Parallax and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on the desolate planet Ryut. In the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison after becoming strengthened by an encounter with crash survivors on the planet, feeding off of their fear to gain strength before pursuing and nearly killing Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth where he commands his power ring to find a worthy successor. Hal Jordan, a cocky test pilot working at Ferris Aircraft, is chosen by the ring and transported to the crash site, where the dying Abin Sur appoints him a Green Lantern, telling him to take the lantern and speak the oath. At home he says the oath and is later whisked away to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa, where he meets and trains with veteran Corps members Tomar-Re and Kilowog and Corps leader Sinestro, who believes he is unfit and fearful. Jordan quits and returns to Earth, keeping the power ring and lantern. Meanwhile, scientist Hector Hammond is summoned by his strikingly attractive, muscular[3] father, Senator Robert Hammond, to a secret government facility to perform an autopsy on Abin Sur's body, under the watchful eye of Amanda Waller. A piece of Parallax inside the corpse enters Hammond, giving him telepathic and telekinetic powers, at the cost of his sanity. After discovering that he was chosen for the secret work only due to his father's influence, Hammond attempts to kill his father by telekinetically sabotaging his helicopter at a party.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

While many of the Lodge products are made in the USA, these enameled Dutch ovens are made in China. Is the review positive or negative? A:","completion":"The review provided is negative in nature. The reviewer starts off by appreciating the aesthetics of the product, mentioning that it \\"looks fantastic.\\" However, they soon express dissatisfaction with the product's durability, stating that it only \\"works fine for a couple months\\" before the interior enamel begins to flake off. The reviewer emphasizes that they took proper care of the product by hand washing it and not overheating it, but this issue still arose. Furthermore, the reviewer expresses their disappointment by stating that they \\"expected more from Lodge,\\" and they end up discarding the Dutch oven as they do not want to risk chipping a tooth. Their concerns around quality are further exacerbated by noting that this specific product is made in China, in contrast to many other Lodge products that are made in the USA. In summary, while the review initially offers praise for the appearance of the enameled Dutch oven, it ultimately conveys a negative overall experience due to issues with durability, the need to dispose of the product, and the reviewer's unmet expectations based on Lodge's reputation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"The woman on the bus was talking about American Indian Day, which is a special day for American Indian people. She said she was a full-blood princess of a tribe, which means her family comes from that tribe and she has a special role in it. Even though her hair was blonde, which is not common for American Indian people, it seems like it was bleached, so her natural hair color might be different.

Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\\" Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \\"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \\"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\\". As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South.

Inside a viewing party for Fox's Batman prequel NEW YORK CITY — The crisp, clear, comfortable night stands in stark contrast to most days in Gotham, the fictional home of both Bruce Wayne (a.k.a. Batman) and Fox's eponymous TV series, populated by supervillains and heroes in the making. Warner Brothers Studios invited cast and press to a Monday viewing party for the somewhat struggling show's midseason return. Since its launch in fall 2014, Gotham's ratings have tumbled 50%. It now averages just over 4 million viewers a night, despite enjoying a 90% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It’s a moody and often brutal show — bonus points if you ever spot sunlight — that centers not so much on the Caped Crusader, played here by 15-year-old David Mazouz, but on the origins of the endless supply of villains he'll face one day. On this night, the show will introduce Victor Fries, a tragic figure who desperately wants to save his wife’s life by freezing her until he can find a cure for the disease that's killing her. GOTHAM: Guest star Nathan Darrow plays Victor Fries, A.K.A. Mr. Freeze. Image: Â©2016 Fox Broadcasting Co. Cr: Jessica Miglio FOX The cast, crew and more than half a dozen roving journalists are squeezed into a long, covered terrace on a Manhattan hotel rooftop. If you look up through the roof's plastic coveing, you can make out the Empire State Building looming above. Chris Chalk, who plays a much younger Lucius Fox (and Bruce Wayne protector) than Morgan Freeman did in Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, is seated on a porch swing with Jessica Lucas, who plays Tabitha Galavan. They’ve yet to have any scenes together. Nearby, Drew Powell, who plays the hulking menace Butch, is ebullient, hugging cast members and generally playing against type. He tells me that Butch will be coming into his own this season. When I ask him and other cast members if they’re in tonight’s episode, none can quite remember. The cast has already shot the majority of the season; they'll return to work shortly to finish out the last two episodes of the year. We’ve assembled almost two hours before the show airs on the east coast, and Gotham-themed drinks are flowing. Perhaps that’s why nobody panics when no one can figure out how to work the large-screen TV at the front of the room. Gotham cast members, from left to right, Jessica Lucas, Chris Chalk and Sean Pertwee, tweeting during the mid-season premiere. A visibly pregnant Morena Baccarin stands near the TV, which is adjacent to one of the comfy couches she returns to every few minutes or so. Baccarin plays Dr. Leslie Thompkins, girlfriend of Jim Gordon (Ben McKenzie). At the moment, though, she’s enjoying accolades for her role in the hit film Deadpool. We talk a bit about working with Ryan Reynolds and her stunt work. Baccarin especially enjoyed playing a female character who wasn’t just a damsel in distress. She’s extremely gracious, but when I finally ask if she wants to sit down. Baccarin looks relieved. Later, she tells me that if she goes into labor, we'll be in luck — her hospital is nearby. Donal Logue, who plays Gordon’s partner Det. Harvey Bullock, is squeezed into a corner, texting, when I walk up and wish him a happy birthday. The veteran character actor just turned 50. A few feet away stand Ben McKenzie’s publicists, apparently filtering access to the intense actor. Drew Powell (with thumb raised) sits next to Anthony Carrigan (left) who plays villain Victor Zsas. Robin Lorde Taylor is seated on the other side of the room, pale and still sporting Penguin's jet-black hair. As we talk, I realize that, in person, he isn't very menacing. Maybe that's because he's missing Penguin's nose, which the show elongates slightly with a prosthesis for the role. I ask what to expect from his character this season. His answer: “Imagine everything you are being stripped away. What would be left?” Robin Lord Taylor as The Penguin. Image: Â©2016 Fox Broadcasting Co. Cr: Jessica Miglio, FOX The show frequently takes those kinds of turns, defying expectations with a level of violence and gore rarely seen at 8 p.m. on a network. Tonight’s episode features both an inmate who appears to have gouged out his own eyes and a man who disintegrates into a pile of goo. I tell Erin Richards, who plays Barbara Kean, how shocked I was when her character stabbed and murdered both her parents in Season 1. She, like others agrees that Gotham is not your parents’ Batman. When I mention the show's bait-and-switch habit — when, for example, it killed off the kid apparently playing a young Joker — Richards grins slyly. “No one ever dies in Gotham,\\" she says. An enterprising assistant figures out how to connect her laptop to the TV; finally, we’re watching the episode. Penguin is in jail, while Jim Gordon and Logue’s Det. Bullock are investigating a weird bunch of frozen victims. GOTHAM: Guest star BD Wong in the Rise of the Villains Image: Fox Broadcasting Co. Cr: Jessica Miglio, FOX I’m seated behind B.D. Wong, who just joined the show as Dr. Hugo Strange. He's in the midseason premiere, but many cast members here tonight don't not actually appear in the episode — including David Mazouz, seated next to his mother near the back of the room. I’d met Mazouz once before. Tonight, I notice that he’s visibly taller and his voice is breaking. Corey Michael Smith (Edward Nygma) sits next to Camren Bicondova (Selina Kyle). The reserved Smith never left that stool for the duration of the event. We watch as the show continues in its dark, intense way, a gloom pervading the sky and characters. I ask cast members if it’s ever sunny in Gotham. They laugh and tell me no — but remind me that the show was nominated for an Emmy last year for Outstanding Production Design. The episode ends with Victor Fries being dubbed Mr. Freeze and Penguin facing a very uncertain future. There’s a smattering of cheers and applause. Then I make my way back out into the night. Once I'm back at street level, I can't help but look up — scanning the rooftops in vain for the flash of a cape. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments.

Wood was born in Oxford Street, London, the only child of Henry Joseph Wood and his wife Martha, née Morris. Wood senior had started in his family's pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as \\"the musicians' church\\". His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola. Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown. In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren. It is not clear whether he was a member of Manuel Garcia's singing class, but it is certain that he...

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who first commissioned the dredging of a canal, and Silver Springs Creek was narrowed between Big Spring and Elixir Spring, which created Big Spring Lake? Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

Why do mostly Indian Muslims are not accepting that their ancestors were Hindu? Why do Indian Muslims and Christians not accept that their ancestors were Hindu? Do those questions have the same meaning? OPTIONS: [i] no; [ii] yes;","completion":"Before diving into the main questions, it is important to clarify whether the two questions have the same meaning or not. The answer is [i] no. While both questions address the issue of Indian Muslims and Christians not accepting their Hindu ancestry, the first question specifically refers to \\"Indian Muslims,\\" and the second question refers to both \\"Indian Muslims and Christians.\\" Now, let's address each question individually. 1. Why do mostly Indian Muslims not accept that their ancestors were Hindu? The roots of this issue can be traced back to various historical, social, religious, and political factors that have shaped Indian society over the centuries. The following are some possible reasons why Indian Muslims may not accept that their ancestors were Hindu: a. Historical narratives: With the arrival of Islamic invaders and the creation of Muslim empires in India, conversion to Islam became more prevalent over time. These historical narratives often portrayed conversion as a means to escape caste-based discrimination, gain social mobility or to embrace a monotheistic faith. Thus, for some Indian Muslims, accepting their Hindu ancestry might be a challenge due to these historical accounts. b. Identity formation: Over time, religious identity has become deeply ingrained in Indian society. Accepting their Hindu ancestry may lead to a perceived weakening of their religious identity as Muslims, which they might not be willing to consider. c. Social and communal divides: At various points in history, tensions and conflicts between Hindus and Muslims have resulted in deep-rooted social divides. Acknowledging Hindu ancestry can be seen as a threat to the already fragile understanding between the two communities. d. Political factors: India's political history has seen the emergence of parties and organizations with conflicting ideologies. Some Muslim groups may not accept their Hindu ancestry because of their allegiance to certain political ideologies that place emphasis on fostering a strong Muslim identity. 2. Why do Indian Muslims and Christians not accept that their ancestors were Hindu? Similar factors apply to Indian Christians not accepting their Hindu ancestry. We can summarize the reasons as follows: a. Historical narratives: The arrival of European colonial powers and Christian missionaries in India led to the spread of Christianity. Conversion was often seen as a means of adopting modern western values and gaining access to superior education and opportunities. These historical accounts might make it difficult for Indian Christians to accept their Hindu ancestry. b. Identity formation: As mentioned earlier, religious identity plays a significant role in Indian society. For Indian Christians, accepting Hindu ancestry might challenge their religious identity, making it difficult for them to contemplate the connection. c. Social and communal divides: Communal divisions exist not just between Hindus and Muslims but also between Hindus and Christians. By acknowledging their Hindu ancestry, Indian Christians might feel they are compromising their sense of belonging to the Christian community. d. Political factors: As with Indian Muslims, some Indian Christians may hold onto a fixed religious identity due to their alignment with certain political ideologies or parties that promote religious affinity. Both groups may be reluctant to accept their Hindu ancestry for a combination of historical, social, religious, and political reasons. However, it is crucial to emphasize that not all Indian Muslims or Christians adhere to these beliefs or reject their Hindu ancestry. Individuals from both communities have complex and diverse perspectives on their ancestry and religious identity."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Question: what countries are very near to Haiti?

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the character who has a farm in Connecticut?, using the article: David Huxley is a mild-mannered paleontologist. For the past four years, he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone: the \\"intercostal clavicle\\". Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to the dour Alice Swallow and the need to impress Elizabeth Random, who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum. The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance by chance on a golf course when she plays his ball. She is a free-spirited, somewhat scatterbrained young lady unfettered by logic. These qualities soon embroil David in several frustrating incidents. Susan's brother Mark has sent her a tame leopard named Baby from Brazil. Its tameness is helped by hearing \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\". Susan thinks David is a zoologist, and manipulates him into accompanying her in taking Baby to her farm in Connecticut. Complications arise when Susan falls in love with him and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible, even hiding his clothes, to prevent his imminent marriage. David's prized intercostal clavicle is delivered, but Susan's aunt's dog George takes it and buries it somewhere. When Susan's aunt arrives, she discovers David in a negligee. To David's dismay, she turns out to be potential donor Elizabeth Random. A second message from Mark makes clear the leopard is for Elizabeth, as she always wanted one. Baby and George run off. The zoo is called to help capture Baby.

According to the Payson Police Department, the boys were playing in an apartment at 303 S. Ash Street at around noon when they discovered a gun. The 3-year-old shot the 18-month-old in the head. The victim was rushed to Payson Regional Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. The mother and the two children were visiting a 78-year-old friend at his apartment which is in the same complex where they live. They had only been there 10 or 15 minutes when the boys got into another room where they found the gun. Police said, the mother was looking for the boys and just as she walked through the door of that room the 3-year-old boy fired the gun. There were several 911 calls about a child with a head injury. Police questioned witnesses and neighbors and the child's mother to figure out how the children got access to the gun. The semi-automatic gun was not locked up, according to Payson Police Chief Don Engler. \\"We still intend to serve a search warrant at that location and gather further information,\\" said Chief Engler. Police said there were multiple weapons in that apartment and the gun the boys found was not locked up. Investigators are not ruling out the possibility of charges against the mother and her friend.

Article:The engineers were repairing a leaking tank on a Trident submarine while a nearby nuclear reactor was operated. Details of the incident, in February 2012, at the Clyde site emerged after Freedom of Information (FOI) requests by an anti-nuclear group. The Ministry of Defence said no-one was harmed and safety had been improved. MoD reports into several incidents at the Faslane base were obtained using FOI legislation by the campaign group Nuclear Information Service. In the most serious, in August 2012, MoD contractors were repairing a leaking tank on a submarine moored at Faslane, unaware that a nearby nuclear reactor was being operated for prolonged periods. They were reassured about safety, even though their team leader had queried the controls in place. The report said: \\"There was a prolonged and repeated failure of the SS [ship's staff] to understand and control the radiological hazard they were creating.\\" The MoD report has been heavily redacted and does not reveal the level of radiation each worker was exposed to. Other reports obtained by the campaign group reveal: Find out more about Faslane The SNP said the reports raised more questions about safety at the Faslane base. Defence spokesman Brendan O'Hara said: ''The MoD - once again - stands accused of a very poor approach to radiation safety at the Faslane base. \\"When it comes to protecting our armed forces personnel, the contractors working at the base, as well as the wider community, nuclear safety must be paramount. ''These incidents and how they were subsequently handled, pose real and serious questions, not just about nuclear safety procedures at the base - but also whether the regulator, the ONR, is doing enough - and quickly enough - to address these concerns. ''The MoD must investigate and explain why these failings occur and lay out precisely what it is doing to get it sorted.'' The MoD said safety at the base was paramount and none of the events described in the reports caused harm to the health of any member of staff or to any member of the public. A spokesman said: \\"Investigations were carried out and measures put in place to prevent such incidents from occurring again, and we continue to conduct rigorous monitoring as part of our commitment to maintain the highest standards.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"In 2012, some engineers were fixing a leaky tank in a special submarine called a Trident submarine.

Summarize this article in one sentence. People with a cold or the flu can have similar symptoms, such as a runny nose, a sore throat, or a cough. However, you're more likely to be achy and run a fever with the flu, and you're also more likely to have chest discomfort and a headache. Sometimes you may also feel nausea or disorientation. If you've only had your symptoms for a day or two, then Tamiflu, an antiviral drug, can help you get better faster, as well as prevent you from getting the flu if people around you are sick. Since the flu is a virus, it isn't strictly necessary for you to go to the doctor immediately, as the virus will usually run its course without extra help. Nonetheless, if you want to get over the virus more quickly, Tamiflu can reduce the time you're sick as well the severity of the sickness. If someone in your house has the flu but you don’t, you may still get prescribed Tamiflu to avoid getting the virus. Go to the doctor if you have shortness of breath or chest pains or if you can't keep fluids down due to vomiting. Your doctor can help you decide on the best over-the-counter drug options to treat the symptoms. You can also ask your pharmacist for help. If you have complications such as a continuous high fever over 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or chest pains, talk to your doctor.

The reviewer has pointed out that the protagonists in the movie took a full hour to determine the most basic and widely known fact when it comes to killing zombies – shooting them in the head. This observation shows signs of dissatisfaction and disappointment, as the critic perceives the film as lacking a sense of urgency, intelligence, or innovation. Moreover, the critic has chosen to emphasize a relatively trivial detail instead of focusing on other aspects of the film such as plot, character development, visuals, or overall atmosphere. This choice indicates that the critic did not find enough positive attributes or engaging elements in the movie to discuss them in their review, leading to the assumption that they had an unfavorable experience while watching it. In conclusion, the short movie review portrays a negative impression of the film, as the critic points out the unimpressive and mundane aspects of the protagonists' decision-making and does not mention any positive features.

Cos the one that got put down today after i stared at it for a while , looked exactly like my cat but with a black spot on his pink nose . Had the same antisocial behavior like my cat . Why is the narrator unhappy with the management of the place ?","completion":"The narrator is unhappy with the management of the place because of the following reasons: 1. Indifference towards the animals: The management seems to be indifferent towards the animals and treats them as if they are a waste of space. This is evident when they clean out the kennel without any compassion or empathy towards the animals living there. 2. Euthanizing animals: The fact that an animal was put down, specifically one that looked similar to the narrator's cat, makes the narrator feel a sense of unease and dissatisfaction with how the place is managed. The narrator probably believes that the animal could have been given a better chance at life if more effort had been put into finding it a home. 3. Overlooking potential adopters: The narrator's experience suggests that the shelter might not be doing an adequate job of matching animals with potential adopters. The narrator adopted their cat despite its antisocial behavior, yet another, similar animal was euthanized. The manager might not be putting enough effort into finding suitable homes for the animals. In all these steps, the management's insensitivity and perceived inadequacy in handling the animals seem to be the primary reasons behind the narrator's unhappiness with the facility. The narrator likely feels that the animals deserve better care and attention, and that the management could be doing more to improve their chances of finding a loving home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Bees go out during the day and gather food - Then while gathering of their food, they make wax, which is the building block of their bee hive - Bees make food called honey - They use a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis as a binding to hold their hives together - Bees produce all of the building blocks to build their hive in their own body - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are fewer bees happens, how will it affect more honey will be created. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If there are fewer bees, it will have a direct effect on the amount of honey created, as well as indirect effects on the overall process of building the hive and maintaining its structure. 1. Direct effect on honey production: With fewer bees, there will be fewer workers to forage for nectar, which is the main ingredient for honey. This means less nectar will be collected, and subsequently, less honey will be produced. The amount of honey created depends on the size and efficiency of the bee population. 2. Indirect effects on the building and maintenance of the hive: a. Less wax production: With fewer bees, there will be fewer workers to produce wax, which is essential for building the hive structure, including cells for larvae, honey storage, and pollen storage. This may lead to difficulties in expanding the colony and providing enough space for new bees, resources, and brood. b. Difficulty in maintaining hive temperature: A large group of bees is necessary to maintain a constant temperature within the hive, especially during colder months. With fewer bees, it will be more difficult to regulate the temperature, which could affect the survival of the larvae and the health of the entire colony. c. Reduced defense capabilities: Fewer bees mean fewer defenders to protect the hive from predators or invasions by other bees. This could lead to higher mortality rates, loss of resources, or even complete collapse of the hive. d. Negative impact on surrounding ecosystem: Bees are essential pollinators, and a reduction in their population can have negative consequences for plant reproduction and the overall ecological balance of their habitat. This might lead to a decreased availability of nectar and other resources, further affecting honey production and colony health. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of having fewer bees would have profound effects on honey production and the overall health of the hive and surrounding ecosystem. Honey production would be directly affected due to less foraging, along with indirect consequences on the building, maintenance, and defense of the hive, which are essential elements in the bees' lifecycle and survival."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The following plot summary has been simplified and thus does not reflect the exact sequence of the events on screen. Morocco[edit] In a desert in Morocco, Abdullah, a goatherder, buys a .270 Winchester M70 rifle and a box of ammunition from his neighbor Hassan Ibrahim to shoot the jackals that have been preying on his goats. Abdullah gives the rifle to his two young sons, Yussef and Ahmed, and sends them out to tend the herd. Ahmed, the older of the two, criticises Yussef for spying on his sister while she changes her clothes. Doubtful of the rifle's purported three-kilometer range, they decide to test it out, aiming first at rocks, a moving car on a highway below, and then at a bus carrying Western tourists. Yussef's bullet hits the bus, critically wounding Susan Jones (Cate Blanchett), an American woman from San Diego who is traveling with her husband Richard (Brad Pitt) on vacation.[3] The two boys realize what has happened and flee the scene, hiding the rifle in the hills. Glimpses of television news programs reveal that the US government considers the shooting a terrorist act and is pressuring the Moroccan government to apprehend the culprits. Having traced the rifle back to Hassan, the Moroccan police descend on his house and roughly question him and his wife until they reveal that the rifle was given to him by a Japanese man, and then sold to Abdullah.

The three flee from their house, retrieving the rifle as they go. The police corner them on the rocky slope of a hill and open fire.

It is a tradition that has been cherished since ancient times, but as social mobility increases in modern times, the road to family reunions has become very uneasy. It is not the higher travel costs, nor the expected big spending on gifts and other festival items, but the train ticket that has driven many travelers mad.

Some of them have turned to the latest software to aid online booking; others have sought help from friends to increase the possibility of successful booking. No doubt chunyun, the Spring Festival travel season, is the largest-scale annual human migration in the world. Last year, 220 million passengers traveled by train during the Spring Festival season, which usually lasts 40 days. It is a huge jump from 10 years ago, when the number was 128 million. With the big sudden increase in demand, the railway company has increased investment in railway construction; still, it cannot bridge the supply gap, leading to fierce public complaints and criticism. Admittedly, it is almost impossible for the railway company to suddenly improve its capacity to meet the explosive demand during the Spring Festival holiday. Moreover, any temporary increase in capacity would become unnecessary after the holiday and mean great commercial losses during the off season.

The full scale of violence and corruption in Libya since the fall of Colonel Gaddafi has been laid bare in an Amnesty International report accusing the world of 'turning a blind eye' to war crimes. Since the dictator's death in October 2011, the then Western-backed rebel groups have split into two rival camps - one based on hardline Islamist ideology and the other a largely secular faction. Amnesty has now accused both groups of 'running amok' and using armed gangs to torture and murder their rivals, saying the feuding militias have 'committed a wave of abductions targeting civilians based on their origins or perceived political allegiance'. The human rights organisation added that the international community is choosing to ignore the 'chaos engulfing Libya' however, saying the option to punish those responsible for potential crimes against humanity is available to the International Criminal Court, but has simply not been taken up.

He was eventually captured and shot dead by the victorious rebels in 2011. But threat of extreme violence has remained near-constant presence in Libya since the civil war came to an end three years ago, as the once relatively united rebel militias struggle to find common ground on the extent to which religion should play a role in rebuilding the country. The deep ideological divisions have led to both sides committing human rights abuses in the subsequent battle for power, Amnesty International claims in its latest report. Detained: A suspected Islamist militant is arrested by forces loyal to the Libyan regime in Benghazi. A soldier loyal to the Libyan regime fires at Islamists using a machine gun mounted on a pick-up truck. 'Armed groups have tortured - and probably summarily killed - detainees in their custody, and have committed a wave of abductions targeting civilians based on their origins or perceived political allegiance,' the report explains. 'Likewise, satellite images released today by Amnesty show that fighters on all sides in the conflict have displayed an utter disregard for civilian lives, launching indiscriminate rocket and artillery fire into crowded civilian neighbourhoods,' the human rights group added. Amnesty cited specific accounts from Libyans caught up in the conflict - particularly in two cities key to the overthrow of Gaddafi in 2011, Misurata and Zintan. While militia in Misurata are backed by Islamist groups linked to Ansar al-Sharia - the organisation accused of the killing of US ambassador Chris Stevens, fighters in Zintan are allied with the fledling Libyan regime, now based in the city of Tobruk. Fighting: A Libyan regime soldier fires at Islamists in Benghazi yesterday. Only three years ago the groups fought side by side during a civil war that led to the death of dictator Colonel Gaddafi. A soldier loyal to the Libyan regime loads his gun before setting off to fight Islamists in Benghazi. Rebels from Misurata and other Islamist-dominated towns seized Libya's capital Tripoli in August, finally forcing divisions between the rival groups into open warfare. The North African country has had two governments and parliaments since a militia group seized the capital, setting up its own cabinet and assembly. Since then there have been accusations of tit-for-tat kidnappings in the areas around Misurata and Zintan - with detainees from either side saying they have been savagely beaten and tortured. Amnesty says photographs of corpses suggest a number of men taken captive were later murdered by the feuding militia, adding that others remain missing and are presumed dead. Amnesty's report concludes that not enough is being done by the West to bring an end to the violence, adding that the option to punish those responsible for potential crimes against humanity is available to the International Criminal Court, but has simply not been taken up. 'The international community has largely turned a blind eye to the chaos engulfing Libya since the 2011 uprising,' the report claims. A Foreign Office spokesman told the Telegraph that Britain remains committed to playing its part in Libya, and is helping to negotiate an 'essential' political settlement between the rival groups. Libya has had two governments and parliaments since an Islamist militia group seized the capital, Tripoli, setting up its own cabinet and assembly. Pictured is Benghazi during clashes yesterday. Western powers worry that the Libya is heading towards another civil war as authorities are too weak to control Islamists defying the state's authority in order to grab power and a share of oil revenues. This morning Libya's internationally-recognised Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni said he was ready for peace talks with Islamist groups controlling Tripoli,as fresh fighting in Benghazi killed 20 people. Thinni set one condition for talks with his rivals, however. 'We open the doors of dialogue with our brothers on the condition that there be concessions from all sides,' he told reporters in Khartoum at the end of a three-day visit to Sudan. His comments were more conciliatory than recent statements when he had vowed to liberate Tripoli militarily, a plan analysts say is unrealistic as the weak government forces are no match for better-equipped rebels. Western powers worry that the Libya is heading towards another civil war as authorities are too weak to control Islamists defying the state's authority in order to grab power and a share of oil revenues. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1. An Amnesty International report accuses the global community of ignoring violent conflicts and corruption in Libya post the fall of Colonel Gaddafi, and alleges that potential war crimes are being passed over by the International Criminal Court. 2. The death of Gaddafi in October 2011 led to a split of the once-unified rebel groups into two rival factions - one with hardline Islamist ideology and the other mostly secular. Both factions have been accused by Amnesty of using armed gangs to commit atrocities against their rivals. 3. Amnesty International's report cites continued extreme violence in Libya, along with the struggle of rebel militias in finding a consensus on the role of religion in the country's rebuilding. 4. The report details evidence of human rights abuses committed by both sides in their bid for power, including abductions based on origins or perceived political alliance, and the indiscriminate launching of rocket and artillery fire into civilian locales. 5. Two cities, Misurata and Zintan, that were key to Gaddafi's overthrow, have been highlighted for their role in the conflict. In Misurata, the militia is backed by Islamist groups linked to Ansar al-Sharia, while in Zintan, fighters are allied with the fledgling Libyan regime now based in Tobruk. 6. Libya has had two governments and parliaments since a militia group seized the capital and set up its own administration and assembly further fueling the violence and division. 7. The report concludes that the international community, and the West in particular, is not doing enough to quell the violence in Libya. It suggests that the International Criminal Court has the ability to step in and punish those responsible for possible crimes against humanity, but has not acted. 8. There is increasing concern among Western powers that Libya may descend into civil war due to the inability of authorities to control Islamist factions looking to seize power and a share of oil revenues. 9. The internationally recognized Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni has stated a readiness for peace talks with Islamist groups controlling Tripoli, however, this readiness comes with conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sentence 1: Information wanting to be free doesn't seem so appealing when it includes details about all your own flesh and frailties--credit history, shopping habits, records of where you've been, what you asked for, and what you took. Sentence 2: Free information does not seem welcomed when it contains your own personal data. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence can be considered true if we assume the first sentence is true. Let's break down the reasoning behind this answer. The first sentence suggests that the concept of \\"information wanting to be free\\" could become less appealing when it involves sharing personal details. These personal details include credit history, shopping habits, records of your whereabouts, and other potentially sensitive information. We can infer that the speaker in this sentence values their privacy and might feel less comfortable with the notion of free information if it means that their personal data will be exposed to others. On the other hand, the idea of \\"information wanting to be free\\" generally promotes transparency and openness, making it more difficult for individuals to keep their personal information hidden. The second sentence is essentially a reworded and more concise version of the first sentence. It emphasizes that free information might not be as welcomed when it contains a person's own personal data. This statement is in line with the concerns expressed in the first sentence regarding the potential consequences of the free flow of information. Both sentences share the same underlying idea that the appeal of free information is diminished when it includes personal and potentially sensitive information about an individual. Therefore, if we consider the first sentence to be true, we can also consider the second sentence to be true, as they essentially convey the same sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: In which English county could you visit the 'Museum of Witchcraft', the 'Barbara Hepworth Museum' and the 'King Edward Mining Museum'? Answer:","completion":"The English county where you can visit the 'Museum of Witchcraft', the 'Barbara Hepworth Museum' and the 'King Edward Mining Museum' is Cornwall. Cornwall is an idyllic county located in the far west of Great Britain, known for its scenic coastlines and rich cultural heritage. Visitors flock to this region to bask in its natural beauty, enjoy its vibrant arts scene, and delve into the area's historical and mythological past. Three of the unique attractions that stand out in Cornwall are the 'Museum of Witchcraft', the 'Barbara Hepworth Museum' and the 'King Edward Mining Museum'. Nestled in the village of Boscastle, the Museum of Witchcraft and Magic is one of the most intriguing cultural hotspots of Cornwall. Opened in 1961 by Cecil Williamson, the museum houses an extensive collection of witchcraft-related artifacts and memorabilia. Displaying items like magical objects, photographs, and documents relating to witchcraft, this museum offers a fascinating insight into the world of magic, paganism, and Wicca. On the other hand, the Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden in St Ives transports visitors into the creative world of one of Britain's most important 20th-century artists. Established by Hepworth herself before her death in 1975, her workspace was transformed into a museum displaying a range of her sculptures and paintings. The adjoining garden, where sculpture displays are set amidst plants and trees, enhances the dramatic effect of the artist's work. Located in the area famously known as the Cornish Mining World Heritage Site, the King Edward Mine Museum gives the visitors a glimpse into Cornwall's rich mining history. King Edward Mine originally started as a training facility for students at Camborne School of Mines. The museum showcases extraction methods and technologies used in the past. With several original buildings and machinery, the museum provides a comprehensive understanding of the region’s mining industry. Therefore, a visit to these three museums in Cornwall is like taking a journey through time - from understanding the ancient craft practiced in secret, appreciating the creativity of a renowned artist, to getting a clear picture of an industry that once formed the backbone of the region. This is indeed a testament to the vibrant and diverse cultural heritage of Cornwall, making it a perfect destination for explorers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The health-care economy is filled with unusual and even unique economic relationships. One of the least understood involves the peculiar roles of producer or \\"provider\\" and purchaser or \\"consumer\\" in the typical doctor-patient relationship. In most sectors of the economy, it is the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various appealing factors of price, quality, and use, and it is the buyer who makes the decision. Such condition, however, is not common in most of the health-care industry. In the health-care industry, the doctor-patient relationship is the mirror image of the ordinary relationship between producer and consumer. Once an individual has chosen to see a physician -- and even then there may be no real choice -- it is the physician who usually makes all significant purchasing decisions: whether the patient should return \\"next Wednesday\\", whether X-rays are needed, whether drugs should be prescribed, etc. It is rare that a patient will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance questions about price, especially when the disease is regarded as serious. This is particularly significant in relation to hospital care. The physician must certify the need for hospitalization, determine what procedures will be performed, and announce when the patient may be discharged. The patient may be consulted about some of the decisions, but in general it is the doctor's judgments that are final. Little wonder then that in the eye of the hospital it is the physician who is the real \\"consumer\\". As a consequence, the medical staff represents the \\"power center\\" in hospital policy and decision-making, not the administration. Although usually there are in this situation four identifiable participants-- the physician, the hospital, the patient, and the payer (generally an insurance carrier or government)-- the physician makes the essential decisions for all of them. The hospital becomes an extension of the physician; the payer generally meets most of the bills generated by the... Question: The author is most probably leading up to _ .

The News on Gary Johnson's Heart Surgery Gary Johnson is a well-respected figure in the world of football, having managed several clubs in his career, including Yeovil Town, Bristol City, and Peterborough United. Appointed as Cheltenham Town manager in 2015, he has played a significant role in the club's successes. Recently, the need for Johnson to undergo heart surgery has been announced by the club, and fans have been quick to rally behind their manager, sending him messages of support and encouragement. Johnson's heart surgery is described as \\"straightforward,\\" which indicates that there are no complications expected during the procedure. However, the club has confirmed that their manager will require a few weeks away from his duties to recover. The necessity of heart surgery is never an easy decision, but the club is fully supportive of Johnson taking the time he needs to ensure a complete and successful recovery. The Implications for Cheltenham Town Gary Johnson's temporary absence from his position as Cheltenham Town manager will undoubtedly have some impact on the team's performances during the few weeks it takes for him to recover. However, it is essential to recognize that the manager's health is of paramount importance and that the whole Cheltenham community is behind Johnson during this crucial time.

She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Soon the pots came to boil. In the first she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and in the last she placed coffee beans. She let them sit and boil, without saying a word. In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out, pulled the eggs out and then poured the coffee into three different bowls. Turning to her daughter, she asked, \\"Tell me what you see.\\" \\"Carrots, eggs, and coffee,\\" she replied. Her mother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She noted that they were soft. The mother then asked the daughter to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard boiled egg. Finally, the daughter was asked to drink the coffee. She smiled as she tasted its rich fragrance. The daughter then asked, \\"What does it mean, mother?\\" Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same disaster but reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, and hard.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century. Question: \\"What year was Japan founded\\" Answer: \\"660 BC\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct.

Use evidence from the fact that cows only eat plants to answer this question: \\"Herbivores like to dine on\\"","completion":"Herbivores like to dine on plant-based materials. The term 'herbivore' refers to any creature that subsists on a plant-based diet, with 'herb' signifying 'plant' and 'vore' meaning 'to eat.' Herbivorous creatures fall into two major categories: frugivores, who eat mostly fruit, and folivores, who consume predominantly leaves. Some herbivores also eat seeds, roots, and bark. For proof of this claim, consider the dietary habits of cows, known herbivores. Evidence-based research has indicated that cows are definitive herbivores with strong preferences for grasses. However, they are adaptable and can also survive on other types of plant materials. Let's go deeper into their dietary habits. Cows are ruminant animals, meaning that they have a uniquely specialized digestive system that allows for the successful digestion of plant materials, specifically grasses and legumes. Ruminants are characterized by their four-chambered stomach, which includes the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. When a cow eats, it partially chews the food just enough to mix it with its saliva which is then swallowed and stored in the rumen, the first section of the cow's four-chambered stomach. The rumen can hold an astonishing 50 gallons of plant material. Once stored in the rumen, microorganisms (including bacteria, fungi, and protozoa) help to break down cellulose, a primary component of plant cell walls, which is indigestible to many animals. This compartment also allows for fermentation, which releases nutrients called volatile fatty acids, which the cow uses for energy. The process doesn't end there. The cow then regurgitates this 'cud' back into its mouth, chews it again, and swallows it for the second time. Upon the second swallowing, the food moves to the other three sections of the stomach (reticulum, omasum, and abomasum), where further digestion occurs with the aid of enzymes. The anatomy and physiology of a cow's digestive system is a clear form of evolutionary adaptation to an herbivorous diet. This capacity to process and breakdown plant matter, particularly that which is high in cellulose, is what makes cows such successful herbivores. In addition to grasses, cows also consume legumes like clover and alfalfa, given their higher protein content. They may also eat other plant materials, such as leaves, stems, grains, and even bark during difficult times. This range of plant-based diet is another indication of their nature as herbivores. In conclusion, herbivores such as cows like to dine on plants, which is demonstrated by their physiological adaptations, including highly specialized teeth for grinding plant matter, a multi-chambered stomach for fermenting and digesting cellulose, and a large intestine capable of extracting remaining nutrients from plant-based materials. From grass and legumes to various types of plant material in more challenging periods, the evidence-based diet of cows supports the conclusion that herbivores feast predominantly on plants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: Which Shakespeare play of 1591 opens with the funeral of King Henry V?","completion":"The Shakespeare play that opens with the funeral of King Henry V is \\"Henry VI, Part 1.\\" Written around 1591, this historical play is the first in the series of three plays chronicling the life, challenges, and reign of King Henry VI of England. Henry VI, Part 1 begins with the funeral ceremony of King Henry V, held at Westminster Abbey. At the ceremony, the attendees mourn the untimely death of the great and united King Henry V. The nobles present express their concern and regret for the vulnerable state of England due to the young age of the new king, Henry VI, who is just an infant when he inherits the throne. The combination of a young king and internal strife leads to political instability, setting the stage for the events that unfold during the play. Henry VI, Part 1 falls into the broader War of the Roses narrative, which encompasses four of Shakespeare's historical plays, including \\"Richard II,\\" \\"Henry IV, Part 1,\\" \\"Henry IV, Part 2,\\" and \\"Henry V.\\" The War of the Roses was a series of civil wars fought in England between the Houses of Lancaster and York for the throne during the 15th century. The play depicts the beginning of these conflicts and follows Henry VI's rule during England's loss of territories in France, as well as the power struggles and rivalry between the English nobility that weaken the nation. Throughout the play, we witness the rise of several prominent characters, including Joan la Pucelle (Joan of Arc), who leads the French resistance against the English invaders. The play portrays Joan of Arc as a witch and a heretic, which was loaded with political undertones and reflective of British sentiment towards France at the time. Additionally, we see the internal fight for power between the English factions - the House of York represented by the white rose and the House of Lancaster represented by the red rose. Another crucial aspect of \\"Henry VI, Part 1\\" is Henry VI's character development. The play exposes the idealism and weakness of the young king, whose inexperience led him to depend on the advice of his more seasoned council members. Henry VI's inability to effectively govern and his eventual marriage to the cunning, manipulative Margaret of Anjou sets the stage for the events in the subsequent parts the \\"Henry VI\\" trilogy, as well as the downfall of the House of Lancaster. In conclusion, \\"Henry VI, Part 1\\" is a Shakespeare play, written around 1591, which opens with the funeral of King Henry V. The play dives into the political machinations and the beginning of the War of the Roses, centered around the rule of the young and inexperienced King Henry VI. It weaves together historical events and political commentary, shedding light on the turbulent times in England and the complex personalities that shaped the nation's history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Meet the Guardians of the Galaxy In the last several years, moviegoers have grown accustomed to seeing Marvel characters pull off one superheroic feat after another. Iron Man swoops in to rescue 13 hapless souls plummeting to their doom after a fall from Air Force One. High-flying Captain America skips the parachute as he foils insidious plans for a Helicarrier fleet to decimate the planet’s population. Iron Man, Cap, Thor, and the rest of the Avengers band together to save New York from being annihilated by invading alien hordes. But in the cosmic action romp “Guardians of the Galaxy,” opening Friday, another group of Marvel heroes is vying to record the greatest feat of all: making a blockbuster draw out of a property that’s had a limited profile even among comics fans. Before Marvel’s current run of self-produced screen successes, you’d hear industry speculation that, say, “Iron Man” might struggle because the character wasn’t known to audiences, and lacked the iconic heft of Batman or Spider-Man. Which was a stretch, of course — Iron Man was a name that registered with the mainstream on some level, even if somewhat confusedly, thanks to triathlons and the old Black Sabbath tune. Jay Maidment (c) Marvel 2014 “Guardians,” by contrast, is genuinely unfamiliar, the unlikeliest Marvel property to get a big-screen push since “Blade,” in the late ’90s. Back then, Marvel was a bankruptcy-bailout case aspiring to get into the movie game. Now the company is a Disney-owned powerhouse willing to gamble that its brand trumps its secondary characters’ visibility, or lack thereof. “Guardians” is headlined by Chris Pratt (“Parks and Recreation), as Peter Quill, a.k.a. Star-Lord, a spacefaring thief-turned-good guy with Earth roots and more than a touch of Han Solo roguishness. Aside from maybe “Moneyball,” in which Pratt played Red Sox castoff and A’s reclamation project Scott Hatteberg, he’s never had a gig this unexpected — as befits the movie, really. (Next up: the franchise relaunch “Jurassic World,” due in 2015.) Star-Lord’s scruffy compadres include green-skinned assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana, swapping her blue “Avatar” avatar for a Margaret Hamilton makeover); brawny, butt-kicking Drax the Destroyer (WWE vet Dave Bautista); and CG creations Rocket, a wisecracking, gun-toting raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper, and Groot, an anthropomorphic, monosyllabic tree voiced by Vin Diesel. Never heard of this bunch of self-proclaimed Guardians? Neither had comics readers until just a few years ago. The Guardians of the Galaxy were first introduced by Marvel in 1969, but in a completely different incarnation, one which spent as much time as a guest-starring sidelight as it did in the spotlight. Geeks of a certain age will recall that the group even got loosely folded into the “Avengers” comics for a time. Then, in 2008, Marvel creators repurposed the Guardians moniker, slapping it onto a collection of editorially discarded characters like Star-Lord. They would lend the entire enterprise an increasingly freewheeling tone, the sort you could get away with when you weren’t dealing with Spider-Man and other characters of corporate significance. And why not? Even the name Peter Quill was originally a bit of subversive slang for, um, jerk, as Sean Howe, author of “Marvel Comics: The Untold Story,” notes in an entertaining “Guardians” primer on Vulture.com. The reconceived team was a good fit for a couple of items highlighted on Marvel’s creative checklist. Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has spoken passionately about how much the company had wanted to do a big, cosmic epic. Fans were already primed for space action by an “Avengers” end-credits teaser featuring intergalactic baddie Thanos. (The character doesn’t figure into next year’s “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” but he’s a presence in “Guardians,” and Josh Brolin, who tackles the role, has a multi-picture deal with Marvel. Stay tuned for “Avengers 3.”) Film Frame (c) Marvel 2014 Glenn Close as Nova Prime. Along with changing up its movie backdrops a bit, Marvel seems intent on trying some tonal change-ups — specifically, by dabbling in action-comedy. Yes, “Iron Man” has Robert Downey Jr., but that’s more like an improv cherry on the franchise’s action sundae. “Guardians” feels shaggier, starting with trailers that sample Blue Swede’s “Hooked on a Feeling” and poke fun at that low profile. (Pratt to funky alien Djimon Hounsou: “[I’m] Star-Lord.” Hounsou: “Who?”) The film is directed and co-written by James Gunn, a fanboy pro whose credits include genre spoofs “Super” and “The Specials.” And as Marvel follows up “Avengers 2” with what it bills as Phase Three of its film slate, we’ll also be seeing Paul Rudd in, yep, “Ant-Man.” That one is being directed by comedy vet Peyton Reed, who signed on after Edgar Wright dropped out. One rationale for Pratt’s casting reportedly was the prospect that the Guardians and the Avengers could one day meet onscreen. You never know — Tony Stark already hangs with Star-Lord’s crew in the comics. “If . . . this actor is talking to Robert Downey Jr.,” Gunn recently told Entertainment Weekly, “I wanted him to give as good as he got.” By that point, maybe the exchange won’t even have to open with, “Who?” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The Guardians of the Galaxy are a group of superhero characters from the Marvel series of comic books and movies. They consist of Star-Lord, a space thief-turned-hero, Gamora, a green-skinned assassin, Drax the Destroyer, a strong fighter, Rocket, a talking raccoon, and Groot, a talking tree."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: While there are some general signs used to identify gender dysphoria, it's not cut-and-dry, and everyone experiences it differently. Some people identify their true gender in early childhood, whereas others don't recognize it until puberty or adulthood. Some people experience severe and distressing dysphoria, while others experience it minimally or not at all. There's no one \\"right\\" way for someone to experience dysphoria, so gender dysphoria can be difficult to identify, and it may take time to figure it out. Gender dysphoria can exist in anyone who's not cisgender, including nonbinary people. If you're trying to determine whether you're experiencing gender dysphoria, you may find it beneficial to look at forums and social media sites for transgender and nonbinary people, read various people's experiences to see if you relate to them, and read articles such as How to Know if You Are Transgender. . It's not unusual for children to experiment with gender, such as by wanting to be called by another name during play. However, if a child consistently asserts that they are a gender other than the one they were assigned, or resists behavior or presentation associated with the gender they don't identify with, they may have gender dysphoria. Signs of gender dysphoria or gender variance in a child include: A repeated desire to be the other sex or an assertion that they are the other sex A belief that their assigned sex will change on its own (e.g. thinking they'll grow a penis or that their penis will come off when they get older) Wanting to change their name to a name typically associated with another gender, or a gender-neutral name A preference for presenting as another gender (e.g. a child assigned male at birth who prefers long hair and wearing dresses, or a child assigned female at birth who prefers short hair and wearing gender-neutral clothing) Resistance or distress when made to present as a gender they don't identify with (such as a \\"girl\\" throwing a tantrum over having to wear a dress or a \\"boy\\" crying after having to get a haircut) Assuming the role of another gender in fantasy games or make-believe An intense desire to participate in the games and activities typical of another gender (such as an assigned-male child playing with Barbie and an assigned-female child playing contact sports) A preference for playmates of another gender Gender dysphoria often becomes more apparent during puberty, since hormonal changes and physical changes are occurring, and a preteen or teen who previously didn't question their gender identity may suddenly feel confused or distressed about the changes. Signs of gender dysphoria in adolescence include: Feelings of panic or severe discomfort concerning puberty and bodily changes (e.g. refusing to acknowledge or admit changes are occurring, refusing to look at their body, or becoming distressed or uncomfortable with body development, menstruation, or ejaculation) Discomfort or distress with certain forms of gender presentation, such as disliking long hair or certain types of clothing Increased bullying at school due to differences in acting out one’s perceived gender or lack of self-confidence Isolation from peers due to lack of connection or fear of bullying Depression and/or anxiety as a result of confusion over gender identity or not fitting in with peers Be aware that some adolescents may try to repress their true gender due to outside pressure, such as from family and peers, even if they previously expressed their true gender as a child. Often, gender dysphoria remains hidden or unrecognized until adulthood due to the learned gender behaviors that are taught to both children and adolescents by their family and peers. Some signs of gender dysphoria in adults include: A difference between the sex at birth and the gender the individual expresses or experiences Consistently identifying with a gender other than the one matching the sex they were assigned (for an official diagnosis of gender dysphoria, this must have been ongoing for at least six months) Constant daydreaming or \\"what if...\\" thoughts about being another gender Wanting to be treated as another gender, or disliking being treated as the gender others perceive them as (e.g. being uncomfortable when addressed as \\"sir\\" or \\"ma'am\\") Wanting to remove, alter, or hide their sex characteristics (however, this is not present in all transgender or nonbinary people) The individual may feel that they act in ways typical of another gender. If gender dysphoria has been deeply repressed or buried, it may have resulted in mental health problems. Take note of any history of anxiety or depression, self-injurious behavior, or substance abuse, and whether these problems lessen or even disappear when they present as their true gender; these can be subtle indicators of dysphoria. Gender dysphoria can be difficult to identify, and some people don't experience it; however, many transgender or nonbinary people experience gender euphoria, which is described as positive feelings when their true gender is affirmed and validated. Even if the person doesn't feel their assigned sex is wrong, they may feel that presenting as a different gender is right, instead. Some signs of gender euphoria are: Feeling happy or excited when addressed as their true gender Feeling relieved after identifying their gender Joy or excitement when presenting in a way that aligns with their gender (e.g. wearing a bra or cutting their hair short) A feeling of peace with their body when transitioning socially or medically","completion":"The article discusses the varying experiences of gender dysphoria among individuals, along with signs and indicators in children, adolescents, and adults, emphasizing the importance of understanding and validating one's true gender identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Run some water from your sink into the bucket, leaving 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of space at the top to make the bucket easier to carry without sloshing. It’s best to use warm or lukewarm water, as it will be closer in temperature to the water that was already in the tank previously. Use whatever water source is closest to your aquarium to cut down on the distance you’ll have to tote the bucket back and forth. You may need to fill the bucket multiple times if you’re replacing the water in a particularly large tank. Refer to bottle of the product you choose for more detailed directions. Most of the time, it will only take 1-2 drops per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to successfully chlorine, chloramine, ammonia, nitrite, and other chemicals and impurities. If left untreated, the chemicals in tap water could wipe out whole colonies of good bacteria, or even harm your goldfish itself. Carefully lift the bucket over the edge of the tank and tilt it so that it flows in little by little. When refilling a large tank, wait 5-10 minutes before adding every next bucket to give the water time to reach a consistent temperature. Continue until you’ve replenished the water to its original level. If you’ve got a thermometer in your tank, look for it to reach a minimum of 60 °F (16 °C) before adding more water. Goldfish are most comfortable at around 65–72 °F (18–22 °C). Unless the water is near room temperature, it may be too cold or too warm for your goldfish. Raising or lowering the temperature in the tank drastically could \\"shock\\" your goldfish, leaving it vulnerable to disease. Now that your aquarium is clean, all that’s left to do is reactivate the filter, heater, and air pump. If possible, let everything run for about 20 minutes to bring the water temperature and oxygen back to their optimal levels. Afterwards, return your goldfish to the tank and welcome it home with a snack! Remember to plug your goldfish tank back into the nearest wall outlet. Summary:","completion":"When replacing water in an aquarium, fill a bucket with lukewarm water from the nearest water source, leaving some space at the top for easier carrying.

Article: A few years ago, in one experiment in behavioural psychology, Stanley Milgram of Yale University tested 40 subjects for their willingness to obey instructions given by a \\"leader\\" in a situation in which the subjects might feel a personal dislike of the actions they were called upon to perform. Specifically, Milgram told each volunteer \\"teacher-subject\\" that the experiment was in the noble cause of education, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes would have a positive effect on the pupils' ability to learn. The teacher-subjects were placed before a panel of thirty switches with labels ranging from \\"15 volts of electricity (slight shock)\\" to \\"450 volts (danger -- severe shock)\\" in steps of 15 volts each. The teacher-subject was told that whenever the pupil gave the wrong answer to a question, a shock was to be administered. The supposed \\"pupil\\" was in reality an actor hired by Milgram to pretend to receive the shocks by giving out cries and screams. Milgram told the teacher-subject to ignore the reactions of the pupil, and to administer whatever level of shock was called for. As the experiment unfolded, the \\"pupil\\" would deliberately give the wrong answers to questions, thereby bringing on various electrical punishments, even up to the danger level of 300 volts and beyond. Many of the teacher-subjects _ administering the higher levels of punishment, and turned to Milgram. In these situations, Milgram calmly explained that the teacher-subject was to carry on with the experiment and that it was important for the sake of the experiment that the procedure be followed through to the end. What Milgram was trying to discover was the number of teacher-subjects who would be willing to administer the highest levels of shock, even in the face of strong personal and moral revulsion against the rules and conditions of the experiment. Before carrying out the experiment, Milgram explained his idea to a group of 39 psychiatrists and asked them to predict the average percentage of people... Question: Why did Milgram do the experiment? - To discover people's willingness for orders from leaders. - To display the power of punishment on ability to learn. - To test people's willingness to sacrifice for science. - To explore the biological basis of social behavior. Answer:","completion":"Stanley Milgram conducted the experiment to discover people's willingness to obey orders from leaders, even when they personally disagreed with the actions they were asked to perform.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: a bloody sheet for the following movie plot: Jack Slavin (Daniel Day-Lewis), a Scottish farmer with a heart ailment, lives on an island which had been a hippie commune decades before. He is struggling to keep landowners from building developments on the wetland. His teenaged daughter Rose (Camilla Belle) is a beautiful but isolated girl with a passion for gardening. Since Rose's mother had left the family, Jack homeschooled his daughter and did not expose her to life beyond their small island home. Jack believes that they both \\"need a woman around.\\" He travels to the mainland to ask his girlfriend Kathleen (Catherine Keener) to move in with him. Jack breaks the news to a shocked Rose, from whom he had kept his relationship a secret. Rose remains disdainful when Kathleen and her two teenage sons move in. Kathleen struggles to adapt to the Slavin's rural lifestyle. Her sons Rodney (Ryan McDonald) and Thaddius (Paul Dano) are almost polar opposites; Thaddius is a sullen, rude delinquent, while Rodney is insecure and often overlooked. While she still has a strained relationship with Kathleen, Rose develops strange bonds with her new \\"step-brothers.\\" It is clear that Thaddius is attracted to her, but Rose does not like him. One night, Rose spies on Jack and Kathleen in bed together, and develops a strange jealousy toward Kathleen. Rose decides to lose her virginity, and shocks Rodney by confronting him topless and asking him for sex. Rodney refuses and reasons with her, and instead ends up giving her a dramatic haircut. Afterward, Rose calmly takes her father's shotgun and possibly misfires it into Jack and Kathleen's bedroom as they sleep. An initially shocked Jack confronts Rose in disbelief, but the two seem to forget the event within minutes. Kathleen asks Jack about his relationship with Rose, and how she might have psychological problems that should be dealt with. Jack denies that his daughter has any problems. Meanwhile, Rose and Rodney become good friends. Rodney is often criticized by his mother for being overweight, and the two fight constantly...

Solution:","completion":"در حقیقت، ما نمی دانیم که این فرضیه درست است یا خیر، زیرا هیچ‌گاه تکنولوژی های قدرتمند کافی برای آزمودن آن نداشته ایم. Step 1: Identify the sentence's structure and main components in Portuguese. The sentence structure is fairly simple: \\"Na realidade, não sabemos se está hipótese está correcta, devido ao facto de nunca termos tido tecnologias poderosas o suficiente para testá-la.\\" Step 2: Translate individual components of the sentence into Farsi. Na realidade = در حقیقت não sabemos = ما نمی‌دانیم se = که está hipótese = این فرضیه está correcta = درست است devido ao facto de = زیرا nunca = هیچ‌گاه termos tido = داشته‌ایم tecnologias poderosas = تکنولوژی‌های قدرتمند o suficiente = کافی para testá-la = برای آزمودن آن Step 3: Assemble the translated components into a coherent Farsi sentence. Now that we have translated each component, we need to form a complete Farsi sentence by respecting the appropriate syntax and grammar. در حقیقت، ما نمی‌دانیم (Na realidade, não sabemos) که (se) این فرضیه (está hipótese) درست است (está correcta) یا خیر، زیرا (devido ao facto de) هیچ‌گاه (nunca) تکنولوژی های قدرتمند (tecnologias poderosas) کافی (o suficiente) برای آزمودن آن (para testá-la) نداشته‌ایم (termos tido).

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Despite its rather salacious title, this is a light teen dramedy. Unless you're an old coot, you'll probably find it likeable. It isn't so good on developing characters or situations smoothly, though. When you view it, you get the feeling that you've been running back and forth to the kitchen even if you've been sitting down watching the whole time. This is one of those films that counts a great deal on your liking the characters, and they are appealing enough. Jennifer Connelly is the heartthrob of many, I know, but I've always liked the more obscure Maddie Corman.

Pick your answer from: 1). negative 2). positive","completion":"The correct sentiment for the given movie review is 2). positive. Justifying the steps: 1. Read the review carefully to understand the emotions and sentiments expressed by the reviewer. 2. Noted that the review starts off with a sort of neutral tone: Despite the title, the reviewer considers it a light teen dramedy, suggesting it doesn't take itself too seriously and isn't overly dramatic. 3. The reviewer points out a few flaws (\\"It isn't so good on developing characters or situations smoothly\\"), which gives a slight negative sentiment. 4. The reviewer then mentions a slightly disoriented feeling when viewing the movie, giving a sense of negative sentiment. But this is immediately followed by the statement that the movie \\"counts a great deal on your liking the characters, and they are appealing enough\\", tipping the sentiment back towards positive. 5. Near the end, the reviewer shows preference for some characters, mentioning that they've liked them, and comments on the young cast getting screen time. This leans the sentiment towards positive too. 6. Overall, even with some criticisms, the review shows a somewhat favorable view of the movie primarily due to the likable characters, enough to be classified as a positive sentiment. The criticisms read more like neutral observations rather than strong disapproval, and they're outweighed by the positive statements. Given the above, the correct sentiment of this review is positive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Please answer the following question: This article: Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the region that supports supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp industry?, what is it ? A:","completion":"The name of the region that supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry is not explicitly mentioned in the given article.

Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Mike Dawes. Reece Lyne's late try made the difference as Wakefield Trinity Wildcats stunned defending First Utility Super League champions Wigan to record their first win over the Warriors since 2009. A youthful Wigan side without the likes of Sean O'Loughlin, John Bateman and Matty Bowen played their part in an excellent match but ultimately fell to a 36-28 defeat. Wakefield edged an entertaining first half which swung one way then the other thanks to tries from Danny Kirmond, Tim Smith, Richard Owen and Richard Moore. Jack Hughes, Liam Farrell and Anthony Gelling crossed during a purple patch for Wigan, who had the first word in the second period as Farrell went over again. Paul Sykes made it five from five with the boot to give the Wildcats the lead but it was short-lived, Dan Sarginson putting Wigan back in the box seat. Purple patch: Jack Hughes bursts away from the defence to score during a spell of Wigan dominance. Danny Washbrook's try moved Wakefield back ahead and Lyne went over four minutes from time to claim the win and knock Wigan off top spot. Warriors hooker George Williams went closest to breaking the deadlock after a tight opening 15 minutes when he was adjudged to have knocked the ball on reaching for the line. It was Wakefield who took the lead as Kirmond took a short ball from Tim Smith close to the Warriors line and crashed over. The Wildcats were almost in again from the restart but Chris Riley was unable to hold onto the ball after a break by Lyne. Riley's error proved costly as Hughes took a flat pass from Matty Smith and showed a good turn of pace to beat Richard Mathers to the line. Wigan were in again from the restart courtesy of Liam Farrell's try on the back of a surging run by Jack Murphy, who was making his first appearance of the season. It looked as if the writing was on the wall for Wakefield when Gelling showed good athleticism to collect Matty Smith's high kick and touch down. Wigan-bound Taulima Tautai was on receiving end of a dangerous tackle by Liam Farrell in an incident which saw the Warriors forward put on report and Wakefield took full advantage as Tim Smith jinked his way over. The hosts were back on level terms when Skyes converted after Owen finished from 40 metres out following a bit of magic by Pita Godinet. Wakefield had the momentum and they retook the lead on the stroke of half-time when Moore crashed onto Godinet's pass from dummy half to power over. Tautai was denied a try at the start of the second half after referee George Stokes penalised the Wildcats for obstruction and they were quickly on the back foot, Liam Farrell crossing for his second try after half-backs Matty Smith and Sam Powell combined. A Sykes penalty edged Wakefield ahead with just over a quarter of the game to go but Wigan were back in front when Sarginson showed good footwork to score. Matty Smith's missed conversion ensured Wakefield had only a two-point deficit, which was wiped out thanks to Washbrook's close-range effort. Sykes missed a straightforward conversion before Murphy had a try ruled out for a forward pass. Wakefield decided against going for goal after a high tackle by Matty Smith and that decision was vindicated as Lyne finished on the back of a good offload by Sykes, who converted to seal a famous win. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"In this article, the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats win a very exciting game against the Wigan Warriors. The match had many exciting moments and lots of tries scored by both teams, but in the end, the Wakefield Wildcats won with a score of 36-28. This is their first win against the Warriors since 2009.

He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age.

Last, Last, Last Minute Tech Christmas Gifts It's never too late to get your Christmas shopping done. You just have to know a few tricks to procure the right procrastinator's presents. Here are a few really last-minute suggestions. Those who think e-mailed greeting cards are tacky and impersonal certainly aren't going to like the latest twist in holiday cheer, text messages with graphics. Initially intended to spice up mundane ASCII text emoticons with goofy graphics, messaging company Zlango is taking advantage of the silly season to offer Santa and Christmas themed mini digital cards. The texts plus graphics have fun or flirty icons and are sent directly to the recipient's phone. No envelopes, and no stamps, but regular messaging charges do apply. How does 9.99 for 14 million songs sound? That's the price of a one-month subscription gift card to the online music service MOG. It's a great idea for snobby music lovers who--let's face it--were never going to play that Katy Perry CD you were planning to give them. With this gift card they can satisfy their own musical tastes from Frank Sinatra to Frank Zappa and even download songs to a mobile phone or music player. The tracks expire when the subscription does, but you can also purchase a two-month card for 19.99. Competing music service Rdio is also offering gift cards, including a 10 offer for 6 weeks of access to its service. Best of all for tardy shoppers, you don't have to wait for them to be mailed out; the MOG and Rdio cards are available at Target stores around the country (so you could pick them up on Saturday). Hollywood may have turned out some duds this year (The Green Hornet, yikes), but there were plenty of good video game releases to fill the entertainment vacuum. For kids, my resident 9-year-old reviewer recommends Super Mario 3D Land (39.99) for the Nintendo 3DS. She loves it and points out that if you don't like the 3D effect, it can be turned off. For teens and up, there is one must-have title: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Available for Windows PCs (49.99), the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles (59.99), Skyrim finally delivers on something video games have promised for years: a completely absorbing virtual fantasy world where you are the main character. In Skyrim you can mold that character to suit your desires, imbuing it with a variety of skills, super powers, and characteristics that you can mix and match. There's an epic fantasy-style plot, but you can ignore it and spend dozens of hours infiltrating secret guilds, exploring the countryside, and slaying monsters. One warning: the PlayStation version has some glitches. A Box Instead of a TV The big flat panels with streaming online video services like Netflix and Hulu Plus may make shoppers drool, but who can afford one as a gift? Instead of upgrading the entire TV, just get a set top box that can deliver all those services -- and more -- for a fraction of the price of new set. Among the dozen or so different streaming media players you'll see in electronics stores, the best is the Roku 2 XS. For just 89.99 you'll get over 330 video and media services, from free services like Pandora to special interest channels like \\"Trigger Talk\\" for gun enthusiasts. It even comes with a game controller and a free version of Angry Birds to play on the big screen. Photos from an iPhone or simple point-and-shoot camera are fine for posting incriminating Facebook shots, but if you want to get some really good photos of your kids or of that incredible sunset, you need to use a real camera. That used to mean spending a lot--and learning a lot--to use a digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera, but no more. There's a growing category of smaller, less technical but just as capable models called compact interchangeable lens cameras (or ILCs). These models are a step up to more serious photography, with better sensors, optics, full manual control, and, as the name suggests, lots of lens options should it turn into a hobby. Two of the best models in this category are the Olympus PEN E-P3 (899.99 with a 17mm lens package) and the Samsung NX200 (899.99 with a 18-55mm i-Function lens). Olympus has a faster processor for quicker auto focusing and shooting better HD video. It also has a built-in flash, and can use some compatible Panasonic lenses. The Samsung NX200 boasts a larger APS-C size sensor (the type favored in full DSLRs) that delivers some excellent image quality and color accuracy, but it doesn't have the number of optional lenses or accessories as the Olympus model. So now you have no excuse. There's a great last-minute tech gift available in every price range, and if you hurry, you might even make the cutoff for overnight shipping. What was this article about?","completion":"This article provides last-minute tech Christmas gift ideas in various price ranges for different recipients, including text messages with graphics, music service subscriptions, video games, streaming media players, and compact interchangeable lens cameras.

At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state. As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify.

These six reviews can help in sorting through publishersâ recent offerings. Among them is a clever racing history meant for young children and adults; a compendium of stories, some very bizarre indeed, about cars and the people who collect them; an account of Mustangâs first five decades; and a travelogue of a bikerâs around-the-world journey. The Epic 1976 Formula 1 Season 59 color and 53 black-and-white photographs. 160 pages. David Bull Publishing. 39.95. This book appears to have been published to coincide with Ron Howardâs movie âRush,â which dramatizes the battle for the 1976 Formula One drivers championship between James Hunt of England and Niki Lauda of Austria. And ârushâ is what comes to mind when I think about the effort behind this book. The author needs quotation marks, it seems, only when mentioning various charactersâ nicknames. Itâs understandable that there are no direct statements from Hunt, who died in 1993 at 45, and perhaps even from Lauda, who may not have wanted to dredge up memories of a season that almost killed him. There are news clippings to quote from, though. And living witnesses. But none of the other people involved in that season (which saw Hunt win the title in the final race when Lauda refused to risk his life again on a very wet racetrack) are asked to provide their insights. Instead, we have Mr. Fearnley telling us what was going on in the minds of Hunt and Lauda, and we are asked to believe. Even the most rudimentary extras, like race-by-race results, are missing. And this book could have also used a glossary to translate Britishisms like âcouldnât test for toffeeâ and âa wizard wheeze.â The writing also suffers from a trait that frequently infests reporting on Formula One racing in the days when Il Commendatore, Enzo himself, was still running Ferrari: namely, all the various intrigues on the Italian team are described in darkly ominous terms befitting a âGodfatherâ novel. There are plenty of photos, color and black-and-white, to please students of racing history, with extensive captions. But if youâve seen the movie and now want to read the book, donât be in such a ... well, you know. JOSEPH SIANO Celebrating Americaâs Only True Pony Car By Donald Farr. Foreword by Edsel B. Ford II. 200 color and 200 black-and-white images. 256 pages. Motorbooks. 50. âMustang Fifty Yearsâ is a voluminous book that tracks the life of a Ford thatâs as famous as the Model T. While the book is presented as an Official Licensed Product, a spokesman for Ford said the automaker had no editorial control. Donald Farr, a longtime writer and editor at Mustang-centric publications, provides a comprehensive recounting of the carâs gestation as a design study in the early 1960s, its splashy debut at the 1964 New York Worldâs Fair and its tumultuous life up through the fifth-generation model that is entering its final model year. The book concludes with sections on Mustangs for racing, in pop culture and for hobbyists and collectors. The book takes a straightforward, generally noncritical approach in presenting each significant Mustang. If there are faults in any of the models, features or production decisions, they are usually presented in retrospect, with a recounting of how the new version addressed the shortcomings of the old. Even some universally scorned models, like the Mustang II of 1974-78, are presented with a faithful recitation of the companyâs list of its supposed virtues. While not exactly a beach read, the book is more digestible, even for general audiences, than its dauntingly encyclopedic appearance might suggest. The captions for the many interesting photos are even more compelling. JERRY GARRETT 692 color photographs and maps. 224 pages. Veloce Publishing. 59.95.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Finland has one of the lowest economic inequality in the world. Finland's neighbor Russia has a different story. After the collapse of Soviet Union, Russia's economic inequality soared to the point that it has now one of the highest economic inequality in the world. John and Keith are residents of Finland. While John is rich, Keith is not so fortunate - he is poor. Similarly, David and Greg are residents of Russia. While David is rich, Greg is in poverty. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would Greg have larger or smaller marginal utility than David? Hint: Following the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number – economic inequality is problematic. A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, is an example of reduced \\"distributive efficiency\\" within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility. An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person (\\"the additional dollar\\") decreases as a person becomes richer. From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies[2][32] have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.","completion":"In the given scenario, Greg, the poor resident of Russia, would have a larger marginal utility than David, the rich resident of Russia. The concept of marginal utility is rooted in the principle that the additional satisfaction or \\"utility\\" gained from consuming additional units of goods or services decreases as more units are consumed, which is also known as the law of diminishing marginal utility. To understand this concept better, let's look at Greg and David's situations. Greg, who is in poverty, would achieve significantly higher marginal utility from an additional dollar as it would help him acquire basic necessities, such as food, water, and healthcare. The acquisition of these necessities would greatly improve his quality of life, and therefore the additional dollar would provide a substantial increase in utility. On the other hand, David, who is already rich, would experience relatively less utility or satisfaction from an additional dollar. This is because the extra wealth is more likely to be spent on luxury items than basic necessities, which typically provide a lower level of marginal satisfaction or utility. David's existing wealth already provides him with a comfortable life, so any additional wealth generates less incremental utility. In line with the utilitarian principle mentioned in the hint, economic inequality is problematic because wealth distribution that prioritizes the few over the many does not maximize the overall utility or happiness of society. A more equal distribution of wealth, as seen in Finland with John and Keith, leads to higher aggregate utility as additional wealth in the hands of those with fewer resources generates more marginal utility than when the same wealth is with the very rich. Several studies have supported this theory by demonstrating that societies with lower levels of inequality exhibit higher population-wide satisfaction and happiness. Consequently, it can be concluded that Greg, being the poorer individual in Russia, would have a larger marginal utility than David, who is already wealthy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

George Edward Foreman (born January 10, 1949) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1969 to 1977, and from 1987 to 1997. Nicknamed \\"Big George\\", he is a two-time world heavyweight champion and an Olympic gold medalist. Outside the sport he is an ordained minister, author, and entrepreneur. After a troubled childhood Foreman took up amateur boxing and won a gold medal in the heavyweight division at the 1968 Summer Olympics. In 1987, after 10 years away from the ring, Foreman surprised the boxing world by announcing a comeback at the age of 38. In his autobiography, he wrote that his primary motive was to raise money to fund the youth center he had created, which had required much of the money he had earned in the initial phase of his career. Another stated ambition was to fight Mike Tyson. For his first fight, he went to Sacramento, California, where he beat journeyman Steve Zouski by a knockout in four rounds. Foreman weighed 267 lb (121 kg) for the fight and looked badly out of shape. Although many thought his decision to return to the ring was a mistake, Foreman countered that he had returned to prove that age was not a barrier to people achieving their goals (as he said later, he wanted to show that age 40 is not a \\"death sentence\\"). He won four more bouts that year, gradually slimming down and improving his fitness. In 1988, he won nine times. Perhaps his most notable win during this period was a seventh-round knockout of former Light Heavyweight and Cruiserweight Champion Dwight Muhammad Qawi. Having always been a deliberate fighter, Foreman had not lost much mobility in the ring since his first \\"retirement\\", although he found it harder to keep his balance after throwing big punches and could no longer throw rapid combinations. He was still capable of landing heavy single blows, however. The late-round fatigue that had plagued him in the ring as a young man now seemed to be unexpectedly gone, and he could comfortably compete for 12 rounds. Foreman attributed this to his new, relaxed fighting style (he has spoken of how, earlier in his career, his lack of stamina came from an enormous amount of nervous tension). By 1989, while continuing his comeback, Foreman had sold his name and face for the advertising of various products, selling everything from grills to mufflers on TV. For this purpose his public persona was reinvented, and the formerly aloof, ominous Foreman had been replaced by a smiling, friendly George. He and Ali had become friends, and he followed in Ali's footsteps by making himself a celebrity outside the boundaries of boxing. Foreman continued his string of victories, winning five more fights, the most impressive being a three-round win over Bert Cooper, who went on to contest the Undisputed Heavyweight title against Evander Holyfield. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did Foreman fight for the championship in his second comeback?","completion":"Yes, Foreman fought for the championship in his second comeback.

By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with an army to conquer the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucatán between 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving the area between - essentially Petén and much of Belize - independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated. Answer this question: How many years after Columbus discovered the Americas did Cortés set sail?","completion":"Hernán Cortés set sail to explore the Mexican coast in 1519. Given that Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas in 1492, this means it was 27 years after Columbus' discovery that Cortés embarked on his journey. This time period was characterized by many expeditions across the New World as part of the Age of Discovery, as European powers sought to expand their territories, gain wealth, and spread Christianity. In Spain's case, private adventurers entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown, agreeing to conquer and rule the newly discovered lands in return for a part of the tax revenues. The ensuing age of exploration and colonization profoundly altered the course of world history, leading to an increased global interconnectedness, while at the same time exposing indigenous cultures to devastating diseases, warfare, and subjugation under colonial rule. These historical events, including the voyages of Columbus and Cortés, are remembered with a mix of admiration for their daring exploration and criticism for the immense suffering caused to the native populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Stir the sifted flour and salt together thoroughly, preferably in a sizable heat-resistant mixing bowl. Because maintaining a cool temperature is essential to keeping the gluten strands from forming a strong bond, using chilled flour and a chilled bowl is recommended. While you're preparing the dough, it's a good idea to chill your butter thoroughly before you attempt to work it in, if you're using butter. Anytime the mixture gets overworked, you can stop, put the mixing bowl into the fridge, and let it chill back down to a workable temperature. There are many different methods of cutting the fat into the flour, but all are equally effective with the right amount of elbow grease. The most important thing is to keep the butter cool, if you use it, so keep it in the freezer for at least 30 minutes or so, cutting it into large chunks before integrating it more thoroughly. You want to mix in the fat until you have small and uniform pea-sized chunks. Use a food processor. The easiest way to cut the butter is to use a food processor, pulsing the flour mixture for a minute or two, until the butter is chopped up to the appropriate size. Use a pastry cutter for butter or shortening. A pastry cutter is a great way of chopping up the butter in a good uniform mixture, quickly and without much effort. Roll the pastry cutter through the flour mixture, clearing out the butter from behind the tines after you make each pass around the bowl, if necessary. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Use a fork or two knives. If you don't have a pastry cutter or a food processor, don't fret. It's possible, but takes slightly more hand strength and effort, to cut up the butter with the flat side of a table fork, using two knives to slice the butter in opposite directions, or even just using the end of a metal spatula. Just use your fingers with shortening. Shortening won't be greatly affected by the heat from your hands or from the room temperature, making it easy to get your hands in and crumble up the shortening into the flour using your fingers. You can also do this with butter. Letting it get warm makes the mixture too glutenous and it won't be flakey. Use a wooden spoon and gently stir the flour as you pour a small amount of ice water into the bowl. Pour a tablespoon or two at a time, integrating it gently by agitating the flour. The mixture should just barely come together and form a loose ball, and shouldn't be at all damp or wet looking. Be very gentle. The key to a flaky crust is to make sure you don't overwork the dough. Pie crust is not bread dough, and if you overwork the dough, the crust will become quite tough and difficult to handle. Be a minimalist when it comes to mixing the water into the flour. Less touching means more tender dough. If you're struggling to get the flour to come together, or if everything has become too warm, don't be afraid to pop the bowl into the freezer for a couple of minutes to chill it back down to a more workable temperature. Cold dough is easier to work with. Very gently, pull the flour into a ball, touching it as little as possible, and then split ball in two equal portions. The recipe should make two portions, which you could use for one bottom crust and one top crust, or bottom crusts for two different pies. Cut the dough ball in half with a kitchen knife and separate the halves gently. It's usually a good idea to chill the dough in the refrigerator until you're ready to roll it out and bake with it. If you've already got the oven pre-heated and you're anxious to get started, putting it in the freezer can be a good way to get the temperature down quickly. If you want to save the dough for a longer period of time, freeze it in a self-sealing freezer bag. When you're ready to use it, let it defrost in the fridge overnight and roll it out normally.","completion":"The article provides detailed steps and tips on how to prepare a flaky pie crust by maintaining cool temperatures, using the right tools to mix the ingredients, and handling the dough gently to avoid overworking it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A subsequent attack in her bathroom leaves bite marks and bruises, which Carla shows to Dr. Sneiderman, who believes she has inflicted them on herself (despite the marks showing up in places impossible for her to reach). We learn that Carla suffered a variety of traumas in her childhood and adolescence, including sexual and physical abuse, teenage pregnancy and the violent death of her first husband.

The surgeon who had delivered my son by C-section an hour earlier stepping back from the table, and saying, “We're done, people. Good job, everyone!” That hour had been hell for everyone in the room, save only my little boy, sleeping peacefully in the warming crib, and his mother, who was just stirring from the general that had put her under about 55 minutes earlier. I had come within a few minutes, maybe seconds, of raising my boy as a single parent. Her OB/GYN had fought valliently to keep my family together, and won. Everyone who'd been awake knew exactly how close run a thing it had been. Mr. Murphy had been hanging around the whole time, and neither Doc nor mom was catching a whole lot of breaks that evening. But Doc only needed one, and he made full use thereof. One thing for all new dad's whose wives have had previous abdominal surgery. You never want to hear the muttered words, “Creative anatomy on the way out”, when somebody has your wife’s belly open. Those are about the worst words in the world, because they mean Doc's gotta put stuff to right in there, and he might not have what he'd like in order to get it done.

To provide a more relevant answer, it is important to clarify what is meant by \\"cubes\\" in the context of the question. 1. If the question refers to cubic measurements of space, then it would be impossible to accurately estimate the number of \\"cubes\\" in the United States, as these figures would vary depending on the units used to measure volume (e.g., cubic inches, cubic feet, or cubic meters) and whether the cubes encompass empty spaces, buildings, natural land features, etc. 2. If the context refers to physical objects in the shape of a cube (e.g., ice cubes, toy cubes, or gaming dice), it would likewise be challenging to provide an accurate estimate, as the number of such objects would depend on factors such as manufacturing, consumer demand, and inventories. Moreover, these figures would constantly change due to daily activity and fluctuations in the market. 3. If \\"cubes\\" pertain to a specific company or product, like Rubik's cubes, one would need to research the number of such items sold in the United States, including both authentic Rubik's cubes and other similar products.

When we knew it might be his last birthday, the whole family decided to get together for a huge birthday celebration at the nursing home. Dad was a good storyteller and we were always his listeners. During a quiet moment, I announced it was now Dad's turn to listen to stories for a change. I wanted everyone to tell Dad what we loved about him. The room became quiet. Then one after another, people told stories from their hearts, while Dad listened with tears in eyes. Everyone seemed to have more than one story. Even the little grandchildren couldn't wait to tell Dad why they loved him. For a man who had been kind to so many hundreds of people in his life, here was our chance to tell him how much we love him. A few months later, at Dad's memorial service, we more fully realized what we had given to Dad that night. Those are the stories people normally tell at a funeral after a loved one is no longer alive to hear the words. They tell stories, full of tears. But we had given those memories to Dad in his life, and we had told them through laughter, together with hugs and joy. He had them to hold and enjoyed them from time to time in his mind during his last days and months. Words do matter, and they are enough. We just need to say them or to speak them publicly the ones we love. That's the ways to give back love and that's our chance to celebrate a person in his or her life.

Chris Christie said Tuesday that New Jersey needed \\"tough and plain-spoken leadership\\" when he took office eight years ago and he delivered it pulling the state from \\"the brink of financial ruin\\" by confronting problems leaders of both parties had ignored for decades. Christie hands over state government to Democrat Phil Murphy in a week. Christie said he was the first governor in America to try to tackle the huge and escalating burden of state pension costs saying previous governors from both parties and Legislatures \\"virtually ignored the growing menace of increased costs and no real contributions.\\" Among the steps taken during his administration was dedicating lottery proceeds to the pension system for the next 30 years. When he took office Christie said New Jersey was \\"on the brink of financial ruin as a state.\\" \\"We needed tough and plain-spoken leadership to deal with these problems \\" he said. He said he vetoed more than 7 billion in spending helped cut the state workforce pushed through a cap on property tax increases and at the same time made sure the state invested heavily to help protect the New Jersey Shore from the kind of devastation it suffered during Superstorm Sandy in 2012. The prepared text of his remarks didn't show him invoking the name of his friend President Donald Trump. But he called it an \\"honor\\" to chair the White House's opioid commission. Christie 's speech caps his stint as one of America's best-known governors. He was on the cover of Time magazine under the headline \\"The Boss\\" and a periodic guest on late-night television where he memorably appeared in a skit about \\"dad dancing\\" with Jimmy Fallon and poked fun at his weight by eating a doughnut on David Letterman's show. At least in the beginning he won acclaim for his forthrightness like when he told beachcombers to \\"get the hell off the beach\\" in 2011 during Hurricane Irene. He told it like it was before Trump brought the practice to the White House. He also was exceedingly popular and widely praised for guiding the state in its recovery from Superstorm Sandy which ravaged the coastline. He was briefly seen as a top GOP contender for president. But he was also criticized for testy exchanges with the public during town hall meetings and other encounters. His popularity and job approval fell sharply particularly after the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal in which three of his allies were convicted in a political retribution scheme. He also lost the home crowd after spending much of 2015 and early 2016 campaigning for president out of state a contest he dropped out of after failing to emerge from the back of the pack. He returned to New Jersey and focused on the state's â and country's â opioid addiction crisis after failing to get a top job in the Trump administration.

There are numerous reasons to consider this as the most probable outcome, such as: 1. Sabok's death resulted from choking on medication without anyone attempting to save him, which suggests negligence on the part of the hospital and its staff. This could potentially form the basis for a medical malpractice or wrongful death lawsuit against the hospital. 2. The involvement of federal investigators and the discovery of multiple cases of suspected abuse and neglect, including physical violence caught on video, further damages the hospital's reputation and could strengthen the family's legal case. This also signifies that there might be systemic issues within the hospital that contributed to Sabok's death. 3. The hospital's loss of certification and Medicare funding – estimated at 800,000 a month – not only impacts its financial standing but also potentially tarnishes its credibility. This fact might be viewed as additional evidence of a dysfunctional institution, potentially increasing the chances of a successful lawsuit. 4. The traumatic experience of losing a family member, compounded by the hospital's multiple alleged issues, would likely result in the family seeking justice for Sabok through the legal system. While option [i] may happen in the long run, initiating a lawsuit could be a crucial step for the family in their healing process. It is important to note that the family's future actions may also include a combination of the possibilities listed.

Background: Herbert Alexander Simon (June 15, 1916 - February 9, 2001) was an American economist and political scientist whose primary interest was decision-making within organizations and is best known for the theories of \\"bounded rationality\\" and \\"satisficing\\". He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978 and the Turing Award in 1975. His research was noted for its interdisciplinary nature and spanned across the fields of cognitive science, computer science, public administration, management, and political science. He was at Carnegie Mellon University for most of his career, from 1949 to 2001. Context: Herbert Alexander Simon was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on June 15, 1916. His father, Arthur Simon (1881-1948), was an electrical engineer who had come to the United States from Germany in 1903 after earning his engineering degree from the Technische Hochschule of Darmstadt. An inventor who was granted \\"several dozen patents\\", his father also was an independent patent attorney. His mother, Edna Marguerite Merkel, was an accomplished pianist whose ancestors had come from Prague and Cologne. His European ancestors had been piano makers, goldsmiths, and vintners. Simon's father was Jewish and his mother came from a family with Jewish, Lutheran, and Catholic backgrounds. Simon called himself an atheist. Simon was educated in the Milwaukee public school system, where he developed an interest in science. He found schoolwork to be interesting and easy. Unlike many children, Simon was exposed to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically at a relatively young age due to the influence of his mother's younger brother, Harold Merkel, who had studied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under John R. Commons. Through his uncle's books on economics and psychology, Simon discovered the social sciences. Among his earliest influences, Simon has cited Richard Ely's economics textbook, Norman Angell's The Great Illusion, and Henry George's Progress and Poverty. At that time, Simon argued \\"from conviction, rather than cussedness\\" in favor of George's controversial \\"single tax\\" on land rents. In 1933, Simon entered the University of Chicago, and following those early influences, he studied the social sciences and mathematics. He was interested in biology, but chose not to study it because of his \\"color-blindness and awkwardness in the laboratory\\". He chose instead to focus on political science and economics. His most important mentor was Henry Schultz, an econometrician and mathematical economist. Simon received both his B.A. (1936) and his Ph.D. (1943) in political science, from the University of Chicago, where he studied under Harold Lasswell, Nicholas Rashevsky, Rudolf Carnap, Henry Schultz, and Charles Edward Merriam. After enrolling in a course on \\"Measuring Municipal Governments\\", Simon was invited to be a research assistant for Clarence Ridley, with whom he coauthored Measuring Municipal Activities in 1938. Eventually his studies led him to the field of organizational decision-making, which would become the subject of his doctoral dissertation. Question: what followed this ? Answer:","completion":"After completing his doctoral dissertation, Herbert Simon embarked on a fruitful academic and research career that spanned across various disciplines. His work on organizational decision-making paved the way for his future contributions to diverse fields such as economics, political science, computer science, psychology, and management. In 1942, Simon accepted a position as a political science professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. Here, he worked closely with mathematician and philosopher Rudolf Carnap, who influenced Simon's interest in logical positivism and scientific approaches to understanding human behavior. During World War II, Simon worked with the Office of Price Administration, using his expertise in mathematical modeling and statistics to address wartime economic challenges. This experience had a significant impact on his subsequent research. In 1949, Simon joined the Carnegie Mellon University (previously known as the Carnegie Institute of Technology) as a professor of administration and psychology. The multidisciplinary environment at Carnegie Mellon suited Simon's diverse interests, and he remained there for the rest of his career. At Carnegie Mellon, Simon started working on his groundbreaking theory of \\"bounded rationality.\\" He argued that individuals or organizations make decisions based on information and cognitive capacity limitations, which prevents optimal decision-making and leads to the selection of a \\"satisficing\\" alternative that meets the minimum requirements. This idea revolutionized the field of decision-making and economics by acknowledging the cognitive limitations and imperfect information environment faced by real-world decision-makers. In the early 1950s, Simon began working with Allen Newell, a computer scientist, and their collaboration marked the beginning of a long-lasting partnership between the two scholars. This partnership had significant implications for the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence (AI) and led to the development of the \\"Logic Theorist,\\" the first AI program, in 1956. Simon's research continued to expand into various fields. He worked on information processing theories that helped push the boundaries of computer science and laid the groundwork for the study of problem-solving, cognitive psychology, and human reasoning. He also made significant contributions to public administration and management. In addition to his Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978, Simon received numerous awards and accolades throughout his career, including the Turing Award in 1975, which marked the pinnacle of his achievements in computer science. He authored multiple books and published a vast number of articles, shaping the academic landscape across multiple disciplines and leaving a lasting legacy. Herbert Simon continued to remain actively involved in research and teaching at Carnegie Mellon University until his death on February 9, 2001. His life's work represents a rare synthesis of interdisciplinary research, and his contributions have had far-reaching effects on a variety of fields, from economics and political science to computer science and artificial intelligence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who was last seen at an archaeological dig?, using the article: Two young American couples — Jeff and Amy, and Eric and Stacy — enjoy their vacation in Mexico. They meet Mathias, a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri, Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone.

John was tuning his musical instruments with two tuning forks, fork A and fork B. He produced higher frequency with fork A and lower frequency with fork B. Interestingly, both frequencies had the same amplitude. Hint: The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude.

Let me provide a more detailed explanation for each of them. 1. Meaning of It? This question is quite ambiguous, as it simply asks for the meaning of \\"it.\\" Without any context, the question cannot be answered accurately. \\"It\\" is a pronoun commonly used in English to refer to something previously mentioned or something that is easily identified in some way. Examples of usage include \\"It is hot outside\\" or \\"I love that book, and it is my favorite.\\" In these examples, \\"it\\" refers to the weather and the book. However, in a standalone question without context, the intended object remains unclear. 2. \\"What is the meaning of 'beagleize it'?\\" This question is more specific and focused, as it asks for the meaning of the term \\"beagleize it.\\" Beagleize is not a standard English word, and its meaning may vary depending on context or where it is used. It may be derived from the word \\"beagle,\\" which refers to a breed of small hounds or dogs with specific physical and behavioral traits. As a verb, \\"beagleize\\" could mean to make something or someone be like a beagle, or to apply beagle-like characteristics or qualities to something. \\"Beagleize it\\" would then mean an instruction or request to apply these characteristics or qualities to an mentioned object or situation. However, without any context or usage, it is difficult to determine the exact intended meaning of the term.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the first name of Sir Terence Aubrey Murray's wife? from the following article ? The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Write an article based on this \\"National League side Aldershot Town have signed Millwall striker Alfie Pavey on a 28-day youth loan deal.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Millwall Striker Alfie Pavey Joins Aldershot Town on 28-day Youth Loan Deal In a significant development for Aldershot Town FC, the National League side has announced the signing of Millwall forward Alfie Pavey on a 28-day youth loan deal. With this acquisition, the Shots are expected to bolster their attacking options, as they continue their campaign in England's fifth tier of football. A product of the Millwall Academy, Alfie Pavey, 22, has been considered one of the rising talents in English football. Standing at 6ft 2in, the striker possesses a strong aerial presence, remarkable finishing skills and an impressive work rate, which should ideally suit the playing style of Aldershot Town manager Danny Searle. Having spent his early career representing various age groups for Millwall, Pavey first came into the limelight in the 2014/15 season, when he scored 19 goals for the Under-18 team. His impressive performances caught the attention of the club's first team, and he was soon handed a professional contract in 2015. Since then, he has made sporadic appearances for the Lions, while gaining valuable experience during loan spells at various Football League and National League clubs, including Bromley, Dartford, Greenwich Borough, Hampton & Richmond Borough, and most recently, Havant & Waterlooville. Despite having limited opportunities at the Den, Pavey exhibited his goal-scoring prowess during his time with Dartford and Hampton & Richmond, where he found the back of the net regularly. In January 2020, Pavey joined National League side Havant & Waterlooville on loan, earning high praise for his performances, which included eight goals in 13 appearances before the season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision to sign Pavey on a youth loan deal aligns with Aldershot's approach of investing in young talents and integrating them into their first team. The Shots are currently in need of a goal-scorer up front, as they have struggled to find the net consistently this season. Thus, a player of Pavey's physicality and aggression could be the much-needed catalyst for a turnaround in their fortunes. Aldershot Town boss Danny Searle expressed his delight in welcoming Pavey to the team and shared his expectations for the young striker: \\"Alfie is a proven goal-scorer for his age group and has all the attributes we look for in a striker. We are confident that he will improve the team's goal-scoring abilities and provide a boost to our frontline.\\" For the young forward, this move presents an opportunity to showcase his skills on a consistent basis and attract the attention of his parent club, Millwall, who would ideally be looking for him to gain more first-team experience. A stellar performance with Aldershot Town could potentially help Pavey earn a more prominent role within Millwall's future plans or open up avenues for him to pursue his career elsewhere. In conclusion, the signing of Alfie Pavey appears to be a strategically sound decision by Aldershot Town, as the English striker brings a wealth of experience from various loan spells while promising to impact their attacking set-up. As the Shots continue searching for a return to the Football League, the addition of talented, young players like Pavey could prove to be invaluable for the team's fortunes. Only time will tell if the Millwall striker can engineer a turnaround at the National League side, but this transfer certainly exhibits the potential for mutual success."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

When we sleep, our body can focus more of its resources on repairing damaged tissues, fighting infections, and boosting our immune system. Positions like lying down or elevating an affected limb can also facilitate improved blood circulation, which is essential for delivering oxygen and nutrients to the damaged areas. Therefore, healing requires sleep as well as sitting to promote the recovery process effectively.

Although some of these options might be indirectly involved in the healing process, they are not the primary or relevant focus for this question. For example, energy is needed for the healing process, and oxygen is necessary for supporting cellular metabolism and respiration for overall body functions.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999. Sotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission. \\"I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business,\\" said Lawrence R. Stack, the company's managing director. \\"This is the Mona Lisa of coins,\\" said Beth Deisher, editor of Coin World, the largest weekly coin publication in the United States, with a circulation of 85,000. \\"It is unique. Forbidden fruit.\\" Collectors' Web sites have surged with speculation about the sale price, and enthusiasts even organized betting pools. Question: \\"What is the history of the double eagle?\\" Answer: \\"Minted in 1804\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer provided is incorrect. The history of the double eagle mentioned here specifically refers to the 1933 double eagle coin, not the 1804 coin. The 1933 double eagle coin bears a fascinating history involving presidents, kings, and a Secret Service sting operation. This 20 gold piece is a potent symbol of one of the United States' past economic crises caused by the Great Depression. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt banned the possession of gold coins in a bid to tackle the worsening economic conditions. He ordered the Treasury to melt down any of these coins that were not recovered, making the 1933 double eagle increasingly rare. Although up to 445,500 double eagles were struck in 1933, most of them never circulated. A few, however, managed to escape the melting pot, with their numbers dwindling to under 20 known examples. A legendary episode in the double eagle's story involves a king, specifically King Farouk of Egypt, who legally exported one of the coins from the US in 1944. The coin was later sold at auction in 1954 after Farouk was deposed. Another twist in the coin's history occurred when a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, was arrested for attempting to sell a 1933 double eagle at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. This led to a court battle, where Fenton eventually won the right to split the auction proceeds with the US Mint. With so few of these rare gold coins in existence, the 1933 double eagle has attracted considerable attention from coin collectors, resulting in record-breaking auction prices and solidifying its place in numismatic history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Passage: As a result of the 2008 Russian military reforms, the units of the Russian Naval Aviation were reorganized into 13 new Naval Air Bases. Each new naval air base consists of an HQ, support units and one or more aviation groups/wings . In a second stage, the air bases were merged into territorially integrated structures. Only the 279th Regiment retained its status. The planned transfer of Naval Aviation assets to the Air Force has been delayed due to their importance to the service, but was finally implemented by the end of 2011. As of 2012, the only fixed wing strike and fighter aircraft of Russian Naval Aviation are the Su-33 fighters and Su-25UTG attack aircraft of the 279th Regiment , plus the Su-24 bombers based in the Crimea. This sole bomber unit remained part of Naval Aviation as an exception to satisfy treaty requirements governing Russian forces deployments on Ukrainian territory . Buying brand new multirole Sukhoi Su-30SM for the Black Sea Fleet to replace Su-24 was in the planning stages and it has been completed as of December 2016. Naval aviation also retains the anti-submarine aircraft of the forces and the helicopter arm.

Write an article based on this summary: – Dairy Queen has given the boot to one of its franchisees after he allegedly unleashed a racist tirade against a customer. Deianeira Ford visited a Zion, Ill., DQ on Wednesday with her two young children and asked for a refund after her order was mixed up. Owner James Crichton gave her one, though she says he also started yelling at her. \\"He called me and my children n------,\\" Ford tells the Washington Post. \\"He said I can go back to where I came from.\\" She called 911 and the responding officer spoke to Crichton, who, per the police report, \\"proudly admitted to calling Ford a n-----\\" and ranted about his other black customers. But since he hadn't committed a crime, there was nothing police could do. It ended up being Ford's own Facebook post that resulted in big consequences for Crichton. Her post about the incident went viral, and on Saturday, dozens of demonstrators gathered—initially, they planned to protest the store and call for a boycott, the Lake County News-Sun reports. Instead, the gathering was a celebration, because on Friday Dairy Queen announced it was shutting down the location and terminating Crichton's franchise rights. DQ called Crichton's actions \\"inexcusable, reprehensible, and unacceptable,\\" and Crichton himself apologized via a DQ statement. (Crichton had previously told the News-Sun Ford's story was \\"99% lies.\\") Ford's attorney tells the Post that legal action may still be taken against Dairy Queen, because since Ford came forward, other customers and employees of that location have shared similar stories. (A shopper's tirade got her banned from JCPenney.) Article:","completion":"Title: Dairy Queen Severs Ties with Franchisee following Racist Outburst Dairy Queen, the popular quick-serve restaurant chain, has formally terminated its agreement with one of its franchisees, James Crichton, following allegations of a racial tirade against a customer. This dramatic decision came after Crichton reportedly engaged in a racial rant at his Dairy Queen outlet in Zion, Ill., when a customer requested a refund due to a mix-up in her order. The customer, Deianeira Ford, visited the Dairy Queen branch with her two young children last Wednesday. According to her, not only did the franchise owner give her a refund, but he also allegedly shouted racial slurs at her and her children. Ford stated in an interview with the Washington Post, \\"He called me and my children n------ and said I can go back to where I came from.\\" Reacting to the incident, Ford called 911, which led to a law enforcement officer interacting with Crichton. As per the police report, Crichton \\"proudly admitted to calling Ford a n-----\\" and went on to vent about his other African-American customers. However, as no crimes had been committed in the eyes of the law, the police were unable to take punitive action. Ironically, it was Ford's recounting of the incident on Facebook that prompted the larger repercussions for Crichton. Her post quickly went viral, leading to dozens of people organizing a protest against the Dairy Queen location, even contemplating a boycott, according to reports from the Lake County News-Sun. However, in turn of the events, the protest transformed into a celebration. This happened after Dairy Queen made the announcement on Friday that it was closing down the franchise and effectively terminating Crichton's franchise rights. The company publicly denounced Crichton's actions, declaring them \\"inexcusable, reprehensible, and unacceptable\\". Additionally, Crichton extended an apology via a Dairy Queen statement, which was somewhat undermined by a previous statement to the News-Sun where he claimed Ford's story was \\"99% lies.\\" Although Dairy Queen has taken action, the story doesn’t end there. Ford's attorney has mentioned that they may still pursue legal action against the corporation. This is due to other customers and employees of the subject Dairy Queen franchise coming forward with similar stories of racially motivated experiences following Ford's disclosure. Despite the unfortunate incident, Dairy Queen's swift response underscores a powerful message about intolerance for racism in business establishments, sending a clear signal to other businesses about the potential repercussions of such malicious actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: One of the greatest sources of unhappiness, in my experience, is the difficulty we have in accepting things as they are. When we see something we don't like, we wish it could be different. We cry out for something better. That may be human nature,or perhaps it's something ingrained in our culture. The root of the unhappiness isn't necessarily that we want things to be different.However, it's that we decided we didn't like it in the first place. We've judged it as bad,rather than saying, \\"It's not bad or good, and it just is it.\\" In one of my books, I said, \\"You should expect people to mess up and expect things to go differently than you planned\\". Some readers said it's too sorrowful to expect things to go wrong.However, it's only negative if you see it as negative and judge it as bad. Instead,you could accept it as the way the world works and try to understand why that is. This can be applied to whatever you do:how other people act at work,how politics works and how depressing the news media can be.Accept these things as they are,and try to understand why they're that way. _ will save you a lot of sadness,because you'll no longer say, \\"Oh, I wish bad things didn't happen!''

Can we make this world a better place? You can say that you'll continue to try to do things to help others, to grow as a person, to make a difference in this world. That's the correct path you choose to take,because you enjoy that path. Therefore, when you find yourself judging and wishing for difference, try a different approach: accept, and understand.

Beulah Print and Design, based in Drogheda, County Louth, confirmed it had declined an order from Jonathon Brennan, one of their former customers. The company said its staff were \\"Bible-believing Christians\\" who did not support same-sex marriage. Mr Brennan told the Irish Independent he was \\"infuriated and shocked\\". The 29-year-old businessman, who owns a salon in Drogheda, is due to enter a civil partnership with his boyfriend of eight years, John Kierans, in August. He told the newspaper he had been a customer of the printing company for four years, before it refused to accept his order. Mr Brennan said the firm's co-owner, Noel Tuite, initially agreed to print the invitations, but visited Mr Brennan's salon on Wednesday to explain the order would be declined. Another co-founder of the firm, Mike O'Leary, told the BBC that although he accepted that there are people who practise homosexuality, he did not hold a \\"morally neutral\\" attitude towards it. Mr O'Leary said that as a Christian he did not agree with a gay \\"agenda or lifestyle\\", and objected to same-sex marriage. He added he was aware in passing of a similar case in Northern Ireland last year, when a Christian-owned bakery firm refused to bake a cake with a logo supporting gay marriage. He said he agreed with Ashers Baking Company's decision to decline the cake order. It was not the first time Beulah Print and Design has refused orders on the grounds of their religious beliefs. Mr O'Leary said that 10 years ago, they declined a similar request to print invitations for a gay ceremony abroad. He added they have also refused request to print materials that promote binge drinking, Halloween, \\"borderline pornography\\" and what he described as \\"the dark arts\\". Mr O'Leary co-founded the firm 12 years ago, after meeting Mr Tuite through Christian fellowship meetings in Drogheda. Members of three families are now employed at the printing company. In a statement, the firm said: \\"We, at Beulah Print, are Bible-believing Christians who are committed to standing by our conscience and God's Word. \\"We have been in business for 12 years during which time we have held to our convictions and have at times declined a variety of work which we felt was clearly contrary to our beliefs. \\"We have never hidden our faith from our customers and represent the gospel at every opportunity.

Answer the following question: What kept the narrator from riding horses more ?","completion":"The narrator mentions that they had envisioned riding horses a significantly greater number of times than they ended up doing, indicating that there must have been some sort of obstacle or hindrance preventing them from doing so. The primary factor that seems to have kept the narrator from riding horses more during the summer appears to be their weight. The narrator expresses hope that by next year they will have their weight down again, which suggests that they might currently be struggling with weight-related issues. This could include being overweight, having health issues tied to weight, or perhaps just lacking physical fitness. Being overweight or lacking physical fitness can make it difficult to ride horses comfortably, safely, and effectively. Riding a horse puts stress on the body, particularly on the joints and muscles, and requires a certain level of balance, coordination, and stamina. If a person isn't physically fit or is overweight, they may find it challenging to ride for long periods or even to mount and dismount the horse. Moreover, the person's weight may also cause discomfort or strain to the horse, making it harder for the animal to perform to the best of its abilities. Other factors that may have kept the narrator from riding more could include a lack of time, financial limitations, or scheduling conflicts. It's important to note, though, that from the information provided in the text, the narrator's focus is on their weight as the primary cause for having ridden less than they had originally planned.

Q with options: Can we draw the following conclusion? The World Bank is criticized for its activities. Options are: (A). yes. (B). no.","completion":"(A) Yes, we can draw the conclusion that The World Bank is criticized for its activities. The World Bank's primary goal is to reduce poverty and promote shared prosperity by providing financial and technical assistance to developing countries. However, despite its positive intentions, the organization has faced criticism over the years for its role in financing projects that have had negative impacts on human rights and the natural environment. One main criticism stems from the institution's support of large-scale infrastructure projects such as dams, power plants, and transportation networks. These projects often have significant environmental consequences, including deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and pollution of water resources. In some cases, they have also led to the displacement of local communities and indigenous peoples, violating their land rights and causing social unrest. Another aspect critics point toward is the World Bank's policy prescription for developing countries, particularly in relation to economic liberalization, privatization, and austerity measures. These policies, often termed as 'structural adjustment programs' or 'Washington Consensus,' have sometimes resulted in short-term economic benefits but long-term social and economic problems for the local populations. Austerity measures, for example, have led to cuts in social services, exacerbating poverty and inequality. Furthermore, the World Bank's governance structure has also been a target of criticism. The organization is mainly led by developed countries, which are the principal contributors to its budget and hold significant decision-making power. Critics argue that this structure gives an unfair advantage to wealthy nations, allowing them to impose their policy preferences and economic interests on developing countries. In the past, the World Bank has been accused of acting as an instrument of Western political and economic domination. In response to these criticisms, the World Bank has made efforts to improve its practices and policies and become more transparent, inclusive, and environmentally and socially responsible. The organization has introduced safeguards to better assess the environmental and social risks of the projects it finances, established grievance mechanisms for affected communities, and increased consultation and collaboration with local stakeholders. Nevertheless, the conclusion that the World Bank is criticized for its activities is indeed valid, considering the various critiques mentioned above. While the institution has achieved significant progress in addressing some of these concerns, it continues to be scrutinized and held accountable to ensure its actions align with its core mission of reducing poverty and fostering inclusive, sustainable development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bermuda In May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return. In September 1940, as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from Darrell's Island in 1943). Q: What did the US ask of Britain in May 1940?","completion":"In May 1940, the United States asked Britain for base rights in Bermuda. This request came in the context of the early stages of World War II, when establishing strategic military locations was of great importance for ensuring the safety and efficiency of military operations. However, at that time, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was initially unwilling to grant the United States the base rights in Bermuda, as he sought something in return for this significant concession. The negotiations between the United States and the United Kingdom eventually led to the Destroyers for Bases Agreement in September 1940, an important deal that allowed the United States to have base rights in several British territories. Although Bermuda and Newfoundland were not initially included in the agreement, both territories were later added to it, without the United Kingdom receiving any war material in return. As part of the agreement, the United States built an airfield in Bermuda that was to be jointly used by both the US and the UK. This arrangement stood for the duration of the war, with the Royal Air Force (RAF) Transport Command relocating to the Bermuda airfield from Darrell's Island in 1943. Thus, the United States' request for base rights in Bermuda during May 1940 eventually resulted in a mutually beneficial arrangement between the two wartime allies, as they collaborated in their military operations against the Axis powers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Violation of these laws rights enables corrupt countries to gain illegitimate economic advantage in the international market.\\", we find that untrustworthy leaders hold on to their immoral behavior primarily due to the economic advantage they gain through corruption in their respective countries. These leaders are able to manipulate and exploit laws and regulations related to the environment, worker protection, and labor rights – including unionization and child labor – by bribing officials and using other corrupt practices. Consequently, this allows them to maintain power and control over resources, while at the same time providing an unfair competitive advantage in the international market. As a result, it becomes quite clear that these untrustworthy leaders prioritize their personal or political gains over the welfare of their people, as well as the environment, leading to further deteriorating conditions in terms of both social rights and environmental sustainability. In short, some untrustworthy leaders continue to engage in immoral behavior simply because of the corrupt environment in which they operate, allowing them to benefit economically and maintain their hold on power.

I read this background article the other day: Biodiversity's relevance to human health is becoming an international political issue, as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of biodiversity loss. This issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change, as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF) at Cornell University.The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health. Partly, the problem lies in the success of water suppliers to increase supplies and failure of groups promoting preservation of water resources. While the distribution of clean water increases, in some parts of the world it remains unequal. According to the World Health Organisation (2018) only 71% of the global population used a safely managed drinking-water service.Some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and nutrition security, infectious disease, medical science and medicinal resources, social and psychological health. Biodiversity is also known to have an important role in reducing disaster risk and in post-disaster relief and recovery efforts.Biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources. A significant proportion of drugs are derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources: at least 50% of the pharmaceutical compounds on the US market... I am facing a new situation today: Belgium and France are two countries participating at a human health meeting. Belgium has a lower biodiversity, while France's biodiversity is much higher. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country didn't cause the scarcity of fresh water? A:","completion":"Belgium B: France Since the question does not provide specific information regarding water scarcity in either Belgium or France, a direct answer cannot be given based on the task assigned. However, in referring to the context given from your background article, it talks about how biodiversity loss can be linked to several health issues including the scarcity of fresh water. In this case, it's suggested that countries with higher biodiversity, like France in your new situation, would have a better chance at avoiding the scarcity of fresh water due to the diversified ecosystem services, including better water regulation, than those countries with lower biodiversity, like Belgium in your situation. So, taking the context from your background article, and applying it to your new situation, one could infer that France, having a higher biodiversity, did not cause the scarcity of water. This is only an assumption based on the correlation between biodiversity and water resources as implied by your background article and might not hold if specific data on water management of each country were provided. Please remember that this is a presumption, and the actual situation could defer based on varied factors like efficiency of water management, population demand, industrial use and others in each specific country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Brandenburg-Prussia is the historiographic denomination for the Early Modern realm of the Brandenburgian Hohenzollerns between 1618 and 1701. Based in the Electorate of Brandenburg, the main branch of the Hohenzollern intermarried with the branch ruling the Duchy of Prussia, and secured succession upon the latter's extinction in the male line in 1618. Another consequence of the intermarriage was the incorporation of the lower Rhenish principalities of Cleves, Mark and Ravensberg after the Treaty of Xanten in 1614. The Thirty Years' War (161848) was especially devastating. The Elector changed sides three times, and as a result Protestant and Catholic armies swept the land back and forth, killing, burning, seizing men and taking the food supplies. Upwards of half the population was killed or dislocated. Berlin and the other major cities were in ruins, and recovery took decades. - The Dutch Republic, also known as the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands ('), Republic of the United Netherlands or Republic of the Seven United Provinces ('), was a republic in Europe existing from 1581, when part of the Netherlands separated from Spanish rule, until 1795. It preceded the Batavian Republic, the Kingdom of Holland, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and ultimately the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands. Alternative names include the United Provinces ('), Seven Provinces ('), Federated Dutch Provinces ('), and Dutch Federation ('). - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - Maine Maritime Academy is a public post-secondary college and nautical training institution with approximately 900 students, located in Castine in Hancock County, Maine, USA. The Academy was established by the 90th Maine Legislature on March 21, 1941. Maine Maritime Academy is a public college. Costs of admission are comparable to the nearby University of Maine. Unlike federal service academies, a congressional recommendation is not required to attend this state school. Students are not obligated to go to sea or into the military after graduation, and a large portion of the graduating class chooses shore-side employment, often in maritime related fields or the power generation industry. - The Holocene is the geological epoch that began after the Pleistocene at approximately 11,700 years before present. The term \\"Recent\\" (usually capitalised) has often been used as an exact synonym of \\"Holocene\\", although this usage is discouraged in 21st-century science. The Holocene is part of the Quaternary period. Its name comes from the Ancient Greek words (\\"holos\\", whole or entire) and (\\"kainos\\", new), meaning \\"entirely recent\\". It has been identified with the current warm period, known as MIS 1, and can be considered an interglacial in the current ice age based on that evidence. - Penobscot Bay originates from the mouth of Maine's Penobscot River. 11,000 years ago, at the beginning of the Holocene era, the Gulf of Maine's sea level fell as low as 180 feet (55 m) below its present height. Penobscot Bay was then a continuation of Penobscot River that meandered through a broad lowland extending past present day Matinicus Island. Penobscot Bay is between Muscongus Bay and Blue Hill Bay. - New France was the area colonized by France in North America during a period beginning with the exploration of the Saint Lawrence River by Jacques Cartier in 1534 and ending with the cession of New France to Spain and Great Britain in 1763. At its peak in 1712 (before the Treaty of Utrecht), the territory of \\"New France\\", also sometimes known as the \\"French North American Empire\\" or \\"Royal New France\\", extended from Newfoundland to the Canadian prairies and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico, including all the Great Lakes of North America. - Fort Pentagouet (Fort Pentagoet, Fort Castine, Fort Penobscot, Fort St. Pierre) was a French fort established in present-day Castine, Maine, which was the capital of Acadia (16701674). It is the oldest permanent settlement in New England. - Acadia was a colony of New France in northeastern North America that included parts of eastern Quebec, the Maritime provinces, and modern-day Maine to the Kennebec River. During much of the 17th and early 18th centuries, Norridgewock on the Kennebec River and Castine at the end of the Penobscot River were the southernmost settlements of Acadia. The actual specification by the French government for the territory refers to lands bordering the Atlantic coast, roughly between the 40th and 46th parallels. Later, the territory was divided into the British colonies which became Canadian provinces and American states. The population of Acadia included members of the Wabanaki Confederacy and descendants of emigrants from France (i.e., Acadians). The two communities intermarried, which resulted in a significant portion of the population of Acadia being Métis. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Franco-Dutch War (167278), often called simply the Dutch War, was a war fought by France, Sweden, Münster, Cologne and England against the Dutch Republic, which was later joined by the Austrian Habsburg lands, Brandenburg-Prussia and Spain to form a Quadruple Alliance. The war ended with the Treaty of Nijmegen, by which Spain ceded the Franche-Comté and some cities in Flanders and Hainaut to France, while France returned some of its conquests (Maastricht and the Principality of Orange) to the Dutch. - Castine is a town in Hancock County in eastern Maine, USA, which served from 1670 to 1674 as the capital of Acadia. The population was 1,366 at the 2010 census. Castine is the home of Maine Maritime Academy, a four-year institution that graduates officers and engineers for the United States Merchant Marine and marine related industries. Approximately 1000 students are enrolled. During the French colonial period, Castine was the southern tip of Acadia and briefly served as the regional capital. - Münster (Low German: \\"Mönster\\"; Latin: \\"Monasterium\\", from the Greek \\"monastrion\\", \\"monastery\\") is an independent city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is in the northern part of the state and is considered to be the cultural centre of the Westphalia region. It is also capital of the local government region Münsterland. Münster was the location of the Anabaptist rebellion during the Protestant Reformation and the site of the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia ending the Thirty Years' War in 1648. Today it is known as the bicycle capital of Germany. - The Principality of Orange (in French \\"la Principauté d'Orange\\") was, from 1163 to 1713, a feudal state in Provence, in the south of modern-day France, on the left bank of the river Rhone north of the city of Avignon. - Jurriaen Aernoutsz ( or Aernouts ) was a Dutch colonial navy captain , who briefly conquered the capital of Acadia , Fort Pentagouet in Penobscot Bay ( present day Castine , Maine ) and several other villages , and renamed the colony New Holland during the Franco - Dutch War . The commander of the frigate Flying Horse , based at Curaçao during the Third Anglo - Dutch War , Aernoutsz was dispatched by the governor of Curaçao to fight French and English ships in the North Atlantic after the Netherlands recaptured New York City . By the time he reached New York , however , the English and the Dutch had made peace in the Treaty of Westminster -- but with the Franco - Dutch War still underway , Aernoutsz met with John Rhoades and decided to attack Acadia . On August 10 , 1674 , Aernoutsz and the crew of the Flying Horse captured Fort Pentagouet in two hours . He then sailed up the Bay of Fundy , pillaging several French posts along the coast and ending at Fort Jemseg , which he also captured . Aernoutsz claimed Acadia as the Dutch territory of New Holland , burying bottles at both Pentagouet and Jemseg to assert his claim , and remained in Acadia for about a month . He subsequently returned to Boston in mid-September , disposing of his pillage and selling the cannon from Pentagouet to the government of Massachusetts . Aernoutsz then returned to Curaçao in October , leaving Rhoades and company in Boston with orders to return to Acadia to maintain possession of the territory . Once in Acadia , Rhoades began seizing New England vessels coming to trade with the Wabanaki Confederacy . As a result , the government of Massachusetts apprehended the party and tried them as pirates , during which time the French regained control of the territory without any military opposition . The Dutch continued to consider New Holland part of their colonial empire in North America , appointing Cornelius Van Steenwyk as Dutch governor of the territory in 1676 , but this was largely a paper designation -- in actual practice , the region... - Franche-Comté (literally \\"Free County\\", Frainc-Comtou dialect: \\"Fraintche-Comtè\\"; ) is a former administrative region and a traditional province of eastern France.

Summarize this article: Matthew Keys, former deputy social media editor for the Reuters news agency, was convicted Wednesday for his role in a conspiracy to hack Los Angeles Times and Tribune Co. servers. Keys, 28, who also was a web producer for KTXL Fox 40 in Sacramento, a Tribune-owned television station, provided members of the hacker group Anonymous with login information for Tribune servers in 2010. Though Keys faces up to 25 years in prison at his sentencing, U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman Lauren Horwood said prosecutors are \\"likely\\" to seek less than five years. Keys' attorney, Jay Leiderman, said they will appeal after Keys’ sentencing, which is scheduled for Jan. 20 in Sacramento. “He shouldn’t be doing a day in jail,” Leiderman said. “With love and respect, [The Times'] story was defaced for 40 minutes when someone found it and fixed it in three minutes. What do you want, a year a minute?” Keys, who works as a managing editor for Grasswire, a news curation website, said he will continue to report until his sentencing. Edward Snowden, who exposed the mass-surveillance practices of the National Security Agency, tweeted about Keys' potential sentence, followed by #PrisonPolicy. “I appreciate the support that everyone is sending my way,” Keys said in response. “This affects our ability to keep sources confidential. I hope they funnel that outrage and anger into progress.” In their indictment, federal prosecutors alleged Keys conspired with Anonymous members to access the Tribune Co.'s servers \\"for the purpose of learning how to alter and damage it.\\" According to federal authorities, Keys provided a username and password for Tribune servers to hackers in an online chat room after he left KTXL in late October 2010. A jury convicted Keys of one count of conspiracy to make changes to Tribune’s website and damage its computer systems, one count of transmitting malicious code and one count of attempting to transmit malicious code. With the information from Keys, prosecutors say, a hacker accessed a news story on The Times' website and changed a headline on a story about tax cuts to read: \\"Pressure builds in House to elect CHIPPY 1337.\\" \\"[T]hat was such a buzz having my edit on the LA Times,\\" the hacker, using the screen name \\"sharpie,\\" wrote to Keys, according to the indictment. \\"Nice,\\" Keys, using the screen name \\"AESCracked,\\" allegedly replied. Keys said he was using a virtual private network \\"to cover my tracks,\\" according to the indictment. Prosecutors wrote in the indictment that Tribune spent more than 5,000 responding to the attack and restoring its systems. According to the indictment, Keys conspired with hackers via a chat room known as \\"internetfeds.\\" Keys had written about gaining access to the chat room and communicating with hackers in a blog post for Reuters last year. Keys said the chat room was a \\"top secret\\" place where \\"elite hackers assembled.\\" \\"If there was a political or economic reason behind their mayhem, so much the better. If not, they did it for kicks,\\" he wrote of the hackers' motivations for their attacks. He wrote in the post about the hack on The Times' site, without acknowledging any personal involvement. Keys was fired from Reuters shortly after federal prosecutors launched their case against him, though the company said he was let go for social media activities. “Although this case has drawn attention because of Matthew Keys’ employment in the news media, this was simply a case about a disgruntled employee who used his technical skills to taunt and torment his former employer,” U.S. Atty. Benjamin Wagner said in a statement. “Although he did no lasting damage, Keys did interfere with the business of news organizations, and caused the Tribune Company to spend thousands of dollars protecting its servers. Those who use the Internet to carry out personal vendettas against former employers employers should know that there are consequences for such conduct.” In an interview with The Times following his conviction, Keys used an expletive to describe the government’s case against him and tweeted the same sentiment. He said prosecutors only went after him after he published information in 2011 that he gleaned from unnamed online sources, and refused to cooperate with federal investigators in a separate probe. “They would love it if journalists who get background or go into dark places would play ball in criminal investigations,” Keys said of prosecutors. “But we’re under no obligation to do that. That’s how we get out our stories – by protecting our sources.” ------------ FOR THE RECORD An earlier version of this post misquoted Keys as saying, \\"But we're under no obligation to do that. That's how we get out our sources - by protecting our sources.\\" It should have said, \\"But we're under no obligation to do that.

He had no part in the hacking of The Times site, in which the headline of an article was defaced, he said. “Are you guys really that offended?” Keys asked a Times reporter. “Shame on the Tribune Co. for being complicit in this.” U.S. Atty. Matthew Segal, lead prosecutor in the case, said Keys’ assertion that he was targeted by the government as retribution for his work and to have him reveal his sources was baseless. “It’s silly,” he said. Segal said Keys signed a confession and offered to cooperate with authorities. “Anybody with any doubt as to what happened here can read the statement that Keys wrote and gave to the FBI,” Segal said. “He admitted what he did and offered to cooperate.” Keys said that when FBI agents executed a search warrant at his home in 2012, he was under the influence of medication and was directed by an agent to write the statement. Keys said the statement was coerced and that he and his lawyers intend to address the issue on appeal. “It’s wrong to call it a confession,” he said. “Armed FBI agents who just pointed a gun at my face were telling me what to write.” ||||| TAKE ME UP ||||| An ex-Reuters employee has been found guilty of aiding members of Anonymous so they could hack his former employer, the Tribune Company. Matthew Keys, who was tried in Sacramento, was an online social media editor for the Reuters news agency when he was indicted in 2013 for allegedly providing a username and password to members of Anonymous to gain access to the server of his former employer, the Tribune Company. He allegedly encouraged the hackers to use the credentials to “go fuck some shit up.” Someone subsequently used the credentials to hack into the web site of the Los Angeles Times, which is owned by the Tribune Company, and change the headline of a story. Keys was indicted in the Eastern District of California with three counts—including conspiracy and the transmission of data to damage a computer. According to authorities, during a recorded FBI interview with Keys in October 2012 at his home, prior to his indictment, he admitted to his involvement in the hacking of the L.A. Times, and to sending a series of disparaging, sometimes threatening e-mails to a former employer. Keys waived his Miranda rights at the time of the interview and was concerned that the case not be publicized, apparently believing he might get off as a cooperating witness. “My concern is this eventually getting out there under my name, um, and I know that there are ways that, you know, like calling me a cooperating witness or, or something like that,” authorities say he told the FBI. “There’s, whatever in your ability to minimalize [sic] … the impact.” At the time, authorities used a search warrant to seize a laptop and two external hard drives from Keys. But Keys argued that the search warrant was unconstitutionally broad. He asked the court to suppress not only information obtained with the search warrant and other evidence, but also oral and written statements he made to the FBI. And although he waived his Miranda rights at the time of the interview, he claimed he did not do so “knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily” because earlier that morning he had taken double his prescribed dose of an anti-depression medication called Trazodone and had only had four hours of sleep when the FBI woke him to search his residence. The government argued, however, that it only took items specified in the warrant and that it authorized agents to “search, copy, image and seize” the items investigators took. Authorities say they needed to conduct a broad search of Keys laptop because the computer itself had been used in the alleged crime, and investigators were concerned that Keys might have moved or hidden evidence (.pdf). They cited a child pornography case as precedent for why broad searches are sometimes needed when the computer is part of the crime. In the end, a federal judge refused to dismiss the recorded confession and the computer evidence. Keys faces a possible sentence of up to 25 years. His sentencing hearing has been set for January 20. The headline of this story has been updated. Keys was convicted of helping Anonymous hack the Tribune Company, not Reuters. ||||| SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A well-known social media journalist was found guilty Wednesday of conspiring with the hacking group Anonymous to break into the Los Angeles Times' website and alter a story. Matthew Keys, 28, of Vacaville, was convicted of giving the group the login credentials to The Tribune Co.'s computer system. The company owns the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun and other media companies. He was fired by Tribune-owned FOX affiliate KTXL-TV in Sacramento two months before the Times' website was hacked, and federal prosecutors in Sacramento say he wanted payback. He was fired by the Reuters news agency after charges were filed in 2013. Prosecutors say a hacker used the login information that Keys posted in an Internet chat room to gain access to the Times' computer system and alter a December 2010 story. They say Keys encouraged the hacking and praised the results. His attorneys contended that any alteration was a relatively harmless prank that did not merit charges carrying a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in federal prison. As a first-time offender, prosecutors say Keys will face far less time at his Jan. 20 sentencing. Tor Ekeland, one of the defense attorneys, said in an email that Keys will appeal, but he did not comment further. \\"Although this case has drawn attention because of Matthew Keys' employment in the news media, this was simply a case about a disgruntled employee who used his technical skills to taunt and torment his former employer,\\" U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner said in a statement. Court documents say the hacking cost Tribune nearly 18,000 for the 333 hours that employees spent responding to the hack. But Keys' attorneys said restoring the original headline, byline and first paragraphs of the story took less than an hour and the cost falls below the 5,000 loss required to make the violation a felony. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A former employee of Reuters news agency, Matthew Keys, has been found guilty of helping a group of hackers called Anonymous break into a computer system owned by a media company called Tribune, and change a story on the Los Angeles Times website. Matthew might have to go to jail when he is sentenced for his actions. Some people are upset because they think the punishment is too harsh for what he did."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs.

Given the two facts above, what can be added to a solid to decrease its freezing point? Select from the following. [A]. oxygen [B]. ice [C]. an ion [D]. NaCl [E]. potash [F]. Acids [G]. sugar [H]. h2o Answer:","completion":"Answer: [D]. NaCl Explanation: Based on the given facts, we understand that adding salt to a solid decreases its freezing point, and salt is exemplified by NaCl (sodium chloride). Therefore, by adding NaCl to a solid, its freezing point will decrease. Let's dive deeper into why this happens. The process is known as freezing point depression, and it is a colligative property of solutions. Colligative properties are properties of solutions that depend on the ratio of solute to solvent particles but not on the nature of the particles themselves. When salt (NaCl) is added to a solid (such as ice or water), the dissolved salt molecules dissociate into ions: one sodium ion (Na+) and one chloride ion (Cl-). These ions spread throughout the solvent and disrupt the uniform arrangement of the solvent particles (in this case, water molecules), making it more difficult for the solid to form its crystalline lattice structure when freezing. As a result, the freezing point of the solution becomes lower than the freezing point of the pure solvent. In other words, more energy needs to be removed from the solution as the salt interferes with the solid's capacity to freeze. This characteristic is the primary reason why salt is often used on icy roads or walkways during winter as it lowers the freezing point of water, causing it to melt and preventing ice from forming. To summarize, given the facts provided, NaCl (sodium chloride) can be added to a solid to decrease its freezing point. The presence of the dissociated ions in the solution impacts its freezing point by making it more difficult for the solvent particles to come together and form a solid crystalline structure, which is ultimately the cause of the freezing point depression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The economy of the town is mostly agricultural, and the town is surrounded by vast cornfields. One particular year the corn crop fails and the people of Gatlin turn to prayer in an attempt to ensure a successful harvest. A 12-year-old young boy, Isaac Chroner, takes all the children of Gatlin into a cornfield and preaches to them about the prophecies of a strange, bloodthirsty incarnation of the Abrahamic God called \\"He Who Walks Behind The Rows\\". Isaac, through his 17-year-old lieutenant Malachai, leads the children in a revolution, brutally killing all of the adults in the town.

Baroness Margaret Thatcher appears to have been well-liked across the pond, as many American politicians have reflected on their respect of the now-deceased British leader. Among her admirers is former First Lady Nancy Reagan, the widow of President Ronald Reagan - who worked closely with the so-called Iron Lady. Reagan and Thatcher joined forces in the early 1980s and drastically changed the economic and political landscapes in both of their countries. Scroll down for video. 'Special relationship': Former First Lady Nancy Reagan (seen here in 1991) said she was too frail to attend Mrs Thatcher's funeral but she mourned her loss. Their calls for more-austere government and lower taxes still resonate with conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic. And their side-by-side standing up to. Soviet communism is credited by those of all political stripes as. hastening the end of the Cold War. Dynamic duo: Reagan and Thatcher's calls for more-austere government and lower taxes still resonate with conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic. Speaking to MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell yesterday, Mrs Reagan said that it wasn't just her husband who got along well with Mrs Thatcher, but she did as well. 'We had a very special relationship,' Mrs Reagan said via phone. 'I think people thought she and I didn't have a relationship. Nothing could be farther from the truth. And of course I loved it that she and Ronnie were as close as they were.' Also singing Thatcher's praises was President Barack Obama, who said that America 'has lost a true friend.' The kind words came amid the revelation that Thatcher died in the luxury suite at the Ritz where she had spent months recuperating after an operation. Britain's first and only female prime minister, who passed away peacefully at the age of 87 after suffering a massive stroke, had checked into the five star hotel at the start of the year following minor surgery on her bladder over Christmas. While a close-knit circle of friends. took it in turns to visit the increasingly frail 87-year-old at the. Belgravia hotel - a long-time favorite of the former leader's - it was a. solitary start to what would prove to be her final few months. She had been due to spend Christmas Day. with her niece Jane Mays, who lives in north east London, but was. admitted to hospital five days earlier for minor surgery to remove a. growth on her bladder. Iron Lady: Baroness Thatcher, who died today, was pictured on a bench in Battersea Park, London with her carers and a police officer. Ritz: Media and police were gathered outside the five star Ritz Hotel in London today, where Baroness Thatcher died after suffering a massive stroke. Her daughter Carol Thatcher, 59, was understood to be at her side in the hospital at Christmas time. After being discharged Baroness Thatcher was checked straight into a suite at the hotel in Belgravia amid concerns she would no longer be able to manage the stairs at her elegant four-story mansion. Staff at the hotel had invited her to make the Ritz her home for the foreseeable future, and her carers are understood to have been taking it in turns to stay with the 87-year-old. Yesterday Carol dashed home from Swiss ski resort Klosters, where she lives for part of the year, to be with her ailing mother, her neighbours said. The mother of two, who was Britain's. first and only female prime minister, had spent the previous two. Christmases without either Carol or her twin brother Sir Mark. Close. friends of the former prime minister said after she was discharged that. she was in 'sparkling form' following the procedure, but admitted the. experience had been 'very draining' for her. Home life: The former prime minister had spent recent Christmases without her children Carol (pictured with her mother) and Mark. The spell in hospital followed more than a decade of fragile health for Baroness Thatcher after she suffered a series of minor strokes in 2002. She had been suffering from acute short-term memory loss, which could make social gatherings an unsettling experience, and in recent years the once formidable Iron Lady had all but disappeared from public view. Alongside her health issues, in 2003 Baroness Thatcher suffered the devastating loss of her husband Denis, 88, who she had described as the 'golden thread running through my life.' The life-altering loss heralded the. start of a new chapter in her life, one in which she appeared to spend. increasing periods of time without her close family around her. Loved ones: Family was said to be essential in the life of Baroness Thatcher, who was mother to Carol, left, who rushed home from a ski trip in Klosters, Switzerland, yesterday, and Sir Mark, right. 'Golden thread': Baroness Thatcher's husband Denis died in 2003 at the age of 88 after suffering heart problems and pancreatic cancer. Although she was a mother of two, it was. with Mrs Mayes - the daughter of Baroness Thatcher's late older sister. Muriel - that she had been due to spend last Christmas before she fell. ill. She dined with Mrs Mayes and her family on Christmas Day 2011, while both Carol and Mark spent the festive season abroad. The former prime minister had credited her husband, who was 10 years her senior, as the man 'who has made everything possible.' Honoured: Baroness Thatcher will receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours, Downing Street has said. She met her husband while fighting the Dartford constituency - which she lost - in 1950. Denis, the director of a paint firm, helped the fledgeling politician by driving her around. They married in the autumn of 1951 when Baroness Thatcher was 26. As she went on to embark upon a career at the highest echelons of British politics, she relied on Denis as a constant source of discreet support. The pair had enjoyed an marriage lasting more than 50 years, but Baroness Thatcher's family life was not without moments of crisis. Some months after the death of her. husband she endured a second personal trauma when their son, Sir Mark,. was charged in August 2004 with plotting a coup to overthrow the. Government of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea - a charge which could, in its. extreme, have led to the death penalty. Baroness Thatcher, already suffering ill health, was deeply upset by the news about her son, to whom she was devoted. To her intense relief, he entered a guilty plea and was punished with a large fine and a suspended prison sentence. Baroness Thatcher was well enough to. celebrate her 87th birthday with Sir Mark, 59, and his wife at a London. restaurant last October. She had also enjoyed robust health during her term as Prime Minister. Unlike. her predecessor at 10 Downing Street, James Callaghan, Mrs Thatcher did. not have a doctor accompanying her on foreign trips. Days gone by: The then Conservative Party leader is seen strolling through the grounds of Scotney Castle in Kent with husband Denis and their twins Mark and Carol in 1979. Upsetting: Sir Mark is seen outside the High Court in Cape Town in 2004, after pleading guilty to charges of plotting a coup to overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea. Once, when she was asked by Lee Kuan Yew, who was prime minister of Singapore, why she did not travel with a doctor, she replied: 'I would have ended up looking after the doctor'. But in the past decade, she had become increasing frail. In 2002, she made her first concession to increasing age when she cut back her workload on the advice of doctors. Concern about her health had been growing and it emerged she had suffered a minor stroke shortly before New Year 2002 during her golden wedding anniversary holiday with Sir Denis Thatcher in Madeira. The series of minor strokes forced her to retire from public speaking. Despite this, in May 2004 - the 25th anniversary of her election as Prime Minister - she defied doctors' orders to speak at a dinner held in her honour, attacking the Blair Government and praising Michael Howard, then Tory leader. In 2008, Lady Thatcher succumbed to the heat at a dinner in the House of Lords and fainted. She was taken to nearby St Thomas's Hospital for tests, but was allowed to go home the following day. Recuperation: Baroness Thatcher started the year convalescing at the Ritz in central London after undergoing minor surgery over Christmas. Tributes: Notes and bouquets were piling up outside the former prime minister's home in London following the news of her death today. That year her daughter Carol admitted that her mother suffered from dementia. She said she first noticed her mother's previously formidable memory was failing in 2000 and she had to be repeatedly. reminded about the death of her husband, each time reacting to the sad. news as if it were the first time she had heard it. Baroness Thatcher died after. suffering from a stroke - a condition which kills around 45,000 people. every year in the UK - and is the third largest cause of death, after. heart disease and cancer. The risk of stroke rises. significantly with age. And 40,000 of those who die each year are over. the age of 75, according to the Stroke Association. Although men have a higher risk of stroke, women are one and a half times as likely to die from one.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","completion":"- Not impacting any step of the process The given question pertains to the process of filtration and waste removal by the kidneys. The question then changes the topic drastically to the seemingly unrelated subject of using less pancake mix. Unless a very obscure indirect relationship is implied in the scenario, the pancake mix does not have an obvious or understood influence on the kidney function or waste removal process. In our body, kidneys are the primary excretory organs which filtrate the blood and remove unnecessary or harmful metabolic substances produced by our body cells. These substances, combined with water, form the urine which is then expelled from our body. This urinary system process can be influenced by factors such as hydration, diet, physical health, and the presence of any diseases or disorders. When we consider the use of less pancake mix, we're stepping into the realms of nutrition and diet. Pancake mix might affect the body's nutritional intake like carbohydrates, sugars or fats, but it does not have a direct or known indirect effect on how the kidneys process and filter blood to create urine. Pancake mix could indirectly influence body processes through its nutritional content or lack thereof. But speaking strictly about the urinary system and kidney function, this would not drastically alter the described process. If perhaps we were considering a diet extremely high in sodium or protein, which could put additional strain on the kidneys and may potentially damage them over time, we might then be able to draw a hypothetical indirect relationship, but this also is not directly related to using less pancake mix either. In conclusion, since no proper relationship is specified between the use of less pancake mix and kidney function, we must assume that this does not impact any step of the filtration process or waste removal from the body by the kidneys, making it a perturbation that does neither directly nor indirectly impact any step of the involved process."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Step 2: Heat the water The water should be comfortably hot, but not scalding. You can heat the water using a kettle, a microwave, or let hot tap water flow into your bowl. Be careful not to burn yourself while handling hot water. Step 3: Wet the washcloth or towel Submerge the clean washcloth or towel in the hot water. Ensure the entire cloth is soaked with the hot water, which will help retain the heat for a longer period. Step 4: Wring out excess water Carefully wring out the excess water from the washcloth or towel by squeezing it. Remember not to twist or wring too tightly, as this can trap heat unevenly and make it too hot to apply on your skin. Step 5: Test the temperature Before applying the hot compress to your face, test its temperature by gently pressing it against the inside of your wrist or the back of your hand. Make sure it is warm and bearable to touch without causing any discomfort. Step 6: Apply the hot compress to the affected area Place the warm, wet washcloth or towel gently on the acne spot or the area of your skin you want to treat. Hold it there for about 10-15 minutes, or until the washcloth or towel loses heat. You can repeat this process multiple times a day to help soothe the pain and inflammation associated with acne. Step 7: Clean up After using the hot compress, wash the cloth or towel, and properly dispose of the water. If you used a plastic bag or microwave-safe container, clean and store them properly for future use. Step 8: Moisturize After the hot compress treatment, ensure you moisturize your skin to prevent dryness. Use a non-comedogenic (non-pore clogging) moisturizer suitable for your skin type to maintain skin health. Step 9: Maintain hygiene Continue to wash your hands regularly throughout the day and avoid touching your face to prevent spreading bacteria and dirt that can worsen acne. By following these steps and precautions, you can use a hot compress to help treat acne and promote better skin health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Background: The Khmer Krom (Khmer: khmaerkroom, Vietnamese: Kho Me Crom) are ethnically Khmer people living in the south western part of Vietnam, where they are recognized as one of Vietnam's fifty-three ethnic minorities. In the Khmer language, Krom means \\"lower\\" or \\"below\\", as it refers to an area of 89,000 square kilometres (34,363 sq mi) around modern day Saigon and the Mekong Delta, which used to be the southeasternmost territory of the Khmer Empire until its incorporation into Vietnam under the Nguyen lords in the early 18th century. This marks the final stage of the Vietnamese \\"March to the South\\" (nam tien). Context: In the 17th century a weakened Khmer state left the Mekong Delta poorly administered after repeated warfare with Siam. Concurrently Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Trinh-Nguyen War in Vietnam migrated into the area. In 1623 Cambodian king Chey Chettha II (1618-1628) officially sanctioned the Vietnamese immigrants to operate a custom house at Prey Nokor, then a small fishing village. The settlement steadily grew soon becoming a major regional port, attracting even more settlers. In 1698 the Nguyen Lords of Hue commissioned Nguyen Huu Canh, a Vietnamese noble to organize the territory along Vietnamese administrative lines, thus by de facto detaching it from the Kingdom of Cambodia and incorporating it into Vietnam. With the loss of the port of Prey Nokor, then renamed Sai Gon, Cambodia's control of the area grew increasingly tenuous while increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers to the Delta isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from the Cambodian kingdom. By 1757 the Vietnamese had absorbed the provinces of Psar Dek (renamed Sa Dec in Vietnamese) on the Mekong itself, and Moat Chrouk (Vietnamized to Chau Doc) on the Bassac River. Minh Mang enacted assimilation policies upon the Khmer such as forcing them to adopt Sino-Vietnamese surnames, culture, and clothing. Minh Mang sinicized ethnic minorities including the Cambodians, in line with Confucianism as he diffused Vietnamese culture with China's Han civilization using the term Han people Han Ren for the Vietnamese. Minh Mang declared that \\"We must hope that their barbarian habits will be subconsciously dissipated, and that they will daily become more infected by Han [Sino-Vietnamese] customs.\\" These policies were directed at the Khmer and hill tribes. On June 4, 1949 the French President Vincent Auriol signed the accord reincorporating Cochinchina to Vietnam. This was done without consulting the indigenous Khmer-Krom. The legal transfer of control cut Cambodia off from the sea via the Mekong River as the Delta administered by an independent Vietnam. Left within the borders of Vietnam were the communities of Khmer people, nowadays Khmer Krom. Question: What did Khmer do? Answer:","completion":"The Khmer people, specifically the Khmer Krom, are an ethnically Khmer group living in the southwestern part of Vietnam. Over the years, they have faced cultural assimilation policies, territorial annexation, and challenges in retaining their unique identity within the Vietnamese state. Some of the significant actions taken by the Khmer Krom throughout history include: 1. Managing the Mekong Delta: In the 17th century, the Khmer people managed the Mekong Delta, though with weakened administrative capacity due to repeated warfare with neighboring Siam. 2. Allowing Vietnamese migration: Under Cambodian King Chey Chettha II, the Khmer allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing from the Trinh-Nguyen War in Vietnam to settle in the area and operate a custom house at Prey Nokor, which eventually evolved into a major regional port, attracting more settlers. 3. Losing control over territory: Over time, the Khmer people lost control over the Mekong Delta region, as Vietnamese settlers continued to migrate and establish themselves in the area. The Nguyen Lords of Hue commissioned Nguyen Huu Canh to organize the territory along Vietnamese administrative lines, thereby detaching it from Cambodia and incorporating it into Vietnam. 4. Enduring assimilation policies: During the reign of Vietnamese Emperor Minh Mang, the Khmer, along with other ethnic minority groups, faced assimilation policies that aimed to make them adopt Sino-Vietnamese culture and customs. This included changes to their clothing, surnames, and daily practices, making it increasingly difficult for the Khmer people to maintain their unique identity. 5. Facing territorial annexation: In 1949, the French President Vincent Auriol signed an accord reincorporating Cochinchina into Vietnam without consulting the indigenous Khmer Krom people. This resulted in the loss of access to the sea via the Mekong River, cutting Cambodia off from its critical maritime resources and leaving the Khmer Krom people within the borders of Vietnam. Throughout these historical events, the Khmer Krom people have persevered in the face of assimilation, annexation, and the gradual erosion of their unique cultural identity. Despite these challenges, they continue to remain a part of Vietnam's diverse ethnic landscape and strive to preserve their Khmer heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 23 January 1995. Toadie was created by writer Elizabeth Packett. Moloney had previously auditioned for another role in the show and had played a minor character, before being cast as Toadie. Toadie's nickname was derived from the toadfishes of Australia. The serial's official website described a young Toadie as \\"fun-loving, mischievous and the class clown.\\" TV Week branded Toadie \\"another troubled-teen-turned-good\\" who was \\"fond of a practical joke\\". Soap opera reporting website, Holy Soap, said he was \\"initially a bit of a layabout\\" that \\"got his act together and qualified as a lawyer.\\" He also observed him as coming in \\"as a rough bloke and now he's a nancy.\\" Toadie is portrayed as an \\"unlucky in love character\\". He would often be played as the \\"third-wheel\\" alongside Billy Kennedy (Jesse Spencer), who was more popular with female characters. In 2003, Moloney said: \\"Billy always got the chicks and it annoyed me because I wanted a chance at pashing someone... and now it's all making up for lost time.\\" Moloney said when Toadie is \\"not in love and when he's not heartbroken\\" he has the ability to do anything he wants. Toadie's persona is similar to Moloney's in the sense that they both \\"mess around\\". He further added, \\"In fact he is me, seeing how much fun and frivolity I can get away with.\\" Molony documented Toadie changing from \\"a bit of a bad boy\\" into a \\"lawyer who's supposedly a responsible member of the community.\\" He felt that to begin with Toadie was not a good lawyer, because many his clients would receive prison sentences. On Toadie's professionalism, Moloney said he is the type of lawyer that \\"probably likes to take his pants off behind the desk.\\" Toadie's image has changed repeatedly during his tenure. When he first appeared in 1995, he had long hair. He used to style a mullet similar to Scott Robinson's (Jason Donovan) hairstyle. Moloney jested that it appeared as though a possum was on his head.

The waterfall's towering measurements and spectacular drop make it the tallest waterfall in the world, unchallenged by any other known falls. Interestingly, Angel Falls is named after Jimmy Angel, a US aviator, who, as per various accounts, was the first to fly over the falls in mid-20th century. However, the indigenous Pemon people had known the falls for centuries and called it Kerepakupai Meru, meaning \\"waterfall of the deepest place\\", or Parakupá Vená, meaning \\"the fall from the highest point\\".

Scroll down for video of Hill on Match of the Day... and as a linesman. Jimmy Hill presenting the BBC's Match of the Day in 1981 - he racked up 600 appearances on the show. At his best: Hill scores for Fulham against Manchester United in 1958. Sporting icon: Once a successful footballer and manager, Jimmy Hill, pictured in 1964, also became chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association in 1957. VIDEO: Hill introduces Match of the Day. It was one of the most seismic changes in football and meant that players not clubs controlled their earning power. Hill's Fulham team-mate Johnny Haynes was the first English player to earn £100 a week. That has arguably led to the player power of today, with stars such as Wayne Rooney and Yaya Toure earning upwards of £200,000 a week. Hill is fondly remembered in Coventry after an innovative spell as manager, during which he changed the colour of the club's kit and their nickname to the Sky Blues. This is still in use. He was also chairman of Coventry, and at Fulham and Charlton. If that wasn't enough, he once even ran the line at a First Division game at Highbury in 1972 after an official was injured and an appeal went out over the PA system for a replacement. He is probably better remembered now for his career as a broadcaster and he presented Match of the Day more than 600 times. Hill moved to Sky Sports in 1999 and fronted Jimmy Hill's Sunday Supplement, a panel show on which journalists discuss the football topics of the day. Jimmy Hill and Bryony at Buckingham Palace in 1995 - he received both an OBE and a CBE. The 85-year-old was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2008 but his condition was made public on Sunday by his youngest son Jamie, 46, and. his daughter Joanna, 50, who are his two children from his second. marriage. There is a legal wrangle concerning his welfare. Hill gave joint powers of. attorney to his current wife Bryony, 62, and a solicitor in 2005, when. he was still in good health. His five children from his two previous marriages only discovered the. existence of the legal document in 2008, when Hill was deemed by doctors. to be too ill to look after himself. It. was only then that the law required that his children be informed that. powers of attorney had been granted to Mrs Hill and the solicitor. As a result, none of his children has any say over his future treatment or the management of his assets. Jimmy Hill pictured at a Fulham v Chelsea match in 2006 - he was diagnosed in 2008, but his condition only came to light at the weekend. Mr. Hill Jnr, a property consultant and fitness coach who lives in west. London told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘He is the most sprightly physical specimen in the home, but his mind is not what it was. The home is the best place for him. That is not my complaint. ‘My concern is we only discovered in 2008 that power of attorney had been signed three years earlier. We said in 2008 that if Bryony’s lawyer steps aside and one of us children has joint power of attorney, we will be happy. ‘Unfortunately, that was declined. We were told they had considered giving one of the children power of attorney in 2005, but decided against because it would have been too difficult to choose just one.’ Mr Hill Jnr has raised the issue with his local MP, Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary, who passed his concerns to Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor. Joanna Hill, who lives in Mexico, added: ‘It is a shame that we as his children have no rights over his treatment and care. ‘Children whose parents have married more than once should be made aware that they will be unable to influence their affairs if they register a power of attorney. Hill’s wife Bryony was unavailable for comment on Sunday. In his heyday as a TV presenter: Jimmy Hill, left, pictured with another presenter with a famous chin, Bruce Forsyth.

News article: A regular bedtime schedule is unquestionably helpful for parents, but a new study has found it that it may be even more beneficial for their children. British researchers interviewed mothers when their children were ages 3, 5 and 7, asking how often their children had a regular bedtime: always, usually, sometimes or never. The mothers and the children’s teachers also completed questionnaires about behavioral difficulties. Almost 20 percent of 3-year-olds had no regular bedtime, compared with 9.1 percent of 5-year-olds and 8.2 percent of 7-year-olds. After controlling for many social, economic and parental behavioral factors, the scientists found that children with a regular bedtime, whether early or late, had fewer behavioral problems. And the longer irregular bedtimes persisted, the more severe the difficulties were. The study, published Monday in Pediatrics, also found that children who had irregular bedtimes at ages 3 and 5 had significant improvements in behavior scores if their bedtime was regular by age 7. Still, the lead author, Yvonne Kelly, a professor of lifecourse epidemiology at University College London, warned against exaggerating the importance of the findings. “Getting kids into a regular bedtime routine does appear to have important impacts on behavioral development,” she said. “But there are lots of things that have beneficial effects. Having a regular bedtime is only one of them.” ||||| It has long been considered the parental holy grail – a regular bedtime, adhered to by compliant children. But steady bedtimes can mean more than a few hours of peace for the adults, according to research which shows that children put to bed at the same time each day are significantly less likely to misbehave. Children with erratic bedtimes are more likely to have behavioural problems – including hyperactivity, problems with peers and emotional difficulties – and demonstrate symptoms similar to jet lag. For children who go for longer periods without a regular bedtime, there is a more pronounced impact, caused by disruptions to natural body rhythms that can cause sleep deprivation. This in turn has been found to undermine the way the brain matures and children's ability to behave well, according to a study of more than 10,000 children carried out by University College London (UCL). But the impact of erratic sleep patterns was not found to be irreversible: parents who started putting their children to bed at consistent times noticed an improvement in their behaviour, as did teachers. The data was collected via the UK Millennium Cohort Study, with bedtimes noted at ages three, five and seven, and information on behaviour collected from parents and teachers. Three-year-olds were the most likely to have erratic bedtimes, with one in five children going to bed at varying times. But by age seven, more than half of children went to bed regularly between 7.30pm and 8.30pm. Children who had changeable bedtimes between the ages of three and five displayed better behaviour by age seven if their bedtimes had become more regular. If erratic bedtimes were not tackled, however, parents could expect their child's behaviour to progressively deteriorate. Professor Yvonne Kelly, from UCL's department of epidemiology and public health, said early child development was well known to have profound influences on health and wellbeing throughout a lifetime. \\"Not having fixed bedtimes, accompanied by a constant sense of flux, induces a state of body and mind akin to jet lag and this matters for healthy development and daily functioning,\\" she said. \\"It follows that disruptions to sleep, especially if they occur at key times in development, could have important lifelong impacts on health.What we've shown is that these effects build up incrementally over childhood, so that children who always had irregular bedtimes were worse off than those children who did have a regular bedtime at one or two of the ages when they were surveyed.\\" The study found that children whose bedtimes were irregular or who went to bed after 9pm were likely to come from more socially disadvantaged backgrounds. They were also more likely to have poor routines such as skipping breakfast, not being read to daily, having a television in their bedroom and spending longer in front of a TV than children with earlier bedtimes. The research, published in the journal Pediatrics, said: \\"Family routines can be difficult to maintain when parents are working long and potentially unsociable hours, thus policy development is needed to better support families to provide conditions in which young children can flourish.\\" Kelly added: \\"As it appears the effects of inconsistent bedtimes are reversible, one way to try to prevent this would be for healthcare providers to check for sleep disruptions as part of routine healthcare visits. Given the importance of early childhood development on subsequent health, there may be knockon effects across the life course. Therefore, there are clear opportunities for interventions aimed at supporting family routines that could have important lifelong impacts.\\" ||||| Kids with regular bedtimes tend to behave better, a new study finds. Young children who don't have a regular bedtime behave worse than kids who go to sleep at the same time each night, a new study suggests. British researchers found that both mothers and teachers rated 7-year-olds who had inconsistent bedtimes as being more hyperactive than their better-rested peers, and as having more social, emotional and conduct problems. The results also revealed that behavior grew worse the more years a child spent without a firm bedtime. But the good news is that children's behavior noticeably improved when they switched to a scheduled bedtime. \\"This is a very well-done study that in many ways reaffirms what we already know about a lack of sleep,\\" said Dr. Carolyn D'Ambrosio, director of the sleep center at Tufts Medical Center and the Floating Hospital for Children in Boston, who was not involved in the research. She said the findings clearly show an association between kids behaving better and a regular bedtime. [10 Scientific Tips for Raising Happy Kids] The study is published online today (Oct. 14) in the journal Pediatrics. Sleepy kids In the study, researchers looked at data from more than 10,000 children enrolled in the Millennium Cohort Study, a long-term study of babies born in the U.K. in 2001 and 2002. When children were ages 3, 5 and 7, their mothers filled out questionnaires describing whether the child went to sleep at a regular time on weeknights during the school year, and what that bedtime was. In addition, mothers and teachers evaluated 7-year-olds' behavior, assessing their conduct, relationships with classmates, emotional symptoms and hyperactivity levels. Researchers found that almost 9 percent of the 7-year-olds lacked a regular bedtime. Having an irregular sleep schedule had the greatest effect on a child's behavior, but kids with later bedtimes also tended to behave worse. D'Ambrosio said the study findings strengthen the argument for a consistent bedtime for children because there were a large number of kids involved in the research, and their behavior was rated at three different ages. For both kids and adults, \\"when people are sleep-deprived, they are a little bit moodier, have a shorter temper and their normal physiological processes aren't as finely tuned,\\" D'Ambrosio said. \\"Kids don't say they're tired, they typically act it out -- most commonly by being hyperactive,\\" she said. In fact, the study found that erratic bedtimes had the strongest influence on children's hyperactivity levels, as judged by their mothers and teachers. A lack of sleep also shows up in a child's school performance, moodiness, eating habits and as behavioral issues, D'Ambrosio said. Bedtime tips Having nighttime routines and a regular bedtime adds structure and consistency to a child's schedule, D'Ambrosio said. An enforced bedtime helps kids to function their best the next day, and to get a regular amount of sleep. Kids ages 5 to 7 need 10 to 12 hours a night, she said. This means enough sleep to get through all stages of sleep, which have important functions that regulate the body: For example, deep sleep helps people to wake up feeling refreshed, while REM sleep helps to improve memory skills. Sufficient shut-eye is also critical for children because their young brains are still developing. D'Ambrosio advised parents to start the process of regular bedtimes early in a child's life. This process involves letting children know when bedtime is coming and beginning their nightly routines -- brushing teeth, bathing, putting on pajamas, reading a story, dimming lights and allowing children to have a comfort item, such as a stuffed animal but limiting stimulating distractions, including a TV or iPad. \\"Pick a bedtime that works for you and your family,\\" she recommended. \\"It may not work every night, but just keep trying.\\" D'Ambrosio also suggested that kids have consistent bedtime schedules, even on weekends and during the summer. She is quick to remind parents that \\"sleep is one of the most important things you can do for a child's health and behavior.\\" Follow LiveScience @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

Answer:","completion":"Given the aforementioned facts, the substance that can be changed from smooth to compacted by physical force is 'foil'. The term 'crumple', particularly in the context provided, generally refers to the process of transforming a smooth item into a compact, wrinkled, or crumpled state, mostly by squeezing, bending, or crushing it. To break it down, let's examine each option: 1. Roads - Roads can be deformed due to physical forces, but they do not crumple in the sense suggested by the context above. 2. Dirt - Dirt can be compacted but not crumpled. When you apply force, it just compresses but doesn't form the characteristic wrinkles associated with crumpling. 3. H2O - H2O, or water, cannot be crumpled as it is a fluid and does not have a fixed shape. 4. Soils - Similar to dirt, soils can be compacted, but they cannot be crumpled since they lack the flexible, yet rigid nature needed for something to be crumpled. 5. Foil - Foil, such as aluminum foil, can easily be crumpled. It is initially smooth and when physical force like squeezing is applied, it changes shape, becoming compact and uneven. Once the force is removed, it maintains its crumpled shape. Therefore, it fits both the definition of \\"crumple\\" and the actions specified in Fact 2. 6. Wood - Wood, due to its rigid structure and composition, cannot be crumpled. It may be broken or split due to physical force, but not crumpled. 7.

Once he decided he must only eat meat that he had killed himself -- an admirable, if quirky, resolution for any vigorous young man with a rifle. Another time he decided to learn Mandarin Chinese -- not a simple task. I wonder how that turned out? Now he's vowed to start a book club, hoping to channel the reading attention of the millions who follow him on Facebook. I like his latest idea a lot: Anything that gets people reading and talking about books is a good thing. If I were Mr. Zuckerberg, I would aim for books that can be read slowly and carefully by busy people in their spare time, choosing ones with the capacity to enlarge their sense of what it means to be human and to live respectfully and generously among others. Which ones would you pick? Here are 10 books that have meant a good deal to me -- a mix of fiction and nonfiction:. 1.\\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\\" by Mark Twain. This is the primary text of American literature, high on any serious list of world classics. It's a book about the American soul, about race and community, and about the urgent need to \\"light out for the territory.\\" As Huck and Jim float down the Mississippi on their quest for freedom, they take every reader of this truly great novel with them, forever. 2.\\"The Death of Ivan Ilyich,\\" by Leo Tolstoy. Written after Tolstoy's conversion to his own idiosyncratic version of Christianity, this short Russian novel brings us face to face with mortality. Each of us, sooner or later, will die. In the process of dying, Tolstoy's lead character comes to terms with his life and its meaning, which is made all the more vivid as it fades. 3.\\"July's People,\\" by Nadine Gordimer. This slim, intense novel appeared in 1981, not so long before apartheid had ended in South Africa. It imagined a violent finale to that conflict between blacks and whites -- an ending that (fortunately) didn't materialize. Yet this novel remains a strong evocation of cultural and racial differences; the sort of book that helps to explain racial divides that continues to haunt us. 4.\\"Walden,\\" by Henry David Thoreau. Another great American book, one that makes the vital connection between spirit and nature. It's an autobiographical masterpiece as well; the story of one man's quest for meaning in the wilderness. It's a wry, touching, eloquent evocation of human consciousness as well as conscience. Nobody can afford NOT to read this book slowly, carefully, more than once. 5.\\"Things Fall Apart,\\" by Chinua Achebe. This fine African novel has been justifiably chosen by millions of readers as a book that gloriously summons the social, cultural and intensely personal situation of modern Africans living in the wake of colonial power. Achebe saw his fellow Nigerians as individuals caught in a web of social relations, delineated here with clarity and confidence. 6.\\"Tao Te Ching,\\" by Laozi, translated by Stephen Mitchell. This Chinese classic is one of the most influential books I have encountered in half a century of reading. The art of living is beautifully unfolded here in 81 tiny chapters. The author invites us to conform to the Tao itself, the universal principle of being, and his book teaches us how to live with ourselves and with others, how to govern a nation, a family, ourselves. It is a book to live with and learn from, decade after decade. 7.\\"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,\\" by Annie Dillard. This lovely work of American autobiography is about paying attention to one's surroundings. Dillard explores the natural world around her home in the Blue Ridge Mountains, moving through the seasons, coming to terms with her own solitude, her sense of vocation as a writer, and her understanding of what faith means. It's a book that should be read in tandem with Thoreau's \\"Walden.\\" 8.\\"What Is God?\\" by Jacob Needleman. A philosopher and religious scholar, Needleman writes about his own spiritual journey from atheism to a more complex understanding of the source of all being. Needleman asks: \\"Who is wise?\\" His answer is: \\"one who learn from everything and everyone.\\" This book asks, even answers, many of the basic questions about being human, drawing on a wide range of religious traditions. 9.\\"Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution,\\" by Adrienne Rich. Published in 1976, this eloquent meditation on motherhood is told from the viewpoint of one of the finest American poets of the 20th century. It's a landmark study, a foundational book in modern feminist thought, and well worth reading, then rereading. 10.\\"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\\" by Gabriel García Márquez. The longest book on my list, but nobody can afford to ignore it. My old mentor, the Scottish poet Alastair Reid, used to say that anyone who hasn't read this book is still an intellectual virgin. Márquez tells the story of a single family in a remote village in Colombia. But this story is the human story writ small, the story of history itself, with its inevitable repetitions, its recurring ghosts, grounded in the nearly untranslatable poetry of human feeling. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article are: 1. Mark Zuckerberg's New Year resolution to start a book club and encourage people to read and discuss books. 2. The author's suggestion for Zuckerberg to choose books that can be read slowly and carefully by busy people, and those that can expand their understanding of humanity and living respectfully among others. 3. The list of 10 recommended books, which include both fiction and nonfiction, as well as their brief descriptions: a. \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" by Mark Twain b. \\"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\\" by Leo Tolstoy c. \\"July's People\\" by Nadine Gordimer d. \\"Walden\\" by Henry David Thoreau e. \\"Things Fall Apart\\" by Chinua Achebe f. \\"Tao Te Ching\\" by Laozi, translated by Stephen Mitchell g. \\"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek\\" by Annie Dillard h. \\"What Is God?\\" by Jacob Needleman i. \\"Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution\\" by Adrienne Rich j. \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" by Gabriel García Márquez These books are presented as meaningful, thought-provoking works that can help readers understand various facets of humanity and the world in which they live."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Movie is a fifty-minute concept film directed by cult movie director Richard Stanley. It is Stanley's stark vision of a young life in the 90's inspired by Marillion's album of the same name, which centres around a teenage girl who is found wandering in a state of amnesia on the Severn Bridge, and her consequent search for her past.

Given the question \\"How would Riley feel afterwards?\\", is \\"happiness\\" a valid answer? Select from: (a). Yes (b). No Answer:","completion":"(a). Yes The response \\"happiness\\" is indeed a valid answer to the question \\"How would Riley feel afterwards?\\" after seeing monkeys playing on the bars at the zoo. The scenario described in the question portrays a positive and entertaining scene, wherein Riley witnesses monkeys engaging in playful and exciting behavior on the bars. Such instances are likely to evoke feelings of joy, amusement, and delight, all of which can be encompassed within the term \\"happiness.\\" Observing the playfulness of the monkeys can not only inspire happiness in Riley due to the sheer entertainment value in the animals' antics, but also it may pique Riley's curiosity and interest in the monkeys' natural behavior and group dynamics. This engagement might further contribute to the uplifting and enjoyable experience of watching the animals in their zoo habitat. The joyful atmosphere that's often present at zoos, alongside the opportunity to learn about and interact with a variety of animals, lends itself to fostering a positive experience for visitors, reinforcing the validity of \\"happiness\\" as a likely emotion for Riley in this particular situation. It is important to note, however, that human emotions can be complex and varied, and \\"happiness\\" may not always be a one-size-fits-all answer for similar scenarios. While we can claim that happiness, in general, would be a valid answer, it is crucial to recognize the subjective nature of emotions and how individual experiences may differ. For example, some may argue that Riley's emotional response to watching the monkeys could be tempered by empathy for the animals' captivity or concern for their well-being depending on Riley's opinions on zoos. Nevertheless, within the context of the question and based on the joyful scene portrayed, \\"happiness\\" remains a valid answer to explain Riley's feelings after observing the monkeys playing on the bars at the zoo."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Supérieur / moyenne: This phrase means \\"upper / average.\\" The term \\"supérieur\\" signifies the upper or higher values within the dataset. In contrast, \\"moyenne\\" refers to the average or mean value of the data. The average is calculated by adding all the values in the dataset and dividing the sum by the total number of values.

Question: \\"Who is the most at risk for exploitation under their current rules?\\" Context: \\"Jehovah's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization. The religion has been criticized for its \\"two witness rule\\" for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that \\"the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah's hands\\". A former member of the church’s headquarters staff, Barbara Anderson, says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation, \\"which is an impossibility\\". Anderson says the policies \\"protect pedophiles rather than protect the children.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children, adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The most at risk for exploitation under Jehovah's Witnesses' current rules are the victims of sexual abuse, particularly children. The \\"two witness rule\\" makes it challenging for victims to prove their allegations, especially in situations where the abuse took place in private without another witness present. This requirement potentially enables abusers to escape from accountability and continue perpetrating abuse within the religious organization. The individuals involved in such abuse cases may also face additional obstacles under the current rules. Elders are instructed to leave the matter in Jehovah's hands if there is not sufficient evidence or corroboration to back up the allegations, distorting the process of addressing the abuse. Moreover, the policy to educate parents and not to sponsor activities that separate children from parents may not be sufficient to prevent abuse. It is crucial to establish an appropriate reporting procedure and a supportive environment for the victims, both of which may be lacking in Jehovah's Witnesses organization due to their policies. In conclusion, the most at risk for exploitation under the current Jehovah's Witnesses rules are those who experience sexual abuse, with the mentioned policies and culture potentially providing a safe haven for abusers while hindering any necessary intervention, support, or assimilation of responsibility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I usually stop here on my way to work grabbing my usual Iced Latte with a 7-grain bagel or a bacon egg cheese bagel sandwich. This is seriously some of the best coffee that you'll find in the Highlands. You'll get freshly roasted coffee from Peru, Antigua and many other international special blends. All of their food is made to order, made with local ingredients and made in house. The egg and cheese bagel with bacon, ham and cheese croissant, blueberry cream muffin are among my favorite eats.The shop is very quaint and cozy. There is a usually a great mix of people working on their computers, people catching up with old friends, and impersonal business meetings. It's definitely quiet enough in there to get work done or study, if needed.Everyone that works here is super friendly, including Leo, Caitlin and Mariana, who are always so full of great energy and optimism in the mornings.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Marquee Moon was released on February 8, 1977, in the United States and on March 4 in the United Kingdom, where it was an unexpected success and reached number 28 on the country's albums chart. The record's two singles—the title track and \\"Prove It\\"—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent's rave two-page review of the album for NME.While holidaying in London after Marquee Moon's completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on NME's front cover and notified Elektra's press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving.In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist Chris Stein said that Television were \\"so competitive\\" and unaccommodating on the tour, and that they did not treat it like a joint effort. He recalled one show where \\"all our equipment was shoved up at the [Glasgow] Apollo and we had like three feet of room so that [Verlaine] could stand still in this vast space.\\"By the time of Television's return to the US, Elektra had given up on promoting Marquee Moon, which they dismissed as a commercial failure. Marquee Moon sold fewer than 80,000 copies in the US and failed to chart on the Billboard 200. The group was dispirited by their inability to meet...

The robotic submarine was developed by researchers at the University of Washington. It is about 1.8 meters long and weighs about 52 kilograms. It moves through water at a speed of up to 20-25 kilometers a day and can stay at sea for up to six months before needing a battery recharged. This special character results from its special propulsion system . Unlike a traditional submarine, the Seaglider does not have a propeller . It has an air tank that is emptied and filled to adjust depth, as well as a pair of wings that help to guide and lead the submarine. A traditional submarine, on the other hand, \\"puts water inside tanks to make it heavier, or it will expel the water to make it lighter,\\" explained Frederick, a professor at the University of Washington. Each time the Seaglider comes to the surface, it sends the data which it collects to its controllers by satellite. Operators can also send the submarine new information. For example, they can change its course in their office through giving the computer orders. Seagliders are already being used for scientific research, such as environmental studies. iRobot also hopes to sell the submarine to the military . At 100,000 each, the Seaglider is a cheap way to keep an eye on the ocean. \\"These things can go out there and monitor large areas of ocean because they're very persistent.

Premise: A man relaxes lying down on the grass at a park area, between two trees, facing a small lake, with buildings and cars visible across the lake. Hypothesis: monkey eats orange .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"When analyzing the scenario given in the premise, there are many potential elements that could exist within that scene. However, not all of them can be necessarily concluded from the premise. The premise describes the following: a man is relaxing at a park, lying down on the grass between two trees, in front of a small lake, with buildings and cars visible in the distance across the lake. The hypothesis states: a monkey eats an orange. To determine whether the hypothesis can be concluded from the premise, we must examine each element and consider whether it can be logically inferred from the information provided. In order to conclude the hypothesis as true, we must be able to establish that there is, in fact, a monkey present at the scene, and this monkey is consuming an orange. 1. Presence of a monkey: The premise does not specifically mention the presence of a monkey in the scene. While it is not impossible for a monkey to be present at a park, the scenario does not provide any information to support this claim. Parks often have various wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other small animals, but the presence of a monkey would depend on the location and type of park, which is not described in the premise. 2. Monkey eating an orange: Given that there is no mention of a monkey in the premise, there is no basis for concluding that a monkey is eating an orange. Additionally, even if we knew a monkey was present, their eating habits and specific food choices are not part of the information provided. Upon examining these two elements, we can acknowledge that the hypothesis cannot be concluded from the premise. The presence of a monkey and its consumption of an orange are not supported by the information provided in the premise.

Tim Warden, a boy with autism, has supposedly witnessed his parents' double murder. Jake Rainer, a former child psychiatrist turned therapist, is called on to probe the child's mind in order to solve the case. The psychological drama is provided by the fact that not even Jake can entice Tim to communicate what he has or has not seen regarding the crime. Tim's sister, Sylvie, is protective of him. She eventually warms to Jake's efforts, but is concerned when she learns he was implicated in the suicide of another young child who was under his care. Jake gradually befriends Tim. At first, Jake thinks that Tim is trying to communicate by cutting up playing cards, but Sylvie reveals that Tim is good at mimicking voices. Jake is able to trigger Tim's memory so that Tim mimics the voices he heard on the night of the murder by using the trigger phrase \\"God Damn,\\" which were the first words Tim heard from the murder. He attempts to piece together the chronology of the murder, suspecting that Tim interrupted a fight between his parents and an intruder. Sheriff Mitch Rivers threatens to use drugs to get Tim to talk about the murder and Dr. Rene Harlinger successfully hypnotizes Tim into breaking down a locked door. The police chief, seeing this as proof of Tim's strength, concludes that Tim was the murderer, after finding photographs showing that Tim's father was molesting him.

Andersen had driven through the Canyon hundreds of times over the years. The weather was fine-but the higher they drove, the more slippery the roads became. Rounding a sharp U-turn at mile marker473, Andersen saw a truck that had skated off the road and immediately tapped his brakes. In an instant, the car was sliding at 25 miles per hour toward the shoulder of the highway, then rolling down a steep ten-foot dam toward the extremely cold Logan River. As it hit the water, the car tipped toward the passenger side, hesitated, and then rolled onto its roof and sank into the river. There was no time to tell the kids what to do.

As the pressure begins to rise, the attractive forces cause the volume of the gas to be less than expected and the value of drops under 1. Continued pressure increase results in the volume of the particles to become significant and the value of rises to greater than 1.

The term \\"bicyclist\\" directly implies that the individual is a person who is riding a bicycle. The grass field refers to the grassy field that the bicyclist is riding on. 2. \\"wearing a red and yellow uniform\\": This part of the statement describes the attire of the person riding the bicycle. The uniform color is not directly relevant to the conclusion, but it helps in painting a descriptive image of the scene. It does not change the fact that a person is riding a bicycle. 3. \\"shades\\": The term \\"shades\\" refers to sunglasses, which is another detail about the bicyclist's attire. Although not relevant to the conclusion, it adds another descriptive element to the situation. 4. \\"and a helmet\\": The use of a helmet by the bicyclist is an essential piece of information for safety reasons. Although it does not significantly impact the conclusion, it does imply that the rider is taking necessary safety precautions while riding the bicycle. Combining all these details, the conclusion \\"A person rides a bicycle over a grassy field\\" is supported by the initial statement. The statement describes a scene in which a bicyclist is riding on a grass field. The additional details about the uniform, shades, and helmet do not change the fact that a person is riding a bicycle on the grassy field but rather provides more context, visual appeal, and safety concerns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The phrase suggests that Angela Merkel, a German politician, was leading in some context, possibly an election or political poll, and has managed to leave her rivals feeling embarrassed due to her significant lead. Step 2: Research to gather more relevant details To expand on this topic and write a coherent text, we can research Angela Merkel's political career, her party's performance in recent elections or political polls, and the reactions of her rivals. This information will help us establish a timeline and context for the text. Step 3: Organize information Structure the gathered information in a logical order, beginning with a brief introduction to Angela Merkel and the specific situation in which she is ahead, followed by a mention of her rivals and their embarrassment as a result of her performance. Step 4: Create the text Title: Angela Merkel Surges Ahead in Germany, Leaving Rivals Embarrassed Angela Merkel, the former German Chancellor and leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has once again demonstrated her political prowess by taking the lead in recent polls, leaving her rivals trailing behind and feeling embarrassed. Merkel, who held the position of Chancellor for 16 years, has been admired worldwide for her leadership and commitment to the European Union. Evidently, her popularity has remained strong among German citizens despite her departure from office, as recent polls indicate a significant lead for the CDU in comparison to other major parties. This upward trend for the CDU has surely left rival parties feeling disconcerted and embarrassed. As they struggle to maintain or gain ground, the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party must reevaluate their strategies and messages to win over German voters. In conclusion, Angela Merkel's enduring popularity and the CDU's favorable position in recent polls have left rival political parties with the challenging task of finding a new approach. Faced with such a strong opponent, these parties must act quickly to avoid further embarrassment as Merkel's legacy continues to dominate Germany's political landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: How do you improve your English speaking skills, so that you can communicate more easily and effectively? These tips will help you to become a more confident speaker. Practice where you can and when you can. Any practice is good--- whether you speak to someone who is a native English speaker or not. It's important to build your confidence. If possible, use simple sentence structure that you know is correct so that you can concentrate on getting your message across. Try to experiment with the English you know. Apply words and phrases you know to new situations. Native English speakers are more likely to correct you if you use the wrong word than if you use the wrong grammar. Experimenting with vocabulary is a really good way of getting feedback Try to respond to what people say to you. You can often get clues to what people think by looking at their body language. Respond to them in a natural way. Try not to translate into and from your own language. It takes too much time and you will find it difficult to get an English answer right away. You don?t know how to do well. The more you want to act well, the more slowly you act. This will make you more shilly-shally. If you forget a word, do what native English speakers do all the time ,and say things that 'fill' the conversation. This is better than remaining completely silent. Try using ' um',or 'er',if you forget the word. Don't speak too fast! It? s important to use a natural rhythm in speaking English, but if you speak too fast it will be difficult for people to understand you. Try to relax when you speak and you,11 find that your mouth does most of the pronunciation work for you. Speak English at normal speed. Final tips --Try to become less hesitant and more confident. --Don't be shy to speak------ the more you do it, the more confident you,11 become. --Remember to be polite------ use \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\" if you ask someone to do something for you.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"This suggests Tripp is not attempting to construct a first draft in her own words following the earlier instructions.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Tripp is using someone else's work.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, it is not definitively true that the hypothesis \\"Tripp is using someone else's work\\" is accurate. However, the premise does raise some suspicion and might serve as a starting point for further investigation. To delve deeper into this and provide a well-rounded perspective, we must first scrutinize the available information and evaluate the alternatives thoroughly. The premise suggests that Tripp is not attempting to construct a first draft in her words, which implies she has been given instructions to create an original piece of writing. The failure to follow these instructions may indeed hint at a possibility that she could be using someone else's work. However, we should consider other possibilities as well. 1. Lack of understanding: It is possible that Tripp could have misunderstood her earlier instructions on producing a first draft in her words. She might be using other sources as a reference but unintentionally included some phrasing that might create the impression that she is using someone else's work verbatim. 2. Inexperience or difficulty with paraphrasing: Tripp might be struggling with the skills needed for paraphrasing and summarizing, leading to a perceived lack of original content in her work. She may be attempting to create her thoughts using resource materials but may not have effectively altered the original content. 3. Use of common phrases or coincidental similarity: Sometimes, the usage of certain common phrases or sentences within a topic may lead to the incorrect assumption of plagiarism. It is possible that Tripp's work bears coincidental similarity with other work in this field but is not an intentional duplication. 4. Rushed work or lack of effort: Tripp might have encountered difficulties in time management or could have procrastinated, causing her to rush and compromise the quality of her work. As a result, she might have unintentionally used someone else's work or heavily relied on existing sources, instead of creating a first draft in her words. To confirm the hypothesis, it is necessary to evaluate the draft meticulously and gather more information on Tripp's background, her writing process, and her understanding of the task assigned. Multiple factors could play a role in her work not being an original first draft apart from using someone else's work. In summary, while the premise suggests a possibility that Tripp could be using someone else's work, we cannot conclusively prove the hypothesis based solely on this premise. It would be prudent to investigate further and consider alternative explanations for her work not being an original, first draft before reaching a conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"Look for converted monasteries and countryside farmhouses.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The farmhouses in the countryside are very authentic. \\" is true (see options)? [A]. yes; [B]. it is not possible to tell; [C]. no;","completion":"[B]. It is not possible to tell The premise \\"Look for converted monasteries and countryside farmhouses\\" suggests that the speaker is recommending seeking out these locations, presumably for their historic, cultural, or aesthetic significance. However, this statement does not necessarily imply that farmhouses in the countryside are very authentic. Authenticity is a measure of truth, genuineness, or originality, and we cannot derive the authenticity of countryside farmhouses merely from this sentence. If the speaker had provided more context or evidence to support the authenticity of farmhouse properties, for example, by mentioning that they have preserved their original features, architectural design, or have been restored to maintain their historical and cultural heritage, then we could consider the hypothesis \\"The farmhouses in the countryside are very authentic\\" to be true. Since we do not have such context or evidence in the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true or false based on the information provided. Therefore, the best answer is that it is not possible to tell whether the farmhouses in the countryside are very authentic based on the given statement. It is essential to recognize that the premise refers to specific types of properties (converted monasteries and countryside farmhouses), which implies that these places could hold some interest or unique features, but this information is not enough to support the hypothesis.

Sara and her husband Peter (Martin Donovan), a recovering alcoholic, discuss finding a rental house closer to the hospital. On another hospital visit, Sara finds a man putting up a âFor Rentâ sign in front of a large house. The man is frustrated and offers her the first month free if she will rent it immediately. The following day, Peter arrives with Matt's brother Billy (Ty Wood) and cousins Wendy (Amanda Crew) and Mary, and they choose rooms. Matt chooses the basement, where there is a mysterious door. After moving in, Matt suffers a series of visions involving an old, bearded man and corpses with symbols carved into their skin. The next day, Peter learns that the house was supposedly a funeral home; the room behind the mysterious door is a mortuary. Matt tells another patient, Reverend Nicholas Popescu (Elias Koteas), about the visions. Nicholas advises him to find out what the spirit wants. Later, Matt finds a burned figure in his room who begins to move toward him. When the family comes home, they find a shirtless Matt with his fingers blood-covered from scratching at the wall.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the answer is: Hill farm reduced the wind velocity around crops. Step-by-step reasoning: 1.

Catherine V. \\"Ginny\\" Kilgore of Oxford, an attorney with North Mississippi Rural Legal Services, has been recognized for her dedication to serving the indigent. Kilgore - who oversees delivering legal services to the disabled and elderly in 39 north Mississippi counties - is recipient of the University of Mississippi School of Law's 2002 Public Service Award. The award was announced recently at a dinne r, held in Kilgore's honor and hosted by law school Dean Samuel M. Davis, who presented her with an engraved plaque. \\"Ginny Kilgore is a public servant in the truest sense,\\" said Davis. \\"Her selection continues the tradition of this award in recognizing those who have labored in the trenches, with little or no compensation but with great professional and personal satisfaction in helping to bring justice and equality to those who need it most.\\" \\"This award means a great deal to me,\\" Kilgore said, pointing to others so honored. \\"The work of those who received the award before me has been so important; I feel very honored.\\" After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in education and a few years teaching, Kilgore enrolled at the UM law school. Upon graduation in 1975, she entered private law practice in Oxford, joining NMRLS in 1978. Since then, she has earned promotions from managing attorney, senior attorney, then director of the Council on Aging project. Since 1990, she has worked in the Administrative Law Unit and Resource Development, and directed the Elder Law Project, serving the northern half of the state. She also is an adjunct professor in the UM law school's Civil Law Clinic. She held a similar post a few years ago in the school's Elder Law Clinic. Kilgore says she's found her niche. \\"I've always thought it was important to do work to help people. I really enjoy it. The issues I've dealt with through the years have been on the side of helping people maintain the basics of life - home, healt h care, jobs and family.\\" She says her desire to serve others was sparked early, growing up in a single-parent home, aware that her widowed mother faced certain challenges as she supported her four children through public school and college.

Additional complications arise when Shelly, a relative old-timer who resents the Disneyfication of Vegas, resists the efforts of new Shangri-La owner advisers, including Ivy League graduate and condescending upstart Larry Sokolov (Ron Livingston), to update the casino hotel property and bring it into the 21st century. Lootz also learns his seldom-seen adult son is back in town, and, with his wife, is interfering with the operations at the Shangri La. Though Shelly still has the backing of certain mob associates, such as gangster Nicky Fingers, the growing power of the new young Ivy League casino owners is lessening his power grip on the casino and the business he truly loves.

William McKinley (January 29, 1843 - September 14, 1901) was the 25th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1897 until his assassination in September 1901, six months into his second term. McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish-American War, raised protective tariffs to promote American industry, and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of free silver (effectively, expansionary monetary policy). McKinley was the last president to have served in the American Civil War, and the only one to have started the war as an enlisted soldier, beginning as a private in the Union Army and ending as a brevet major. William McKinley Jr. was born in 1843 in Niles, Ohio, the seventh child of William McKinley Sr. and Nancy (nee Allison) McKinley (1809-1897). The McKinleys were of English and Scots-Irish descent and had settled in western Pennsylvania in the 18th century, tracing back to a David McKinley who was born in Dervock, County Antrim, in present-day Northern Ireland. There, the elder McKinley was born in Pine Township, Mercer County. The family moved to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy, settling in New Lisbon (now Lisbon). He met Nancy Allison there, and married her later. The Allison family was of mostly English descent and among Pennsylvania's earliest settlers. The family trade on both sides was iron-making, and McKinley senior operated foundries throughout Ohio, in New Lisbon, Niles, Poland, and finally Canton. The McKinley household was, like many from Ohio's Western Reserve, steeped in Whiggish and abolitionist sentiment, the latter based on the family's staunch Methodist beliefs. William followed in the Methodist tradition, becoming active in the local Methodist church at the age of sixteen. He was a lifelong pious Methodist. In 1852, the family moved from Niles to Poland, Ohio so that their children could attend the better schools there. Graduating from Poland Seminary in 1859, he enrolled the following year at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. He remained at Allegheny for only one year, returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed. He also spent time at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio as a board member. Although his health recovered, family finances declined and McKinley was unable to return to Allegheny, first working as a postal clerk and later taking a job teaching at a school near Poland, Ohio.

John Key said the toll was expected to rise further, adding: \\"We may be witnessing New Zealand's darkest day.\\" The tremor caused widespread damage as it occurred at a shallow depth of 5km (3.1 miles) during lunchtime when Christchurch was at its busiest. The mayor of New Zealand's second-biggest city says 120 people have been rescued from the ruins. The country's deadliest natural disaster in 80 years struck at 1251 (2351 GMT on Monday), 10km (6.2 miles) south-east of the city. Screams from rubble The damage is said to be far worse than after the 7.1-magnitude quake on 4 September, which left two people seriously injured but no fatalities. We've had friends in town call us and say there are just bodies lying around: lots of dead bodies outside shops just lying there just covered in bricks Jaydn Katene, Christchurch resident Christchurch earthquake: Eyewitness accounts The epicentre of that quake, which occurred in the middle of the night, was further away from the city and deeper underground, but it still caused an estimated 3bn (£1.9bn) in damage. TV pictures of the aftermath of Tuesday's disaster showed scores of collapsed buildings in the South Island city of nearly 400,000 people. Shocked survivors could be seen wandering the rubble-strewn streets, which cracked open as the ground beneath was liquefied by the tremor. Police said that the dead included people on two buses which were crushed by falling buildings. Helicopters plucked survivors to safety from rooftops, and dumped water on fires. Officials said up to 30 people were feared still trapped inside the razed Pyne Gould Guinness building, where screams have been heard from the ruins. CLICKABLE Select the images for more details. Bexley Streets in the north-eastern suburb of Bexley were flooded as the quake caused water mains to burst, which coincided with heavy rain. Pyne Gould Guinness The multi-storey Pyne Gould Guinness Building, which normally houses around 200 workers, collapsed. A number of people were thought to be trapped inside. Cathedral The 63m spire of the city's Anglican cathedral was toppled by the earthquake. A New Zealand TV reporter took a look inside the damaged building. CTV building Part of Christchurch's Canterbury Television [CTV] building completely collapsed in the earthquake. Some 24 people have been rescued from the building, but police said there might be between 60 and 120 bodies trapped underneath. Oxford Terrace In the aftermath of the earthquake, Rhys Taylor took this video on Oxford Terrace, 50 metres away from the city's main hospital. He said: \\"Cars were being used as ambulances to transport the injured.\\" Trapped under her desk inside the building, Anne Voss told Australia's Channel Seven by mobile phone: \\"I am hoping they will get me out soon because I have been here so long. And it's dark. And it's horrible.\\" Asked whether she was injured, she said: \\"I know I am bleeding and I can feel the ground is quite wet. I think it's blood.\\" Glacier smashed A dozen visiting Japanese students are among those reported missing. Bystanders have been using bare hands to try to free survivors trapped under debris. Many injured people were carried out on blood-soaked stretchers or in the arms of shocked workmates and strangers. Some escaped on ropes lowered from office towers. Others managed to crawl out of the rubble. Analysis By nature, earthquakes tend to cluster in space and time. And Tuesday's tremor in Christchurch is almost certainly related to the much more energetic event that hit the region last September. The critical difference on this occasion is the ground broke almost directly under the country's second city, and at shallow depth, 5km (3 miles) below the surface. Contrast this with September's magnitude 7 quake: its epicentre occurred some 40km west of the city and at a depth of 10km, and it continued to rupture mainly away from the major built-up areas. New Zealand lies on the notorious Ring of Fire, the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim. The country straddles the boundary between two tectonic plates: the Pacific and Indo-Australian plates. On South Island, the location of the latest quake, the plates rub past each other horizontally. Depth and location key The tremor sent the spire of Christchurch Cathedral, a landmark in the centre of the city, toppling into the square below. John Gurr, a camera technician, told Reuters news agency the area outside the cathedral was \\"like a warzone\\". Power and telephone lines have been knocked out, while burst pipes have deluged streets with water. The suburbs of Lyttelton and New Brighton are reportedly \\"unliveable\\". Queen Elizabeth II said in a statement she had been \\"utterly shocked\\" by the news. \\"My thoughts are with all those who have been affected by this dreadful event,\\" the statement said. The quake caused some 30m tons of ice to shear away from New Zealand's biggest glacier. Witnesses say massive icebergs formed when the Tasman Glacier in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park broke, tossing a nearby lake with huge waves. Back in Christchurch, emergency shelters were set up in the city's Hagley Park, a race course and schools as night approached. City Mayor Bob Parker told the BBC: \\"This is a terrible, terrible toll on our city.\\" \\"There is no power in most of the city; there is no water in most of the city,\\" he added. PM John Key said: \\"It is just a scene of utter devastation. We have to work as fast as we can to get people out of environments where they are trapped.

We just need this community, as it has done before and as it will do again, to come together, to check and support one another,\\" he added. Aftershocks The military has been deployed to help the rescue effort, and the government has accepted an offer of specialist help from Australia. A series of aftershocks, some as big as magnitude 5, have already rattled the stricken city, and officials warned residents to brace for more. One Christchurch resident, Jaydn Katene, told the New Zealand Herald: \\"We've had friends in town call us and say there are just bodies lying around; lots of dead bodies outside shops just lying there just covered in bricks.\\" A British backpacker said the city \\"looked like a bomb had hit it\\". New Zealand experiences more than 14,000 earthquakes a year, of which only around 20 have a magnitude in excess of 5.0. The last fatal earthquake was in 1968, when a 7.1-magnitude tremor killed three people on the South Island's western coast. Tuesday's was the country's worst natural disaster since a 1931 quake in the North Island city of Napier killed 256 people. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

The rest of the film then occurs in flashback. In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he received his first loss. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vikki approach a table with Salvy and his crew.

A spokeswoman said the pilot was really experienced with more than 30 years flying a number of different passenger aircraft types. \\"But he has recently transferred from flying aBQ300 to aBQ400, so hehas to regain his qualification for landing in such conditions as the thick fog he experienced this time,\\" she said. \\"The pilot, therefore, quite correctly turned the aircraft back, a decision 100 percent accepted by the aviation officials in the company.\\" One passenger said she had missed an appointment for an interview in prefix = st1 /Paris. \\"I might have had a nice chance to work inParis,\\" she told the local newspaper. \\"The whole thing sounds hard to believe. If I had not been on the plane, I would take it as a funny story!\\" The British Civil Aviation Authority described the incident as one that was \\"quite unusual but probably not unheard of,\\" because there are different classifications of aircraft with different qualifications for landing in different climatic conditions and when an aircraft is updated, the pilots have to get retrained, even though they have enough skills to do the job successfully. Poor pilot, it's not really his fault...

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: The musical opened on Broadway on May 28, 1953 at the Majestic Theatre. Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run; by the start of November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted \\"because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\\". According to Frederick W. Nolan in his book about the duo's works, \\"despite a 500,000 advance sale, despite a ten-month run (which, for anyone except Rodgers and Hammerstein, would have represented a major success), and despite an eventual profit in excess of 100,000, Me and Juliet has to be classed as a failure\\".The backstage drama portrayed in the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health as a result of her diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: \\"I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love.\\" The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going. The lyricist thought for a second, then said \\"I hate that show.\\" According to Bill Hayes in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he states We played nearly five hundred performances, however, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits... Guess a valid title for it!
