Let's analyze both the premise and the hypothesis to understand this better. Premise: \\"A girl in a pink shirt is riding a bicycle in traffic.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A girl in bright clothing bikes through traffic\\" First, let's break down the key components of each statement: 1. The subject: In both the premise and the hypothesis, the subject is a girl. 2. The attire: In the premise, the girl is described as wearing a pink shirt. In the hypothesis, the girl is described as wearing bright clothing. Although the hypothesis doesn't explicitly mention a pink shirt, it can be inferred that the pink shirt is considered bright clothing, as pink is often seen as a bright color. 3. The activity: In both the premise and the hypothesis, the girl is riding a bicycle. 4. The setting: In both the premise and the hypothesis, the girl is riding in traffic. Based on the analysis of these key components, we can draw the following conclusions: 1. The subject is the same in both statements - it is a girl. 2. The attire is slightly different but can be considered as comparable. A pink shirt is an example of bright clothing. 3. The activity is the same in both statements - the girl is riding a bicycle. 4. The setting is the same in both statements - the girl is riding her bicycle in traffic. Putting everything together, we can infer that the hypothesis is true based on the information provided in the premise. The slight variation in the description of the girl's clothing does not change the overall conclusion since a pink shirt could be seen as a type of bright clothing. So, the hypothesis \\"a girl in bright clothing bikes through traffic\\" aligns with the premise \\"A girl in a pink shirt is riding a bicycle in traffic.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - fairness - candies - compliments - well fed - arguements I believe the correct choice is \\"fairness\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"fairness\\", and here's why: The question describes a situation where a person is unhappy with the varying size of cake slices handed out, which suggests an issue of unequal distribution. This concern aligns with the idea of fairness, as the person likely wants more consistency and equal treatment when it comes to distributing cake slices. Now, let's briefly examine the remaining options in order to understand why they are less suitable: 1. Candies: This answer is not relevant to the given situation, as the person's issue revolves around the cake slices, not additional sweets. 2. Compliments: Although compliments may make someone feel better, they do not address the underlying problem of the uneven cake slices. 3. Well fed: This option refers to being adequately nourished, but the person's concern is about the equitable distribution of cake, not the overall consumption of food. 4. Arguments: The person seems unsatisfied with the current situation, so it's unlikely that they are seeking more arguments or conflict. Instead, they are looking for a resolution to the unequal cake slices. Based on this reasoning, \\"fairness\\" is the most appropriate answer choice, as the person is seeking a more equitable distribution of cake slices in order to ensure everyone receives a fair share."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was the only child of Italian immigrants Antonino Martino \\"Marty\\" Sinatra and Natalina \\"Dolly\\" Garaventa. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity deals with the tribulations of three soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, stationed on Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role which would bring him back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as \\"Maggio\\" in the film. During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend, and Sinatra later professed that he \\"learned more about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before\\". After several years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world. His performance also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture. The Los Angeles Examiner wrote that Sinatra is \\"simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant\\", commenting that his death scene is \\"one of the best ever photographed\\". In 1954 Sinatra starred opposite Doris Day in the musical film Young at Heart, and earned critical praise for his performance as a psychopathic killer posing as an FBI agent opposite Sterling Hayden in the film noir Suddenly. Sinatra was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as a heroin addict in The Man With The Golden Arm (1955). After roles in Guys and Dolls, and The Tender Trap, Sinatra was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as hospital orderly in Stanley Kramer's debut picture, Not as a Stranger. During production, Sinatra got drunk with Robert Mitchum and Broderick Crawford and trashed Kramer's dressing room. Kramer vowed to never hire Sinatra again at the time, and later regretted casting him as a Spanish guerrilla leader in The Pride and the Passion (1957). In 1956 Sinatra featured alongside Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly in High Society for MGM, earning a reported 250,000 for the picture. The public rushed to the cinemas to see Sinatra and Crosby together on-screen, and it ended up earning over 13 million at the box office, becoming one of the highest-grossing pictures of 1956. In 1957, Sinatra starred opposite Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak in George Sidney's Pal Joey, for which he won for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Santopietro considers the scene in which Sinatra sings \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" to Hayworth to have been the finest moment of his film career. He next portrayed comedian Joe E. Lewis in The Joker Is Wild; the song \\"All the Way\\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. By 1958 Sinatra was one of the ten biggest box office draws in the United States, appearing with Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine in Vincente Minnelli's Some Came Running and Kings Go Forth with Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood. \\"High Hopes\\", sung by Sinatra in the Frank Capra comedy, A Hole in the Head (1959), won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and became a chart hit, lasting on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks.

The premise states that a person lays down on the grass with a hood on. The hypothesis states that a person lays in the grass at night.

The premise tells us that a person is laying down on the grass with a hood on, which meets the first condition of the hypothesis (the person is laying in the grass). However, the premise does not provide information about the time of day, specifically whether it is nighttime or not. Step 4: Conclusion Since the premise only fulfills one of the two conditions required for the hypothesis to be true, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true.

As she lies quietly with her newborn litter, her father, Sir Gregory, walks inside, not realizing she had her puppies until she summons his attention and he spots them curled up next to her.

All the other dogs, Swift, her son Ernie, and Jake, are delighted to meet the puppies at last but Fern doesn't seem to like puppies and is not happy to be their auntie. When the puppies realize they can finally see things, Mist looks out of a nearby window and sees a flock of sheep pass by, but does not exactly know what they are. She points them out to Storm and Drift, but by the time they come to the window, the sheep are gone. They think Mist is making it up, and they playfully tease and wrestle each other around the barn.

Movie title: Once Upon a Time in the West Movie plot: The film portrays two conflicts that take place around Flagstone, a fictional town in the American Old West: a land battle related to construction of a railroad, and a mission of vengeance against a cold-blooded killer. A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \\"Harmonica\\", pursues Frank.

In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men.

Harmonica explains that Jill will lose Sweetwater unless the station is built by the time the track's construction crews reach that point, so Cheyenne puts his men to work building it. Frank turns against Morton, who wanted to make a deal with Jill; Morton's disability makes him unable to fight back. After raping Jill, Frank forces her to sell the property in an auction.

Today, we're going to write a super fun and simple article about a big and interesting place called Georgia. It's not the one you may know in the United States but a whole different country. There are people called ethnic Georgians who live there, and they need some help sometimes. There are also European Union Monitoring Mission monitors, who help watch over and protect the nice people in Georgia. Now, let's find out the difference in their numbers! Title: How Many More Ethnic Georgians Need Help Than Monitors To Watch Over Them In Georgia? Once upon a time in a beautiful land called Georgia, there were many people living happily together. These people are called ethnic Georgians. Sometimes, they might face some problems and need someone to help and watch over them. People who do this job are called European Union Monitoring Mission monitors. These monitors come from a big group of countries called the European Union, and they visit Georgia to make sure everybody is safe and sound. Now, let's be detective and find out the difference between the number of ethnic Georgians who need help and the number of monitors who do this super important job. First, we need to know how many ethnic Georgians are facing problems and need help. In Georgia, there are around 239,872 ethnic Georgians who have become vulnerable and need some extra care. Next, let's find out how many European Union Monitoring Mission monitors are in Georgia. There are about 200 monitors working hard to make sure everything goes well. To find the difference, we simply have to subtract the smaller number (the monitors) from the bigger number (the ethnic Georgians who need help): 239,872 (ethnic Georgians) - 200 (monitors) = 239,672 Wow! That's a big number! So, the difference is 239,672. That means there are 239,672 more ethnic Georgians who need help than there are monitors to watch over them. In our magical land of Georgia, many people need someone to look after them, but there are not as many monitors as we wish. This means that our brave monitors have a lot of work to do! We hope that one day everyone in Georgia will be happy, safe, and have enough people to watch over and protect them.

Jack Kerouac, born on March 12, 1922, in Lowell, Massachusetts, was an influential American writer and a significant figure in the Beat Generation. The Beat Generation was a literary and social movement in the United States during the 1950s, characterized by its members' rejection of mainstream societal norms and conventions, their exploration of new artistic and spiritual expressions, and their embrace of nonconformity and spontaneity. Notable authors of the Beat Generation included Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs. 'On The Road' is one of Jack Kerouac's most famous works and the defining novel of the Beat Generation. Published in 1957 (not 1958) by Viking Press, the novel is based on Kerouac's own experiences and adventures traveling across the United States with his friends, including Neal Cassady, who became the inspiration for the character Dean Moriarty. Written in a stream-of-consciousness style, the novel provides a vivid and frenzied account of the protagonists' cross-country road trips and their quest for freedom, self-discovery, and a genuine connection with the human experience. Kerouac's 'On The Road' was groundbreaking for its time and has since become an iconic piece of American literature, reflecting the social and cultural changes of the 1950s in the United States. The novel has served as an inspiration for generations of readers and writers who seek to challenge societal expectations and explore the human spirit's boundless potential. Despite its controversial nature and initial mixed critical reception, 'On The Road' has been recognized as a foundational work in American literature, with Jack Kerouac's distinct voice and energetic prose leaving an indelible mark on the literary world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Early in his career Richard Grenville had some minor posts in the royal household. On the death of his father in 1523 he completed his father's term as Sheriff of Cornwall, a post he also held in 1526-7, 1544-5. In between he was Sheriff of Devon in 1532-3. He was Justice of the Peace for Cornwall from 1524 till his death and also in Devon, at Exeter from 1535 to 1547. Further afield he was Marshal of Calais, a post that required his residence there, from October 1535 to October 1540. In 1544 Grenville accompanied the King to France as a commander in the English army. He was active in his Christian faith and openly favoured ‘God's word'. In the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549 Grenville was called upon against the western rebels, and with a company of friends and followers he defended Trematon Castle.

However, all of these facets of medieval university life are considered by standard scholarship to be independent medieval European developments with no tracable Islamic influence. Generally, some reviewers have pointed out the strong inclination of Makdisi of overstating his case by simply resting on \\"the accumulation of close parallels\\", but all the while failing to point to convincing channels of transmission between the Muslim and Christian world. Norman Daniel points out that the Arab equivalent of the Latin disputation, the taliqa, was reserved for the ruler's court, not the madrasa, and that the actual differences between Islamic fiqh and medieval European civil law were profound. The taliqa only reached Islamic Spain, the only likely point of transmission, after the establishment of the first medieval universities. In fact, there is no Latin translation of the taliqa and, most importantly, no evidence of Latin scholars ever showing awareness of Arab influence on the Latin method of disputation, something they would have certainly found noteworthy. Rather, it was the medieval reception of the Greek Organon which set the scholastic sic et non in motion. Daniel concludes that resemblances in method had more to with the two religions having \\"common problems: to reconcile the conflicting statements of their own authorities, and to safeguard the data of revelation from the impact of Greek philosophy\\"; thus Christian scholasticism and similar Arab concepts should be viewed in terms of a parallel occurrence, not of the transmission of ideas from one to the other, a view shared by Hugh Kennedy. What other religion was considered to share parallels in teaching styles with the Muslim faith? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The other religion that was considered to share parallels in teaching styles with the Muslim faith was Christianity. Both Christian and Muslim scholars had to deal with similar problems, like reconciling conflicting statements from authorities and protecting their beliefs from the impact of Greek philosophy. So, their teaching styles had some similarities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Today, we are going to talk about how to make good choices that help us be healthy and happy. So, let's start off with the first one: Develop your support group. You know how in a superhero movie, the superhero always has friends or helpers? That's sort of like your support group! This group could be your family, friends, or even your favorite stuffed toy who are always there for you. They can cheer you up when you're sad, help you solve a tricky puzzle, or even play with you when you're bored! Next, eliminate stimulants. Now, this is a big term - but don't worry, I'll break it down for you. Stimulants are like that extra strong mega super hot chili sauce; they make your body and brain go super fast. So, these could be things like lots and lots of sugary candy or too many fizzy drinks. It's okay to have a little bit, but too much can make it hard for you to sleep or stay calm. Then, limit your alcohol intake. This one's not for you right now but when you eventually grow up. You know how adults sometimes drink things that kids can't, like wine or beer? These kinds of drinks have something called alcohol in them. Too much alcohol isn't good for the body, just like too much candy isn't good. So, when you grow up, remember to only have a little bit! Now, let's move to 'follow a balanced diet'. Remember how fun it is to play on the seesaw? But it only works when both sides are balanced. That's the same with your food! Your body needs a mix of different foods like fruits, veggies, proteins and grains - and not just your favorite ice cream. Eating all kinds of food not only makes your meals more exciting but also helps you grow big and strong! Lastly, sleep more. Sleep is like your body's special charging time like how you plug in your toy car to recharge. When you sleep, your body gets to rest and build up energy for the next day. So, if you want to continue running as fast as a cheetah, remember to get enough sleep every night! And that's it! These are some helpful tips to lead a healthy and happy life. Like taking care of your favorite toy, taking care of your body and mind is also vital. So, always remember: build your superhero team, eat your fruits and veggies, get enough rest and avoid too much candy or fizzy drinks!"},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: My parents lived through the Great Depression of the 1930s and I heard stories from both of them about how their lives changed because of it. The same was true of my in-laws whose lives were also affected negatively. For example, my husband's grandfather owned a factory. Owing to the stock market crash, he lost the factory and went back to work in the very factory he'd once owned. He could no longer afford to send my father-in-law to college. My father-in-law worked full time as a pipe fitter and went to school part-time to earn his degree, which took seven years. Somehow, my husband and I never dreamed that we would live through anything similar. However, as they say, history often repeats itself. In 1929, the stock market crashed in the month of October. The same thing happened in 2008. My husband, who had invested all our money in the market, was in a state of shock. Each day the news was more terrible. \\"We've lost more than half of our wealth,\\" he told me. I just stared at him. \\"How can that be?\\" \\"I thought we had good, solid investments, but it seems I was wrong.\\" \\"Well, we do have pensions ,\\" I said. \\"Hopefully, they won't be affected. Since we have never lived a high lifestyle to begin with, I don't think we have to worry.\\" \\"I did hope to leave our children and grandchildren a generous inheritance ,\\" my husband said. He shook his head in disbelief. \\"We'll still be able to give gifts. Love is the most important gift anyway.\\" Our children are grown and we always try to be generous to them and our grandchildren. \\"It just won't be the same.\\" \\"The world is always changing,\\" I said. \\"You never know what will happen. The main thing is not to get discouraged. As long as we have our health and can afford the necessities of life, there's no reason to be upset. When you have your health, you can always earn more money.\\" I hugged my husband and he kissed me in return. \\"I guess you're right,\\" he agreed. \\"We love each other.

Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that \\"I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy\\" and complaining of \\"the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth\\" which he considered \\"such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it\\". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student.

Not size, of course. I've been in some of the grandest houses in America, and it's readily apparent that no one lives there. Earlier this year, I had dinner in a mud hut in Ethiopia, where we sat on chairs next to the hostess's bed --- a home that had more warmth than any house I've been in since. Now John Edwards is exploring what makes a house a home in his just-released Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. There Edwards writes, \\"This is a book about homes, the values they rest on, the dreams they are filled with, and the people they have shaped. The houses and circumstances are different, but much of what you find inside will be familiar.\\" Whether you're sitting in an airport right now, waiting to fly to your childhood home for Thanksgiving, or in your own home waiting for the s to arrive, you know what he's talking about.

It's where friends sit on the kitchen counter drinking wine while dinner is being fixed. I lived there for only 18 years, but it will always be my true home. Even the lamp in the west living room window, which I could see far down the road when driving home late at night, still shines.

Delia proceeds to marry Jim Ralston, and Charlotte comforts Clem, who enlists in the Union Army and is later killed in battle. Shortly after his death, Charlotte discovers she is pregnant with Clem's child, and in order to escape the stigma of an illegitimate child, she journeys West to have her baby, a daughter she names Clementina (or \\"Tina\\").

Who composed the opera La Traviata?","completion":"La Traviata, a renowned opera in three acts, was composed by the distinguished Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi. Born on October 10, 1813, Verdi was a prolific maestro who contributed immensely to the world of music and opera throughout the 19th century. La Traviata, regarded as one of his finest works, exemplified his extraordinary gift as a composer. With a libretto written by Francesco Maria Piave, the story of La Traviata is based on \\"La Dame aux Camélias,\\" a play adapted from the novel penned by Alexandre Dumas fils. The opera had its premiere on March 6, 1853, at La Fenice, a historic opera house in Venice, Italy. Though the initial reception of La Traviata was lukewarm, the opera gained immense popularity after minor alterations, eventually becoming a staple in the global opera repertoire. Set in Paris during the 19th century, La Traviata is a tragic love story which revolves around the main characters Violetta Valéry (a Parisian courtesan), Alfredo Germont, and his father, Giorgio Germont. The opera offers a compelling insight into the society of that time, exploring themes such as love, morality, social expectations, and class distinctions. Verdi's mastery over melody, orchestration, and dramatic sensitivity is skilfully showcased in La Traviata, with famous arias and ensembles that have become iconic in Western classical music. Notable arias include \\"Libiamo ne' lieti calici\\" (The Drinking Song), \\"Sempre libera,\\" \\"Di Provenza il mar, il suol,\\" and \\"Addio, del passato.\\" These captivating pieces emphasize Verdi's profound understanding of characters and their emotional arcs. Beyond La Traviata, Giuseppe Verdi composed an extensive body of work, including operas such as Rigoletto, Il trovatore, Aida, Otello, and Falstaff, among others. His immersive compositions have left an indelible mark on the world of opera and continue to enchant audiences worldwide. Today, Verdi is remembered as one of the most significant Italian opera composers, and his legacy as an innovator and musical genius endures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The majority of eukaryotic genes are stored on a set of large, linear chromosomes. The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome. DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin.:4.2 The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the centromere.:4.2 Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process. The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.:18.2 Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What are replication origins?","completion":"Replication origins are the specific sequence regions within the DNA of eukaryotic chromosomes where DNA replication is initiated, allowing for the production of two identical copies of the chromosome.

Her only living relative, she has met him only once and is reluctant to comply. Her mother superior pressures her into accepting. Don Jaime is a recluse, living on a neglected farm with a couple of servantsâRamona (Margarita Lozano), her daughter Rita, and Moncho. When Don Jaime sees his niece, he is struck by her strong resemblance to his deceased wife.

When Ramona informs Viridiana that Don Jaime wants to marry her, she is aghast and Don Jaime seems to drop the idea. Ramona secretly drugs her drink. Don Jaime carries the unconscious woman to her room with the intention of raping her. At the last moment, he decides otherwise. The next morning, he lies and tells Viridiana that he \\"took her virginity\\", i.e. raped her, so she cannot go back to her convent. When she is undeterred, he confesses he lied, leaving her uncertain as to what happened that night. At the bus stop, the authorities prevent her from leaving.

The action of throwing could have multiple reasons – it could be for fun, as part of a game, due to fear, anger, or disgust, or any other motivation not mentioned here.

He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference. Trump also received more good news this week when his choice for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, finally won Senate confirmation.

Summarize this article: Of all five senses, eyesight is the sense that you depend upon the most. Despite this, few people insure their eyes or get eye exams, almost taking their sight for granted. One of the greatest adversaries to your eyes is the sun. With dangerous UV rays, glare, and carcinomas, the sun damages the eyes considerably over time. Carcinomas of the eyelids, like squamous and basal cell, spread rapidly and are typically found in people who have a history of sun exposure. Melanomas are linked to intense, intermittent sun exposure and if not treated promptly can prove lethal. Transitions lenses adapt to the sun’s brightness and protect the eyes from potentially fatal damage by darkening the lenses of your glasses. Constant adjustment to changing light can cause eyestrain and fatigue. Your lenses have to filter all the sunlight that comes into contact with your eyes making them work hard and wears them down quickly. Although eyestrain by itself does not have long-term consequences, it can severely aggravate your eyes making you tired and reducing your ability to concentrate. Transitions lenses protect your eyes allowing them to stay relaxed and comfortable throughout the day. Glare and squinting are related but glare is far more dangerous, especially if you are driving or walking along a road. Glare, caused by excessive sunlight, forces you to either squint or look away because it is blinding. Without proper protection, this distraction can cause a serious accident. Good vision is important to safe driving. Driving without protection against glare — from the road, snow, or other cars — is a treacherous proposition. Make sure you use the sun visor, keep your windshield clean, rest your eyes from squinting, and look into Transitions Drivewear sunglasses, which cuts glare considerably. Drivewear lenses rapidly adapt to glare while you are driving your car making them the perfect answer for driving safely. Most windshields are treated with UV protection, so most normal Transitions lenses may be less effective behind the wheel (as they respond to UV light, which will already be filtered by the windshield). Drivewear, however, uses ambient light and will get darker depending on light conditions. The earlier you begin to protect your eyes against the sun the better. In other words, it is never too early to protect your vision. Children are even more susceptible to the harmful effect of UV radiation than adults. Children under the age of ten have a greater chance of getting photokeratitis, which is sunburn of the eye, and UV-related retina problems because their eyes are not as efficient at filtering UV rays as adults' eyes. Without proper eye protection, your child could suffer red eyes due to sunburn, non-stop tearing, burning or itchy eyes, or severe eye pain and spasms. Transitions eyewear blocks 100% of UV radiation, providing safety for your children’s eyes.","completion":"Eyesight is the most crucial of the five senses, and the sun poses a significant threat to it through harmful UV rays and glare. Over time, sun exposure can lead to carcinomas and melanomas in the eye area, which can be lethal. Transitions lenses protect eyes from these dangers by adapting to the sun's brightness and filtering sunlight. This helps reduce eyestrain, glare, and fatigue, which are particularly important for safe driving. Transitions Drivewear lenses are specifically designed for driving, adapting faster to changing light conditions. Children are more susceptible to the harmful effects of UV radiation, so early protection with Transitions eyewear that blocks 100% of UV rays is crucial for safeguarding their eyesight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If the time is convenient for you, surely accept their invitation. But if you're busy, don't be afraid to _ the invitation, perhaps suggesting a time that would be better. Your host won't be shamed. Invitations are usually sent in person or over the telephone. The main exception is for some formal occasions, in which case a written invitation will be mailed. You would normally receive a written invitation to a wedding . For a casual dinner invitation, don't arrive more than 5 minutes early, because your host may still be preparing for your visit. Arriving more than 10 minutes late is considered rude if very few people were invited. If many people were invited, it's OK to arrive a little late, even as much as half an hour late. For example, it's OK to arrive late for a party, for a potluck dinner or for a social gathering inviting a large group of people. If you're invited for dinner, it's proper to bring the host a bottle of wine, a gift basket of fruit, a box of candy , or a bouquet of flowers.

In February 1953 Vaughan Williams and Ursula were married. He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London. It was the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation; Vaughan Williams's contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune, and a new setting of \\"O taste and see\\" from Psalm 34, performed at the service in Westminster Abbey. Having returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as \\"like a musical state occasion\\".Of Vaughan Williams's works from the 1950s, Grove makes particular mention of Three Shakespeare Songs (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata Hodie (1953–1954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the Ten Blake Songs (1957) for voice and oboe, \\"a masterpiece of economy and precision\\". Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, Thomas the Rhymer. The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh—officially unnumbered, and titled Sinfonia antartica—divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic, and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The Eighth, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the Hallé Orchestra under the dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who warned Annette about Sebastian's reputation? In an upscale New York City mansion, wealthy and popular teenager Kathryn Merteuil is discussing her prep school with Mrs. Caldwell and Mrs. Caldwell's daughter, Cecile. Kathryn promises Mrs. Caldwell that she will look out for the naive Cecile. Kathryn's stepbrother, Sebastian Valmont, enters the room, whereupon Mrs. Caldwell reacts to him coldly and leaves with Cecile. Kathryn reveals to Sebastian that her real intention is to use Cecile to take revenge on her ex-lover Court Reynolds, who dumped her for Cecile. Kathryn asks Sebastian to seduce Cecile, thereby rendering her a \\"tramp\\" and spoiling her in Court's eyes. Sebastian refuses as he is planning to seduce Annette Hargrove, the virgin daughter of their prep school's new headmaster who published an essay in support of chastity until marriage. After some negotiation, the two step-siblings agree on a wager: If Sebastian fails to bed Annette, Kathryn gets Sebastian's vintage Jaguar XK140; if he succeeds, Kathryn will have sex with him, as Kathryn is the one girl Sebastian has failed to bed.

Comprehensive school: In these schools children could be selected on the basis of curriculum aptitude related to the school's specialism even though the schools do take quotas from each quartile of the attainment range to ensure they were not selective by attainment. A problem with this is whether the quotas should be taken from a normal distribution or from the specific distribution of attainment in the immediate catchment area. In the selective school system, which survives in several parts of the United Kingdom, admission is dependent on selection criteria, most commonly a cognitive test or tests. Although comprehensive schools were introduced to England and Wales in 1965, there are 164 selective grammar schools that are still in operation.[citation needed] (though this is a small number compared to approximately 3500 state secondary schools in England). Most comprehensives are secondary schools for children between the ages of 11 to 16, but in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools, and in some places the secondary level is divided into two, for students aged 11 to 14 and those aged 14 to 18, roughly corresponding to the US middle school (or junior high school) and high school, respectively.

What is the last name of the person who was known for their fascination with contrasts in skin tones? Answer the above question based on the context below: William Etty (1787–1849), the seventh child of a York baker and miller, began his career as an apprentice printer in Hull at the age of 11. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk crayons\\", with the intention of becoming a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters, and studied under renowned artist Thomas Lawrence. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, Etty submitted numerous paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited.In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra), which depicted a large number of nude figures. Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in painting nudes, and many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work.

Write an article based on this summary: A French court has ruled that wire-tapped conversations between ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy and his lawyer can be used as evidence in an ongoing corruption investigation. Article:","completion":"Title: French Court Approves Wiretapped Conversations as Evidence in Sarkozy Corruption Investigation Introduction: A landmark ruling in a French court has declared that wiretapped conversations between former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his lawyer can be used as valid evidence in the ongoing corruption investigation. The decision has potential consequences for future cases involving high-profile figures and could prove to be a significant turning point in the case against Sarkozy. Step 1: Examine the background of the corruption case The corruption investigation against Sarkozy began in 2014 when he was accused of attempting to bribe a high-ranking French judge, Gilbert Azibert, with a prestigious job in Monaco in exchange for information on an inquiry into illegal campaign financing. While that particular inquiry was eventually dropped, new charges emerged, painting a picture of a widespread web of alleged corruption throughout Sarkozy's presidency. Step 2: Explain the wiretapped conversations and their legality Throughout the course of the investigation, Sarkozy and his lawyer, Thierry Herzog, were subject to wiretapping by French investigators, who recorded various exchanges between the pair. Due to the confidential nature of attorney-client conversations, their admissibility as evidence initially faced scrutiny and debate. However, the French court has ultimately ruled that the wiretapped conversations can be used as evidence to shed light on Sarkozy's alleged corrupt dealings. Step 3: Discuss the impact of the ruling on Sarkozy's case The inclusion of the wiretapped conversations as valid evidence is a major development in the corruption investigation against Sarkozy. These recordings could provide crucial context and details to support the existing allegations, potentially leading to a conviction for the former French President. The verdict could also serve as a precedent for future corruption cases involving public figures, setting a new standard in legal battles where wiretapped recordings are involved. Step 4: Analyze potential responses from the involved parties It is likely that Sarkozy and his defense team will contest the court's decision and argue that the wiretapped conversations are a breach of their right to attorney-client confidentiality. As a result, the legal battle may continue to center around the admissibility of these wiretaps, and the case could potentially reach higher courts in France and the European Court of Human Rights. Step 5: Consider the broader implications of the ruling Aside from the immediate impact on Sarkozy's case, the ruling by the French court may have long-lasting implications on the handling of future corruption investigations in France and elsewhere. By allowing wiretapped conversations between politicians and their lawyers to be used as evidence, a new precedent is set, potentially encouraging more aggressive investigative techniques and promoting transparency in government dealings. Conclusion: The French court's decision to allow wiretapped conversations between Nicolas Sarkozy and his lawyer as evidence in a corruption investigation represents a significant milestone in the case against the former President. The ruling has not only consequences for Sarkozy but also broader implications for the legal treatment of wiretapped conversations in corruption cases involving high-profile figures. As the investigation continues to unfold, the outcome may reshape the approaches to fighting corruption and promoting transparency in France and beyond."},{"prompt":"Question: Question: Mike and Sue decide to ride their bikes around the park.

The answer could be more straightforward and focused to provide a clearer and concise response to the question. Below is a more detailed and long answer to the question: Augusto Pinochet was the ruler of Chile, a South American country located along the western coast of the continent. He came to power in a military coup on September 11, 1973, which led to the overthrow of the democratically elected socialist President Salvador Allende. During his rule, which lasted until 1990, Pinochet implemented a series of neoliberal economic reforms, while also establishing a military dictatorship characterized by widespread human rights abuses, political repression, and forced disappearances of those who opposed his regime. Pinochet's rise to power was part of a broader context of Cold War politics, with the United States and the Soviet Union competing for influence in developing nations. This competition led to the involvement of both superpowers in the affairs of many countries, including Chile. Prior to Pinochet's rule, Chile had been experiencing a period of significant political unrest and mounting economic difficulties under the socialist Allende administration. The country was deeply polarized, with many Chileans fearing that Allende's brand of socialism was paving the way for communist rule and an eventual alignment with the Soviet bloc. During Pinochet's regime, several countries around the world severed diplomatic relations with Chile in response to the coup and the resulting human rights violations. Among these countries was Yugoslavia, which had maintained an official policy of neutrality in Cold War affairs and adhered to a policy of non-alignment. However, the situation in Chile pushed Yugoslavia to make an exception to this stance, as it joined other nations in cutting diplomatic ties with the Pinochet regime. The severing of relations demonstrated global disapproval of the military dictatorship and served as a form of diplomatic pressure on the regime to enact changes and restore democracy. In summary, Augusto Pinochet ruled the country of Chile, which faced widespread international condemnation for its human rights abuses and political repression. The response provided in the original statement does contain the correct answer to the question, but it could have been more directly focused on Chile and Pinochet's rule for better clarity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Vincent van Gogh, a renowned Post-Impressionist painter, employed a variety of techniques in his paintings, which set him apart from his contemporaries and made his works distinctive. Some of the key techniques used by van Gogh included impasto, bold color choices, expressive brushstrokes, and capturing the fleeting nature of light. Here is a detailed analysis of these techniques. 1. Impasto: Impasto is a painting technique that involves the application of thick layers of paint on the canvas, resulting in a raised and textured surface. Van Gogh used this method extensively to add depth, texture, and a sense of movement to his paintings. By manipulating the thickness of the paint, he was able to create an almost sculptural quality in his works, making them physically engaging to the viewer. 2. Bold color choices: Van Gogh was greatly influenced by the emerging ideas of color theory, which emphasized the psychological and emotional impact of color in art. He moved away from the muted tones and traditional color palettes of his contemporaries, opting for vibrant and saturated hues. This decision allowed him to evoke strong emotional responses from the viewer and create a heightened sense of reality in his paintings. His color choices also challenged the traditional perception of nature and reflected his personal emotions and experiences. 3. Expressive brushstrokes: The way van Gogh applied paint to his canvas was as essential to his style as his choice of subject matter and color. He favored bold and visible brushstrokes, which established a sense of dynamism and energy in his paintings. His loose and expressive brushwork created a sense of movement, reflecting his emotional state or the energy he perceived in the subject. This technique also served to further emphasize the textures created through impasto. 4. Capturing the fleeting nature of light: Inspired by the Impressionist movement, van Gogh sought to capture the transient effects of light and atmosphere in his paintings. He believed that by representing these ephemeral qualities, his work would evoke a more profound emotional response from the viewer. To achieve this, he used loose brushstrokes and contrasting colors to depict the play of light and shadow in his scenes. This technique helped to create a sense of depth and atmosphere in his paintings while further emphasizing the emotions conveyed in the subject matter. 5. Emotional intensity and symbolism: Van Gogh's distinctive style was also characterized by the emotional intensity and personal symbolism he infused into his works. He used color, form, and texture to express his feelings and convey a deeper meaning to the audience. This approach allowed him to transcend the limitations of realism and elevate his paintings to communicate not only his perception of the world around him but also his internal emotions and thoughts. In summary, Vincent van Gogh's painting technique was marked by a combination of impasto, bold color choices, expressive brushstrokes, capturing the fleeting nature of light, and infusing emotional intensity and symbolism. These methods allowed him to create powerful, evocative, and visually captivating works that continue to resonate with audiences worldwide, showcasing his unique artistic vision and talent."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Our then 10 year old turkish angora cat was extremely upset by the move and started using the hallway carpet both upstairs and down instead of her catbox. She would no longer go outside and hid for the first few months. After much research my husband found this product on the internet. Since both my husband and I are now retired, she is used to our being home most of the time. When we go on vacation, in spite of hiring a cat sitter who spends alot of time with her, we need to make sure the diffuser has not and will not run dry while we are gone. As long as we continue to use this product, the marking has stopped. When it runs dry, she doesn't mark unless she sees another cat outside or her routine changes. Getting the smell out of the carpet has been challenging, even using the enzymatic cleaners, so we try to make sure the Feliway is always plugged in both upstairs and down. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","completion":"This product review conveys a positive sentiment, as the reviewer found the product to be effective in stopping their cat from marking when used consistently. They also appreciated how it helped manage their cat's behavior during their absence.

The Clark Sisters are an American gospel vocal group consisting of five sisters: Jacky Clark Chisholm (b. 1948), Denise Clark Bradford (b. 1953), Elbernita \\"Twinkie\\" Clark-Terrell (b. 1954), Dorinda Clark-Cole (b. 1957), and Karen Clark Sheard (b. 1960). The Clark Sisters are the daughters of gospel musician and choral director Mattie Moss Clark. They are credited for helping to bring gospel music to the mainstream and are considered as pioneers of contemporary gospel. The Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. They each began singing at an early age, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. A few years later, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who would then go on to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. In 1973, the sisters recorded their first album, Jesus Has A Lot To Give, on their uncle's local label Billesse Records. The following year, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents The Clark Sisters was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as Unworthy, Count It All Joy, and He Gave Me Nothing to Lose. It was not until the early 1980s that The Clark Sisters began to become more widely known. Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording Is My Living In Vain. The first live recording by The Clark Sisters spent an entire year at number one on Billboard's Gospel Music chart. Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \\"Hi ya\\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \\"Speak Lord\\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \\"Now Is The Time\\". Another hit from this release, \\"Expect Your Miracle\\", is still a staple in black churches across the country. Their next release You Brought the Sunshine would prove to be a monster hit via the title track. Reminiscent of Stevie Wonder's \\"Master Blaster (Jammin'),\\" the song became a hit in church houses and on dance floors, including New York's Studio 54. \\"Sunshine\\" was picked up from its original independent gospel record label Sounds of Gospel and distributed by both Westbound Records and Elektra Records. In 1983, the song peaked at #16 on the Black Singles chart, #27 on the Club Play Charts, and #80 on the Hot R&B Charts driving the album to Gold sales. This album continues to display Twinkie's signature blend of scripture with unprecedented vocal and musical arrangements on biblically based songs like \\"Psalms 31.\\" The album's other songs include the sincere prayer found within the lyrics of both \\"Center of Thy Will\\" and \\"Endow Me,\\" featuring a young but already vocally mature Karen, as well as \\"Overdose of the Holy Ghost\\", showcasing Dorinda's vocal dexterity. The disco-inspired \\"He Keeps Me Company\\" is noted for its bubbly syncopation. The sisters delivered another progressive effort in 1982, Sincerely, which included \\"Name It And Claim It\\" and the politically charged \\"World.\\" Though its success was overshadowed by the previous hit \\"You Brought The Sunshine\\", the album received a Grammy nomination.

Q:Q: The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: The strength of acids and bases is determined by the concentration of ions they produce when dissolved in water. The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called acidity. It is measured by pH. A neutral substance has a pH of 7. An acid has a pH lower than 7, and a base has a pH greater than 7. Choices: - alkalinity - alcohol - moisture - acidity A: A:","completion":"The correct answer is \\"acidity\\". In this paragraph, it explains that the relative concentration of hydrogen ions dissolved in a solution is termed as its acidity. This kind of concentration is a key factor in determining how acidic a solution is. Acidity is often quantified on a scale, known as the pH scale, which runs from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline, or basic). On this scale, a pH of 7 is considered neutral, meaning that the solution is neither acidic nor basic. This is typically the pH of pure water at 25 degrees Celsius. When a solution falls below this neutral value and approaches 0, it signifies that the concentration of hydrogen ions is increasing, and thus the solution is becoming more acidic. Conversely, if a solution has a pH value higher than 7 and approaching 14, the concentration of hydrogen ions is decreasing relative to hydroxide ions, hence that solution is becoming more basic or alkaline. To explain the options: - Acidity: Refers to the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. A high concentration of H+ ions leads to a low pH value and a high acidic nature. - Alkalinity: This represents the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) in a solution. A high level of OH- ions corresponds to a high pH value, indicating a high basic or alkaline nature. - Alcohol: This is an organic compound with a hydroxyl (OH) functional group. It's related to chemistry but not directly used to determine the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. - Moisture: Refers to the presence of water in the air, in materials, or in the ground. It isn't used to quantify the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. From this comparison, we can eliminate \\"alkalinity\\", \\"alcohol\\", and \\"moisture\\" from the selection because they do not indicate the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. Hence, the correct response is \\"acidity\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

New York (CNN) -- Three defendants pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to conspiring to defraud a Holocaust reparations organization out of 57.3 million, according to court documents. Genrikh Kolontyrskiy, Moysey Kucher and Dora Kucher, all of Brooklyn, helped produce and process some of the thousands of fraudulent applications for the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany that are under investigation. The organization, also known as the Claims Conference, distributes more than 400 million a year from funds provided by the German government to victims of the Holocaust. \\"Our efforts to hold to account all of the individuals who participated in defrauding an organization that exists solely for the purpose of aiding victims of Nazi atrocities continues,\\" said Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a statement. The defendants aided in defrauding two funds managed by the Claims Conference, the Article 2 Fund and the Hardship Fund, of 45 million and 12.3 million, respectively, according to court documents. The Article 2 Fund makes monthly payments of around 400 to survivors of Nazi persecution who make less than 16,000 per year \\"and either lived in hiding or under a false identity for at least 18 months,\\" according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's office. The Hardship Fund pays a one-time payment of 3,500 to \\"victims of Nazi persecution who evacuated the cities in which they lived and were forced to become refugees.\\" Kolontyrskiy, 80, knowingly processed fraudulent applications for payment while employed with the Article 2 Fund, according to court documents.

Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: THE first night in Yosemite had been awful. I hadn't been able to sleep and I was stuck in a too small tent with my wife and two kids. \\"Things haven't worked out,\\" I said to myself. But, like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee, this one was ridiculously off-key. Things weren't bad; they were good. A hundred yards(91 meters) away was Summit Lake, with its wonderful early morning mists shimmering off the water. A couple of miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level, huge snow banks dotting the place even in mid August. It was beautiful. We fired up the camp stove, got out our cold boxes from the heavy metal locker ,fired up some bacon, cut open some bread, and boiled up a cup of coffee. Half an hour later, my 6-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail, getting ready to hike. We wouldn't make it all the way-- young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path, but it didn't matter. We would see great views spread out below us, the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it. Later, on the hike, I felt stupid about my morning complaints. Everything had been worthwhile. It gave me enormous satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain. Yes, camping is uncomfortable. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to nature. Just as importantly, there's something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology-filled comfort zones and forcing them to encounter the non-cyber world around them. We lose something when we spend all our time cocooned inside a carefully constructed modernity, when read about daily affronts to the environment, yet don't fully realize what is at risk, removed as we are from nature.

Cook county used many fertilizers and pesticides, while Dane county used only organic methods and no pesticides. As a result, the waters in Dane county were cleaner. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which county polluted fewer rivers? Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Answer:","completion":"Dane county polluted fewer rivers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As the blood flows through the glomerulus, pressure forces water, salts, glucose, urea, and other small molecules out of the capillaries and into the surrounding Bowman's capsule, a cup-shaped structure that encircles the glomerulus.

A nephew of the kingdom's founder King Wareru, Saw Zein succeeded his brother King Saw O in September 1323. He lost the southern territories of Tenasserim coast back to his nominal overlord Sukhothai, and looked to expand his territory northwards. He died in battle in his siege of Prome (Pyay). - A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king (or an empress consort in the case of an emperor). In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch. - Wareru (; 12531307) was the founder of the Ramanya Kingdom located in today's Lower Burma (Myanmar). The kingdom is more commonly known as Kingdom of Hanthawady Pegu (Bago), or simply Pegu although the kingdom's first capital was Martaban (Mottama). By using both diplomatic and military skills, the commoner of Shan and Mon descent successfully carved out a kingdom for the Mon people in Lower Burma following the collapse of the Pagan Empire in 1287. Wareru was nominally a vassal of his father-in-law Ram Khamhaeng of Sukhothai, and of the Mongols, and successfully repulsed attacks by the Three Shan Brothers of Myinsaing in 1287 and 1294. - Sanda Min Hla (; died c. 1363) was the queen consort of three kings of Hanthawaddy Kingdom, and the real palace power behind the throne. Her murder of her second husband King Saw E, grandson of king of Sukhothai provoked an invasion from Sukhothai. Her third husband King Binnya E Law, whom she placed on the throne, defeated the invasion, allowing the kingdom to achieve its independence from Sukhothai. - Zein Pun ( Burmese : ( ze p ) ; 1295 -- 1330 ) was the fifth king of the Hanthawaddy Kingdom in Burma . A court official at Martaban Palace , he seized the throne for seven days in 1330 after the death of King Saw Zein in the battlefield of Prome . Zein Pun 's reign was short . Saw Zein 's chief queen Sanda Min Hla organized a putsch , and handed the throne to Saw E , son of Saw O and the princess of Sukhothai .

It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry.

Choreography is used in a variety of fields, including musical theater, cheerleading, cinematography, gymnastics, fashion shows, ice skating, marching band, show choir, theatre, synchronized swimming, cardistry, video game production and animated art. In the performing arts, choreography applies to human movement and form. In dance, choreography is also known as dance choreography or \\"dance composition\\". - Performance art is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally interdisciplinary. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work. - Dance is a performance art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.

SINGAPORE — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed Tuesday \\"to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\\" during a historic summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who then unexpectedly said he was suspending military drills with South Korea. Kim's commitment to denuclearize was included in a document signed after the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader. It calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides promised to hold follow-up negotiations. While the document didn't lay out a specifics regarding denuclearization, Trump said at a news conference \\"We're starting that process very quickly. Very, very quickly, absolutely.\\" \\"We're going to denuke North Korea,\\" Trump also told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren, adding that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announcing one concession long-sought by North Korea not included in the document signed earlier in the day. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said, referring to the U.S. participation in joint military exercises with South Korea. At his news conference, Trump said the war games were expensive, provocative and inappropriate. ​Later, a Pentagon spokesman said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was \\"not surprised\\" by Trump's concession ending the war games and had been consulted, including discussions with Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \\"We welcome the outcomes,\\" the defense spokesman said. \\"We support them.\\" Trump struck an optimistic tone about his talks with Kim. \\"My meeting with Chairman Kim was honest, direct and productive. We got to know each other well in a very confined period of time.\\" The U.S. leader stressed that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" Question: How likely is it that the signed document led to the any real change in North Korea's nuclear production?

It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What does the narrator probably think of dried foods? Options: A. That you can eat dried food as much as fresh food B. not enough information C. That you shouldn't buy dried food as much as fresh food D. That dried food is awful","completion":"B. not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sentence 2: Teversall Manor is a former railway station in Teversal, Nottinghamshire on the Derbyshire border west of Mansfield. Step 1: Identify the main subject in both sentences. Both sentences are talking about Teversall Manor. Step 2: Check for any differences in the description of the subject. In both sentences, Teversall Manor is described as a former station or railway station. The only minor difference is that Sentence 1 simply says \\"station,\\" while Sentence 2 specifies \\"railway station.\\" However, in the context of these sentences, it's reasonable to assume that \\"station\\" implies \\"railway station.\\" Step 3: Compare the locations mentioned in both sentences. Both sentences mention that Teversall Manor is on the Derbyshire border and that it's west of Teversal (Sentence 1) or west of Mansfield (Sentence 2). However, Sentence 1 states that Teversall Manor is in Mansfield, while Sentence 2 states it is in Teversal, Nottinghamshire. Step 4: Determine if the location differences significantly impact the meaning of the sentences. The difference in location (Mansfield vs. Teversal, Nottinghamshire) creates some ambiguity. The sentences may be interpreted as describing different locations for Teversall Manor. However, given that both sentences mention Teversall Manor being on the Derbyshire border and west of something, it's likely that they refer to the same location, albeit described slightly differently.

One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \\"Losing My Religion\\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song \\"Locust Street.\\" Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize.

Answer a question about this article: As part of the housing and credit booms, the number of financial agreements called mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO), which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices, greatly increased. Such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the U.S. housing market. As housing prices declined, major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in subprime MBS reported significant losses. Who could invest in the U.S. housing market through MBS and CDO?","completion":"Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO) facilitated the global investment in the U.S. housing market. When discussed in the context of the article above, these instruments could be invested in by a number of different entities or groups. 1. Financial Institutions: One of the first groups that could invest in such financial instruments are global financial institutions. These include commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, and pension funds. These entities usually have large sums of money at their disposal which they look to put in a variety of investments to diversify their portfolio and maximize their return. They would invest in MBS and CDO as these were considered to be safe investments with attractive yields. 2. Individual Investors: Individual or retail investors who have a certain level of wealth can also invest in such securities. They may do this through asset management companies or brokerage firms. To maximize their capital, they might invest in these securities because they offer good returns. However, these instruments are sophisticated and complex, thus making them more suitable for savvy investors who are able to understand and manage the risks involved. 3. Sovereign Wealth Funds: These are state-owned investment funds which have surplus reserves to be invested in a range of assets. MBS and CDO could form part of their investment strategy due to the potentially high returns. However, this heavily depends on the risk appetite of the fund. 4. Government Sponsored Enterprises: In the US, this specifically refers to enterprises like Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Ginnie Mae. These entities were established to enhance the flow of credit to specific sectors of the economy. They are involved in the buying, pooling, and selling of home mortgages in the secondary market as MBS. 5. Endowments and foundations: Certain types of institutional investors like university endowments, foundations, or nonprofits might seek to enhance their investment earnings by investing in such securities. In essence, a wide range of investors with differing risk profiles, including individual investors, institutional investors, and government entities, could invest in the U.S. housing market through MBS and CDOs. These divisions are not only confined to the United States, but also extend across the globe given the vast, interconnected nature of modern financial markets.

Without the organ the church choir cannot perform the rehearsed Bach piece because the music was written to be performed with an organ. Accompanied by both his sons, Gruber travels to Salzburg, hoping to buy spare parts and then mend the organ when returning to the village. The party is caught in a snow storm and the spare part is lost on the way home but pastor Joseph Mohr is simply thankful they are unharmed. Pastor Mohr (with a little help from the bell-ringer Otto) writes the lyrics for a song and the next morning he brings it to Gruber, asking him to compose a melody for the lyrics. With some inspiration from his wife, Gruber sets music to Mohr's words. At church Gruber and Mohr presents \\"Silent Night\\" performed a cappella by the choir. Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person that is asked to compose a melody is Franz. In the article, it is mentioned that pastor Joseph Mohr brings the lyrics of a song to Franz Gruber and asks him to compose a melody for the lyrics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Questioned closely, it is discovered that his wife is being held hostage at their home by Steve, a brutal extortionist who demands the diamonds in the shop's safe in exchange for the woman's life. After Steve kills the family maid, FBI agent Warren Stantin (Sidney Poitier) hands over the diamonds, but Steve kills the jeweller's wife anyway, and escapes. Feeling that he has failed, Stantin becomes obsessed with finding Steve, and he chases Steve into the rugged forests of the state of Washington, where Steve joins up with a group of sportsmen who plan to trek into the wilderness on a fishing trip. Steve's plan is to kill them and force their guide, Sarah (Kirstie Alley), to lead him through the wilderness to the CanadaâUS border. Stantin must team up with Sarah's mountain-man boyfriend Jonathan Knox (Tom Berenger) to pursue Steve. Jonathan does not believe city slicker Stantin can keep up on a tough cross-country hike that includes some rock climbing, and Stantin is determined to prove himself. They pursue Steve and Sarah into the wilderness and eventually to the streets of Vancouver. The movie also featured a chase scene aboard the BC Ferries Queen of Vancouver. After a long chase, Stantin manages to shoot Steve in an underwater struggle. The killer's identity is not revealed until midway through the film. He attempts to evade detection by killing a member of a hiking expedition and taking his place.

Based on the premise \\"and they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"They dip it in the garlic butter and slurp it out of the shell.\\" is true?","completion":"To assess the validity of the hypothesis \\"They dip it in the garlic butter and slurp it out of the shell\\" as a conclusion for the premise \\"and they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it,\\" we need to analyze the given information and context. Here is a detailed analysis. Premise: \\"And they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it.\\" This statement provides some clues about the possible food item and the way it is being consumed. There are a few key points to consider: 1. The food is meant to be dipped. 2. The food comes in a shell that can be opened or removed during consumption. Considering these points, it's likely that the food in question is some kind of shellfish, such as oysters, clams, or mussels as these are typically served in their shells and can be dipped in a sauce before consumption. Hypothesis: \\"They dip it in the garlic butter and slurp it out of the shell.\\" The hypothesis suggests that the food is dipped in garlic butter and then consumed by slurping it from the shell. This hypothesis is plausible, as many shellfish dishes are commonly served with a garlic butter sauce, and slurping is a common way of eating these foods, ensuring that the flavors blend as they are eaten. However, the original premise does not explicitly mention garlic butter as the dipping sauce, nor does it mention slurping as the method of consumption. It is important to note that there are other sauces in which the shellfish could be dipped, and there may be different ways to consume the dish, although slurping is a common method in some cultures. For example, some other possible sauces include cocktail sauce, mignonette sauce, or a simple lemon wedge, and the consumer might not necessarily slurp it but could use a fork or spoon to remove the shellfish from the shell. Given this information, while the hypothesis \\"They dip it in the garlic butter and slurp it out of the shell\\" is certainly a plausible interpretation of the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that it is true without additional context or information. Further details about the dish and sauce being used would be required to confirm the accuracy of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Article: BEARS EARS NATIONAL MONUMENT, Utah — Parts of this sprawling region of red-rock canyons and at least three other national monuments would lose their strict protection and could be reopened for new mining or drilling under proposals submitted to President Trump by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Thursday, according to congressional aides and others who have been briefed on the report. Environmentalists, ranchers, tribal governments and Western lawmakers had been watching closely to see if Mr. Zinke would propose changing the borders of the Bears Ears National Monument, which President Barack Obama established at the end of his term, and other scenic and historic areas under federal protection. In recent days, Mr. Zinke had been considering a dramatic reduction to Bears Ears, to approximately 160,000 acres from 1.35 million, according to multiple people familiar with the process. No president has ever reduced a monument by such a large amount. Shrinking the monuments would be widely seen as a direct blow to Mr. Obama’s environmental legacy, and would probably prompt the first major legal test of a century-old conservation law. ||||| This crawl of online resources of the 115th US Congress was performed on behalf of The United States National Archives & Records ||||| FILE - In this May 26, 2017, file photo, Susie Gelbart walks near petroglyphs at the Gold Butte National Monument near Bunkerville, Nev. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he's recommending that none... (Associated Press) SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Tribes, ranchers and conservationists know that none of the national monuments ordered reviewed by President Donald Trump will be eliminated, but the changes in store for the sprawling land and sea areas remain a mystery after the administration kept a list of recommendations under wraps. That left people on all sides of the contentious debate clinging to only shreds of information and anxiously waiting for more details. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told The Associated Press that none of the 27 monuments will be rescinded, but he said he would push for boundary changes on a \\"handful\\" and left open the possibility of allowing drilling, mining or other industries on the sites. The White House said only that it received Zinke's recommendations Thursday, a deadline set months ago. But it declined to make them public or offer a timetable for when it would take action. Zinke previously said in a trickle of announcements this summer that no changes would be made at six monuments under review — in Montana, Colorado, Idaho, California, Arizona and Washington — and that Bears Ears on tribal lands in Utah would be downsized. Conservationists and tribal leaders responded with alarm and distrust, demanding the full release of Zinke's recommendations and vowing to challenge attempts to shrink any monuments. Jacqueline Savitz, senior vice president of Oceana, which has been pushing for preservation of five marine monuments included in the review, said that simply saying \\"changes\\" are coming doesn't reveal any real information. \\"A change can be a small tweak or near annihilation,\\" Savitz said. \\"The public has a right to know.\\" Groups that consider the millions of acres designated for protection by President Barack Obama and other past presidents part of a massive federal land grab voiced optimism that Zinke wants to reign in some areas. But they also expressed disappointment that the full report wasn't available. \\"It was kind of the unmonumental monument announcement,\\" said Kathleen Sgamma, of the oil industry trade group Western Energy Alliance. Sgamma's group is among the organizations that hope the review spurs reform of the 1906 Antiquities Act, the law that gives presidents power to unilaterally create national monuments. Zinke said in a short summary report that he found that that the creation of some of the monuments was arbitrary or politically motivated. If Trump adopts Zinke's recommendations, it could ease some of the worst fears of the president's opponents, who warned that vast public lands and marine areas could be stripped of federal protection. But significant reductions in the size of the monuments or changes in what activities are allowed on them could trigger fierce resistance, too, including lawsuits. A tribal coalition that pushed for the creation of the 2,100-square-mile (5,400-sqaure kilometer) Bears Ears monument on sacred tribal land said it is prepared to launch a legal fight against even a slight reduction in its size. \\"Our tribes stand together and are willing to go into battle in terms of litigation,\\" said Davis Filfred, a council delegate for the Navajo Nation council. New England commercial fishing groups say they're hopeful they'll get back rights to fish in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, an area off the coast of New England designated last year for protection by President Obama. Republican Utah state Rep. Mike Noel, who has pushed to rescind the designation of Bears Ears as a monument, said he could live with a rollback of its boundaries. He called that a good compromise that would enable continued tourism while still allowing activities that locals have pursued for generations — logging, livestock grazing and oil and gas drilling. Other sites that might see changes include the Grand Staircase-Escalante monument in the Utah desert, consisting of cliffs, canyons, natural arches and archaeological sites, including rock paintings; Katahdin Woods and Waters, 136 square miles (352 square kilometers) of forest of northern Maine; and Cascade Siskiyou, a 156-square-mile (404-square kilometer) region where three mountain ranges converge in Oregon. The marine monuments encompass more than 340,000 square miles (880,000 square kilometers) and include four sites in the Pacific Ocean and an array of underwater canyons and mountains off New England. Zinke suggested that the same presidential proclamation process used by four presidents over two decades to create the monuments could be used to enact changes. Environmental groups contend the Antiquities Act allows presidents to create national monuments but gives only Congress the power to modify them. Mark Squillace, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said he agrees with that view but noted the dispute has never gone before the courts. Conservative legal scholars have come down on the side of the administration. No president has tried to eliminate a monument, but some have reduced or redrawn the boundaries on 18 occasions, according to the National Park Service. Zinke did not directly answer whether any monuments would be newly opened to energy development, mining and other industries Trump has championed. Zinke, a former Montana congressman, insisted that public access for uses such as hunting, fishing or grazing would be maintained or restored. He also spoke of protecting tribal interests. In the interview, Zinke struck back against conservationists who had warned of impending mass sell-offs of public lands by the Trump administration. \\"I've heard this narrative that somehow the land is going to be sold or transferred,\\" he said. \\"That narrative is patently false and shameful. The land was public before and it will be public after.\\" ___ Brown reported from Salt Lake City.

The changes, which could pave the way for new mining and drilling concessions, would represent a significant reduction in the monument's size, from its current 1.35 million acres to just 160,000 acres. If undertaken, the removal of restrictions would pose a major challenge to the century-old US conservation law and could lead to a legal confrontation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have an equation that looks like this: 0 = 246*d - 440*d + 3298. Our job is to find the value of 'd' that makes the equation true. First, let's combine the terms with 'd' in them: 0 = (246 - 440) * d + 3298 Now, subtract 246 from 440: 0 = (-194) * d + 3298 Next, we want to move that 3298 to the other side of the equals sign. We'll do that by subtracting 3298 from both sides: -3298 = (-194) * d Now, we want to find out what 'd' is. We do that by dividing both sides by -194: (-3298) / (-194) = d When we divide -3298 by -194, we get 17: 17 = d So, the value of 'd' that makes the equation true is 17.

This spinning takes approximately 24 hours to be completed, which makes up one solar day or \\"sun time.\\" However, as the Earth is rotating around the Sun in its orbit, its position with respect to the background stars changes slightly during this 24-hour period. This leads us to another concept known as a \\"sidereal day,\\" which is the time taken by the Earth to complete one rotation with respect to the background stars. A sidereal day is slightly shorter than a solar day and lasts about 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds. This difference occurs because the Earth has to rotate slightly more than 360 degrees in a solar day to remain aligned with the Sun due to its orbital motion. As the Earth rotates on its axis, the sky appears to move as well, with the stars and celestial objects seemingly changing their positions throughout the course of a day. This apparent motion is known as the \\"diurnal motion\\" of the stars. In the beginning, the stars will appear to rise in the East and then gradually move across the sky following curved trajectories, finally setting in the West. During the night hours, when the Sun is not visible, we observe the stars and celestial objects clearly because there is less interference from sunlight, which makes the sky \\"dark.\\" The stars are actually continuously moving across the sky during both day and night, but their motion is obscured by the brightness of the sky during daytime. Therefore, their apparent motion is more noticeable during nighttime, even though the Earth's rotation is causing the stars to appear to move continuously throughout the 24-hour solar day or \\"sun time.\\" In conclusion, the Earth rotating on its axis causes the apparent motion of stars across the sky throughout the entire solar day or \\"sun time.\\" However, this motion is primarily noticeable during nighttime hours, when there is less interference from sunlight and the sky appears darker, allowing us to observe stars and celestial objects more clearly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Besides taking care of her home and family, Gloria also works as a cleaning lady to make ends meet and takes amphetamines to keep going. Her marriage to Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver, is on the rocks. Fifteen years earlier, in Germany, Antonio worked as a driver for Ingrid Muller, a German singer with whom he had a brief affair. His only mementos of their liaison are a signed photograph and a tape of her song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen which he constantly plays and which Gloria detests. Antonio's services for Ingrid involved copying letters that she had allegedly received from Hitler himself. In his taxi Antonio meets the writer Lucas and Antonio casually mentions this fact to Lucas, who suggests that they forge Hitler's diaries for big profit. There is also a book of Ingrid's memoirs written by a friend which contains letters from Hitler which Antonio helped forge. Antonio is trying to teach the art of forgery to one of his sons, as this talent will be his only inheritance. The younger son, Miguel, who is twelve, sleeps around with older men.

When the king is killed while suppressing a peasant rebellion, Einon is mortally wounded by the peasant girl Kara (Sandra Kovacikova). Einon's mother, Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie), has him taken before a dragon whom she implores to save the boy's life. The dragon replaces Einon's wounded heart with half of its own on the promise that Einon will rule with justice and virtue. However, Einon soon becomes more tyrannical than his father, enslaving the former rebels and forcing them to rebuild a Roman castle. Bowen believes that the dragon's heart has twisted Einon, and swears vengeance on all dragons. Twelve years later, an adult Einon (David Thewlis) has his castle rebuilt. Kara (Dina Meyer) asks the king for pardoning her father after years of slavery, but Einon instead kills him in order to \\"free\\" him. As for Bowen, he has become a very skilled dragonslayer.

The dragon states that he is the last of his kind, and thus if Bowen kills him, he will be out of a job. The two form a partnership to defraud local villagers with staged dragonslayings. Bowen calls the dragon Draco, after the constellation.

Staind ( STAYND) is an American rock band formed in 1995. The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Aaron Lewis, lead guitarist Mike Mushok, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny April, and drummer Jon Wysocki. The lineup has been stable outside of Wysocki's departure in 2011, who was replaced by Sal Giancarelli. The band has recorded seven studio albums: Tormented (1996), Dysfunction (1999), Break the Cycle (2001), 14 Shades of Grey (2003), Chapter V (2005), The Illusion of Progress (2008), and Staind (2011). In late 2014, the band went on another hiatus. Aaron Lewis continued to play solo shows and work on his next solo album. He also confirmed that the hiatus would last \\"for a while\\". Mike Mushok teamed up with former Three Days Grace singer Adam Gontier, former Finger Eleven drummer Rich Beddoe and Eye Empire bassist Corey Lowery to form Saint Asonia. When asked in an August 2016 interview about Staind's future, Mushok stated that the hiatus could possibly be the end of the band. He explained, \\"I remember '09, we stopped touring, and we did a record after that. We did the self-titled Staind record, which we did a little touring on. It was one of my favorite Staind records we had done. Aaron, I know, has another country record coming out in September. So...you know, we say we're gonna do something else, but there's no real plan for it right now. I know he's pursuing. And I know we're writing another record.\\". In addition, Aaron Lewis indicated that he is focused on country music while noting \\"Do I think there's room somewhere down the road for Staind to play shows in the summertime, radio festivals and stuff like that? Sure. Do I think I have another one of those Staind records in me? Of course I do. All I have to do is live.\\" On August 4, 2017, the band performed for the first time since November 2014 for an acoustic performance at Aaron Lewis' 6th annual charity golf tournament and concert when bassist Johnny April & drummer Sal Giancarelli joined Aaron Lewis & Mike Mushok to perform \\"Outside\\", \\"Something to Remind You\\", and \\"It's Been Awhile\\".

Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Packers, the Vikings' Week 11 opponent was the Oakland Raiders, who had former Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper under center. After a 79-yard pass from wide receiver Sidney Rice to Visanthe Shiancoe on the first play from scrimmage, the Vikings scored on the very next play on a 10-yard run from Chester Taylor. This was followed by a safety when Culpepper was penalized for intentional grounding in his own endzone. Two plays after the ensuing free kick, the Vikings fumbled the ball just inside Oakland territory, allowing the Raiders to set up a 42-yard field goal for Sebastian Janikowski. On the next drive, the Vikings restored their nine-point lead as kicker Ryan Longwell hit a 30-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter. A short Oakland drive culminating in 10-yard touchdown pass from Culpepper to tight end John Madsen, followed by another Janikowski field goal, saw the Raiders take the lead for the first time. Four plays later, Minnesota regained a six-point lead on a 38-yard touchdown run from Taylor, but field goals of 42 and 49 yards from Janikowski meant the first half ended with the scores level at 19-19. The Vikings recorded the only score of the third quarter on a 38-yard field goal from Longwell, though they did finish the period on the Raiders' 6-yard line, allowing Taylor to run in his third touchdown on the opening play of the fourth quarter, the first time in his career that he scored three touchdowns in one game. A 52-yard field goal from Janikowski narrowed the margin to 7 points with less than three-and-a-half minutes to play, and after forcing the Vikings to punt just inside the two-minute warning, they had one last chance to level the scores. On the first play of the drive, Culpepper threw the ball in the direction of Justin Fargas, who tipped it up, allowing Chad Greenway to come up with an interception; he went to ground with the ball, but inexplicably got up and attempted to advance it, which allowed left tackle Barry Sims to force a fumble, recovered by right guard Paul McQuistan. That enabled the Raiders to extend their drive, but although they managed to get into Vikings territory, a false start penalty meant Culpepper had to attempt a Hail Mary pass on the final play, but it came up short, giving the Vikings a 29-22 win.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Choices: (a). negative (b). positive TEXT:I saw this film at the Adelaide Film Festival '07 and was thoroughly intrigued for all 106 minutes. I like documentaries, but often find them dragging with about 25 minutes to go. Forbidden Lie powered on though, never losing my interest. The film's subject is Norma Khoury, a Jordanian woman who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the publication of her book Forbidden Love, a biographical story of sorts concerning a Muslim friend of hers who was murdered by her family for having a relationship with a Christian man. A few years later though, a few journalists started poking holes in the story, leading the public to believe it was fraud. The film covers this quickly but thoroughly in the beginning, and from there we spend most of our time in the company of Norma as she tries to convince us that her novel is more than fiction. Director Anna Broinowski has found a truly fascinating woman to study, and she conducts endless interviews with Khoury as she seeks the truth. As always in life, the truth is not so easy to find. Norma fears for her life, worried about violent backlash over the unsavoury portrait her novel paints of Jordanian Muslims. She refuses to return to Jordan and show us the facts. Broinowski is not deterred however, and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us. The result is an incredible look inside the mind of a con artist. Naturally, what we find there makes little sense and is extremely difficult to follow, and ultimately we don't know whether to believe Norma or not. She's either a rather unfairly put-upon woman trying to survive, or a fantastic spinster. The web of lies, truths and half-truths she turns through the film is brilliant. The film uses much interview footage, as well as dramatisations to tell it's story, and Broinowski uses these dramatisations to show us why people like Norma are able to exist: we want to be conned. We go to the cinema every day and allow ourselves to believe what's happening on the screen is real. That might just be me reading into things a bit too much, it didn't come up in the Q&A with Brionowski after the film, but that's what I took away from it. This is a great Australian film, and must receive an international release, and a swag of awards if you ask me. Certainly the best film I saw at AFF07. Go see it, if you get the chance.","completion":"The correct sentiment for this text is (b). positive.

First, write down the math problem: -74 * o - 2944 = 154 * o - 208 2. Next, we want to move all the \\"o\\" pieces to one side. Let's move the -74 * o to the other side by adding 74 * o on both sides: -2944 = 154 * o - 208 + 74 * o 3. When we add 154 * o and 74 * o, we get 228 * o: -2944 = 228 * o - 208 4. Now, let's move the -208 to the other side by adding 208 on both sides: -2944 + 208 = 228 * o 5. When we add -2944 and 208, we get -2736: -2736 = 228 * o 6. To find out what \\"o\\" is, we need to divide -2736 by 228. So, o = -2736 / 228 7. When we do the division, we find out that o=-12. So, the answer to the problem is o = -12.

Context: The second of three children born to bank manager Tony Taylor, and his wife Judy, Mark Taylor's early years were spent at Wagga Wagga, where his family relocated when he was eight. His father had a sporting background, playing first grade rugby in Newcastle. The young Taylor preferred Australian rules football and cricket. He learned to bat in the family garage, with his father throwing cork balls to him. Taylor idolised Arthur Morris, the left-handed opening batsmen from New South Wales who led the aggregates on the 1948 \\"Invincibles\\" tour of England. Taylor played for his primary school as an opening batsman, and made his first century at the age of thirteen for the Lake Albert club at Bolton Park in Wagga. His family then moved to the north shore of Sydney, where he joined Northern District in Sydney Grade Cricket. Completing his secondary education at Chatswood High School, he later obtained a degree in surveying at the University of New South Wales. Along with the Waugh twins, Steve and Mark, Taylor played in under-19 youth internationals for Australia against Sri Lanka in 1982-83. Taylor made his Sheffield Shield debut in 1985-86 when NSW was depleted by the defection of regular openers Steve Smith and John Dyson to a rebel tour of South Africa. Opening with fellow debutant Mark Waugh, he scored 12 and 56 not out against Tasmania. His first season was highlighted by home and away centuries against South Australia in a total of 937 runs at 49.31 average. He had a lean season in 1987-88, after which he spent the English summer with Greenmount, helping them to win their first Bolton League title by scoring more than 1,300 runs at an average of 70. He originally trained as a surveyor, and received a degree in surveying from the University of New South Wales in 1987. Question: Did he receive any formal training?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Mark Taylor received formal training both in his sporting and professional career. In terms of his cricketing career, he learned to bat in his family's garage with his father throwing cork balls at him, eventually playing for his primary school as an opening batsman. He then continued his sporting exploits with the Northern District in Sydney Grade Cricket, and representing Australia in under-19 youth internationals against Sri Lanka in the 1982-83 season. Outside of his sport, Taylor achieved a formal education and undertook professional training. He completed his secondary education at Chatswood High School and furthered his studies at University of New South Wales, where he obtained a degree in surveying in 1987. This indicates a pursuit of formal training in a professional capacity alongside his athletic endeavors. In the context of cricket, Taylor also had his first taste of professional cricket in the 1985-86 Sheffield Shield season, when he was called up to play for New South Wales. He made his debut in a match against Tasmania, and his first season was notable for his commendable batting performance. Therefore, be it learning the game from his father in his early years, playing for various cricket clubs during his formative years, representing his country in youth internationals, or gaining professional experience in Sheffield Shield, Taylor had extensive formal training in cricket. Simultaneously, he also received formal academic training, completing high school and acquiring a university degree. This blend of sporting and academic training laid a well-rounded foundation for Taylor’s future career both as a cricket player and commentator, and as a professional in the field of surveying."},{"prompt":"Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Joe Pendleton (Warren Beatty) is a quarterback for the LA Rams, and has just been given a chance to start.

One bizarrely popular response was to blame the absence of. John Terry. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: England's Football Legacy: A Closer Look at Humble Beginnings and Challenges In the annals of football history, England stands proud with its remarkable impact on the sport. However, the past few decades have seen a string of disappointments led by a series of managers, including Greenwood, Robson, Hoddle, Eriksson, Capello, and most recently, Hodgson - all of whom have struggled to rekindle the glory days of English football. In this article, we will explore the history of these managers and the various challenges they have faced, ultimately leading to the acknowledgment that they have been forced to \\"eat humble pie.\\" While the likes of Greenwood, Robson, Hoddle, and Eriksson attempted to assess the weaknesses of the English team to create new tactical systems, it became evident that they did not have the necessary tools at their disposal. English players, too, struggled to adapt to the changes demanded by this coaching evolution, which was a vital reason behind their lackluster performance. One such player under immense media scrutiny was Steven Gerrard, whose displays during this period were far from satisfactory. Gerrard performed like a \\"tribute act\\" to his former self, failing to make a significant contribution to the team's general improvement. Under Fabio Capello, England seemed to have found their footing with a confident playing style, but the Italian's rigid tactics stifled creativity, causing more problems than it solved. The lack of trust and connection between the players and the coaching staff led Capello to also face criticism and the burden of failure. Roy Hodgson went through a similar experience - an experienced hand in the realm of football club management, but unable to produce the expected results. He, too, faced the humbling challenges of being singled out as a failure in the quest for England's success. It was during his tenure that another perplexing issue arose - the absence of John Terry from the national team. The former Chelsea captain and English international, John Terry, is considered one of the great English defenders of his generation. Known for his leadership and organization skills on the field, his absence played a significant role in the decline of the team's defensive performances. Many believed that his presence would have been a game-changer, attributing the team's misfortunes to his exclusion. However, it is crucial to recognize that no single player or manager can single-handedly shoulder the responsibility of an entire team. It concealed the deeper issues within the English football system – a lack of a cohesive youth development program, the imbalance between domestic leagues and international competitions, and the immense pressure placed on players and managers alike. There has been a shift in recent years with the appointment of Gareth Southgate as the manager, who has aimed to develop a more balanced and youthful team. The importance of nurturing homegrown talent has also been acknowledged, with youth academies playing a more significant role in developing a new generation of footballers committed to England's footballing future. In conclusion, England's football journey has provided valuable lessons on the importance of change, adaptability, and creating a sustainable long-term vision. The time has come to discard the past and build a stronger foundation at both the grassroots and top tiers of English football, ensuring the sport can return to its former glory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When someone says, \\"Well, I guess I'll have to go to face the music\\", it does not mean he is planning to go to a concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that, and why you did not do this or that. Sour(; )music, indeed, but it has to be faced. The phrase \\"to face the music\\" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. Where did the expression come from? The first information comes from the American writer James Fennimore Cooper. He said in 1851 that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their cue(,) to go on, they often said, \\"It's time to go to face the music.\\" And that is exactly what they did--- face the orchestra which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. So, \\"to face the music\\" came to mean having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice. The other explanation comes from the army. Men had to face inspection by their leader. The soldiers worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean--shiny enough to pass inspection? Still, the men had to go out, and face the music of the band, as well as the inspection. What else could they do?

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Simpsons Movie Context: While performing on Lake Springfield, music group Green Day perished when the lake's pollution dissolves their barge, following an audience revolt after frontman Billie Joe Armstrong proposes an environmental discussion. At their memorial, Grampa Simpson foresees the destruction of the town, but only Marge takes this seriously. Later that day, Homer dares his son Bart to skate naked to the Krusty Burger restaurant and Bart is arrested by Chief Wiggum. Bart considers their neighbor Ned Flanders a better father figure after Homer refuses to take responsibility for the incident. Lisa and a new Irish friend named Colin convince the entire town to clean their lake. Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger and names it \\"Spider Pig\\" (later \\"Harry Plopper\\", and simply \\"Plopper\\"), and stores the pig's feces (and some of his own) in a silo, until Marge tells him to safely dispose of the waste. Homer intends to take his silo to the waste management plant, but after Lenny calls to tell him that Lard Lad Donuts has been shut down and is giving away free donuts, Homer impatiently dumps the silo straight into the lake, polluting it worse than before. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated; Flanders and Bart (who bond after Homer humiliates Bart) discover the creature before the EPA captures it. Russ Cargill, head of the EPA, presents five \\"unthinkable\\" options to U.S. President Arnold Schwarzenegger to keep the town's pollution contained; the slow-witted president, doesn't bother reading number 3 before picking it; enclosing Springfield in a large glass dome. When the police discover Homer's silo in the lake, and his responsibility for sealing Springfield in the dome, an angry mob advances on the Simpsons' home to kill Homer, but the family escapes the town through a sinkhole, which then destroys their house. With the EPA on their trail, the Simpsons flee to Alaska. On the way, Homer tries to make some money at a carnival by riding a motorcycle around the inside of a metal... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Simpsons Movie,\\" Springfield is enclosed in a large glass dome. This drastic measure is taken after the town's pollution reaches critical levels, making it unsafe for the inhabitants and the surrounding environment. The decision to enclose Springfield in a dome is made by U.S. President Arnold Schwarzenegger, who chooses from five \\"unthinkable\\" options presented to him by Russ Cargill, head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). President Schwarzenegger does not read the details of the third option but picks it anyway, leading to the containment of the town under the dome. The pollution of Springfield Lake worsened when the main character, Homer Simpson, dumps a silo filled with pig feces and some of his own waste into the already-contaminated lake. This act leads to a squirrel mutating severely upon contact with the lake's water. The mutated squirrel is discovered by Bart Simpson and Ned Flanders, who come to bond with each other after Homer humiliates Bart. The mutated squirrel is captured by the EPA, which prompts their direct intervention in containing the pollution issue in Springfield. The citizens of Springfield become aware of Homer's role in causing the town to be contained under the glass dome, and an angry mob forms to confront him and his family. The Simpsons manage to escape both the mob and the pursuing EPA agents through a sinkhole, and they flee to Alaska. Along their journey, Homer tries to earn money by riding a motorcycle in a carnival, demonstrating the family's determination to survive and escape the predicament they find themselves in due to the pollution crisis and the dome containment. In summary, the town of Springfield is enclosed in a large glass dome to contain the hazardous pollution caused by the waste dumped in the lake, primarily due to Homer Simpson. This event causes the Simpsons family to go through various challenges and experiences, strengthening their bond with one another and eventually finding a way to save their town."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jeffrey has an aggressive cat, while Benjamin does not because","completion":"Benjamin has a mild allergy to cats. One day, Jeffrey and Benjamin decided to have a barbecue at the local park. Jeffrey, knowing that his cat, Mr. Whiskers, would cause a ruckus around other people, decided to leave him at home. Benjamin appreciated his consideration, as his allergies could be quite uncomfortable. Step 1: Decide on the location - Choosing the local park to enjoy the barbecue creates a comfortable environment that both Jeffrey and Benjamin can enjoy. It also helps keep the allergic reactions for Benjamin to a minimum. Step 2: Jeffrey leaves Mr. Whiskers at home - This step is important because bringing an aggressive cat to a public setting can create unnecessary stress and discomfort for both the cat and the people around. Step 3: Preparing the barbecue - Jeffrey and Benjamin discussed what food they wanted to cook and who would bring what. Benjamin opted for the allergy-friendly veggie skewers, while Jeffrey was in charge of the meat and grill. They both agreed to contribute a side dish. Step 4: Arriving at the park - Jeffrey and Benjamin met at the park around noon, gave each other a friendly hug, and immediately set up the grill. Jeffrey taught Benjamin his secret grilling techniques. Meanwhile, Benjamin carefully marinated the vegetables for his skewers. Step 5: Cooking and enjoying the food - After the grill was all set, Jeffrey started cooking the meat while Benjamin prepared the veggie skewers. They were both happy with how the food turned out, and enjoyed sharing their side dishes with each other as well. Step 6: Cleanup - After they finished eating, Jeffrey and Benjamin made sure to clean up their area and dispose of any trash. As environmentally conscious individuals, they knew the importance of keeping the park clean for future visitors. Step 7: Relaxing and chatting - Once everything was packed up, they decided to relax on a nearby bench and chatted for hours about their mutual interests. Benjamin even shared some advice on how to manage aggressive cats, which Jeffrey would later try with Mr. Whiskers. Step 8: Reflecting on the day - As the sun began to set, Jeffrey and Benjamin reflected on the great time they had at the park. They appreciated the relaxing atmosphere, good food, and engaging conversation. They decided that this successful barbecue should become a monthly tradition. By considering the well-being of both the cat and Benjamin, they were able to have a memorable day at the park.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what contains chloroplasts?\\" is \\"trees\\", given that bushes contain chloroplasts? Answer:","completion":"While \\"trees\\" is indeed a valid answer to the question \\"what contains chloroplasts?\\", it is important to note that the answer can be much broader. This is because chloroplasts can be found in diverse organisms that carry out photosynthesis. Chloroplasts are specialized cell organelles found in plants and certain kinds of algae. They play a crucial role in converting sunlight into carbohydrates through the process of photosynthesis, which provides energy for these organisms to grow and, in turn, sustains all life forms that rely on them for food. Due to their fundamental role in providing energy for the biological world, understanding the full scope of organisms that contain chloroplasts is essential. Although trees are perhaps the most well-known example of organisms containing chloroplasts, they are not the only ones. A wide variety of plant life and eukaryotic algae also contain chloroplasts, including: 1. Bushes and shrubs: As you correctly pointed out, bushes contain chloroplasts. This is because bushes, like trees, are plants that rely on the process of photosynthesis to produce food. 2. Flowering plants: Angiosperms, or flowering plants, represent a considerable portion of the plant kingdom, and they too contain chloroplasts, which allows them to generate energy through photosynthesis. 3. Ferns and mosses: Non-flowering plants such as ferns and mosses (pteridophytes and bryophytes, respectively) also contain chloroplasts and are capable of performing photosynthesis. 4. Green algae: Eukaryotic algae, particularly those belonging to the group Chlorophyta (green algae), contain chloroplasts. Like plants, green algae also use these organelles to generate energy through photosynthesis. 5. Red and brown algae: Algae belonging to the groups Rhodophyta (red algae) and Phaeophyceae (brown algae) also contain chloroplasts, albeit with slightly different pigment compositions compared to green algae. 6. Seaweed: Seaweeds are a type of macroscopic, multicellular marine algae and can also contain chloroplasts. They play a fundamental role in aquatic ecosystems due to their ability to create energy from sunlight. 7. Cyanobacteria: While not containing traditional chloroplasts, cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae) can perform photosynthesis using specialized structures called thylakoids. Though they are not technically considered to be part of the plant kingdom, their contribution to global oxygen production and the ecosystem cannot be overlooked. In conclusion, while answering \\"trees\\" is not entirely wrong, it is essential to understand that chloroplasts can be found in a much broader range of organisms, from a great diversity of terrestrial and aquatic plant life to algae and even some bacteria. Expanding our comprehension of this topic provides a much richer and more complete understanding of the myriad forms of life that depend on chloroplasts and photosynthesis for their survival, growth, and sustenance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: In 1841, Léon Escudier wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, \\"One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\\" Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his Projet de méthode he wrote: \\"Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.\\" He further stated: \\"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\\" The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.

The androids are indistinguishable from human beings, apart from minor flaws in their hands, and guests are encouraged to indulge in any fantasy, including killing the androids. The androids are programmed to respond positively to guest requests, specifically including requests for sex. Delos's guests pay 1,000 a day for the experience.Peter Martin (Benjamin) a first-timer and his friend John Blane (Brolin), who has visited previously, come to the WesternWorld zone, where one of the main attractions is the Gunslinger (Yul Brynner), a robot programmed to start duels. Thanks to its programming, humans can always outdraw the Gunslinger and kill it. The guns issued to the guests also have temperature sensors that prevent them from firing at each other or anything else living but allow them to 'kill' the room-temperature androids.Gradually, the technicians running Delos begin to notice problems with the androids.

It is one of the most important natural and historical areas in Florida. Paynes Prairie is located near Gainesville. It is large, 21,000 acres. This protected land is called a preserve. The Florida Park Service manages the preserve. The Paynes Prairie basin was formed when limestone dissolved and the ground settled. It is covered by marsh and wet prairie vegetation. There are areas of open water. During brief periods it has flooded enough to be considered a lake. Except for that, the basin has changed little through time. Man has lived on Paynes Prairie a very long time. He lived there as far back as 10,000 B. C. At one time, the Seminoles lived there. The prairie is thought to have been named after King Payne, a Seminole chief. During the late 1600s, the largest cattle ranch in Florida was on Paynes Prairie. Today, Paynes Prairie is preserved land. It is occupied by visitors and Florida Park Service employees. Willam Bartram visited Paynes Praire. Bartram was the first person who portrayed (described) nature through personal experience as well as scientific observation. He lived 200 years ago. He visited Paynes Prairie in 1774. At that time he described it. He called Paynes Prairie the \\"great Alachua Savannah.\\" Most of the animal life, which Bartram described, is still here. A large number of sandhill cranes, hawks and waterfowl are here in winter. The animal _ is increased by the presence of pine flatwoods, hammock, swamps and ponds. The Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park is open year round. The Florida Park Service works hard so that the park will appear as it did in the past. It offers many opportunities for recreation. At the park you can camp and picnic. You can hike and bike. You can boat and fish. You can ride on horse trails. And you can see lots of nature and wildlife.

In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film Hamlet, which was favourably reviewed by The New York Times: \\"But the lack of this aural stimulation – of Shakespeare's eloquent words – is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\\".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: \\"Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.\\"A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival.

A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence...

Question: Given the following context: A year after the song was published Dresser's brother Theodore, who later became a famous novelist, privately claimed to have authored its lyrics. In 1917, after Dresser's 1906 death, Theodore made his controversial claim public in a newspaper article. Already a controversial figure because of his open support for communism and tendency to make negative comments about his home state, Theodore's claims were ridiculed in many papers and by prominent Hoosiers who dismissed it as a hoax. Although Theodore never retracted his assertion that he wrote the first verse and chorus of the song, he downplayed the importance of his alleged contribution in later years. It is possible that Theodore did give his brother the idea for the song, and may have even authored a portion of the lyrics, some of which reflect his writing style. The line stating \\"where I first received my lessons, nature's school\\" is a possible link, reflecting Theodore's obsession with nature during his youth and his belief that it held the answers to life, a topic he wrote of on several occasions.Dresser died penniless after his publishing business failed. Known for his generosity, he also had a tendency to overspend and give money to his friends and family. In addition, copyrights to Dresser's music were poorly managed after the Haviland and Dresser Company went bankrupt in 1905. Maurice Richmond Music, who purchased the bankrupt company's copyrights, gave Ballard MacDonald and James Hanley permission to use two bars from Dresser's ballad in a song they published in 1917. MacDonald and Hanley's \\"Back Home Again in Indiana\\" has since eclipsed \\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\\" in public use. Their song borrowed heavily from \\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\\" in the chorus, both musically and lyrically, using far more than just the two bars granted to them. Twenty-six bars from the last two lines of the chorus are copied almost identically.

These two composers published a song called \\"Back Home Again in Indiana,\\" which borrowed heavily from \\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\\" in the chorus.

Read this: Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265–420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181–234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \\"Zhuge\\". The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refugee in south of the Yangtze River. However, considering the mountainous geography and relative lack of agrarian lands in Zhejiang, most of these refugees might have resided in some areas in south China beyond Zhejiang, where fertile agrarian lands and metropolitan resources were available, mainly north Jiangsu, west Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui,and provinces where less cohesive, organized regional governments had been in place. Metropolitan areas of Sichuan was another hub for refugees, given that the state of Shu had long been founded and ruled by political and military elites from the Central Plain and north China.

The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth. An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, \\"the worst came to the worst\\". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door. The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced. Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank.

Nearly 50% of students say they are worried about robbery on the way to and from school. Now in main big cities in China, some schools have taught an unusual lesson: self-protection. Students like this lesson because there are no exams or boring classes. And they can learn how to save lives and know how to get away from danger before it really happens. Chen Haoyu, a teacher at Beijing No. 25 Middle School, gives young students advice on how to deal with danger. If you are robbed Keep calm if you can not cry for help or run away. Give the robber your money. Try to remember what the robber looks like and tell the police later. If you are in a traffic accident If a car hits you, you should remember the car number. If it is a bicycle, try to call your parents before you let the rider go. This is because you don't know how seriously you are hurt. If it is raining hard and there is lighting Don't stay in high places and stay away from trees. If there is a fire Get away as fast as yon can. Put wet things on your body and try to find an exit .

You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. The film opens with Colin Smith (Tom Courtenay) running, alone, along a bleak country road somewhere in rural England. In a brief voiceover, Colin tells us that running is the way his family has always coped with the world's troubles, but that in the end, the runner is always alone and cut off from spectators, left to deal with life on his own.Colin is then shown with a group of other young men, all handcuffed. They are being taken to Ruxton Towers, a detention centre for juvenile offenders, an approved school. It is overseen by \\"the Governor\\", who believes that the hard work and discipline imposed on his charges will ultimately make them useful members of society. Colin, sullen and rebellious, immediately catches his eye as a test of his beliefs.An important part of the Governor's rehabilitation programme is athletics, and he soon notices that Colin is a talented runner, easily able to outrun Ruxton's reigning long-distance runner. As the Governor was once a runner himself, he is especially keen on Colin's abilities because, for the first time, his charges have been invited to compete in a five-mile cross country run against Ranley, a nearby public school with privileged pupils from upper-class families. The Governor sees the invitation as an important way to demonstrate the success of his rehabilitation programme.The Governor takes Colin under his wing, offering him outdoor gardening work and eventually the freedom of practice runs outside Ruxton's barbed wire fences. A series of flashbacks shows how Colin came to be incarcerated: his difficult, poverty-stricken family life in a lower class workers' complex in industrial Nottingham. Without a job, Colin indulges in petty crime in the company of his best friend, Mike (James Bolam). Meanwhile, at home, his father's long years of toil in a local factory have resulted in a terminal illness for which he refuses treatment. Colin is angered by the callousness of his mother (Avis Bunnage), who he knows already has a \\"fancy man\\", and who Colin finds has neglected to give his father a herbal concoction for pain and (as Colin believes) brings about his father's death.Colin rebels by refusing a job offered to him at his father's factory. His father's company has paid Â£500 in insurance money, and he watches with disdain as his mother spends it on clothes, a television and new furniture. When his mother moves her lover into the house and after an argument when she tells him to leave, Colin and Mike take to the streets. Colin uses his portion of the insurance money to treat Mike and two girls they meet to an outing in Skegness, where Colin falls in love with his date, Audrey (Topsy Jane), and confesses to her that she is the first woman he's ever had sex with. She eventually extracts a half-hearted promise from Colin that he might look for work, implying his feelings for her are such that they might marry.But one night, while prowling the streets of Nottingham with Mike, the two spot an open window at the back of a bakery. There is nothing worth stealing except the cashbox, which contains about Â£70. Mike is all for another outing to Skegness with the girls, but Colin is more cautious and hides the money in a drainpipe outside his \\"prefab\\". Soon the police call, accusing Colin of the robbery. He tells the surly detective (Dervis Ward) he knows nothing about it. The detective produces a search warrant on a subsequent visit, but finds nothing. Finally, frustrated and angry, he returns to say he'll be watching Colin. As the two stand at Colin's front door in the rain, the torrent of water pouring down the drainpipe dislodges the money, which washes out around Colin's feet.This backstory is interspersed in flashbacks with Colin's present-time experiences at Ruxton Towers, where he must contend with the jealousy of his fellow inmates over the favouritism shown to him by the Governor, especially when the Governor decides not to discipline Colin, as he does the others, over a dining hall riot over Ruxton's poor food. Colin also witnesses the kind of treatment given to his fellows who are not so fortunate â beatings, bread-and-water diets, demeaning work in the machine shop or the kitchen.Finally, the day of the five mile race against Ranley arrives, and Colin quickly identifies Ranley's star runner (played by James Fox). The proud Governor looks on as the starting gun is fired. Colin soon overtakes Ranley's star runner and has a comfortable lead with a sure win; but a series of jarring images run through his mind, jumpcut flashes of his life at home and his mother's neglect, his father's dead body, stern lectures from detectives, police, the Governor, the hopelessness of any future life with Audrey. Just yards from the finish line, he stops running and remains in place, despite the calls, howls and protests from the Ruxton Towers crowd, especially the Governor. In close-up, Colin looks directly at him with a rebellious sneer, an expression that remains as the Ranley runner passes to cross the finish line to victory. The Governor is intensely angry.At the end, Colin is back in the machine shop, punished and ignored by the Governor. But he seems calm â even content â with his loneliness, because he has refused to submit to authority., Question: how much money is in the cashbox?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If I did not, of course, know at the time that the will in question had only been made this afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell into a grievous error. , can we conclude that \\"My children as well, did not know when the will had been created.\\"?","completion":"Based on the provided information, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the children were unaware of the creation of the will. However, we can try to examine the situation and make an educated assumption. In the given statement, the speaker admits to not knowing that the will in question had only been made that afternoon. They also acknowledge that when they learned this piece of information, they realized they had made a grievous error. The statement does not explicitly mention the children's knowledge or involvement concerning the creation of the will. Therefore, we must consider different scenarios to determine whether the children were likely aware of the will's creation. Scenario 1: If the person providing the statement (let's call them Person A) was actively involved in some aspect of the will creation process and still lacked information about the timing, it is reasonable to assume that others involved (i.e., the children) may also have lacked that information. Scenario 2: If Person A has a more distant relationship to the situation, simply learning about the will's creation and not participating in any discussions or decisions, it is still possible that the children may have known when the will was created. Their knowledge would largely depend on their own involvement and communication with other parties. Scenario 3: If Person A is directly responsible for keeping the children informed about the situation, then it is highly likely that the children would not have known the details about the will's creation if Person A was not aware of the timing themselves. In conclusion, while the provided statement does not offer definitive proof regarding the children's knowledge of the will's creation, examining possible scenarios can help us make an educated assumption about whether they were aware of the timing. Moreover, we cannot directly conclude that the children did not know when the will had been created, as their awareness of the event depends heavily upon individual circumstances and involvement in the matter."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. - Chilecebus carrascoensis is an extinct species of New World monkey that lived in what is now Chile during the Early Miocene some 20 million years ago . It had a body mass of about 1.3 pounds ( 600 grams ) . - Spider monkeys of the genus Ateles are New World monkeys in the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus contains seven species, all of which are under threat; the black-headed spider monkey, and brown spider monkey are critically endangered. - A prehensile tail is the tail of an animal that has adapted to be able to grasp or hold objects. Fully prehensile tails can be used to hold and manipulate objects, and in particular to aid arboreal creatures in finding and eating food in the trees. If the tail cannot be used for this it is considered only partially prehensile - such tails are often used to anchor an animal's body to dangle from a branch, or as an aid for climbing. The term \\"prehensile\\" means \\"able to grasp\\" (from the Latin \\"prehendere\\", to take hold of, to grasp). - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - The Old World monkeys or Cercopithecidae are a family of primates, the only family in the superfamily Cercopithecoidea in the clade (or parvorder) of Catarrhini. - The Callitrichidae (also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae) are a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets and tamarins. At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in Central and South America and portions of Mexico: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the Platyrrhini parvorder and the Ceboidea superfamily, which are essentially synonymous since Ceboidea is the only living platyrrhine superfamily. Platyrhini means flat-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini (\\"down-nosed,\\" comprising Old World monkeys and apes). New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago. - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas. - Apes (Hominoidea) are a branch of Old World tailless anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are the sister group of Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes. - Catarrhini is one of the two subdivisions of the simians, the other being the plathyrrhine (New World monkeys). The Catarrhini contains the Old World monkeys and the apes; the latter of which are in turn further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes, consisting of the orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. The Catarrhine are all native to Africa and Asia. Members of this parvorder are called catarrhines. - The Pitheciidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. Formerly, they were included in the family Atelidae. The family includes the titis, saki monkeys and uakaris. Most species are native to the Amazonia region of Brazil, with some being found from Colombia in the north to Bolivia in the south. - The Atelidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It was formerly included in the family Cebidae. Atelids are generally larger monkeys; the family includes the howler, spider, woolly, and woolly spider monkeys (the latter being the largest of the New World monkeys). They are found throughout the forested regions of Central and South America, from Mexico to northern Argentina. - The Cebidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It includes the capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys. These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical South and Central America. - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. - A primate is a mammal of the order Primates (Latin: \\"prime, first rank\\"). In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal. - Monkeys are haplorhine (\\"dry-nosed\\") primates, a group generally possessing tails and consisting of about 260 known living species. There are two distinct lineages of monkeys: New World Monkeys and catarrhines. Apes emerged within the catarrhines with the Old World monkeys as a sister group, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. However, traditionally apes are not considered monkeys, rendering this grouping paraphyletic. The equivalent monophyletic clade are the simians. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, particularly Old World monkeys.

Answer the following question: Process: - Acid rain makes waters acidic - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die - The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems - Question: suppose there will be more remains buried happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"A: More If more remains are buried, it means there is a higher concentration of organic matter in the soil. When acid rain occurs, the acidic water may cause the release of various chemicals and nutrients from this organic matter as it decomposes. This can lead to increased levels of nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, being released into water bodies like lakes and streams. The presence of excessive nutrients can cause algal blooms, which further deplete oxygen levels in the water and create inhospitable conditions for aquatic life. Moreover, the aluminum absorbed by the water due to acid rain can also cause issues when more remains are buried. The higher levels of aluminum in the soil can be toxic to many plant species, leading to a decrease in plant diversity and affecting other organisms that rely on these plants for food and habitat. This imbalance in the ecosystem can make it more susceptible to the damaging effects of acid rain, leading to a vicious cycle of environmental degradation. In conclusion, more remains buried can contribute to the damage caused by acid rain by exacerbating the release of harmful substances such as aluminum and nutrients, negatively affecting ecosystems and making them more vulnerable to acid rain's effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Foxconn has been at the center of a storm of complaints about working conditions for its","completion":"employees in recent years. As the world awaits the highly anticipated release of the iPhone 5, Foxconn is facing even more scrutiny from human rights watchdogs and the general public. In order to address these allegations and to prove their commitment to fair labor practices, Foxconn decides to take several initiatives. They begin by implementing stricter policies for their internship program, which include more rigorous oversight and a reduction of working hours for students. The company also establishes partnerships with independent organizations to conduct regular audits and assessments of their working conditions. As a result of these efforts, Foxconn receives recognition and support from several well-respected human rights groups, who attest to the improvements made in the working conditions and overall welfare of the employees. Apple also releases a statement praising Foxconn's efforts to address the issue, further boosting the company's reputation. The launch of the iPhone 5, while initially marred by the controversy surrounding Foxconn's labor practices, goes on to be a smashing success. Apple's stock soars, and customers worldwide are satisfied with both the quality of the product and the steps taken to address the concerns about the manufacturing process. Over time, Foxconn's improvements in labor practices lead other electronics manufacturers in China to follow suit, initiating a ripple effect of positive change in the industry. The public starts to perceive these efforts as a clear message that both Apple and Foxconn are serious about their commitment to ethical labor, and the story ultimately comes to a close on a hopeful note, with the companies being hailed as pioneers for change in the world of electronics manufacturing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Votes: Garcetti, Greuel reach out; how the tax vote varied After winning spots in the May 21 mayoral runoff, Wendy Greuel and Eric Garcetti are back on the campaign trail and heavily courting two distinct constituencies -- black Democrats in South Los Angeles and white Republicans in the San Fernando Valley. The candidates are also increasingly highlighting their plans to revitalize the city’s economy -- a reaction, some argue, to widespread criticism that Greuel and Garcetti failed to offer many specifics during the primary. Many eyes turned to failed mayoral candidates Jan Perry and Kevin James, whose supporters could be key to winning in the May runoff. Perry has not endorsed, but had harsh words for Greuel’s ties to labor. James met with both remaining candidates in recent days as he decides whether to endorse. FULL COVERAGE: L.A.'s race for mayor The Times analyzed voter trends in the other big contest on the ballot: the half-cent sales tax increase that L.A. city voters rejected. The results showed a tale of two cities, with voters in the poorest parts of Los Angeles who are most dependent on city services more likely to support the measure, while residents in more affluent swaths were more likely to be against it. Columnist Steve Lopez weighs in on Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's supporting the sales-tax proposal as vital for retaining key city services, and then claiming that the city’s finances are rosier than believed after the tax failed at the ballot box.

You can also learn more about chromosomal alterations by watching the provided video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrXRSqa_3lU (2:18). These alterations can lead to genetic disorders or changes in an organism's traits, depending on the affected genes and the specific alteration involved. Some common types of chromosomal alterations include deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. Deletions occur when a section of a chromosome is lost during DNA replication or repair, leading to the absence of certain genes on the chromosome. This can cause serious health issues and developmental problems if the missing genes are essential for normal function. Duplications arise when a section of a chromosome is accidentally copied, leading to an extra copy of certain genes. This can result in an overexpression of the duplicated genes, which might lead to phenotypic changes or the development of genetic diseases. Inversions involve a section of a chromosome breaking off, flipping around, and rejoining in the opposite orientation. This may disrupt the order of genes on the chromosome, potentially disrupting gene function and regulation. Translocations occur when a piece of one chromosome breaks off and attaches to another chromosome. This can lead to the misregulation of genes on both chromosomes, and potentially cause genetic disorders or contribute to the development of cancer. To summarize, the correct option from the provided choices is \\"chromosome structure.\\" Chromosomal alterations are mutations that change chromosome structure, which, depending on the specific alteration, can lead to various genetic disorders, changes in phenotypes, or even the development of cancer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The story of Joseph Smith stands out as an amazing - even moving - episode in American history and World Religious history. This movie portrays events in the life of Joseph Smith, whom Mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on the earth. I've so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing. Joseph Smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers (Alvin, Hyrum & Joseph) who, at a very young age, needed an operation. The operation, done without our modern conveniences, was bloody and difficult. The scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the Smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents. Joseph's religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what Mormons call the First Vision was interestingly portrayed. The face of Jesus is never shown, but you see the unmistakable nail marks in His hands. The rejection by religious leaders and many in his small New York community is sweetened at least slightly by Joseph's marriage to Emma. This movie does not clearly map out the events of Mormon Church history, but merely jumps from scene to scene. This is not a critique - simply a note about the style. The practice of tarring and feathering is shown, and it is especially dramatic and moving when Joseph delivers a sermon about the Savior's love with a scarred face from having recently been attacked. The movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of Mormonism as an infant church, while at the same time the ever-deepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governments. The film shows many scenes from Joseph's life, including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to Emma. An attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, including his fierce love for his wife, his endless love for children, his wit, his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition, his religious sentiments, and his compassion. As Joseph and Hyrum ride to Carthage, never to return home alive, most of the characters from throughout the movie, whose lives had been touched by Joseph, are shown along the way, helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful. At the end, the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum is portrayed, and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessed. When I first watched the movie I assumed it was made by the Church to introduce Joseph Smith to non-members. I no longer think that is the case, although I hope the movie can do just that. As an insider, I find that the film is a celebration of Joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him. I am curious to see how outsiders will view the film - whether they will simply see it as propagandic, an epic story of an American religious man, or something else. The film is beautifully shot, family friendly, moving and, hopefully, something good for everyone. That the events portrayed actually happened in these United States of America is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and respect (generally) for the law - we moderns take for granted.

His only hope is that his lawyers can persuade the serial killer Richard Ramirez to confess to the crime instead. His legal team includes Kit, who is tasked with traveling to California, and visiting Ramirez in San Quentin State Prison in an attempt to persuade him to confess. She stays in a budget hotel and spends time in a bar during her time off. The murder in Texas took place before Ramirez's first known killing. Kit initially speaks with Ramirez by phone through glass; he refuses to reveal anything until they meet in a visitation room. There, he demands she remove her gold jewelry; he says that he is a Satanist, and gold is offensive to Satan because it is God's metal. He remains uncooperative because guards are in the room, but suggests that they can have privacy if she says she's his lawyer. Even then he remains uncooperative and insulting, demanding that she reveal personal details about herself to make herself interesting enough that she deserves to know more about him. As a child, she lived in the same neighborhood as one of Ramirez's notorious crimes, and she was obsessed with his crime spree, which was one of her inspirations to become a lawyer. answer the following question: Who is the drifters lawyer?

Article: A qualified doctor who rarely practiced but instead devoted his life to writing. He once said: \\"Medicine is my lawful wife, and literature is my lover.\\" Russian writer Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, was a great playwright and one of the masters of the modern short story. When Chekhov entered the Moscow University Medical School in 1879, he started to publish hundreds of comic short stories to support his family. After he graduated, he wrote regularly for a local daily newspaper. As a writer he was extremely fast, often producing a short story in an hour or less. Chekhov's medical and science experience can be seen through the indifference many of his characters show to tragic events. In 1892, he became a full time writer and published some of his most memorable stories. Chekhov often wrote about the sufferings of life in small town Russia. Tragic events control his characters who are filled with feelings of hopelessness and despair. It is often said that nothing happens in Chekhov's stories and plays. He made up for this with his exciting technique for developing drama within his characters. Chekhov's works combined the calm attitude of a scientist and doctor with the sensitivity of an artist. Some of Chekhov's works were translated into Chinese as early as the 1940s. One of his famous stories, The Man in a Shell, about a school teacher's extraordinarily orderly life, was selected as a text for Chinese senior students.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more adolescents becoming adults happens, how will it affect less fetus in womb. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the process The given process outlines the typical stages of human life, from conception (as a fetus in the womb) to death (as an elderly person). Step 2: Define the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis states that an increase in the number of adolescents becoming adults will have an effect on the number of fetuses in the womb. Step 3: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis's potential effects To do this, we will consider the different ways in which more adolescents becoming adults can influence the number of fetuses in the womb: - If a higher number of adolescents are becoming adults and assuming they have children during their adult life, this could potentially increase the number of fetuses in the womb in the population. - On the other hand, if more adolescents becoming adults lead to delayed childbearing or a decrease in the average number of children per family, it could result in fewer fetuses in the womb overall. Step 4: Determine if the perturbation hypothesis affects the process (directly or indirectly) A: Yes, the perturbation hypothesis does have an effect on the process, although it is indirect. An increase in the number of adolescents becoming adults could change variables such as the overall fertility rate, average age of childbearing, and family planning decisions, all of which can influence the number of fetuses in the womb. However, it is important to note that other factors like social, cultural, and economic conditions may also play a significant role in shaping these variables."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Early life is a critical period for the establishment of the intestinal microbiota and for metabolic development. Mice exposed to subtherapeutic antibiotic treatment (STAT)– with either penicillin, vancomycin, penicillin and vancomycin, or chlortetracycline had altered composition of the gut microbiota as well as its metabolic capabilities. Moreover, research have shown that mice given low-dose penicillin (1 μg/g body weight) around birth and throughout the weaning process had an increased body mass and fat mass, accelerated growth, and increased hepatic expression of genes involved in adipogenesis, compared to controlled mice. In addition, penicillin in combination with a high-fat diet increased fasting insulin levels in mice. However, it is unclear whether or not antibiotics cause obesity in humans. Studies have found a correlation between early exposure of antibiotics (<6 months) and increased body mass (at 10 and 20 months). Another study found that the type of antibiotic exposure was also significant with the highest risk of being overweight in those given macrolides compared to penicillin and cephalosporin. Therefore, there is correlation between antibiotic exposure in early life and obesity in humans, but whether or not there is a causal relationship remains unclear. Although there is a correlation between antibiotic use in early life and obesity, the effect of antibiotics on obesity in humans needs to be weighed against the beneficial effects of clinically indicated treatment with antibiotics in infancy. Why do physicians use antibiotics on infants when the relationship has been proven? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Physicians use antibiotics on infants when necessary because the primary concern is to treat and prevent life-threatening bacterial infections. While there is a correlation between early life antibiotic exposure and increased body mass in both humans and mouse models, the causal relationship between the two remains unclear. Furthermore, the benefits of treating and preventing severe bacterial infections in infants with antibiotics often outweigh the potential risk of obesity. Antibiotics are designed to target specific bacteria and play a crucial role in treating bacterial infections that can cause serious illness or even death if left untreated. In infants, their immune systems are still developing, making them more susceptible to bacterial infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis. As infants may not exhibit the typical symptoms of infection, it's imperative that physicians quickly diagnose and treat these conditions to prevent complications. The correlation between early life antibiotic exposure and increased body mass, though studied, has not been definitively proven as a causal relationship. As mentioned, multiple factors may contribute to obesity development, such as genetics, diet, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Although the effect of antibiotics on obesity is an important consideration, the critical need for antibiotic use in life-threatening situations cannot be dismissed. To balance the potential risks and benefits of antibiotic use in infants, physicians practice judicious prescription practices – prescribing antibiotics only when clinically necessary and precisely targeting the causative bacterial pathogen. This approach aims to minimize unnecessary antibiotic use and reduce potential antibiotic-related risks, such as obesity or the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In conclusion, physicians use antibiotics on infants because the benefits of treating potentially serious bacterial infections often outweigh the potential risks, including the correlation with increased body mass. Further research is necessary to more fully understand the potential causal relationship and long-term effects of early antibiotic exposure on obesity in humans. Meanwhile, responsible antibiotic prescription practices will continue to be emphasized to ensure infants receive appropriate care with minimal potential harm."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This field is dynamic- it changes over time, due to these currents' variable motion and their interaction with the Earth's rotation, and it is also irregular, with the magnetic poles (the points to which a compass needle will point) not aligning exactly with the geographical North and South poles. The magnetic field plays a crucial role in protecting life on Earth by deflecting solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Without the magnetic field, these harmful particles could strip away the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful solar radiation. In addition to its protective role, Earth's magnetic field also aids navigation by humans and many other species. Despite the magnetic poles not being perfectly aligned with geographic poles, they are close enough to be a reliable guide for direction over short to moderate distances, or for determining one's general orientation. So, in conclusion, the movement of molten metal in Earth's outer core does not create a gravitational field (which is instead caused by mass), nor a stellar field (which refers to the region of space around a star), nor does it directly cause earthquakes (which are primarily the result of tectonic forces). It is responsible for creating the Earth's magnetic field."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Times of London Sued in Hacking Scandal LONDON — As Britain’s hacking scandal shows little sign of easing, a high-profile London lawyer who has been closely involved in pursuing cases involving Rupert Murdoch’s British tabloids said on Friday that his firm was suing the upmarket Times of London over e-mail hacking for which the newspaper has apologized. The lawyer, Mark Lewis, said in an interview Friday that the “claim has been issued,” and that he would soon be filing a comprehensive statement of case against the London newspaper, also part of Mr. Murdoch’s British newspaper group, News International. The suit, filed Tuesday, concerns a case in which a reporter who is no longer with the newspaper hacked into the e-mail account of Richard Horton, a police detective who ran an award-winning blog under the pseudonym NightJack. The claim, Mr. Lewis said, “is not just on misuse of information or privacy grounds, but also a claim for what lawyers would call deceit,” based on denials the newspaper made. A spokeswoman for News International confirmed the suit had been filed, but declined to comment further. The blogger’s true identity was not publicly known until an article in The Times of London in 2009 identified him as Mr. Horton. At a hearing in February of the so-called Leveson inquiry into press ethics and practices, James Harding, the editor of The Times of London, apologized on behalf of the newspaper, saying “I sorely regret the intrusion” into the e-mail account. His acknowledgment reversed earlier denials by the newspaper. Britain’s hacking scandal has focused largely on the illicit interception of voice mails, which are at the center of overlapping police, parliamentary and judicial inquiries mainly involving News International, the British newspaper subsidiary of the giant News Corporation. Investigators are also examining the payment of bribes to public officials at two Murdoch-owned tabloids, The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World. Hacking into people’s e-mails is a potentially more serious crime than listening to their voice mail messages, and last summer the police opened Operation Tuleta, an investigation into computer hacking that is being held in tandem with one on phone hacking (Operation Weeting) and another on bribing the police (Operation Elveden). The scandal may be poised to go beyond Britain. On Thursday, Mr. Lewis, the lawyer, said that he planned for the first time to sue on behalf of alleged victims in the United States, the center of Mr. Murdoch’s global media empire. In a telephone interview, he said that he would take legal action on behalf of three people — a well-known sports person, a sports person not in the public eye and an American citizen, none of whom he would further identify. “The News of the World had thousands of people they hacked,” Mr. Lewis said, when announcing the suits in an interview with the BBC, referring to the Sunday tabloid that Mr. Murdoch closed down last year as the hacking scandal engulfed it. “Some of them were in America at the time, either traveling or resident there.” It was not immediately clear how or whether the action would affect the News Corporation. News International declined immediate comment on the cases. Mr. Lewis’s clients in the hacking scandal include the family of Milly Dowler, an abducted teenager who was found murdered in an outer London suburb in 2002, and whose voice mail was said to have been hacked after she disappeared. Public outrage at the case helped propel the hacking scandal to new heights in July, leading to the closure of The News of the World. Reports last year said News International had offered a package of compensation worth some 4.8 million in that case, made up of 3.2 million to the Dowler family, with an additional payment of about 1.6 million to go to charity. News International has so far paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars in other compensation settlements to dozens of hacking victims. But, the BBC said, more than 4,000 people have been identified by the police as possible victims of phone hacking. The scandal spread further earlier this month when a British satellite news broadcaster, Sky News, whose parent company is partly owned by News Corporation admitted that one of its reporters had hacked into e-mails on two occasions while pursuing news coverage, the first time that such accusations had spilled into television news. The acknowledgment came just two days after Mr. Murdoch’s son James resigned as chairman of Sky’s parent company, British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, of which News Corporation owns around 39 percent. Company officials said there was no link between the resignation and the hacking revelations, which were made public only as a result of an inquiry by the newspaper The Guardian.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Article: Talk to others who own German Shepherds. Visit area dog parks, dog shows, and other places in your area where people gather with their dogs. Ask if they bought their dog from a breeder and if they were happy with the experience. Check the American German Shepherd Rescue Association and the American Kennel Club websites for German shepherd breeder referrals nationwide. It is a good idea to visit several breeders before deciding which you want to buy your puppy from. You want to determine how knowledgeable they are about the German shepherd breed and how well they take care of their dogs. Look for breeders who participate with their dogs in activities that demonstrate the dogs' abilities. Such activities include Schutzhund, the working breed test for German Shepherds, and dog shows. Avoid breeders who keep the dogs in cages away from people and have multiple litters at the same time. These puppies often do not receive the early stimulation necessary for development. This includes certification that the dogs do not carry a predisposition for hip or elbow dysplasia, eye disorders, cardiac disease, or Von Willebrand's disease (or VWD). Although some breeders do sell puppies on the Internet, you should always visit the breeder in person and see the puppy before deciding to buy it. If a litter is not currently available, ask if you can visit with a breeder's adult dogs. Notice the adult dogs' physical appearance. The size, build and coloring of the breeding pair is a good indication of how future puppies will look. An adult male German shepherd should stand 24 to 26 inches (60 to 66 cm) at the top of his shoulder blades. A female should stand 22 to 24 inches (55 to 60 cm). If you like what you see and feel comfortable with the breeder, request to be contacted when a litter is being offered for sale. Observe the way the available puppies and the grown dogs interact with each other and people. German Shepherds should have an even temperament. They should display fearlessness and self-confidence, but not aggression or hostility. Pay attention to the cleanliness of the area where the dogs are kept. The dogs' space should be free or feces and urine, and fresh water should be available. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article provides guidance on how to find a reputable German Shepherd breeder by talking to other owners, visiting dog parks and shows, and checking websites for referrals.

Add spaces: Moreeffortsareneededonpoliticalreforms,inparticularfreedomofexpression.","completion":"More efforts are needed on political reforms, in particular freedom of expression. In recent times, there has been a growing concern about the decline in political freedoms and rights of individuals, especially in the area of freedom of expression. To create a more robust and inclusive democratic environment, it is essential that governments and other stakeholders invest more resources, time, and energy into promoting and protecting political reforms. Specifically, the following areas should be given significant attention: 1. Strengthening constitutional guarantees: Many countries have constitutional provisions related to freedom of expression, but they are often weak, vague, or not effectively enforced. Governments should work to strengthen these guarantees and ensure that they are not just symbolic but have a real impact on people's lives. This may involve amending existing provisions and drafting new legislation related to the right to free speech. 2. Enhancing media freedom and independence: A free and independent media is critical for a healthy democracy, as it allows for the dissemination of diverse opinions and enables citizens to make informed decisions. Governments should ensure that journalists can operate without fear of reprisal and that media entities can function autonomously without undue pressure or interference. This may involve repealing or amending restrictive media laws, providing legal protection to journalists, and promoting policies that foster media pluralism. 3. Encouraging public debate: Encouraging open and inclusive public debates on political, social, and economic issues is vital for promoting freedom of expression. Governments should take measures to create spaces for people to express their opinions and engage in constructive discussions. This may involve supporting civil society organizations, providing forums for dialogue, and investing in public education programs that promote critical thinking and debate. 4. Protecting the right to dissent: Dissent is an essential component of a healthy democracy, and individuals should be able to express their disagreement with government policies without fear of retribution. Governments should respect the right to peaceful protest and refrain from using unnecessary force against demonstrators. Additionally, laws that criminalize peaceful dissent, such as sedition and defamation laws, should be reviewed and amended, where necessary. 5. Combating hate speech and promoting tolerance: While protecting freedom of expression, it is essential to recognize the harmful impact that some forms of speech, such as hate speech, can have on individuals and communities. Governments should work to balance the need to protect freedom of speech with the need to combat hate speech and intolerance. This may involve enacting legislation that prohibits hate speech but respects the right to free speech, as well as promoting educational initiatives that foster tolerance and understanding among different communities. 6. Nurturing digital rights: In the digital age, freedom of expression is increasingly linked to digital rights, including access to information and privacy. Governments should ensure that individuals can exercise their right to free speech online and promote digital literacy, data privacy, and the protection of personal information. 7. Holding authorities accountable: Lastly, creating a culture of accountability is crucial for promoting and protecting freedom of expression. Government officials and institutions should be held to account for any actions that undermine this fundamental right. Independent oversight bodies, such as human rights commissions and ombudspersons, should be established and empowered to investigate and address cases of abuse. In conclusion, more efforts are indeed needed on political reforms, particularly in the sphere of freedom of expression. By addressing the issues mentioned above and promoting a holistic approach to strengthening democracy, governments worldwide can ensure that the right to free speech is protected and cherished for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When will the tax plan be made law? Options: A.

Question: Given the below context: The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam. In his court were eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars (Ashtadiggajas) of the literary assembly. The most famous among them were Allasani Peddana who held the honorific Andhrakavitapitamaha (lit, \\"father of Telugu poetry\\") and Tenali Ramakrishna, the court jester who authored several notable works.

Summarize: If you are finding your new schedule is ever-changing, and nothing is familiar, then you may be adjusting your life around your new partner. Look for a few of the following tell-tale signs: You haven’t talked to your best friend in a long time. If you don’t know what your best friend is up to, what their latest news is, you’re definitely placing the new partner first. Normal hobbies are being put on the back burner. Did you miss poker night or ladies night? Ask yourself if your time with friends has been sacrificed. If you’ve skipped a family meal or get together for a new flame, chances are you’re altering your daily life for them. If you have been really moody lately, or have been easily upset, it’s understandable after a breakup. If this has affected your daily life, however, enough that everyone is noticing, then you’ve likely changed emotionally. Create some alone-time in your schedule. Find time to just relax and steady your nerves. If you can't change your attitude and be happy about your new partner, that's not a good relationship sign. Repeat positive affirmations daily. Each day you tell yourself why you are happy with your partner. If convincing yourself proves difficult, the relationship may just be a rebound. No matter what sappy romance movies tell you about the great love that’s been sitting under your nose the entire time, jumping straight out of a breakup into a relationship with a very good friend is a likely sign of a rebound relationship. Immediately reaching out to date your best friend is not the best solution, it's just the easiest. You run the additional risk of ruining the friendship if the relationship doesn't work out. Dating a good friend allows the uncomfortable stage of a relationship to be skipped. Romance and intimacy happens more quickly when the friendship is already established.","completion":"The summary discusses the signs of adjusting your life around a new partner.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? How does a catabolic and an anabolic pathway differ? What are the differences between catabolic and anabolic pathways?","completion":"Yes, both questions essentially ask for the same information. They inquire about the distinctions between catabolic and anabolic pathways. In order to provide a detailed and long answer to this question, we will explore the concepts of catabolic and anabolic pathways, their functions, examples, and their overall differences. 1. Catabolic Pathway: Catabolic pathways, also called \\"catabolism,\\" refer to the series of biochemical reactions in a cell that result in the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones. These pathways typically release energy in the process, which is then utilized to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) - the primary energy currency in the cell. Functions of Catabolic Pathways: - Breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones for providing energy and building blocks for the biosynthesis of other molecules in the cell. - Production of ATP, which powers various cellular processes and reactions. - Facilitation of the elimination of waste substances via the breakdown of molecules. Examples of Catabolic Pathways: - Glycolysis: The breakdown of glucose (a six-carbon sugar) into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon compound), which results in the release of energy and the conversion of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) into ATP. - Beta-oxidation: The breakdown of fatty acids into two-carbon units of acetyl-CoA, which is then incorporated into the citric acid cycle (also called Krebs cycle or TCA cycle) to provide energy. - Proteolysis: The breakdown of proteins into individual amino acids, which can subsequently be used for energy production or other purposes in the cell. 2. Anabolic Pathway: Anabolic pathways, also called \\"anabolism,\\" encompass a series of biochemical reactions that lead to the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones. These pathways generally consume energy, which is usually provided by ATP. Functions of Anabolic Pathways: - Synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones to facilitate growth, repair, and maintenance of cells. - Storage of energy in the form of complex molecules, such as glycogen and lipids, for future use. - Preservation of the cell's genetic information through the replication of DNA and the synthesis of RNA molecules. Examples of Anabolic Pathways: - Photosynthesis: The process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. - Gluconeogenesis: The synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors, such as some amino acids and glycerol, in the liver and kidneys. - Lipogenesis: The synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA, which can then be converted into triglycerides for storage in adipose tissue. - Protein synthesis: The creation of new proteins from individual amino acids, based on the genetic information coded in DNA and carried by mRNA. Differences between Catabolic and Anabolic Pathways: 1. Purpose: Catabolic pathways mainly focus on providing energy and producing simpler molecules, while anabolic pathways are involved in the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones. 2. Energy: Catabolic pathways release energy, whereas anabolic pathways consume energy. 3. ATP: Catabolic reactions typically generate ATP, while anabolic reactions often require ATP. 4. Examples: Examples of catabolic pathways include glycolysis, beta-oxidation, and proteolysis, whereas examples of anabolic pathways include photosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and protein synthesis. In summary, both questions essentially seek the same information, which is to understand the differences between catabolic and anabolic pathways. Catabolic pathways are biochemical processes that involve the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones, thereby releasing energy, while anabolic pathways involve the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones, requiring energy input. The functions, energy requirements, and example processes all differ between the two types of pathways."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Background: Wilhelm was one of eleven children born to poor tenant farmers John and Ethel (nee Stanley) Wilhelm in Huntersville, North Carolina. He played baseball at Cornelius High School in Cornelius, North Carolina. There, he began experimenting with a knuckleball after reading about pitcher Dutch Leonard. Context: Though Wilhelm was primarily a starting pitcher in the minor leagues, he had been called up to a Giants team whose strong starting pitchers had led them to a National League (NL) pennant the year before. Giants manager Leo Durocher did not think that Wilhelm's knuckleball approach would be effective for more than a few innings at a time. He assigned Wilhelm to the team's bullpen. Wilhelm made his MLB debut with the Giants on April 18, 1952 at age 29, giving up a hit and two walks while only recording one out. On April 23, 1952, in his third game with the New York Giants, Wilhelm batted for the first time in the majors. Facing rookie Dick Hoover of the Boston Braves, Wilhelm hit a home run over the short right-field fence at the Polo Grounds. Although he went to bat a total of 432 times in his career, he never hit another home run. Pitching exclusively in relief, Wilhelm led the NL with a 2.43 ERA in his rookie year. He won 15 games and lost three. Wilhelm finished in the top ten in Most Valuable Player Award voting that season, becoming the first relief pitcher to finish that high. He finished second in the Rookie of the Year Award voting. Wilhelm made 69 relief appearances in 1953, his win-loss record decreased to 7-8 and he issued 77 walks against 71 strikeouts. Wilhelm was named to the NL All-Star team that year, but he did not play in the game because team manager Charlie Dressen did not think that any of the catchers could handle his knuckleball. The Giants renewed Wilhelm's contract in February 1954. In 1954, Wilhelm was a key piece of the pitching staff that led the 1954 Giants to a world championship. He pitched 111 innings, finishing with a 12-4 record and a 2.10 ERA. During one of Wilhelm's appearances that season, catcher Ray Katt committed four passed balls in one inning to set the major league record; the record has subsequently been tied twice. When Stan Musial set a record by hitting five home runs in a doubleheader that year, Wilhelm was pitching in the second game and gave up two of the home runs. The 1954 World Series represented Wilhelm's only career postseason play. He pitched 2 1/3 innings over two games, earning a save in the third game. The team won the World Series in a four-game sweep. Wilhelm's ERA increased to 3.93 over 59 games and 103 innings pitched in 1955, but he managed a 4-1 record. He finished the 1956 season with a 4-9 record and a 3.83 ERA in 89 1/3 innings. Sportswriter Bob Driscoll later attributed Wilhelm's difficulties in the mid-1950s to the decline in the career of Giants catcher Wes Westrum, writing that baseball was \\"a game of inches, and for Hoyt, Wes had been that inch in the right direction.\\" Question: Which team was this that won the World Series ?

However, David Petraeus was already mentioned at the beginning of the passage as the one who had an affair with his biographer which ended his storied career. This does indicate that Petraeus could very likely have retired within a year of the scandal, but in the format of the sentence, it would be incongruous to mention Petraeus right after Mattis, as the latter had been in contact with Kelley, not Petraeus. So, out of the remaining options, the most suitable one to complete the sentence would be: \\"James N Mattis retired from the military within a year of the scandal.\\" Hence, the completed passage would be: “Newly-released emails give more detail on how Tampa socialite Jill Kelley carded her way into military society. These emails shed light on the ambitious Tampa socialite who inadvertently exposed General Petraeus' affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell, which ended his storied career in one of the biggest military scandals of the past decade.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. If you have ever grimaced at your petrol bill and dreamed of a car that runs on fresh air, your prayers are about to be answered. French car giant PSA Peugeot Citroen believes it can put an air-powered vehicle on the road by 2016. Its scientists say it will knock 45 per cent off fuel bills for an average motorist. And when driving in towns and cities costs could be slashed by as much as 80 per cent because the car will be running on air for four-fifths of the time. Saving the planet: The Hybrid Air technology could allow a car the size of a Citroën C3 or Peugeot 208 to emit as little as 69g/km of CO2. Cutting costs: A look inside the 'air engine' which could cut 45 per cent off the petrol bill for the average driver. The system works by using a normal internal combustion engine, special hydraulics and an adapted gearbox along with compressed air cylinders that store and release energy. This enables it to run on petrol or air, or a combination of the two. Air power would be used solely for city use, automatically activated below 43mph and available for ‘60 to 80 per cent of the time in city driving’. By 2020, the cars could be achieving an average of 117 miles a gallon, the company predicts. The air compression system can re-use all the energy normally lost when slowing down and braking. The motor and a pump are in the engine bay, fed by a compressed air tank underneath the car, running parallel to the exhaust. The revolutionary new ‘Hybrid Air’ engine system – the first to combine petrol with compressed air – is a breakthrough for hybrid cars because expensive batteries will no longer be needed. Lift-off: The air power will be automatically activated below 43mph and can be used for up to 80 per cent of driving time in urban areas. Cars fitted with Hybrid Air will be about £1,000 cheaper to buy than current hybrid models. For more than two years, 100 elite scientists and engineers have been working on the air-powered car in top-secret conditions at Peugeot’s research and development centre at Velizy, just south of Paris. Hybrid Air is the centrepiece of Peugeot chief executive Philippe Varin’s efforts to restore the fortunes of the historic car maker. The revolutionary system will be able to be installed on any normal family car without altering its external shape or size or reducing the boot size, provided the spare wheel is not stored there. From the outside, an air-powered car will look identical to a conventional vehicle. A spokesman said: ‘We are not talking about weird and wacky machines. These are going to be in everyday cars.’ Peugeot, which unveiled its prototype yesterday, envisages introducing it in smaller models such as the 208 at first. Running on air: The Peugeot 208 is one model that may use the air engine technology in future. The company said that as well as being greener and cheaper to run, the air system created no extra dangers in a collision. Motorists never run the risk of running out of compressed air late at night on a deserted country road because the car will be fitted with a sophisticated artificial brain that ensures it replenishes itself automatically. The air compresses and decompresses of its own accord as the car speeds up and slows down. Spacious interior: Allows for full-sized passenger compartment without surrendering boot volume. Driving comfort and road handling: Hybrid Air promises to deliver nimble response with the boost effect as well as first-class road handling thanks to its automatic transmission. Worldwide potential: The technology is viable in all markets, making it possible for energy efficient cards in all types of climate and regardless of the state of the roads. Boot: No space for a spare tyre once the Hybrid Air motor is installed. As well as the revolutionary air car,. Peugeot also unveiled plans for new larger cars such as the Peugeot 508 and the. Citroen C5 that will save 20per cent on fuel bill through the use of new. materials such as lightweight steel and aluminuim composites. They will also deploy other innovations such as electric power steering instead of hydraulic and new tyres with reduced drag. These. will be introduced from this year. The first cars to feature them will. be the replacement for the Citroen C4 Picasso produced at the company’s. plant in Vigo Spain and the replacement for the 308 built at Sochaux in. France. The audience gasped as the covers were. removed from the prototypes at a packed ceremony attended by French. politicians and business leaders. The innovations are crucial to chairman Philippe Varin’s efforts to revamp the ailing automaker that has suffered badly due to the crisis in southern european markets including Italy, Portugal and Spain that account for a large chunk of its sales. The economy in its home market of France has also been hard hit in the single currency crisis. It has lost its triple-A credit rating and socialist President Francois Hollande has earned international ridicule through his plans for a supertax on the wealthy. The Peugeot company was founded in 1810 and the family still has a controlling stake. Thierry Peugeot drafted in Varin - widely hailed in the UK for rescuing Corus, the former British Steel, from the brink of ruin - in 2009. Varin’s attempts to revive the marque have been hit by the euro meltdown and militant French unions. Worldwide sales for 2012 were down 8.8per cent to 2.82m. The company has been hindered in efforts to improve its performance by France’s rigid labour laws. It has also been plagued by violent industrial action at its Aulnay plant near Paris which is due to close next year with the loss of thousands of jobs. It is embroiled in controversy with rival European car makers over a French state guarantee given to its financing arm last year.

It looks like it might have been repaired, though. I had to push it pretty hard to flush it. Here we go. That’s a very good flush.” This commentary comes from the most popular YouTube video of toiletfan1, who has a channel solely dedicated to toilets. Describing it as one of his favorites, this specimen is located in the women’s room of the Brick Dwelling at the Hancock Shaker Village in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. It is but one of many latrines lovingly cataloged by toiletfan1 and his parents, who have been documenting toilets and urinals across the U.S. for the past three and a half years. To date, they have amassed a total of 4,514 YouTube clips. Uploaded By: toiletfan1 And they’re not alone. While toiletfan1’s channel is among the most visited, he’s just one of a group of toilet enthusiasts who spend their spare time sharing videos and pictures of bowls, cisterns and urinals. A few of the major players include ILoveVintageToilets, who as the name suggests, specializes in older models; the prolific Liam Brom; and Toilet Explorer, a flush-obsessed veteran of the scene. Between them, they have spent years studying toilets and are responsible for tens of thousands of videos and pictures floating around online. And though, to the outside observer, this borderline-obsessive attention might seem like a fetish, they claim it isn’t. At least, not in the regular sense. “The fetishist is very self-centered, very narrow and fairly shallow. They just want to get off by looking at this,” says Bob Cromwell, moderator of website Toilet Guru. “For the enthusiast, it’s a mental thing not a sexual thing. I’m interested in this as it relates to history, as a part of culture, as a part of technology.” Cromwell documents a toilet Lady Gaga allegedly used in her early days, at Johnson's Bar in New York. Bob Cromwell Described as the Indiana Jones and Ansel Adams of toilets, Cromwell has been taking photos of commodes in far-flung places since the ’90s. His site started out as a resource for travel tips, but included a few images of odd plumbing from around the world—which he’d initially posted as a joke. He noticed that visitors to his page were clicking on these photographs, and it soon became apparent he should switch focus. “Looking back, it makes sense, because if you want to look at a picture of London there are a million places to find them. This is something that’s just, you know, strange,” he says. “There’s nothing too weird that you can’t find it somewhere on the net—some obsessive dedication to it or obsessive cataloguing.” Dwight Eisenhower’s plush, presidential potty. Bob Cromwell He now spends much of his free time taking photos of toilets, usually when he is abroad for his work as a systems analyst. During these scouting missions, he is on the lookout for something unusual or culturally specific. More often than not, he finds something illuminating—a habit or practice distinct from his own experience, such as squat toilets. “You say, ‘Oh, they’re a bunch of savages. Their plumbing is completely different to ours.’ Well, maybe they are, but maybe we’re the savages,” he says. “A lot of people look at toilet paper as a filthy approximation that doesn’t get you clean. Actually sitting on the seat that everybody else sits on? A lot of countries think, for very good reason, that that’s a horrible idea.” \\"If you are interested in the fetish aspect or urination, there are much better places to go. This is strictly porcelain, as it were.\\" Other times he focuses on a toilet’s historical relevance, like the time he photographed a lavatory on a tour through Dwight Eisenhower’s house. Though it started out as a joke, Cromwell now sees such toilets as a portal to other worlds and times, and considers them the ultimate common denominator. “It’s like the children’s book, Everyone Poops. There’s nobody who doesn’t need some form of this,” he says. “Everybody does, multiple times a day. But most of us try very hard to pretend that’s not the case. You don’t talk about it. You’re not supposed to talk about it. …It’s kind of this taboo thing.” The urinals at Malaysia's Toy Museum don't disappoint. Urinal.net It’s a philosophy familiar to Joe U. Rinator, co-moderator of Urinal.net, the world’s premier urinal-specific site. He and his business partner (who shares the same tongue-in-cheek pseudonym) started it in 2000, following a road trip through Europe, where they came across unfamiliar pissoirs. Like Cromwell, they started posting photos for a laugh, but it soon took on a more serious tone. They are also eager to separate themselves from fetishists. “Frankly, I don’t really have any interest in looking at pictures of people using urinals,” he says. “It is intended to be a depiction of clean urinals, not in use. We’re not attempting to touch that part of the world. Certainly, there’s nothing preventing people from looking at them for that reason and I’m sure that happens plenty, but if you are interested in the fetish aspect or urination, there are much better places to go. This is strictly porcelain, as it were.” Joe U. Rinator is partial to a urinal with a view, like this submission sent in from Chongqing, China. Urinal.net U. Rinator’s site relies largely on images sent in by urinal watchers from around the globe. They have, on average, 500 visitors every day and receive anywhere between 12 and 20 submissions each month. There are so many that they built a geo-tagged map so fans can more easily navigate the 3,721 individual locations, covering everywhere from Kazakhstan to Namibia. When asked why he does it, U. Rinator also expresses an interest in the cultural differences that can be gleaned from our toilet habits. However, he has a clear bias that sets him apart from many other toilet enthusiasts—namely that he keeps it strictly urinal. “Once you’re focusing on something as prevalent as a toilet, I mean, everybody’s got one,” he says. “It’s just such a different world, and frankly something that I haven’t had any interest in.” ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

This part of my site spun off into its own domain in 2010. My original site can now be just on travel, Linux and other technology, and other non-plumbing topics I find interesting. What makes me a guru? It's purely a self-appointed title. There is no sanctioning body. Am I obsessed with toilets? No! I'm just willing to admit that I find the topic somewhat interesting. I've taken lots of other travel pictures. When you travel off the beaten path, it doesn't take long until the question comes up. \\"Well, you know, how did you, well, when you had to, well, uh, what was it like?\\" So here are pictures I have taken of toilets I have encountered. And hey, I'm not the person reading this page, probably after doing some sort of web search for toilets! Why are you reading this? A web server logs the referer, the page on which the user clicked a link to come to the requested page. For search engines, the URL of the search result page includes the search that was performed. Once in a while I pull out the queries and process that list to find the current interests. There is always curiousity about whether toilet paper will be available or just water, and then where to put the used toilet paper when you're done. And curiousity about other people's toilet habits or rules, be they Islamic, Chinese, French or whatever. Some nervous travelers are researching the availability of toilets on buses and trains. Plus more general or basic questions, such as what is a bidet, or why there are no toilet seats in many European countries, or how to sit on an English commode. The last of those seems rather obvious but it is a continuing theme. I regularly get messages from people saying \\"I have spent the last four hour reading about toilets on your web site, and I would like to know why you are so obsessed.\\" Excuse me? You just spent how long reading about toilets? And you think I am fixated on the topic? What is it like to be a toilet guru? In 2014 I did some Linux consulting for Merrill Lynch at their large facility outside Trenton, New Jersey. I had most of one afternoon free, and in the year leading up to that I had received messages from several people telling me that I should track down Adolf Hitler's toilet which was in an auto repair shop in a nearby small town. The German state yacht was scrapped in New Jersey after World War II. It was partially disassembled and various portholes, teak decking, and internal fixtures including at least one toilet and sink were sold to area residents. The toilet and sink were installed in a local garage. It was interesting to see, not that it was very unusual on its own but it certainly was an unexpected place to find such a connection to history. But the most interesting thing was talking to the guy who came to own Hitler's toilet by accident. He simply purchased a garage when its owner was retiring, the relic came with the building. He likes working on cars, that's what he does and he's good at it. People from all around the world come to his garage to see the toilet, and that mostly just amuses him. There are surplus parts from Hitler's yacht all around the small town, why do people come from Japan, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere to see the toilet? A U.K. television show flew him and the toilet and sink to London. Free airfare, free shipping for the fixtures, and a week in a hotel in London. It wasn't until then that he realized that it had never been properly bolted down, it was simply cemented to the floor. The television show hosts obsessed about this, asking why he hadn't properly bolted it down. It was that way when he bought the garage, and it worked, so there was no reason to pay any further attention to it. Then they demanded an explanation for why, if it was working, had he removed it and ultimated needed to replace it with a modern fixture. This question was from the very people who had invited him on the free week in London if he unfastened it and brought it along. This was all very familiar to me. I have a silly web site on which I make a little ad revenue. Someone else comes along and spends hours looking at the pictures and reading the text. Maybe they're a reporter for the BBC or a major newspaper in the U.S. or U.K., and they decide this is an appropriate topic for a detailed article. They then immediately demand that I explain why I am obsessed with the topics. I have been described by Yahoo as: ||||| Are you wondering how to use a bidet , or even what a bidet is?

National rulers and others wielding great power play by a different set of rules. This includes not caring about privacy while using the toilet. This goes back to the Bronze Age and continued through medieval times, but recent leaders such as U.S. President Lyndon Johnson have practiced Bronze-Age-style toilet habits. The one theme constant from Old Testament times to today is that one of the privileges of great power or high social station is the lack of concern for privacy. It wasn't so much about privacy as it was about power and privilege. Actions or situations that might be distasteful or embarrassing for commoners were not to those in power. Royalty and nobility could behave however they pleased.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life.

Temporal theories offer an alternative that appeals to the temporal structure of action potentials, mostly the phase-locking and mode-locking of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus. The precise way this temporal structure helps code for pitch at higher levels is still debated, but the processing seems to be based on an autocorrelation of action potentials in the auditory nerve. However, it has long been noted that a neural mechanism that may accomplish a delay—a necessary operation of a true autocorrelation—has not been found. At least one model shows that a temporal delay is unnecessary to produce an autocorrelation model of pitch perception, appealing to phase shifts between cochlear filters; however, earlier work has shown that certain sounds with a prominent peak in their autocorrelation function do not elicit a corresponding pitch percept, and that certain sounds without a peak in their autocorrelation function nevertheless elicit a pitch. To be a more complete model, autocorrelation must therefore apply to signals that represent the output of the cochlea, as via auditory-nerve interspike-interval histograms. Some theories of pitch perception hold that pitch has inherent octave ambiguities, and therefore is best decomposed into a pitch chroma, a periodic value around the octave, like the note names in western music—and a pitch height, which may be ambiguous, that indicates the octave the pitch is in.

It dropped to a much lower level in September, October and November, when they released a significant portion of the water as a yearly chore. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: When was the water level higher, in April or in March? Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. A:","completion":"The water level in the Large Lake was higher in April compared to March. According to the provided paragraph, the water level in the lake was high in March and it rose even further in April - it was specifically mentioned to be 3 feet higher in April than it was in March. This suggests a seasonal pattern in which the lake's level increases in the spring due to factors like snow melt and underground springs.

Title: A very systematic and rigorous text Product review: This text is most often used in intensive summer immersion programs, and the pace is consequently more rigorous than Wheelock's. It's more thorough on grammar coverage and drills, though the examples can be a bit plonking. A more serious and deliberate approach, it covers a few uses of the subjunctive and some other tough cookies early on. Low on cultural context, high on systematic presentation of grammar. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?","completion":"The review provided can be considered having both flattering and unflattering aspects towards the product, as it highlights the specific strengths and shortcomings of the text. Let's thoroughly analyze the review to better understand the different elements mentioned. Flattering aspects: 1. Rigorous pace: The reviewer describes the text as systematic and rigorous, suggesting that it is well-organized and suitable for intensive language learning programs. This can be appealing to readers looking for a resource that will ensure they cover the necessary material in a methodical and exhaustive manner. 2. Thorough grammar coverage: The text is praised for its comprehensive grammar coverage and drills. This may be appealing to learners who prioritize a strong understanding of grammatical rules and their application, as well as a focus on practicing those rules to effectively internalize them. 3. Serious and deliberate approach: The reviewer mentions that the text's approach is more serious and deliberate than other resources, which implies that the text's focus is on ensuring accuracy and proficiency of language use. For learners who prioritize precision and mastery of language structures, this might be seen as a plus. Unflattering aspects: 1. Examples can be plonking: The reviewer's use of the term \\"plonking\\" suggests that the examples provided might be dull, uninteresting or overly simplistic. This may be unappealing to readers who seek to have engaging and contextually relevant examples that make the learning process more enjoyable. 2. Low cultural context: The lack of cultural context in the text is noted as a downside. While the product excels in grammar and drill practice, the absence of cultural references or context might be a disadvantage for learners who want to not only learn the language but also gain insights into the culture, history, and nuances of the language's native speakers. 3. Early introduction to difficult topics: The presentation of challenging subjects, such as the subjunctive mood, early in the text might make it unattractive for beginners or those who prefer a more gradual and scaffolded approach. By introducing such complex topics early on, the text could potentially overwhelm or discourage learners who are still developing a basic understanding of the language. In conclusion, the review paints a mixed picture of the product, highlighting the strengths of the text as a systematic and rigorous learning resource but also drawing attention to its potential downsides. The suitability of the product for a specific reader depends on their individual learning priorities and preferences. If they are looking for a methodical and comprehensive language resource with extensive grammar practice, the flattering aspects of the review would be enticing. However, if they prioritize an engaging learning experience with cultural context and gradual difficulty progression, the unflattering aspects might steer them away from this particular text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.

Francis \\"Frank\\" Hague, born in Jersey City, was the fourth of eight children to John D. and Margaret Hague (nee Fagen), immigrants from County Cavan, Ireland. He was raised in Jersey City's Second ward, an area known as The Horseshoe due to its shape which wrapped around a railroad loop. The ward was created when the Republican-controlled legislature gerrymandered a district within Jersey City in 1871 to concentrate and isolate Democratic, and mostly Catholic, votes. By age 14, Hague was expelled from school prior to completing the sixth grade for poor attendance and unacceptable behavior. Technically, Hague's only responsibility as mayor was to appoint the school board. Otherwise, he was merely first among equals, with no powers over and above the other four commissioners. However, soon after taking office, he wrested control of the Hudson County Democratic Party from Wittpenn. This allowed him to significantly influence the makeup of the commission in this overwhelmingly Democratic city. He soon built the organization into one of the most powerful political machines in the country. Hague himself became very wealthy, owning a 125,000 summer home in Deal, living in a large apartment in the best building in the city, and able to give a 50,000 altar to a local Catholic church. He also had the support of a significant faction of Republicans which dated to his initial election as mayor, when he cut a deal with then-Governor Walter Edge in which Edge effectively ceded North Jersey to Hague in return for keeping South Jersey for himself. Also, as public safety commissioner (a post he held throughout his entire tenure), he controlled the two departments with the most patronage appointments in the city. This post also placed responsibility for maintaining public order in his hands. Hague soon extended his influence statewide by helping to elect his \\"puppets\\" as governor. In the 1919 gubernatorial election, Hague endorsed State Senator Edward I. Edwards and aggressively campaigned for him. Edwards carried Hudson County by 50,000 votes, which was enough for him to win statewide by just under 15,000 votes. Hague proclaimed himself leader of the New Jersey Democratic Party, and Edwards allowed him to recommend dozens of appointments to high state offices. Democrats won five out of eight gubernatorial races between 1919 and 1940, more often than not due to massive landslides in Hudson County. However, he was never able to extend his dominance to the state legislature. Hague was able to stay in power despite a nearly constant effort to turn him out of office from 1921 onward. He was also able to avoid prosecution despite numerous federal and state investigations in part due to the fact he took most of his kickbacks in cash. However, from the early 1940s onward, many of the older ethnic groups started moving to the suburbs. They were replaced by Poles, Italians, Eastern Europeans and African-Americans. Hague never adapted his methods to the new groups. Hague had little tolerance for those who dared oppose him publicly. He relied on two ordinances of dubious constitutionality to muzzle critics. A 1920 ordinance effectively required people making political speeches to obtain clearance from the chief of police. A 1930 ordinance gave the public safety commissioner--Hague himself--the power to turn down permits for meetings if he felt it necessary to prevent \\"riots, disturbances or disorderly assemblage.\\" The latter ordinance was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, but continued to be enforced for several years after that decision. The police were also allowed to stop and search anyone without probable cause or a warrant after 9 pm.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who was the Boss of Jersey City?","completion":"The Boss of Jersey City was Francis \\"Frank\\" Hague."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which daily newspaper was founded in 1909, but closed in 1971 when it merged with the Daily Mail?","completion":"The daily newspaper that was founded in 1909 and closed in 1971 when it merged with the Daily Mail is the Daily Sketch. The Daily Sketch was a British tabloid, known for its sensational news stories and focus on entertainment and sports. It was established in Manchester, England, by Sir Edward Hulton, a prominent newspaper publisher, and quickly gained a reputation for its news coverage and unique giveaways. In its early days, the newspaper favored the working class and provided a refreshing alternative against the more conservative mainstream newspapers. The Daily Sketch gained popularity thanks to its innovative approach, including the use of photographs, and covering a wide range of news topics, human interest stories, and sports. Over the years, the newspaper went through several changes in ownership and editorial direction. As the British newspaper industry evolved, the competition increased, and the Daily Sketch faced sales declines. In 1971, the newspaper was acquired by the Associated Newspapers, the publishers of the Daily Mail. The decision was made to merge the struggling Daily Sketch with the more successful and popular Daily Mail. Consequently, the Daily Sketch ceased publication, and many of its editorial staff and features were absorbed into the Daily Mail. The closure of the Daily Sketch marked the end of an era for a newspaper that made pioneering strides in the early and mid-20th century British media landscape. Apart from the intriguing stories it covered, the Daily Sketch also launched the careers of several notable journalists and cartoonists and was an important force in shaping public opinion during its 62-year run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Tommy stared hard at the dusty windows of the motel office. \\"This is a trick, right? There's a TV camera back there and you want to make me look stupid.\\" \\"No tricks, Tommy.

Question: Why didn't Tommy like the shoes Options: - they're red converse All-Stars - they're battered - not enough information - they're gross A:","completion":"Based on the information given in the provided context, the correct answer to the question \\"Why didn't Tommy like the shoes?\\" is \\"they're gross\\". In the text Tommy directly refers to the shoes as \\"gross\\" after first seeing them. He does recognize them as red Converse All-Stars and notes that they're battered, but his immediate negative reaction is primarily connected to his opinion that they are unappealing or disgusting--in his words, \\"gross\\". Note that while the shoes are in a battered condition, and they are indeed red Converse All-Stars, the text does not specifically attribute Tommy's dislike to these factors. There's an implication that Tommy is not fond of their overall appearance, including their worn out, battered condition, which could be part of what he finds \\"gross\\" about them. But, foremost, the immediate emotion is one of distaste and revulsion that is best encapsulated by the term \\"gross\\". Moreover, while he does initially express disgust, it's worth noting that Tommy does ultimately try the shoes on, indicating his rejection was initially based on superficial visuals rather than other factors such as comfort or fit. His change of mind could also be attributed to the dog's subsequent revelation that the shoes are magic with special abilities, piquing Tommy's curiosity and motivating him to overlook their outer appearance. Tommy's priority shifts from aesthetics to the potential value these shoes could have thanks to their alleged magic properties.

(2) \`\` It had to be sexy and provocative , but in a long , sexy , sleek way . '' Do these two sentences mean the same thing? Options are: + no + yes","completion":"After careful consideration, it can be fair to say that, fundamentally, yes, these two sentences do carry the same meaning. Both are describing something that is intended to be sexy and provocative, with emphasis on the words 'long' and 'sexy'. The differentiation between the words 'sleek' and 'slender' may slightly alter the nuances or connotations of the descriptions, but they generally add to a similar overall image. In terms of the context in which 'slender' and 'sleek' are used, it appears clear that they're meant to embellish the description of 'long' and 'sexy'. 'Slender' and 'sleek' are synonymous in certain contexts. Both can mean thin in an attractive and elegant way. 'Slender' generally emphasizes thinness, often in a graceful and delicate manner. For example, it could be used to describe someone who has a tall, thin, and potentially flexible frame or a particular object that is long and slim. 'Sleek', on the other hand, often embeds an additional connotation of smoothness or an aspect of polished sophistication. It implies a well-defined, streamlined, or glossy appearance and can also suggest an element of modern and stylish sophistication. For instance, it could be used to describe a highly polished car, or a long, glossy piece of furniture, besides the bodies of certain animals. However, despite the slight intensity in their implications, the overall fundamental message conveyed in both sentences remains generally the same. That is, to underscore something as being sexy and provocative in a long, attractive, and elegant way. Thus, considering the natural flexibility of language and interpretations of adjectives, while 'sleek' and 'slender' may have slight variations in meaning depending on context, in this instance, they can be seen as indeed approximating the same overall meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Royal Mail were blasted today after they banned deliveries to more than 100 residents on a street following health and safety fears - over wonky paving slabs. Residents on the Victorian estate in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, are now forced to make a four-mile round trip collect their letters and parcels from a central depot. Royal Mail postmen are refusing to deliver to The Villas after it became a no-go zone due to 'a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping'. Resident Catherine Burgass said the move by Royal Mail has 'annoyed' all of the residents at The Villas. Yesterday home-owners on the road, which is not council-maintained as it is privately run by the residents' association, said their mail had been delivered without a problem for 150 years and slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning. The estate's residents' association has asked Royal Mail to identify which areas need repairing but say it would cost tens of thousands of pounds to tarmac the entire stretch. Elderly resident Alfred Poole, 79, branded the move 'barmy'. He said: 'Its health and safety gone mad. I'm an old man and if I can manage the paving slabs, I'm sure the postman can. 'I haven't got a car and I can't walk four miles to fetch my post. It's just ridiculous.' Royal Mail say they suspended deliveries to the street for health and safety reasons following 'incidents' Julian Wilshaw, 38, who lives with his partner Sarah and daughter Jessica, added: 'It came out of the blue. 'We had heard nothing at all about it and then the letter came through. 'We weren't even warned or informed there was an issue, so we could maybe try to help put any issues right. 'Royal Mail deliver to the likes of the Isle of Skye and the Hebrides - we're just The Villas, in Stoke. 'My daughter has hip problems and we're waiting on a letter from the hospital. 'I have sympathy for the postmen if they've hurt themselves, but we don't know what the problem is, and Royal Mail have been delivering to us for years. 'It's a massive inconvenience for all the residents, especially the more elderly people living here.' A total of 40 households and over 100 residents have been affected by the ban. Ms Burgass said the pavement has been in the same condition since she moved in 15 years ago. Martin Parker, 52, secretary of The Villas Residents' Association, said: 'The letter said one postman had injured themselves a month ago, and we were told it happened again a couple of days before the letter was sent. 'No-one had been consulted about any problems with the state of the pavements and I'm surprised they hadn't bothered to consult with us. 'It would have been sensible for them to speak to us, and it's bizarre Royal Mail has taken this rather extreme stance. 'The road is not slippery, our bins are emptied and post had been delivered here for a very long time. 'Luckily, I have a car and I'm physically fit, but there are quite a few elderly residents and there's the care home here too. 'Also, no-one seems to be able to contact the phone number attached with the letter.' Doug Burnham, 49, who has lived on The Villas for 15 years, added: 'It's a very difficult situation. I can't see how our neighbourhood differs from any other neighbourhood. Residents have slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning about the cancellation of the service. 'Sweeping and cleaning is something we do as often as possible. We also tackle things like potholes, drainage issues and fly-tipping. 'We are open to discussions. 'We would be willing to pay if there were particularly problematic areas and we do that anyway, but obviously we couldn't do the entirety of the paving.' Resident Catherine Burgass, 47, added: 'I was extremely surprised we had not had any prior warning. 'The pavement has been in the same condition since I moved in 15 years ago.

Relationships sometimes experience moments of doubt where one or both partners simply don't know what to do. They may feel that' things will get better' or that they should give their partner another chance, but those second chances don't always work out. Pick your answer from: A. This is bad advice for both of you. Don't reject the possibility of romance. B. If this is the case with you, you need to take the opportunity to confront the inner box you may have buried your head in. This can make matters worse in the long run. C.

This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment. Paragraph: A scientist studied the effects of alcoholic beverages on the human body during severe weather exposure. He decided to experiment on himself. He stood in -30 degrees weather for 2 hours and called it experiment A. He then repeated the experiment, the only difference being that he consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during those two hours, and that was called experiment B.

If you ever crave P.F. Chang's, but would prefer to avoid the pretentiousness and cut the cost, Pei Wei is a great alternative. They serve a similar menu, many of the dishes are the exact same, but at a slight to drastic price difference. The atmosphere is not inferior by any means. Instead of the dark, rich colors that signifies fine dining, Pei Wei goes for a more simplistic motif. The open windows creates lighting that give this place a comfortable feel, and the plush booths add to this sentiment. The large menu board up front, leading towards the cashier, is easy to read and directs the flow of guest. Once you order, you sit down, they bring your food, and the rest is self serve. It is a more upscale version of fast food. My friends and I enjoy the chicken lettuce wraps. The portion is large enough to share between three. PFC- 7.95 PW-6.95 I am not one to over stuff my lettuce, so we usually run out before the filling is gone. I have asked for extra wrappers and they have complied without making a fuss. Bonus points for a better tip. Another popular starter are their crab wontons. They are filled with bits of crab, scallions, red peppers, and cream cheese. Usually I avoid cream cheese, but am a sucker for rangoons. For an order of six you pay 4.95 compared to the 6.95. Now for the main course. You get to choose from a variety of different styles, and the cost varies depending on your protein. Tofu and veggies run the cheapest at 7.50 and shrimp cost the most at 9.25. Orange Peel is similar to orange chicken and works well with all, but I prefer the tofu and veggies in this sauce. The Thai Coconut Curry is just as great with no meat. The green beans are the best in this ensemble. Now here is where you will see the big difference in your receipt. If you order the Orange Peel Chicken at Pei Wei, it will cost you 8.25. At P.F. Chang's, it is 13.75. With the savings from that alone you can go down the street and get a crepe from The Crepe Shack for dessert. The best part is that you get a choice between brown or white rice. You technically get a third option of fried rice, but that comes at an up-charge. This place is great for those who want their favorite dishes, but do not have the time or money. You will also save more because you leave a tip for the busser. Cashier, as well, if they are extra helpful. Although it is not authentic Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese food. All my favorite cuisines, by the way. Sometimes you can learn to appreciate the Americanize spin on classics.","completion":"The sentiment expressed in this review is primarily positive. The justification for this analysis is found in various parts of the review text. The reviewer compares the subject of the review, Pei Wei, favorably to another Asian restaurant, P.F. Chang's. They appreciate that Pei Wei offers a similar menu at a lower price, and they praise the relaxed and comfortable ambiance of the restaurant (\\"the atmosphere is not inferior by any means\\"). They specifically mention the restaurant's brightness, comfortable seating arrangements, and clear signage, all of which contribute to a positive dining experience. Additionally, they speak highly of the food at Pei Wei. They appreciate the portion sizes (\\"The portion is large enough to share between three\\") and the accommodating service for special requests (\\"I have asked for extra wrappers and they have complied without making a fuss\\"). They also comment positively on the taste and quality of various dishes from starters (\\"chicken lettuce wraps,\\" \\"crab wontons\\") to main courses (\\"Orange Peel,\\" \\"Thai Coconut Curry\\"). The review also sees value for money as a notable positive aspect. They repeatedly compare Pei Wei's more affordable prices to those of P.F. Chang’s, highlighting that cost savings become evident when ordering the same dishes. They also speak positively about the 'fast-food' serving system and the possibility to leave tips for helpful staff. Even though they admittedly say it's not authentic Asian food, they still show an appreciation for the American twist on it. In conclusion, while the review does point out a few areas of improvement (such as up-charges for fried rice and slight inauthenticity), the overall sentiment comes across as mostly positive owing to the satisfaction with the food, ambiance, price, and service of the restaurant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This film was so disappointing. From the blurb that made me decide to see Phantom Love (why is it called this?)I had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery.

It seemed like any other work stopover along Alaska Airlines’ service route: After arriving in Minneapolis, the captain and his co-pilot, Betty Pina, vanpooled to the flight crew’s designated hotel and met up later in the concierge room set up with snacks and drinks for airline employees. Afterward, there was supposed to be a short overnight stay, before the two piloted a return flight to Seattle the next morning. But things turned fuzzy for Pina before she made it back to her hotel room that evening, she said. It started with a glass of wine, Pina said, delivered to her by the captain — a veteran Alaska pilot she’d never met before they were teamed for the three-day assignment last June. Pina commented that her drink tasted funny, then after only a few sips, she couldn’t keep her head up and felt the walls closing in. “From there, I don’t remember leaving the concierge room, the elevator ride or walking down the hallway to my room, ” Pina recalled during a recent interview. “When I woke up, everything was hazy. I remember seeing a figure, somebody pulling at my right ankle, and rolling over and trying to say �?No.’ And then, I was out again.” The next time she came to, Pina said, she found herself naked from the waist down in a bed wet with vomit. She said she also heard the captain, who was in the same room, on the phone saying to an airline official that he’d been drinking. Now, Pina, 39, a Seattle-area resident and decorated Army chopper pilot who has been flying commercial flights for Alaska since 2016, is suing the airline. Her suit claims Alaska Airlines is liable for its captain’s alleged drugging and raping of her that night, and for its subsequent failure to hold him accountable after she reported what happened to airline officials. “I’m infuriated that he’s still working there,” Pina said of the accused captain, who she said remains on Alaska’s active seniority list for pilots. In a statement early Wednesday, Alaska Airlines’ chief spokeswoman Bobbie Egan declined to comment about Pina’s allegations, citing the matter as “an open and active investigation.” “What we can say is that we are taking this matter seriously,” Egan said. “The safety and well-being of our employees and guests is a top priority.” Paul Engelien, the accused captain — a 50-year-old veteran pilot and married Nevada resident — did not respond to phone messages left for him Wednesday. He is named in Pina’s lawsuit, although not as a defendant. As is the airline’s policy, Engelien immediately was removed from flying in June, when an investigation was opened, Egan said. He remains employed and on paid-leave, she said. The Seattle Times generally does not name victims of alleged sexual assault, but Pina agreed to be identified. After word of Pina’s lawsuit emerged early Wednesday, an airline official contacted her and requested that she voluntarily withdraw from a scheduled work flight, according to her attorneys, Eric Makus and Lincoln Beauregard. Egan said the airline contacted Pina intending only to check on her well-being. “Betty will fly as scheduled,” said Makus, adding the official expressed a change in tone to Pina on Wednesday, offering “complete support” for her. That’s not quite how the airline previously handled the matter, Pina and her lawyers said during an interview Tuesday. After recounting how she found her underwear inside her zipped-up purse in Engelien’s room that night, Pina said she regretted not immediately calling 911. “That’s when I knew I’d been assaulted,” she said. Instead, in the first foggy hours after the incident, Pina said she felt sick and confused — and wracked by the fear of losing a 17-year career in aviation that she’d dreamed about while growing up in Kansas. “I’m worried about everything I’ve ever worked for,” she said. “I’m not married, I don’t have kids. My career has been my number one.” Pina said she’s since learned that on the night of the incident, a flight attendant reported to the first officer on duty that he had observed Engelien walking in a hotel hallway with two glasses of wine and a woman who appeared in danger. “The crew member didn’t feel comfortable flying with (Engelien) the next day, so called the (first officer on duty),” Pina said. That report triggered the duty officer’s subsequent calls to Engelien’s room, asking about his fitness for duty, her lawsuit contends. After Engelien acknowledged drinking, the duty officer scratched the captain and Pina from piloting the return flight to Seattle, she said. The two instead were put in coach seating on a later flight bound for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Pina said. Before and during the flight, Pina said Engelien told her “that I’d been really drunk and had come on to him” the previous evening. She said he also tried to persuade her to “get our stories straight” to avoid putting their jobs at risk. Back in Seattle, representatives for the pilots’ union and airline officials questioned both pilots, taking statements over the next two days, Pina said. Pina said she initially didn’t feel comfortable reporting the rape but changed her mind after returning home after the airline’s interviews and finding “a handprint bruise” on her left thigh and other bruising. Pina first reported the allegations to her union representative the night of June 7, two days after the alleged assault, and a day later to an Alaska human-resources official. In early July, Pina said she detailed her allegations again to a lawyer, Marcella Reed, hired by the airline to investigate. The probe focused on whether Engelien and Pina potentially violated the company’s policy barring pilots from consuming alcohol within 10 hours before a scheduled flight, she said. The airline had placed Pina on paid leave beginning in June, telling her not to talk about its investigation, she said. Meantime, Reed took various statements and purportedly informed Pina in August that a review of the hotel’s security video showed Engelien tried to forcibly kiss Pina in an elevator. “She said I was incapacitated, that it took 18 to 20 minutes to get from the elevator to the room, and this whole time he’s trying to get me into the room, and I’m trying to put up whatever fight I can,” Pina said. Finally in December, Pina said, Alaska’s Seattle base chief informed her that she’d soon be allowed to return to the cockpit. He also asked her: “Betty, let me ask you this, why didn’t you press charges?” Pina recalled. “And until that moment, I thought telling my company and my supervisor is all I needed to do,” Pina said. “I was shocked when he said that.” Pina was returned to active duty in January. She fears she may be forced to fly with Engelien again — despite the base chief’s promises that she won’t. She and her attorneys served the airlines with a legal complaint detailing her allegations in mid-February, largely relying on official summaries of Pina’s formal statements to investigators. The airlines didn’t take any corrective action, the lawyers said, so they formally filed suit on Wednesday in King County Superior Court. She is seeking unspecified damages. “My hope is that by me doing this, it may protect other women,” Pina said. “How many other victims are out there? I may not be the first case, but I hope to be the last. It’s time to take responsibility. The culture needs to change. We can’t sweep this under the rug any longer.” Pina said she’s open to pursuing a criminal case against Engelien. “I wanted to get back in the cockpit flying before moving forward with anything,” she said. “Now that I have, I am.” |||||","completion":"Alaska Airlines faces legal action over an incident in June 2017 in which a captain allegedly drugged and raped his co-pilot during a layover in Minneapolis.

WASHINGTON — Saudi Arabia was preparing an alternative explanation of the fate of a dissident journalist on Monday, saying he died at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago in an interrogation gone wrong, according to a person familiar with the kingdom’s plans. In Washington, President Trump echoed the possibility that Jamal Khashoggi was the victim of “rogue killers.” The shifting story line defied earlier details that have emerged in the case, including signs that he was murdered and dismembered. Among other things, Turkish officials have said, an autopsy specialist carrying a bone saw was among 15 Saudi operatives who flew in and out of Istanbul the day Mr. Khashoggi disappeared. The new explanation, whatever its truth, seemed intended to ease the political crisis that Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance has created for Saudi Arabia. The new story could also defuse some criticism of the Trump administration, which has refused to back down from billions of dollars in weapons sales to the kingdom and as of Monday was still planning to attend a glittering Saudi investment forum next week. [UPDATE: Jamal Khashoggi is dead. Here is everything we know so far.] And it could help Turkey, where a shaky economy would benefit from a financial infusion that low-interest loans from Riyadh could provide. ||||| Ankara, Turkey (CNN) Saudi Arabia is preparing a report that will acknowledge that Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's death was the result of an interrogation that went wrong, one that was intended to lead to his abduction from Turkey, according to two sources. One source says the report will likely conclude that the operation was carried out without clearance and transparency and that those involved will be held responsible. One of the sources acknowledged that the report is still being prepared and cautioned that things could change. The Washington Post columnist was last seen in public when he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in Turkey on October 2. Previously, Saudi authorities had maintained Khashoggi left the consulate the same afternoon of his visit, but provided no evidence to support the claim. CCTV footage shows Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate on October 2. Khashoggi's fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, who was waiting outside the consulate, says she did not see him re-emerge. Read More ||||| Saudi Arabia is preparing an official account that will admit journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, according to multiple reports on Monday. It is not clear how much responsibility Saudi Arabia will take for the journalist's death, as reports indicate that while an official narrative is being prepared it is not complete. ADVERTISEMENT The kingdom will reportedly deflect responsibility for the death away from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman by saying Khashoggi's death was \\"unintentional\\" and the result of a \\"botched operation\\" by Saudi agents who were not authorized by the government's top authorities, two sources told CNN. \\"We are hearing from the sources at this stage that [the operation] was not carried out with the proper clearance,\\" CNN's Clarissa Ward said on air. \\"There will be plenty of people who will have difficulty swallowing that narrative, [saying] it's hard to believe anything of this nature, of this sensitivity, could possibly take place without those in power in Saudi Arabia … being privy to it on some level,\\" Ward noted. A source familiar with Saudi plans told The New York Times earlier Monday that Saudi Arabia was planning to indicate the killing was done by an incompetent intelligence official. The Wall Street Journal also reported Saudis are weighing admitting one of their intelligence officials killed Khashoggi by mistake. A joint team of Saudi and Turkish investigators on Monday began their search of the Saudi consulate in Turkey, where Khashoggi went missing on Oct. 2. Turkish reports have indicated Saudi agents were likely working on orders from Riyadh when they allegedly dismembered and killed Khashoggi. Turkey said they have unreleased video and audio evidence of the incident. Saudi Arabia has so far denied a role in Khashoggi's disappearance. President Trump Donald John TrumpAvenatti ‘still considering’ presidential run despite domestic violence arrest Mulvaney positioning himself to be Commerce Secretary: report Kasich: Wouldn’t want presidential run to ‘diminish my voice’ MORE on Monday morning suggested that \\"rogue killers\\" could have been behind Khashoggi's disappearance. According to the Times, this language is similar to the narrative Saudi Arabia will soon release. Khashoggi was a Virginia-based contributor to The Washington Post. He often criticized the Saudi government. U.S. intelligence previously indicated Saudi officials were plotting to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia in order to detain him. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Saudi Arabia is working on a different explanation for what happened to Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who went missing after going to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.

Question: when amina faints, what appears on her wrist? Movie title: The Mummy's Ghost Movie plot: In Egypt, Yousef Bey (John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham (George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

If you see something that repeats a point you've already made, or wastes the reader's time, delete it. Anything that isn't working to prove the main idea is ineffective wasted space. It's sometimes necessary to eliminate unnecessary sentences, ideas, points, sections, or even paragraphs to make a piece more effective. Make sure your subjects and verbs agree, and replace weak verbs to avoid passive voice. Weak verbs include \\"is\\" \\"was\\" \\"be\\" and \\"have.\\" Learn to replace weak verbs with more active verbs to make your writing more vigorous. Instead of writing \\"A big crowd has been lured downtown,\\" use a stronger verb than \\"has been.\\" Try, \\"The festival lured a big crowd downtown,\\" replacing the verb with the stronger \\"lured.\\" Look for sentences that start with the word \\"there\\" for a quick tip to weak verbs. Bad writing is wordy and wastes the reader's time. Good writing is concise, cutting straight to the point. Don't use two words when a single more accurate word is sufficient. Instead of writing \\"The party was super fun and exciting,\\" write, \\"The party was thrilling.\\" Any sentence that involves multiple \\"ands\\" or semi-colons needs to be cut into more than one sentence. In general, avoid semi-colons and sentences with more than one clause. Does your writing accomplish what you wanted it to accomplish? Does it explain the main idea fully and clearly? If so, you're ready to move on to late concerns. Read over the improved draft and look for misspellings, typos, and punctuation errors. This should be one of the last things you do with a draft before it is finished. Ask a friend or family member to read your writing and ask them for specific feedback by having them tell you what they thought the main idea was, or having them write it at the end of the piece.

If not, keep working to make it more effective.","completion":"When you finish writing something, read it again and look for parts that are not needed or repeat what you already said. Delete these parts to make your writing better. Make sure your words match and use strong action words.

Check if your writing does what you wanted it to do and if it's easy to understand. Then, fix any small mistakes like spelling or missing commas.

What position at the paper would Henry be leaving if he went to work at the New York Sentinel? Answer the above question based on the context below: The film takes place during a 24-hour period. Henry Hackett is the metro editor of the New York Sun, a fictional New York City tabloid. He is a workaholic who loves his job, but the long hours and low pay are leading to discontent. He is at risk of experiencing the same fate as his editor-in-chief, Bernie White, who put his work first at the expense of his family. The paper's owner, Graham Keighley, faces dire financial straits, so he has Alicia Clark, the managing editor and Henry's nemesis, impose unpopular cutbacks. Henry's wife Martha, a fellow Sun reporter on leave and about to give birth, is fed up because Henry seems to have less and less time for her, and she really dislikes Alicia Clark. She urges him to seriously consider an offer to leave the Sun and become an assistant managing editor at the New York Sentinel, another fictional newspaper (based on The New York Times), which would mean more money, shorter hours, and more respectability, but might also be a bit boring for his tastes. Minor subplots involve Alicia, Bernie, and Sun columnist Michael McDougal. McDougal is threatened by an angry city official named Sandusky whom McDougal's column had been tormenting for the past several weeks. Their drunken confrontation in a bar (later in the film) leads to gunfire, which gets Alicia shot in the leg through the wall. Alicia, who is having an affair with Sun reporter Carl and has expensive tastes, schemes to get a raise in her salary. Bernie reveals to Henry that he has recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer, which causes him to spend time tracking down his estranged daughter Deanne White, in an attempt to reconcile before his time is up.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, and the company said, Monday, it will discuss with federal regulators the possibility of prescribing the drug for more breast cancer patients. Sentence: There is a possibility that the drug will be available for more patients.","completion":"Yes, the sentence is true. According to the given text, Herceptin has already been approved for use in treating the sickest breast cancer patients. The company has announced that they will engage in discussions with federal regulators to explore the possibility of expanding the indications for the drug, which would allow it to be prescribed for a broader range of breast cancer patients. This statement suggests that the drug has shown potential benefits for patients beyond the original group for whom it was initially approved. The company's decision to discuss the matter with federal regulators signifies their intent to receive authorization for its expanded use. This authorization would facilitate access to the drug for additional patients who could benefit from the treatment. However, it is essential to bear in mind that this is only a possibility at this stage. The discussion with federal regulators will involve the presentation and evaluation of relevant evidence, including the safety and efficacy of the drug in the intended patient population. The regulators will thoroughly review the data to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks before granting the approval. In summary, the sentence is true as there is a possibility that Herceptin will be available to more breast cancer patients if the discussions with federal regulators prove fruitful and lead to the approval of the drug for expanded use. This would bring potential benefits to additional patients in need of effective treatment options for breast cancer. It is also important to note that the process of drug approval and expansion for additional indications is complex and multifaceted, so although there is a possibility, there is no guarantee that the drug will become available to more patients until the process is completed and approved."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here are possible answers to this question: - gas - full stomach - feeling satisfied - have energy - bloated I believe the correct choice is \\"feeling satisfied\\", here's why:","completion":"Feeling satisfied is the correct choice because it is the most logical reason for stopping eating after having just enough at breakfast. When you eat breakfast, your goal is to consume enough nutrients and energy to start your day. As you eat, your body receives signals from your brain that you have consumed enough food to meet your energy and nutritional needs. This feeling of satisfaction is what tells you that you have eaten enough and prevents you from overeating. Gas and bloated are not relevant answers, as they are side effects of consuming certain types of food or overeating, rather than reasons for stopping after eating just enough.

The same thing happens in our rooms. For that, we need to make some little doors for the air to pass through. 1. Make a Small Door for Air: To help the air leave and enter our rooms, we need to make a small door in the big door. This small door will be around 1 to 1.5 inches wide. That's about as wide as 2 to 4 fingers held side by side. This little door will help the air in your room play outside and come back in. 2. Install a Return Duct: Now it's time to add a special tunnel, called a \\"return duct.\\" This is like a secret passage for the air to travel through. It takes the air from your room back to the machine (air-conditioner or furnace) that makes the air either warm or cool. This way, the air can get clean and fresh before it comes back into your room. 3. Use Jump Ducts to Help Air Flow: Lastly, we are going to help the air move even more freely in and out of the room with something called \\"jump ducts.\\" Jump ducts are like little trampolines for the air to bounce around between different parts of the room. They help the air twirl and dance between the room and the return duct. And that's it! By making a little door, installing a secret tunnel (return duct), and adding trampolines (jump ducts), we make sure the air in our rooms stays clean, fresh, and easy to breathe. Just like how we love to play outdoors, the air in our rooms loves to move, too! So next time you're in your room, think about the air as it moves around, and remember all the little things that help keep it clean and fresh for you to breathe. Now you're a little air-flow expert! Happy exploring!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What rank was the composer who composed a piece for the Paris Opera in the 1970s promoted to in 1987? , can you please find it? Messiaen's next work was the large-scale La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ. The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial. He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux étoiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York.In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opéra. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-François d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \\"spectacle\\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the Légion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. François, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc of the composer in... The answer is:","completion":"In 1987, the composer who composed a piece for the Paris Opera in the 1970s, Olivier Messiaen, was promoted to the highest rank of the Légion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Research I will perform research to find accurate information on the topic. Step 3: Analyze the information After researching, I discovered that color movies have been around for much longer than most people think. The first color film process was Kinemacolor, introduced in 1908. However, it was not widely adopted due to its limitations and the requirement of a special projector for playback. Technicolor, first introduced in 1916, gained wider acceptance as a color process. However, color movies did not become mainstream until the 1930s. The release of the first Technicolor three-strip film, \\"Becky Sharp,\\" in 1935 marked the beginning of color films as part of mainstream cinema.

Context: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Most adults can remember their first stuffed bear, and over the decades these toys have become nearly a symbol of their childhood. However, children are not the only ones with whom these toys have become popular, as many adults make it a habit to collect these toys as well. The Teddy Bear first became popular during the early 20th century and was associated with then President Theodore Roosevelt. The story can date back to a hunting trip that President Roosevelt had taken where he was invited to be the one to shoot a black bear that had been tied to a tree. Being a crazy outdoors lover and hunter, Roosevelt refused to kill the animal because he believed that shooting the helpless bear was unsportsmanlike and wrong. This story quickly spread through newspapers across the country, and in the end inspired the introduction of a stuffed toy called \\"Teddy's bear\\". These toys became popular soon after first introduced, and within ten years, they were being produced by dozens of companies around the world. Within a generation, these stuffed bears were \\"the\\" toy to have, and have always been within children's toy boxes ever since. They are most often mass-produced in factories in order to keep up with the high demand. However, there are still companies that take great pride in their handmade designs; and while handmade teddy bears are often preferred, they are also generally more expensive than their mass-produced ones. Today, these bears and other similar toys generate well over a billion dollars a year in profits for the companies that make them. Walk through just about any toy store in America and you will find dozens of different teddy bears lining the shelves. Options: A History of the Teddy Bear. B A popular toy -- Teddy Bear.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - An ascus (plural asci; from Greek \\"skós\\" 'skin bag') is the sexual spore-bearing cell produced in ascomycete fungi. Asci usually contain eight ascospores, produced by meiosis followed, in most species, by a mitotic cell division. However, asci in some genera or species can occur in numbers of one (e.g. \\"Monosporascus cannonballus\\"), two, four, or multiples of four. In a few cases, the ascospores can bud off conidia that may fill the asci (e.g. \\"Tympanis\\") with hundreds of conidia, or the ascospores may fragment, e.g. some \\"Cordyceps\\", also filling the asci with smaller cells. Ascospores are nonmotile, usually single celled, but not infrequently may be coenocytic (lacking a septum), and in some cases coenocytic in multiple planes. Mitotic divisions within the developing spores populate each resulting cell in septate ascospores with nuclei. The term ocular chamber, or oculus, refers to the epiplasm (the portion of cytoplasm not used in ascospore formation) that is surrounded by the \\"bourrelet\\" (the thickened tissue near the top of the ascus). - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011. - In formal nomenclature. When formally naming a taxon, uncertainty about its taxonomic classification can be problematic. The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, stipulates that \\"species and subdivisions of genera must be assigned to genera, and infraspecific taxa must be assigned to species, because their names are combinations\\", but ranks higher than the genus may be assigned \\"incertae sedis\\". - Dikarya is a subkingdom of Fungi that includes the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, both of which in general produce dikaryons, may be filamentous or unicellular, but are always without flagella. The Dikarya are most of the so-called \\"higher fungi\\", but also include many anamorphic species that would have been classified as molds in historical literature. Phylogenetically the two phyla regularly group together. In a 1998 publication, Thomas Cavalier-Smith referred to this group as the Neomycota. - Ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \\"ascus\\" (from Greek: (\\"askos\\"), meaning \\"sac\\" or \\"wineskin\\"), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Basidiomycota is one of two large divisions that, together with the Ascomycota, constitute the subkingdom Dikarya (often referred to as the \\"higher fungi\\") within the kingdom Fungi. - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Coryneliella is a genus of fungi in the Ascomycota phylum . The relationship of this taxon to other taxa within the class is unknown ( incertae sedis ) , and it has not yet been placed with certainty into any class , order , or family . This is a monotypic genus , containing the single species Coryneliella consimilis . - An ascospore is a spore contained in an ascus or that was produced inside an ascus. This kind of spore is specific to fungi classified as ascomycetes (Ascomycota). What is the relationship between 'coryneliella' and 'ascomycetes'? A:","completion":"Coryneliella is a genus of fungi within the Ascomycota phylum.

Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue. Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army. In May 1803, the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haïti in 1804. Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts, Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States, instantly doubling the size of the U.S. The selling price in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre, a total of 15 million.

The Kooks have mentioned drawing on a number of varied sources to create their sound, listing the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Chris de Burgh among influences on songwriting style and musical presentation over the course of their four albums. The band's debut album Inside In/Inside Out was touted as a typical Britpop record, and was influenced by the Libertines, Thin Lizzy, the Police and containing elements of the 60s British pop movement. Pritchard's lyrical style was compared to that of a \\"younger, less pathetic version of Pete Doherty's mush-mouth style\\". The band themselves felt the album was not consistent in its direction. \\"The first record was definitely genre-hopping. [...] The first album was finding its feet, it was gadabout\\", said Harris in an interview for The Sunday Business Post. On the follow-up Konk, the band attempted to find a more mature and polished sound. Drawing on a much wider choice of material for the album (about 80 to 90 new songs had been accumulated within the band's repertoire by this stage), the band began to incorporate more a hard-edged rock focus into their music. Critics drew comparisons to the work of The Kinks throughout the album, it being recorded at the studio owned by Ray Davies. Also noted were the band's growing similarities in musical direction to The Fratellis and the Arctic Monkeys. \\"I think we've made a dynamic album\\", Pritchard said. \\"Every song has its own character.

What is the answer for the question: The scythe is a reminder of the agricultural history of what area? from the following article ? Stretford was part of the ancient parish of Manchester, within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, a national scheme for dealing with the relief of the poor, Stretford joined the Chorlton Poor Law Union in 1837, one of three such unions in Manchester, before transferring to the Barton-upon-Irwell Poor Law Union in 1849. In 1867, Stretford Local Board of Health was established, assuming responsibility for the local government of the area in 1868. The board's responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways, and it had the authority to levy rates to pay for those services. The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of Stretford Urban District Council in 1894, as a result of the Local Government Act 1894. Stretford Urban District became the Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933, giving it borough status in the United Kingdom. Stretford Borough Council was granted its arms on 20 February 1933. The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre represents John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster.

You may well get mad quite often, but cutting loose with the curse words and name-calling every time something rankles you dilutes the effect of cussing someone out. It also wears you out pretty quickly.","completion":"So, to truly cuss someone out effectively, reserve your strong language and emotional energy for when it's genuinely warranted, and follow these steps to ensure your expletives are both strategic and impactful. First, take a deep breath and assess the situation; not only will this help you cool down, but it also provides valuable time to mentally prepare and choose your words wisely. Remember, specificity is key – a targeted and well-crafted insult will sting much more than a generic string of profanities. Next, know the person you're cussing out and what makes them tick; this will help you to personalize your choice of words, maximizing the impact of your verbal assault. Play with language and creatively incorporate metaphors, pop-culture references, or even their own words to help in this endeavor. Furthermore, be mindful of your timing and the environment, as this can significantly amplify the effects of your cussing. Find a moment when the person is vulnerable or least expecting, and a place where your words will hold the most weight. This may be among mutual friends or in a setting that inherently heightens the tension, such as during an important meeting or a high-pressure situation. In addition, be mindful of your tone and body language. An exasperated sigh, a dismissive roll of the eyes, or even a sarcastic smirk can speak volumes alongside your carefully chosen words. Ensure your tone is assertive, confident, and commanding without veering into the territory of unhinged or pathetic, as this will just undermine your goal. Following these steps, remember to stay calm and composed. Losing your temper or getting overly emotional will likely result in losing credibility, and the person you're aiming to cuss out will be less likely to take your words to heart. After you've delivered your verbal blow, it's critical to know when to walk away. Lingering or pushing the issue further may only serve to diminish the potency of your cussing, so practice the art of the mic drop and disengage gracefully. Lastly, it's important to reflect on the aftermath of cussing someone out. This can be a powerful means of asserting your boundaries or releasing pent-up frustration, but there's a thin line between an effective cuss-out and an unnecessarily hurtful tirade. Always consider if there's a more constructive way to address the source of your anger, and weigh the long-term consequences of burning bridges through harsh words. For while a well-timed, expertly crafted cuss-out may leave you feeling temporarily victorious, an ill-conceived one may lead to a legacy of regret and a damaged reputation. So, as you traverse the treacherous terrain of cussing someone out, wield your words wisely and with intent, and remember that a sniper's precision will always outshine a mindless spray of ammunition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Montreuil has several noteworthy churches, and Saint-Saulve is indeed an important historical and architectural monument in the town. Dating from the 13th century, this church holds significant historical value and its architecture is representative of that time. Despite Saint-Saulve's importance in Montreuil's cultural landscape, the information provided does not cover enough details about the popularity of this church among tourists. Moreover, visitors to Montreuil are mainly interested in exploring the town's cobbled streets and medieval alleyways, which suggests that the charm and allure of Montreuil lies in the overall atmosphere and features of the town rather than a specific focus on any particular church or site. Considering these factors, it is not possible to tell if Saint-Saulve dates back to the 10th century or if it is vastly popular among tourists.

The relationship that we share with our friends is grounded in mutual care as our friends help us in _ our personalities as well. Even in this age of online social networking and e-cards, the need of keeping the network of friends, whether online or offline remains a primary concern for people. We may not completely understand what makes a friend but we all want to have a good number of friends around us. The first step to make friends with someone is to make them like you. If they don't like you in the first place, it is unlikely that they'll be eager to become your friends. To let someone know that you are specially interested in them, simple gestures like a little smile and calling them by their names can lay the basic foundation. To make the other person feel important to you, you need to be a good listener and encourage the other person to talk. Give your honest and sincere opinion but do not directly criticize or make fun of him or her. The second step of making someone your friend is to develop a mutual understanding. You need to share his or her experiences and it is necessary for you to develop a habit to see things from the other person's point of view. The third or final step towards friendship is to show your unconditional support and encouragement towards your friend. Moreover, you also need to be very clear about your expectations from your friend.

Aaron wanted to watch the television..","completion":"Ian sat outside on the porch longer than Aaron because unlike Aaron, he found a unique tranquility in the great outdoors that was often lacking in their generally chaotic house. Aaron preferred the warmth, comfort and contained amusement that television provided. It was a difference in their personalities that highlighted their contrary preferences. Ian was more introverted, happier with his own thoughts than in the company of others. He was someone who cherished the quiet moments which were easily accessible on the porch where he indulged in his love for nature and kept up with his hobby of bird watching. He noticed the variety of bird species that visited their woods, each species bringing with it a unique color, song or behavior that intrigued him. He could quietly observe the squirrels playing and the deer eating and every so often, if he was lucky, he even saw a splendid fox. The outdoor space offered a feeling of serenity and peace that calmed his mind and soul. Furthermore, the porch was a sanctuary for his reading habits. Ian loved books and the porch gave him the perfect environment to dig into a new adventure, a love story or mystery novel. A cup of coffee or tea by his side, his loyal dog at his feet, the fresh air rustling the pages of his book - everything felt perfect to him. It was his own little paradise away from the loud, electric world indoors. Aaron on the other hand, was the more extroverted one of the two. He was lively, bustling with energy and always seeking people or exciting activities. He had an undying affection for modern technology and the latest gadgets. The television was Aaron's portal to the world beyond their small town. It offered him a mix of everything - news from around the world, reality shows, sports events, movies and educational documentaries. It was his means of connecting with the greater world, expanding his knowledge and quenching his thirst for entertainment. The television gave Aaron a sense of contentment. He loved the way the stories unfolded, the fast-paced sequence of events, the thrilling surprises in every episode or movie he watched. He was also a sports enthusiast. The roar of the crowd, the commentary on live matches, the thrill of watching his favorite teams win - all these brought him immense joy. He would often invite his friends over for a movie night or to watch a soccer match, turning their sitting room into a small cinema or stadium. In a nutshell, both Ian and Aaron found their solace in different corners of their home. While Ian was mesmerized by the natural ballet that unfolded daily on his porch, Aaron was drawn towards the electric magic of the television. Their preferences were a clear reflection of their personalities, and it wasn't surprising to anyone knowing them that Ian would spend longer hours outside on the porch while Aaron would be more inclined to stay inside and watch television. So, they lived comfortably in their chosen territories, content to enjoy their hobbies in their own distinctive ways."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

On 29 May 1842, Victoria was riding in a carriage along The Mall, London, when John Francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire; he escaped. The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plain-clothes policemen, and convicted of high treason. On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life, John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge. Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail. In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill, London. In 1850, the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer, Robert Pate. As Victoria was riding in a carriage, Pate struck her with his cane, crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years' transportation.

Trivia question: What process improvement method, pioneered by Motorola Corp in the 1980s, is named after a number and the Greek letter 's'? And the answer is?","completion":"The process improvement method you are referring to is Six Sigma, a data-driven and structured improvement methodology pioneered by Motorola Corporation in the 1980s. The name \\"Six Sigma\\" comes from the combination of the number six and the Greek letter 's' (which is σ in lowercase and Σ in uppercase), symbolizing the central concept of this method. Six Sigma is a set of techniques and tools that aim to improve the quality of manufacturing and business processes by identifying and eliminating defects or errors. The main goal of Six Sigma is to reduce the number of defects to a level of 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO), hence the number six. Six Sigma relies heavily on statistical methods to find the root cause of problems and quantitatively measure the performance of a process. The methodology is based on the DMAIC framework, which stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. Each phase is briefly described below: 1. Define: Identify the problem, set goals, and establish the project scope. 2. Measure: Collect data about the current process and establish key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure improvements. 3. Analyze: Analyze the data to identify root causes of the problem and determine areas where improvements can be made. 4. Improve: Develop, test, and implement solutions that address the root causes and lead to process improvements. 5. Control: Monitor the improved process to ensure that it maintains its level of quality and to prevent any regression to the previous state. Six Sigma is widely adopted due to its focus on delivering consistent and high-quality results, which can lead to significant cost savings and customer satisfaction. Companies such as General Electric, Honeywell, and many others have reported significant success in applying the Six Sigma methodology to improve their operations. In addition, Six Sigma has evolved over the years to incorporate other process improvement methodologies, such as Lean Management, creating a more comprehensive approach known as Lean Six Sigma."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Knowing the importance of daily matters is the first step towards good time management. Write down the things that you want to do and organize them according to their level of importance. The important thing should be done first. If there are too many things that have to be done in one day, then you have to give up doing something that is less important on your list. Besides this,you need to spend a specific amount of time doing all the activities you have written down and make sure you finish them on time. People often slow down in their work even though they know that time will never wait for them. Make sure you keep to your plan and finish the tasks one by one.

With modern technology, there are many jobs can you can easily do from home if you have a laptop and an internet connection. Freelance writing jobs are often done at home. There are also many jobs, like transcription work, that can be done from home. Many companies hire web designers to work from their own house. Also, a lot of call center type jobs are handled at home. You can be a customer service representative at your own house, taking calls on behalf of a business as they come in. If you have a specialized skill set, consider working for yourself. This does not necessarily mean starting your own business. You could do freelance work from home for clients. If you have a writing degree, for example, you could look into freelance editing. If you want to become particularly reclusive, you may be hesitant to leave your home even for things like grocery and clothes shopping. If this is the case, find creative ways to stay at home. In the modern world, almost everything you need can be ordered online. Clothing, books, food, and other items can be ordered from websites like Amazon. You may cringe at the delivery fees, but remember you're staying home most of the time. While you may spend 10 for shipping and handling, you're not spending money on gas or public transportation. If you don't want to order everything online, consider avoiding people in other ways. You could shop during hours of the day where stores are unlikely to be crowded. For example, try going clothes shopping at 1 o'clock in the afternoon on a weekday. As most people are working, you may be less likely to run into other people. If you want to be a recluse, you may feel you have to cut people out of your life entirely. However, this is not the case. In fact, a reclusive lifestyle may not be sustainable if you cut out all your friends and social contacts. Strong relationships can help you feel more secure about spending time alone. Even if you enjoy spending time alone, it's important to be able to have someone to call if you need it. Everyone needs support on occasion. In the event of a major emergency or setback, you should be able to have at least one person to rely on for support. Try to deepen existing relationships before committing to a reclusive life. Spend more time talking to friends and family members. Be willing to share intimate secrets to your social contacts. If you have a few very close friends, you'll feel more secure in the fact your solitude is a choice rather than a necessity. If you're going to be spending a lot of time alone, stress management is important. Troubling thoughts may be harder to avoid if you have a lot of time to yourself.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop. Would crop A have lower or higher yields than crop B? Hint: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that crop A, which is herbicide tolerant, would have higher yields than crop B. This is because the use of herbicide-tolerant crops can lead to improved weed management, allowing the crops to grow more efficiently without being harmed by the chemicals.

Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - The Wurlitzer electric piano, trademarked the \\"Electronic Piano\\" and referred to by musicians as the \\"Wurly\\", was one of a series of electromechanical stringless pianos manufactured and marketed by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of Corinth, Mississippi, U.S. and North Tonawanda, New York.

The development, unveiled by billionaire Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, is part of a £13billion redevelopment of the Kingdom City, north of Jeddah.

The sprawling mega project, first. announced in 2008, will cover two square miles at its base, and will. also include serviced apartments, luxury flats and offices. The Jeddah Economic Company (JEC), which. appointed EC Harris and Mace to provide project, commercial and design. management, said the vision for the building belonged to bin Talal. In 2011, it was said that construction. firm Saudi Binladen Group had been given the contract to build the. structure, one of seven ambitious projects in the kingdom which is. OPEC's top exporter of oil. The Prince had initially wanted to. build the tower a mile high, but abandoned the proposals because he was. worried the soil would not support its foundations. But it will still shatter the record for Burj Khalifa, which opened in January 2010. Soon to be overshadowed: At 1,016 ft high, the Shard is currently western Europe's tallest building. Heading for record: A graphic showing how the Kingdom Tower will become the world's tallest building. That tower has 160 liveable floors and rises 2,717 feet, making it not only the tallest building but also the tallest free-standing structure in the world. Prince Alwaleed wants the tower to 'send a message of strength' in tough economic times. The work is intended to diversify the economy from the crude oil that has fuelled the kingdom's growth for years. It also reflects a continuation of the. unstated race between the oil rich Gulf nations that are also pumping. tens of billions of dollars into job creation and housing for their. lower income residents.

A: tired B: worried C: happy Answer:","completion":"After taking a cross country road trip with their close friends, Aubrey would most likely feel a combination of emotions. However, we will analyze each of the possible answers and determine which one best answers the question according to the context. A: Tired. It is natural for Aubrey to feel tired after taking a cross-country road trip, as driving long distances can be both physically and mentally exhausting. Traveling for an extended period can also lead to fatigue, especially when dealing with various time zones, unfamiliarity with new places, and changing sleep patterns. Spending time in a confined space and coordinating activities and stops with friends could also contribute to the feeling of tiredness. B: Worried. Although it is possible that Aubrey might have some worries during or after the trip, there is no specific reason mentioned in the given context for Aubrey to feel more worried than any other emotions. Worries could arise from budget management, vehicle issues, or other unexpected challenges along the way; however, without specific mention of these factors, it is not the best answer. C: Happy. Taking a cross country road trip with close friends would generally lead to feelings of happiness and excitement. Creating lifelong memories, sharing unique experiences, and deepening friendships would all contribute to overall happiness. Additionally, vacations often provide a break from daily routines and work, giving Aubrey a chance to relax and enjoy their surroundings. Considering the provided context, answer C: Happy, would best reflect Aubrey's emotions after completing the cross country road trip. The opportunity to bond with friends, explore new places, and enjoy time away from regular responsibilities would all contribute to creating happiness over the other possible emotions presented."},{"prompt":"Title: Deadly Dull Review: This was my first Bill Bryson book.

Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children. According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\". Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter. Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.

He denies all charges. Dubbed \\"The Nose\\", 55-year-old Holleeder was already in custody facing murder and attempted murder charges, as well as belonging to a criminal organisation. He was arrested in his cell in April over the alleged plot to kill his sisters after a tip-off from a fellow prisoner, prosecutors said. \\"Holleeder allegedly already paid money and promised more, should his plans indeed be carried out,\\" they added. Appearing in court on Tuesday, Holleeder denied he had plans to kill his sisters and Mr de Vries. \\"It's absolutely not in my interest that anything happens to them,\\" he said. When his sisters testified against him in a murder case last year, one of them said she was signing her death warrant.

Presidentinvaalien aikana on tapahtunut useita asioita, jotka ovat saaneet ihmiset pelkäämään demokraattisen kehityksen hidastumista ja jopa taantumista. Tämä huoli herää erityisesti silloin, kun kyseessä on maa, joka sanoo toimivansa demokraattisen lain alaisuudessa ja tavoittelevansa poliittista ja taloudellista vakautta. On ollut monia tapahtumia, jotka ovat antaneet aihetta epäillä demokratian toimivuutta ja oikeusvaltion periaatteiden kunnioittamista. Esimerkiksi äänestysprosessin läpinäkyvyyttä ja oikeudenmukaisuutta on kyseenalaistettu useissa tilanteissa, mikä on lisännyt epäluottamusta poliittista järjestelmää kohtaan. Lisäksi on ollut tilanteita, joissa on ollut väärinkäytöksiä tai epärehellisiä toimia, jotka ovat vaikuttaneet vaalituloksiin. Myös vallan käyttö ja sen jakautuminen ovat herättäneet huolta. Esimerkiksi, jos yksi poliittinen ryhmittymä onnistuu saamaan liikaa valtaa tai jos demokraattisen prosessin kautta valituilla johtajilla on taipumus keskittää valtaa omiin käsiinsä, tämä voi johtaa demokraattisen kehityksen pysähtymiseen ja mahdollisesti jopa autoritaaristen hallintomuotojen vahvistumiseen. Monet ihmiset ovat huolissaan siitä, että tämäntyyppiset kehityskulut heikentävät demokraattista järjestelmää ja mahdollistavat vallan väärinkäytökset sekä ihmisoikeusloukkaukset. Yhteiskunnalliset jännitteet ja polarisoituminen voivat myös vaikuttaa demokratian toimivuuteen ja vakautta tavoittelevan maan kehitykseen. Erityisesti silloin, kun yhteiskunta on jakautunut voimakkaasti erilaisten poliittisten, taloudellisten, uskonnollisten tai etnisten ryhmien välillä, voi olla vaikeaa saavuttaa poliittista yksimielisyyttä ja luoda yhteistyöhön perustuvia ratkaisuja maan ongelmiin. Näiden kysymysten ratkaisemiseksi on tarpeen edistää avoimuutta, läpinäkyvyyttä ja vastuullisuutta poliittisessa järjestelmässä sekä rakentaa vankka ja toimiva oikeusvaltio. Näin voidaan taata kansalaisten luottamus demokratiaan, vahvistaa yhteiskunnallista eheyttä ja edistää kestävää kehitystä. Samalla on tärkeää, että kaikki poliittiset toimijat sitoutuvat kunnioittamaan demokraattisia periaatteita ja ihmisoikeuksia sekä pyrkivät vahvistamaan yhteistyötä ja vuoropuhelua yhteiskunnan eri osapuolten välillä. Vain tällä tavoin voidaan torjua pelot demokraattisen kehityksen taantumisesta ja edistää vakautta tavoittelevan maan menestyksekästä etenemistä kohti todellista demokraattista oikeusvaltiota."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

UPDATED:. 05:57 EST, 30 October 2013. A second mystery barge has been discovered - this one docked in Maine, thousands of miles away from the ship spotted in San Fransisco Bay that has set the tech world abuzz. The vessel in Portland Harbor looks nearly identical to its cousin 2,700 miles away in California - four stories of shipping containers welded together atop a large flat barge. They are also both registered to the same mysterious Delaware-based corporation. The ships are widely believed to be owned by Google - built as prototype floating data centers that use ocean water to regulate the intense heat put out by the mass of servers. Mystery: This is the Maine barge that is thought to be part of a floating data center project by Google. This is the San Fransisco barge - which looks strikingly similar to the mysterious ship docked in Portland Harbor. Google has refused to comment on the vessels, though a 2009 patent filed by the company describes an environmentally-friendly sea-powered telecommunications and storage system that looks much like the vessels that have appears on both side of the continent. The Portland Press-Herald reports the Maine barge is docked at the city's Ricker's Warf. Contractors from local engineering firm Cianbro Corp. are installing high-tech equipment in the vessel, though workers said even they didn't know what the purpose of the ship was or who they were working for. Little is known about them, but they appear to have been registered by someone familiar with geek speak - and with a sense of humor. The structures are registered with a Delaware corporation as BAL0001, BAL0010, BAL0011 and BAL0100. In binary code used in computing, the numbers spell out \\"one,\\" \\"two,\\" \\"three\\" and \\"four.\\" Currently, Nos. 1 and 2 are on the water in San Francisco and No. 3 is in Portland Harbor. Also, the Delaware company to which they're registered is called Buy and Large, a likely joking reference to \\"Buy N Large,\\" the fictional mega-corporation in the 2008 Pixar film 'WALL-E.' The San Francisco barge is docked at Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay. Is this is? A 2009 patent filed by Google shows a water-borne data center. Possible: This large structure on a barge just off Treasure Island, between San Francisco and Oakland, could be a floating data center being made by Google. Google's patent describes 'a system includes a floating platform-mounted computer data center comprising a plurality of computing units, a sea-based electrical generator in electrical connection with the plurality of computing units, and one or more sea-water cooling units for providing cooling to the plurality of computing units.' 'The cutouts in the long walls of the containers, when they line up, they make hallways,' said Joel Egan, who designs similar structures. 'You could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers...It doesn't have enough windows for an office building' Now, CNET investigative reporter Daniel Terdiman claims the mystery construction site floating in San Francisco Bay could belong to Google, drawing on evidence from lease agreements, expert consultations and interviews with locals. He said putting data centers inside shipping containers, as he claims Google is doing, is already a well-established practice. While some commentators have criticized the reporter's evidence as circumstantial, experts say it's plausible that Google would build water-based data facility. Joel Egan, the principal at Cargotecture, which designs custom cargo container buildings, said the structure looks like a data center. 'The cutouts in the long walls of the containers, when they line up, they make hallways,' Egan told CNET. 'You could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers...It doesn't have enough windows for an office building.' Egan said that putting a data center on a barge would provide access to abundant water to help cool a large number of servers. Jonathan. Koomey, a Stanford research fellow and expert on data centers, said. companies such as Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft. have been installing specially built data centers in shipping. containers for some time because they're easy to deploy. This is an aerial view of the 'secret project' in San Francisco Bay. This is Hangar 3 on Treasure Island, alongside Pier 1, as seen in Apple Maps, before construction began. Plans? Sources say Google hopes to tow the completed structure from Treasure Island across the Bay to San Francisco¿s Fort Mason, where it would be anchored and open to the public. Meanwhile, KPIX 5 reports that Google is. actually building a floating marketing center at Hangar 3 for Google Glass, the cutting-edge wearable. computer the company has under development. KPIX 5 claims sources say Google hopes to tow the completed. structure from Treasure Island across the Bay to San Francisco’s Fort. Mason, where it would be anchored and open to the public. The media outlet also reported that construction on the site, near the San Francisco Bay Bridge, stopped several weeks ago because Google does not have a permit to park the barge on the waterfront. Construction on the site commenced last year, and the work is being shielded by a high security fence. Another theory is that Google is building a floating marketing center at for Google Glass, the cutting-edge wearable computer the company has under. Highlights:","completion":"1.

When they land, he is welcomed by representatives of the East German government, and Sherman realizes that Armstrong has defected to the other side. Sherman, however, is extremely uncomfortable with this move, realizing if the apparent defection is in fact real, given the circumstances of the Cold War of the period, she would likely never see her home or family again. They are constantly accompanied by Professor Karl Manfred (Günter Strack), who took part in arranging Armstrong's defection to the East.Armstrong visits a contact, a 'farmer' (Mort Mills), where it is revealed that his defection is in fact a ruse to gain the confidence of the East German scientific establishment in order to learn just how much their chief scientist Gustav Lindt (Ludwig Donath) and by extension, the Soviet Union, knows about anti-missile systems.

The first one was performed while Ottomans were dealing with the Greek uprising, see Greek War of Independence.The Greeks' independence war led to the Russian forces advancing into Bulgaria before the Turks sued for peace. The resulting Treaty of Adrianople on September 14, 1829, gave Russia most of the eastern shore of the Black Sea and the mouth of the Danube. The second independence movement happened during the uprisings. See Bosnia and Herzegovina: 19th-20th centuries, Romanian War of Independence. An uprising against Ottoman rule began in Herzegovina in July 1875. The Bulgarians organised the April Uprising, which lasted from April to May 1876. Serbia achieved autonomy and Russia was allowed to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia until Turkey had paid a large indemnity. The uprisings raised a chance for Russia and Austria-Hungary , who made the secret Reichstadt Agreement on July 8, on partitioning the Balkan peninsula depending on the outcome. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, in February 1878 the Russian army had almost reached the Ottoman capital but, scared the city might fall, the British sent a fleet of battleships to intimidate Russia from entering the Ottoman capital.

It ran from 1985 to 1989 for fifteen issues. Each takes the form of a series of short stories featuring different sets of characters, although some issues feature full-length stories relating to just one set of characters. The series was Bagge's first one-man comics anthology.

First published by Fantagraphics in 1990 it ran for 30 issues , and was one of the best - selling alternative comics of the 1990s , at its height selling 30,000 copies an issue . In 2000 Bagge revived the series in Hate Annual , a yearly comic which continues the story after Hate in short stories , in addition to Bagge 's writings on Libertarianism and culture and topical cartoons . Hate follows the life of Buddy Bradley , in a continuation of events from Bagge 's strip \`\` The Bradleys '' from former publications Neat Stuff . It is set for the first half in Seattle and later in suburban New Jersey . Buddy has to deal with the end of adolescence , reluctantly growing up , his relationships with a host of unpleasant acquaintances he has to class as friends , working in dead - end jobs and having no direction in life . Bagge used memories of events from his own life as material . Hate has been referenced by many commentators as an important example of Generation X comic culture and grunge culture in general .

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 3*p + 16 = -p for p.","completion":"To solve the equation 3*p + 16 = -p for p, we need to isolate p on one side of the equation. Step 1: Combining terms with the variable 'p'. We start by adding 'p' to both sides of the equation to move the '-p' term to the left side. 3*p + 16 + p = -p + p This simplifies to: 4*p + 16 = 0 Step 2: Isolating the variable 'p'. Now, we want to isolate 'p' by moving the constant term (16) to the other side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 16 from both sides: 4*p + 16 - 16 = 0 - 16 This simplifies to: 4*p = -16 Step 3: Solve for 'p'. Finally, we divided both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'p', which is 4. 4*p / 4 = -16 / 4 This simplifies to: p = -4 So, the solution to the given math problem is p = -4."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You can find these kits at hardware stores and plumbing supply retailers. A kit should include sheets of insulating foam, adhesive, an adhesive application tool, and instructions. Alternatively, you can create your own tank insulation kit by buying a standard size yoga mat and a tube of high-quality waterproof adhesive. Unless you find a good deal on the yoga mat, however, the price difference may not be that great. Turn off the water supply by turning the oval valve at the end of the supply line clockwise. Remove the lid of the toilet tank and set it aside. Flush the toilet to drain nearly all the water from the toilet tank. For now, leave the small amount of water that remains in the tank. It will help you clean out the tank. Use your preferred spray-based cleaner and a handled scrub brush. Scrub away as much of the rust-colored buildup on the tank's interior sides and bottom as you can. Dip your brush into the water in the bottom of the tank occasionally to rinse it off. Cleaning off the walls will make the adhesive for the insulation hold better. Once you've cleaned off most of the buildup, rinse down the interior walls with clean water, then flush again to empty away most of this water. Use a turkey baster to suck up the remaining water in the tank, or use a sponge to sop it up. Your goal is to remove all standing water from the tank. Your fastest option is to wave a hair dryer on high power back and forth throughout the tank for 10-15 minutes. Or, you can try one of the following: Position a space heater so that it is blowing hot, dry air into the tank. Check it at least every half-hour and leave it running until the porcelain is dry to the touch. Clip a work light with a 100 watt incandescent bulb to the top edge of the tank. Position it so the bulb is inside the tank. The heat of the bulb will dry the tank in roughly 12 hours. A toilet tank insulation kit comes with sheets of flexible styrofoam that you can cut to fit. Estimate the size and shape of the bottom and sides of your tank interior, and cut the pieces as needed. Follow the same process if you're using a yoga mat instead of an insulation kit. Always estimate on the larger side first, then cut the pieces smaller as needed. There should be extra sheets if you make a mistake. You'll have to cut around some obstructions within the tank, like the flush valve and the flapper. If you're using a kit, apply the included adhesive to the back of each sheet of cut insulation with the included wooden stick (basically, a popsicle stick). Try to spread a fairly even layer over the entire surface. Then, press each sheet in place against the tank interior. If you're using a cut-up yoga mat as your insulation, choose a high-quality, waterproof glue or sealant as your adhesive. Apply it according to the product instructions. This gives the adhesive time to fully set. After waiting, just turn the water supply valve counterclockwise to fill the tank back up. Then put the lid back on and you're all set! Insulating the interior should make a noticeable reduction in the amount of condensation on the outside of the tank. Summary:","completion":"1.

Patient C uses sunscreen, but patient D does not use any sunscreen. Patient E tans with tanning lamps, but patient F tans in the sun. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which patient would be more susceptible to skin cancer, patient E or patient C? The answer is:","completion":"Patient E would be more susceptible to skin cancer compared to patient C. Several factors in their respective lifestyles contribute to this increased risk. First, let us consider the habits of both patients. Patient C uses sunscreen, which is a preventive measure to protect the skin from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Sunscreen works by either absorbing or reflecting UV rays, preventing them from penetrating the skin and causing damage to skin cells. By using sunscreen, patient C reduces their risk of developing skin cancer, specifically, melanoma, and other skin-related conditions, such as sunburn, premature aging, and actinic keratoses. On the other hand, patient E tans using tanning lamps. Tanning lamps emit artificial UV radiation, which can be equally, if not more, harmful to the skin compared to natural sunlight. Indoor tanning devices, such as tanning beds and lamps, are known to increase the risk of skin cancer, particularly melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies tanning beds and lamps as Class 1 carcinogens, meaning they have strong evidence of causing cancer in humans. Another crucial factor to acknowledge is the duration and intensity of UV exposure. The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes that there is no safe limit for tanning, and any form of UV exposure, whether natural or artificial, can be harmful. Tanning lamps can deliver a concentrated dose of UVA and UVB rays, making the sessions more intense and the exposure more prolonged compared to sunbathing outside. These factors can further exacerbate the risk of skin cancer development for patient E. In conclusion, patient E, who tans with tanning lamps, has a higher susceptibility to skin cancer compared to patient C, who uses sunscreen as a preventive measure. It is essential to emphasize the importance of sun protection measures, such as wearing sunscreen, protective clothing, and seeking shade, in minimizing the risk of skin cancer and promoting skin health."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Australians have serious water worries, but it could be worse. They don't have to fear that when they turn on the tap, nothing will come out. That's the case in India. Many people in New Delhi, the capital, go without clean water for days. City leaders have taken stricter measures to save water. Users pay a very high but affordable price for it. Homeowners who waste water are given large fines. There are 1.9 million people who live in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now it has grown by more than 300,000 people since 2002. But it uses less water today than it did seven years ago. Question: What do people in Las Vegas think of the water-saving measures in their city?

A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). and the situation: Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late.

The premise has several elements: 1. The individual in question managed to outsmart others this time. 2. The charge of espionage could not be proven against him. 3. His wings were pretty well clipped for the future. From these elements, we can deduce that the person was suspected of espionage but managed to escape the consequences of his actions, due to either his cleverness or lack of concrete evidence. The mention of his \\"wings being clipped\\" indicates that he may face restrictions or limitations in the future, which can stem from increased scrutiny, legal consequences, or other barriers. Now, let's consider the hypothesis, \\"He would be prevented from doing something similar in the future.\\" The statement implies that the person in question will face obstacles or hindrances hindering him from engaging in similar activities, such as espionage. Based on the premise, the hypothesis appears to be substantially supported. The idea of \\"his wings being clipped\\" implies that the environment has changed for him after the incident, making it increasingly difficult for him to engage in activities like espionage. While the premise does not definitively state that he will be prevented from doing something similar in the future, it strongly suggests that he will face more significant challenges and constraints that could deter or limit his actions. In conclusion, if the premise is true, it provides strong evidence for the hypothesis, \\"He would be prevented from doing something similar in the future.\\" Although it does not absolutely guarantee this outcome, the context given in the premise makes it highly likely that the person in question will encounter obstacles and restrictions that may effectively impinge on his ability to engage in similar activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name.

Despite the troubling situation, there appears to be significant resistance to implementing stricter gun control measures on a local and national level. Local and federal law enforcement agencies have been working tirelessly to track down the sniper, using every available resource at their disposal. Advanced technology, forensic analysis, and eyewitness accounts have contributed step-by-step towards narrowing down the possible locations of the suspect. According to sources, police are optimistic about capturing the individual responsible for the shootings and returning the community to a state of safety and normalcy. While the progress made in locating the sniper has been encouraging, the current crisis has brought to light the controversial issue of gun control legislation. Authorities and local communities are grappling with the challenge of balancing public safety concerns and individual rights to bear arms. Many citizens and political factions, however, remain opposed to any form of increased restrictions on firearms. They argue that the sniper incident should not be used as a justification for advocating more stringent gun control policies but that it should be instead seen as an isolated event. This resistance to gun control measures presents a significant challenge for lawmakers and public safety officials looking to reduce the instances of gun-related violence and enhance public safety. As the authorities continue to search for the sniper, the ongoing resistance to gun control measures underscores the complexity of the issue. Law enforcement and policymakers must work in tandem to find a balance between protecting the public and preserving individual liberties.

When bible verses are listed, the first thing you'll see is the name of a book. Use the table of contents in your bible to locate that book within it.","completion":"After locating the book of the verse using the table of contents in your Bible, you will need to further navigate to the specific chapter and verse that you are looking for. Here are the next steps to complete this process: 1. Identify the chapter and verse number. Once you have found the book in the Bible, you will notice that the listed Bible verse will have additional numbers, usually formatted as \\"Book Chapter:Verse.\\" These numbers indicate the specific chapter and verse (or verses) that you are seeking. For example, if the Bible verse is \\"John 3:16,\\" then \\"John\\" is the book, \\"3\\" is the chapter number, and \\"16\\" is the verse number. 2. Find the correct chapter within the book. After locating the book, you will want to flip through the pages of the book until you find the specific chapter that the desired verse is from. Each chapter in the Bible typically starts with a bold or larger font number, which represents the chapter number. In the \\"John 3:16\\" example, you will need to look for the chapter number \\"3\\" within the pages of the book of John. 3. Locate the specific verse. Once you are on the correct chapter, you need to find the exact verse among the passages. Verses in the Bible are usually denoted by smaller numbers throughout the text. The verse numbers are often found at the beginning of each individual verse (or sometimes in the margins). In our example, you would look for the small number \\"16\\" at the beginning of a passage within the third chapter of John. 4. Read and reflect on the verse. Now that you have found the verse you were looking for, take the time to read and reflect on its meaning, context, and relevance to your life or situation. You may want to read the surrounding passages as well to gain context and understanding of the verse's message. 5. Utilize additional resources (optional). You might find it helpful to use additional resources like commentaries, Bible study guides, or online tools to further explore the meaning and context of the verse. These resources can provide historical background, interpretations, explanations, and applications that can enrich your understanding and appreciation of scripture. Finally, you can participate in group Bible studies or discuss the verse with friends, family, or church members to exchange insights and thoughts about the verse's meaning and how it relates to your personal faith journey. Remember, studying the Bible can be a rich and transformative experience; the more time and effort you put into understanding its text, the deeper your appreciation will be for God's Word and its messages for our lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question...who was on the english throne in 1789??","completion":"The monarch who held the English throne in 1789 was King George III. Born as George William Frederick, King George III was one of the prominent historical figures in British history. He was born on June 4, 1738, in London and became king on October 25, 1760, succeeding his grandfather, King George II. George III's reign was marked by a series of significant historical events and crises, which shaped both the British monarchy and the history of the country. One of the most notable conflicts during his reign was the Seven Years' War which ended in 1763, with Britain becoming the world's prominent colonial power. However, this victory was immediately followed by another significant challenge – the American War of Independence (1775–1783), also known as the American Revolutionary War. This war resulted in Britain's loss of control over its American colonies and America's birth as an independent nation, which was undoubtedly a significant setback for George III's reign. Apart from the political and social turbulence marked by these wars, George III’s rule in the late 18th century was also remembered due to the king's deteriorating mental health. In 1788, a year before 1789, the King suffered from a mental illness, now believed to be porphyria, which led to the Regency Crisis of 1788. During this time, the King was unable to fulfill his duties, leading to debates regarding his fitness to rule. In 1789, George III recovered, reasserting his control over the throne, and leading to a short period of stability referred to as the 'King's Peace'. In his personal life, George III was known for his morality and committed family life. Married to Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, he had 15 children. He had an interest in agriculture and was often referred to as \\"Farmer George\\". His reign was one of the longest in British history, lasting almost 60 years until his death on January 29, 1820. Two of his sons, George IV and William IV, succeeded him before his granddaughter, Queen Victoria, took the throne in 1837, becoming one of Britain's most iconic monarchs. George III's reign was a critical period in British history, characterized by significant shifts in the political landscape, the beginning of Britain's industrial revolution, and vast changes in social realities. His reign left a significant imprint on British history and had far-reaching impacts beyond the shores of Britain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I guess this weekend proved that we ca n't escape the inescapable and even if we could , I ' m not sure we should . Question: Why is the narrator so downcast and defeated ?","completion":"In reading the passage, it's evident that the narrator is feeling downcast and defeated due to the loss of an important person in their life. The opening line, \\"Her absence echoes in absolutely everything we do,\\" indicates that she used to have a significant role. This could be anyone with a vital role in someone's life, like a mother, sister, wife, girlfriend, or close friend. The choice of words suggests that her presence previously influenced and gave meaning to what they did, something that is now missing from their lives. The statement, \\"I don't think this will ever change,\\" tells us about the enduring nature of this sentiment. The narrator feels hopeless and entrenched in their sorrow, believing that the pain they feel, the emptiness left by her absence, will never cease. This indicates a deep despair, a profound grief over a loss that they perceive as permanent and unchangeable. The narrator also mentions a particular weekend which 'proved' that they can't 'escape the inescapable.' This could mean that in spite of attempts to ignore or move on from this loss, an event or circumstance over the weekend brought the raw pain of this absence back to their fore. It's a reminder that grief cannot be rushed or bypassed; it resurfaces in unexpected and powerful ways and during times that the survivor might initially believe they're ready to move forward. The final part of the sentence, \\"even if we could, I'm not sure we should,\\" complicates the feeling of defeat. The narrator suggests that even if they had the power to alter this reality, erase this pain, they may choose not to. It could mean that the narrator believes that this pain, as unbearable as it is, is somehow necessary or valuable. This could be out of respect for her memory, to acknowledge the depth of the relationship that can’t simply be forgotten, or it could be their due diligence in the grieving process. In essence, the factors contributing to the narrator's downcast and defeated tone stem from a deep-seated sense of loss and grief, a perceived inability to alter that reality, and an even more profound inner conflict about whether they should even try to move on from this loss. The passage presents a complex picture of grief, memory, and the impress of deep emotional ties that make moving forward feel like a defeat just as much as staying in the same emotional place does."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She was also one of the most adventuresome. She was born in London on January 9th, 1810. She entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of 14. Seven years later, just after her first show, Anna married Sir Henry Bishop, who was 24 years her senior. Her reputation as a singer grew rapidly, based largely on her tours with Sir Henry and harpist Nicholas Bochsa. After a tour of Dublin, Edinburgh, and London, Anna Bishop deserted her husband and three children and ran away with Bochsa. From then on, Madame Bishop--as she continued to be known--traveled and sang as if her life depended on it. Between 1839 and 1843 she traveled to every major town in Europe, where she sang in 260 concerts. In the course of two years in Naples, she performed in 20 operas. In 1855 she and Bochsa sailed for Sydney, Australia. He died there the following year, and Anna went on to tour South America before returning to New York, where she married a diamond merchant. Then she began what proved her most dangerous adventure. After another American tour in 1866, she and her husband set sail across the Pacific. They were shipwrecked on a small coral reef, and for more than a month they drifted in a small boat before they finally reaching Guam. She had lost her music, her wardrobe, and her jewelry, but Madame Bishop was not to be stopped. She went on to Manila and began a concert tour that led to Hong Kong, Singapore, and India before she went back to England. After another two-year world tour she returned eventually to New York, where she gave her last public performance in 1883--at age 73.

This article: \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is the best known piece from Thespis, as it was transplanted in 1879 into one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most successful operas, The Pirates of Penzance. In 1902, Gilbert told a correspondent that this had happened accidentally. He and Sullivan had arrived in New York to produce the new opera, but the composer discovered that he had left his sketches behind in England. Fortunately, the entrance chorus from Thespis fitted the situation almost exactly, so it was substituted instead.Several scholars have doubted that explanation.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - Jackie Keith Whitley (July 1, 1954 May 9, 1989), known professionally as Keith Whitley, was an American country music singer.

Clinic counselor Dr. Vinnie Donatti (Alan King) explains that the clinic has a 100% success rate due to a uniquely persuasive method: every time Dick smokes a cigarette, horrors of increasing magnitude will befall his wife and child. Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him). Not wanting to worry them, Dick hides the looming threat from his family. That night, Dick is angered by the methods Quitters uses and notices an undisposed pack of cigarettes in his desk. He prepares to smoke it, but notices a set of feet in his closet, realizing Quitters Inc. is serious about their threat to ensure he is not smoking. The following day, Dick visits his daughter (also played by Drew Barrymore) and gives her a doll. Donatti is also at the school, warning Dick that if he strays the only thing his daughter would understand is that someone is hurting her because her father misbehaved.

Let's analyze the premise and the hypothesis in detail to visualize the underlying reasoning behind this conclusion. Premise: \\"A man on a green motorcycle speeding up the road\\" In the premise, we are given three distinct pieces of information: 1. There is a man involved in the scenario. 2. The man is on a green motorcycle. 3. The man and the motorcycle are speeding up the road. Now let's examine the hypothesis: Hypothesis: \\"A man on a green motorcycle\\" The hypothesis contains two of the three pieces of information mentioned in the premise: 1. There is a man involved in the scenario. 2. The man is on a green motorcycle. While comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we can observe that the hypothesis is a simpler version of the premise, excluding only the action \\"speeding up the road.\\" However, since this information is not contradictory to the other details present in both the premise and the hypothesis, it doesn't compromise the validity of the hypothesis when considering the premise to be true. In other words, both pieces of information in the hypothesis are directly derived from the premise, making the hypothesis true if the premise is true. Additionally, it's important to note that the omitted action \\"speeding up the road\\" in the hypothesis does not affect the truth of the statement \\"a man on a green motorcycle.\\" The hypothesis focuses on the presence of a man on a green motorcycle, whether or not the individual is in motion or at rest. Since the motion aspect is a separate variable, removing it does not alter the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise provided. In conclusion, when accepting the premise as true, we can rightfully deduce that the hypothesis is also true. The man being on a green motorcycle is undeniable in both the premise and the hypothesis, solidifying the soundness of the hypothesis under the given conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Joe had four grandchildren, and they visited him during their holidays. During one vacation, Joe was preparing his home for the kids: cleaning and buying their favorite foods. After he finished working, he realized he lost his favorite watch. The watch was a gift from his wife when their first child was born. Joe loved the watch very much, especially after his wife's death. He was very upset about losing it. Once his grandchildren came, they promised him they would find the watch. One granddaughter asked: \\"Grandpa, do you remember when you saw the watch last before it went missing?\\" \\"I guess when I was cleaning the barn !\\" Joe replied. The children looked for more than two hours with Joe, but they could not find it. The kids were now also sad, but they tried to comfort their grandfather. One grandson went back to the barn to search again. Joe asked why he was going there a second time. But the little boy just asked the others not to follow him and to remain silent.

Which is the oldest college of Cambridge University?","completion":"Peterhouse College is the oldest college of the prestigious University of Cambridge. It was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, the Bishop of Ely, in an attempt to establish an intellectual community that would pursue knowledge and learning in the town of Cambridge. Hugh de Balsham sought to encourage scholarship among the students after observing that students in the town needed formal teaching institutions due to the lack of regulation, as they were solely living together and receiving informal instruction from teachers. The establishment of Peterhouse marked the beginning of the collegiate system that distinguishes Cambridge University today. Peterhouse initially comprised just two main buildings: the original hostelry (now known as Bishop's Hostel) and a hall, which served as a common dining area and study space for the scholars. The students admitted to Peterhouse were mainly focused on the study of theology, with some emphasis on subjects like arts and law. Later, the college expanded its focus to include a wider variety of subjects, keeping up with the evolving academic environment. Throughout its history, Peterhouse has undergone significant architectural and physical developments. The college expanded its facilities following the growth and success of the institution, constructing new libraries, gardens, and accommodation buildings. Some of the most notable expansions include the construction of the Perne Library in the late 16th century and the addition of the Chapel, designed by Sir Christopher Wren, in the 17th century. Additionally, the Ward Library was established in the 19th century as a repository for books and manuscripts. Today, Peterhouse is a small college, consisting of approximately 260 students and 45 fellows, representing diverse academic fields. Despite its small size, the college boasts a distinguished list of alumni, including five Nobel laureates, one British Prime Minister, and several notable figures in the fields of mathematics, literature, and science.

How to determine prostate cancer recurrence Know the risk factors for prostate cancer recurrence. One factor is whether there was cancer in the lymph nodes at the time of the initial diagnosis. Cancers that spread to the lymph nodes around the pelvic region increase the risk for a recurrence of prostate cancer later on.","completion":"Additionally, the aggressiveness of the cancer at the time of diagnosis, as indicated by the Gleason score, plays a significant role in the likelihood of recurrence. A high Gleason score suggests a more aggressive cancer type with a higher propensity to return after treatment. It is crucial for patients to maintain regular follow-up appointments with their healthcare team for accurate and timely monitoring of potential cancer recurrence, enabling appropriate and prompt intervention if needed. Other risk factors that contribute to prostate cancer recurrence include the presence of positive surgical margins after a prostatectomy, indicating that some cancerous tissue may have been left behind, and the status of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level post-treatment. A rising PSA level may signal the return of cancerous cells, necessitating further evaluation and potential treatment adjustments. Moreover, genetic predisposition, family history, and personal lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise habits, may also influence a person's risk for prostate cancer recurrence. Ultimately, understanding and addressing these factors in collaboration with a knowledgeable healthcare team can lead to a personalized, proactive approach to safeguarding one's health and mitigating the risk of prostate cancer recurrence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Process: - Magma rises through cracks in the Earth&#x27;s crust - The pressure causes plates to move - Magma explodes to the surface - The lava from the eruption cools to form new crust - After several eruptions, the rock builds up and a volcano forms - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more lava from the eruption that cools happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you proposed suggests that there is more lava cooling from the eruption. In this scenario, if more lava cools and forms new crust, it could have several effects on the process, and may lead to less or smaller eruptions. 1. Thicker Crust: If more lava cools to form a thicker crust, it might make it more difficult for magma to rise through the cracks and reach the surface. This resistance could result in less frequent eruptions or smaller eruptions, as the magma would need greater pressure to break through the Earth's crust. 2. More Pressure Buildup: With more lava cooling and solidifying, the pressure within the Earth's mantle might build up more gradually. This could lead to less frequent eruptions but potentially larger ones when the pressure finally overcomes the increased resistance of the thicker crust. 3. Change in Plate Movements: As additional lava forms a new crust and adds mass to the tectonic plates, this could affect the way the plates move and interact with each other, either decreasing or increasing the likelihood of volcanic eruptions in certain areas. 4. Change in Volcano Formation: If more lava from the eruption cools around the vent, it may alter the way a volcano forms. This could potentially lead to different types of volcanic structures, which may affect the frequency and magnitude of eruptions. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of more lava cooling from an eruption could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of volcanic eruptions. It may lead to less frequent or smaller eruptions due to increased resistance from a thicker crust, changes in pressure buildup, alterations in plate movements, and differences in how volcanoes form. However, these effects are highly dependent on various factors, such as the type of volcanoes, tectonic settings, and magma composition, making it difficult to predict exact outcomes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Buried with him were the tools of a hunter or warrior. There was a bone pin that may have been from a piece of clothing such as a leather coat. He carried a copper knife on his breast. The most amazing find was two gold earrings. That would have made him a man of distinction. Only a few centimeters from his head were two pots made of clay, tools and materials to make arrows, a bow and a dozen arrows for hunting and a second, smaller copper knife. Next to them lay a cushion stone, upon which the man could work metal. His grave is the richest of any found from that period, because this man was buried with two gold earrings which are the oldest gold ever found in Britain (dated to 2470 BC). Besides, he was buried three miles from Stonehenge. Archaeologists tend to believe he was a member of a powerful class who might have organized the construction of Stonehenge. Stonehenge was begun around 3000 BC. In about 2300 BC the huge stone circles were built. The biggest stone weighed approximately 20 tons. But the smaller blue stones, still weighing 4 tons on average, came from west Wales. It is not yet known how these were conveyed over a distance of 380 km. It is also a mystery how early man was able to construct Stonehenge without the use of modern construction machines and lorries. He is an example of people who brought culture and new techniques from the European mainland to Britain. In terms of technical development people were going from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age and then to the Iron Age.

No. The correct answer is not \\"Wood has always been used extensively for furniture, such as chairs and beds.\\" The question is asking about specific wooden utensils that many people use to eat Chinese takeout. A more appropriate answer would be: Many people use wooden chopsticks when eating Chinese takeout. Chopsticks are traditional eating utensils and have been used for over 2,000 years in China. These elongated sticks are held in one's dominant hand and are usually made from bamboo, although they can be made from other materials such as metal, plastic, or wood. Wooden chopsticks are the most commonly used type for Chinese takeout due to their natural, eco-friendly properties and lightweight nature. Chopsticks require a certain level of acquired dexterity and skill, which differs from conventional Western utensils such as forks and knives. They are typically used for manipulation and transportation of small, bite-sized food items from a shared dish to one's mouth or personal plate. The cultural significance of chopsticks in Chinese cuisine extends beyond their practical use as eating utensils. They carry symbolic meanings, such as representing good fortune and auspiciousness, especially during holidays and celebrations. In Chinese takeout, wooden chopsticks are often provided as disposable utensils to support hygiene, ensuring they are only used once. They are usually connected at the top end and require the user to snap them apart before use. Aside from wooden chopsticks, there might be other wooden utensils such as wooden spoons used for consuming soup or washing down rice.

The actress tweeted Sunday afternoon that she and her family were announcing Christopher’s “unexpected passing” — less than 24 hours after she took to Instagram to ask for help in searching for her brother. “At this time we ask for privacy,” Cattrall said in the post. “We want to thank you all on social media for your outpouring of love and support in this trying time.” RCMP had said the 55-year-old was last heard from on Tuesday, and was believed to have been at his home on a rural property in Lacombe, Alta., at the time. Police said in a news release Sunday afternoon that Cattrall’s body was found on that property. “The investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death will continue by the RCMP, but preliminary information indicates that his death is not being considered suspicious,” RCMP said in the release. Police said they would not be commenting further on the case out of respect for the family. Kim Cattrall, who was born in the U.K. but spent much of her childhood in Canada, had said in an earlier Instagram post that her brother’s keys, cellphone and wallet were left on a table in the house, and his front door was unlocked and his seven dogs were left alone. Police did not confirm those details. RCMP Cpl. Laurel Scott said earlier Sunday that a relative checked Cattrall’s home on Friday and that’s when police were notified he was missing. She said police and search and rescue had checked the property.

Observing the abundance of game birds Martin wrote: There is plenty of land and water fowl in this isle—as hawks, eagles of two kinds (the one grey and of a larger size, the other much less and black, but more destructive to young cattle), black cock, heath-hen, plovers, pigeons, wild geese, ptarmigan, and cranes. Of this latter sort I have seen sixty on the shore in a flock together. The sea fowls are malls of all kinds—coulterneb, guillemot, sea cormorant, &c. The natives observe that the latter, if perfectly black, makes no good broth, nor is its flesh worth eating; but that a cormorant, which hath any white feathers or down, makes good broth, and the flesh of it is good food; and the broth is usually drunk by nurses to increase their milk. Similarly, Samuel Johnson noted that: At the tables where a stranger is received, neither plenty nor delicacy is wanting. A tract of land so thinly inhabited, must have much wild-fowl; and I scarcely remember to have seen a dinner without them. The moor-game is every where to be had. That the sea abounds with fish, needs not be told, for it supplies a great part of Europe. The Isle of Sky has stags and roebucks, but no hares.

Mary miraculously surfaces, but she cannot remember how she survived. Mary then drives to Utah, where she has been hired as a church organist. At one point, she can get nothing on her car radio but strange organ music. She passes a large, abandoned pavilion sitting all by itself on the shores of the Great Salt Lake; it seems to beckon to her in the twilight. Shortly thereafter, while she is speeding along a deserted stretch of road, a ghoulish, pasty-faced figure (never identified, but called \\"The Man\\" in dialogue and played by director Herk Harvey, uncredited) replaces her reflection in the passenger window and stares at her. When The Man suddenly appears in front of her, she swerves off the road.

More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D.

The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media.

Question: Given the following context: The band's third album, Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), demonstrated a change in direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, who had worked with Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up. The gloominess surrounding the sessions worked its way into the context for the album's themes. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of Southern mythology, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by \\"the whole idea of the old men sitting around the fire, passing on ... legends and fables to the grandchildren\\".They toured Canada in July and August 1985, and Europe in October of that year, including The Netherlands, England (including one concert at London's Hammersmith Palais), Ireland, Scotland, France, Switzerland, Belgium and West Germany. On October 2, 1985, the group played a concert in Bochum, West Germany, for the German TV show Rockpalast. Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: how to make holiday party mix","completion":"Both solutions have their own merits and what might be better for one person, might not suit another. However, to properly assess and recommend the better of these two options, it's essential to provide an in-depth analysis of both methods for preparing the holiday party mix. Solution 1: DIY Homemade Holiday Party Mix In this method, you make the holiday party mix from scratch using a combination of snacks, candies, and other festive ingredients. Here's a suggested recipe for creating a delicious and versatile homemade holiday party mix: Ingredients: - 2 cups mini pretzels - 2 cups rice or corn Chex cereal - 1 cup mixed nuts (almonds, cashews, peanuts, and pecans) - 1 cup holiday M&M's or other festive candy - 1 cup dried cranberries or raisins - 1 cup mini marshmallows - Optional: 1 cup of chocolate or white chocolate chips, popcorn, or other small seasonal candies Instructions: 1. In a large bowl, mix together pretzels, Chex cereal, and mixed nuts. 2. Add in the M&M's and dried cranberries, then gently mix until combined. 3. Mix in the mini marshmallows and any optional ingredients, like chocolate chips or popcorn. 4. Store the holiday party mix in an airtight container or divide into individual serving bags for guests. Advantages of Homemade Holiday Party Mix: - Customizable: You can choose your favorite ingredients, modify the recipe according to allergies or dietary preferences, and make it as sweet, salty, or healthy as you'd like. - Freshness: A homemade mix is often fresher, as you can control the ingredients' quality and decide when to make it. - Budget-friendly: Making your own mix often allows for cost savings as you choose the ingredients, determine the portion size, and avoid any high-priced commercial options. Disadvantages of Homemade Holiday Party Mix: - Time-consuming: Making the mix from scratch takes time, which might be a constraint if you're very busy with holiday preparations. - Inconsistent results: There might be variations in the taste and overall appearance each time you make the mix, especially if you use different ingredients or proportions. Solution 2: Store-bought Holiday Party Mix This method involves purchasing a pre-made holiday party mix from a grocery store or online marketplace. Many brands offer festive and tasty mixes that cater to various tastes and preferences. Advantages of Store-bought Holiday Party Mix: - Convenience: Purchasing a pre-made mix is convenient and time-saving, simply open the bag and serve. - Consistency: The taste, appearance, and proportions of ingredients in a store-bought mix will be consistent each time you buy it. - Variety: There are several holiday party mix choices available in the market, catering to various taste preferences and dietary restrictions. Disadvantages of Store-bought Holiday Party Mix: - Limited customization: You will have limited control over the mix's ingredients, which might be an issue for people with specific allergies or dietary preferences. - Cost: Pre-made holiday party mixes might be more expensive than creating your own, especially if you choose a high-end or gourmet product. Conclusion: The better solution for making holiday party mix ultimately depends on your personal preferences, time constraints, and desired level of customization. If you enjoy preparing your own recipes and have specific ingredient preferences, then the DIY homemade holiday party mix is likely a better choice. However, if convenience, time-saving, and consistency are more important to you, a store-bought holiday party mix could be the better solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Who is the assistant going on a date with? Answer the above question based on the context below: One evening, after getting drunk at a bar, Mitch and Dave urinate in a park's fountain, and simultaneously wish that they had each other's lives. The next morning, Mitch and Dave realize they have switched bodies. Mitch remembers the wish they made the night before and they drive back to the park, planning to urinate again in the fountain and wish for their original lives back, but find the fountain has been removed for restorations. Forced to wait a few days until the parks department can locate the fountain, Mitch and Dave agree to pretend to be each other for the day. When Mitch arrives at Dave's law firm office, he befriends Dave's attractive assistant, Sabrina McKay. However, Mitch's lack of professionalism and legal knowledge cause a big merger to fall through. Meanwhile, Dave arrives at Mitch's film shoot to discover that it is a lorno (light porno). Tired of pretending to be Mitch, Dave has them go back to his house to tell his wife Jamie the truth, but Jamie does not believe him. Dave gives Mitch advice on how to behave professionally and Mitch sets Dave up on a date with Sabrina, who Mitch has had a crush on. After speaking with his father, Mitch rededicates himself to doing everything Dave's life demands, from taking care of the kids and buying groceries to making decisions at the firm. On the night of her ballet recital, Cara, Dave's eldest child, is about to be pushed by another girl who has a habit of bullying her, but takes Mitch's advice and throws her to the floor, to which Mitch foul-mouthedly cheers. Cara tells Mitch that she loves him and Mitch says the same thing, but feels guilty for doing so immediately after. That night, Mitch and Jamie begin to have sex with each other, but Mitch angrily finds that his guilt will not allow him to become erect, and he admits that he is not cut out for the responsibilities of an adult. Jamie comforts him, and he discreetly rests his head on her breasts. The answer is:","completion":"The assistant, Sabrina McKay, is going on a date with Dave. However, it's important to note that Dave's body has been switched with Mitch due to their wish at the fountain. So, technically, Sabrina is going on a date with Dave's personality in Mitch's body."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Problem:Problem: a couple who own an appliance store discover that if they advertise a sales discount of 10 % on every item in the store , at the end of one month the number of total items sold increases 12 % . their gross income from sales for one month increases by what percent ? Options: a ) 0.4 % , b ) 0.8 % , c ) 2 % , d ) 4 % , e ) 8 % Solution:","completion":"To solve this problem, we'll analyze the change in gross income from the sales in terms of the percent changes. Let's represent the original gross income as G, the number of items sold as N, and the price of each item as P. The formula for gross income is: G = N * P Now, let's consider the changes after the couple applies a 10% discount on every item and the number of items sold increases by 12%. 1. The new price after a 10% discount is 90% of the original price: New price = 0.9 * P 2. The new number of items sold after the 12% increase: New number of items = 1.12 * N Now, let's calculate the new gross income (G_new) using these values: G_new = (1.12 * N) * (0.9 * P) To determine the percent increase in gross income, we calculate the difference between the new and old gross incomes, then divide by the original gross income and multiply by 100. Percent Increase = [(G_new - G) / G] * 100 Substituting G = N * P and G_new = (1.12 * N) * (0.9 * P): Percent Increase = [((1.12 * N) * (0.9 * P) - N * P) / (N * P)] * 100 Simplify by factoring out N*P: Percent Increase = [((1.12 * 0.9) - 1) * 100] Percent Increase = [(1.008 - 1) * 100] Percent Increase = [0.008 * 100] Percent Increase = 0.8 % So, the couple's gross income from sales for one month increases by 0.8%. The correct answer is (b)."},{"prompt":"Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person that is replaced by a monster?, using the article: A \\"skybike\\", a one-man, open-cockpit flying machine, attacks Dogen.

Article: Students who want to attend an American university must explain how they will pay for their education. They have to show that they will be able to pay for each year of study. Students have to consider not only the tuition, the cost of classes, but also meals and a place to live in, which is known as room-and-board. They also need money for books and supplies. And they need money to spend on social activities and other things. Educational advisers say foreign students should have enough money in a local bank to pay for at least two months of expenditure . So how much will a year at an American school cost? Generally speaking, the answer is: a lot. A leading state university in the Pacific Northwest will serve as an example. The University of Washington says foreign students are paying more than 36,000 this year. This major research university currently has 2,600 foreign students from more than 100 countries. There are many schools that cost less, but also others that cost more. Its web site says the University of Washington does not offer financial assistance to international students. This is generally true of American schools, especially at the undergraduate level. The international application for the university includes a Statement of Financial Responsibility that must be signed. Students must also provide a bank letter or statement from within the past six months. And they have to name someone who will help with payments. These people must send proof from a bank to show that they have the money. Your government or employer may be able to help you pay all or some of the college costs. A good idea is to ask at least eighteen months before you want to start classes in the United States. Our Foreign Student Services, including links to web sites discussed in our reports, can be found at www.unsv.com. To learn more about higher education in America, the State Department has a special web site: educationusa.state.gov. Question: What is the speaker's purpose in this speech?

I am sure part of the reason was because they had offered to foot part of the expenses. There came a point in the planning, when his mom seemed to sort of run-amok with her ideas. His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people. My partner’s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn’t even part of your ancestry. It’s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don’t really want. Soon after that, my partner’s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister.

Biodiversitatea se referă la varietatea de forme de viață care există pe Terra, inclusiv diversitatea genetică din cadrul speciilor, diversitatea speciilor în sine și diversele ecosisteme și habitaturi în care acestea trăiesc. Păstrarea biodiversității oferă numeroase beneficii, cum ar fi protecția resurselor de hrană, apă și subsol, minimizarea riscului de dezastre naturale și îmbunătățirea calității vieții noastre prin menținerea unui mediu sănătos și echilibrat. Importanța conservării biodiversității a devenit din ce în ce mai evidentă în ultimii ani, în timp ce oamenii au început să observe efectele deteriorării mediului înconjurător, dispariția habitatului și extincția speciilor la nivel global. Astfel, trebuie să fim conștienți de rolul pe care diversitatea biologică îl joacă în menținerea vieții pe Pământ și să ne axăm eforturile politice pe protejarea și conservarea acestei bogății naturale. Una dintre metodele cheie pentru acțiunea politică în conservarea biodiversității este dezvoltarea unor politici și legi care să reglementeze activitățile umane și să reducă impactul negativ asupra mediului înconjurător. De exemplu, implementarea unor legi care să protejeze habitatele fragile, să limiteze extracția excesivă de resurse, să controleze poluarea și să prevină fragmentarea pământului poate contribui într-o mare măsură la păstrarea biodiversității. În plus, politica trebuie să promoveze cercetarea și educația în domeniul biodiversității, pentru a încuraja o mai bună înțelegere a acestei probleme și pentru a dezvolta strategii de conservare eficiente. De asemenea, cooperarea internațională este crucială în acest proces, având în vedere că biodiversitatea este o problemă globală ce necesită acțiuni concertate și coordonate între țări. Investițiile în programe de conservare, de refacere a habitatelor și de gestionare durabilă a resurselor naturale sunt, de asemenea, esențiale pentru conservarea biodiversității. Acest lucru înseamnă că guvernele trebuie să aloce fonduri adecvate și să implice sectorul privat și comunitățile locale în aceste eforturi. Toate aceste acțiuni politice, în combinație cu eforturi de conștientizare la nivel individual, vor ajuta la protejarea și conservarea biodiversității, asigurând un viitor mai sănătos și mai prosper pentru noi toți și pentru generațiile care vor urma. Astfel, este imperativ ca păstrarea biodiversității să rămână o prioritate în agenda noastră politică."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A good worker's watch. I also think it is a nice looking \\"rounded appearance\\" every day watch. Years ago they were square. This is the only watch I wear. My first two watches never stoped running, just the rubber/plastic casing gets broken up over the years from contact with varius items I'm working on. The battery lasts 4-5 years if you dont use the light feature button much. The bands also need replacing over the years with heavy use. The three alarms I never use (high tones) because of my hearing loss. Although they claim water resistant I don't take it in the water. One did leak on me once but after it dried out it continued to work. Less than 50.00 including tax and shipping. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","completion":"The product review conveys a predominantly positive sentiment towards the G-shock watch. The reviewer shares their long-term experience with the product, stating that this is their third G-shock over a period of 25 years, which implies a sense of loyalty and satisfaction with the brand. Additionally, the reviewer mentions the watch's durability, as the first two watches never stopped running and the battery life can last 4-5 years if the light feature button is not used frequently. The watch's design and rounded appearance are also considered as appealing for an everyday watch. However, there are a few negative remarks mentioned as well. The reviewer notes that the rubber/plastic casing tends to get damaged, and the band needs to be replaced after years of heavy use. Furthermore, they reveal their disappointment in the watch's alarm feature, as the high tones cannot be heard due to their hearing loss. Lastly, the reviewer shares a concern related to water resistance, recounting an incident when the watch leaked, but acknowledges it continued working after drying out. Overall, the sentiment of the review is positive, as the user appears to be content with the watch's performance and design while acknowledging a few flaws. The fact that the reviewer continues to purchase G-shock watches after 25 years is a strong indication of their satisfaction with the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The man was elderly, unshaven and ragged. Passers-by wanted nothing to do with him. But the woman smiled. \\"Are you hungry?\\" she asked. The man slowly looked up. This was a woman clearly used to the finer things in life. Her coat was new. She looked like that she had never missed a meal in her life. \\"No, \\" he answered sarcastically . \\"I've just come from dining with the president. Now go away. \\"To his surprise, the woman continued standing. And her smile became even broader. \\"What are you doing, lady?\\" he asked angrily. \\"I said to leave me alone. \\" Just then a policeman came up. \\"Is there any problem, ma'am?\\" He asked. \\"No problem here, officer,\\" the woman answered. \\"I'm just trying to get this man to his feet. Will you help me?\\" The officer scratched his head. \\"That's old Jack. He's been around here for a couple of years.

I didn't do anything.\\" \\"This is a good deal for you, Jack, \\"the officer answered. \\"Don't blow it. \\" Finally, the woman and the police officer got Jack into the cafeteria and sat him at a table. It was the middle of the morning, so most of the breakfast crowd had already left and the lunch bunch had not yet arrived. The woman turned to the officer, \\"Would you like to join us in a cup of coffee and a meal, officer?\\" \\"Yes, ma'am.

A) some people get help just when they need it B) the cup of coffee is going to taste as sweet as sugar C) Jack was paid back for his kindness so many years later D) Eddy achieved her Success through painstaking efforts in the end Answer:","completion":"C) Jack was paid back for his kindness so many years later. The story recounted by the woman, Penelope Eddy, reveals that in her time of need many years ago, when she was a young, cold, and hungry college student, it was Old Jack who had shown her kindness. As she entered the cafeteria where Jack once worked, he had helped her by providing a warm meal, giving her hope, and perhaps even indirectly contributing to her future success. Now, finding Jack in a similar situation to her own years earlier, Penelope extends the same kindness toward him that he had given to her. She helps him by providing a meal, including the police officer and involving him in a meaningful conversation. This act of kindness from Penelope represents the repayment of Jack's earlier generosity, creating a full circle moment in their lives. The police officer refers to this encounter as a miracle because it is a rare and heartwarming event where the roles have been reversed, and someone who was once in great need is now able to help the one who initially supported them. It highlights the idea that sometimes, good deeds may come back to benefit us in unexpected ways, further emphasizing the importance of being kind to others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Speaking two languages can actually help offset some effects of aging on the brain, a new study has found. Researchers tested how long it took participants to switch from one cognitive task to another, something that's known to take longer for older adults, said lead researcher, Brian Gold, a neuroscientist at the University of Kentucky. Gold's team compared task-switching speeds for younger and older adults, knowing they would find slower speeds in the older population because of previous studies. However, they found that older adults who spoke two languages were able to switch mental activities faster than those didn't . The study only looked at life-long bilinguals, defined in study as people who had spoken a second language daily since they were at least 10 years old. Gold and his team asked 30 people, either bilingual or monolingual , to have a series of tests. They found that bilingual people were not only able to switch tasks faster, they had different brain activity than their monolingual peers. Kristina called bilingualism \\"a beautiful natural experiment\\", because people grow up speaking two languages,and studies have shown that they get certain cognitive benefits from switching between languages and determining which to respond with based on what's going on around them. Gold said he grew up in Montreal, where he spoke French at school and English at home, prompting relatives to question whether his French language immersion would somehow hinder his ability to learn English. \\"Until very recently, learning a second language in childhood was thought of as dangerous,\\" he said. \\"Actually, it's beneficial. \\" Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

Goldfinger lived there with his wife Ursula and their children until his death in 1987 . 1 -- 3 Willow Road was constructed using concrete and a facing of red brick . A number of cottages were demolished to allow for the construction , which was strongly opposed by a number of local residents including novelist Ian Fleming ( this was said to be his inspiration for the name of the James Bond villain Auric Goldfinger ) and the future Conservative Home Secretary Henry Brooke . No. 2 , which Goldfinger designed specifically as his own family home , is the largest of the three houses and features a spiral staircase designed by Danish engineer Ove Arup at its core . The building is supported by a concrete frame , part of which is external , leaving room for a spacious uncluttered interior , perhaps inspired by the Raumplan ideas of modernist architect Adolf Loos .

An example of the directing: When Candy (Jean Peters) starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing, an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in -- as if it's an alarm going off in her head. It's not cartoon-like -- it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you've seen the film a few times and it just \\"clicks\\" that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag. Richard Widmark is way on top of his game as a smart-alec -- he's really great -- but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for \\"Moe,\\" the street peddler/informer, played by Thelma Ritter. Later, in her apartment, you are not seeing a movie -- you're seeing a real person. I've never seen anyone \\"act\\" so real I felt like I was looking into a real room until Ritter's performance -- right down to the way her hair stuck out a bit when she removed her hat. About a million other things just *worked,* from the way Lightning Louie picks up money with his chopsticks to the way Candy's jewelry clicks when she flicks Moe's hand away from her brooch, to the way Moe gets the dollars and change from the police captain across the FBI guy's chest -- and even the way the captain opens his filing cabinet, like he's been doing it in that way in that room for many years. \\"Pickup On South Street\\" is detailed moves (directing) with consummate performances (acting) and superb now-nostalgic visuals of the day, such as the panel truck, the boards leading to the shack out on the water, the dumbwaiter, -- and the unforgettable place Skip stashes his pocket pickings. Wonderful stuff. \\"Pickup On South Street\\" is also one of the few movies where, even though the characters aren't perfect, you do care about them -- perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape: Skip as a \\"three-time loser\\" and Candy as a youngish woman who has \\"knocked around\\" a lot. When these people behave a little more badly than you'd expect, it's in sort of novel ways that make it seem you're looking in at people you'd never otherwise imagine -- and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human.

Honours and legacy In 1929, Soviet writer Leonid Grossman published a novel The d'Archiac Papers, telling the story of Pushkin's death from the perspective of a French diplomat, being a participant and a witness of the fatal duel. The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the Tsarist regime. In Poland the book was published under the title Death of the Poet. In 1937, the town of Tsarskoye Selo was renamed Pushkin in his honour. There are several museums in Russia dedicated to Pushkin, including two in Moscow, one in Saint Petersburg, and a large complex in Mikhaylovskoye. Pushkin's death was portrayed in the 2006 biographical film Pushkin: The Last Duel. The film was directed by Natalya Bondarchuk. Pushkin was portrayed onscreen by Sergei Bezrukov. The Pushkin Trust was established in 1987 by the Duchess of Abercorn to commemorate the creative legacy and spirit of her ancestor and to release the creativity and imagination of the children of Ireland by providing them with opportunities to communicate their thoughts, feelings and experiences.

If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred. Question: \\"What kind of fine do you get for repeatedly beating a woman?\\" Answer: \\"100 dollars\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Select from the following. * no. * yes.","completion":"* yes. The correct answer is \\"yes.\\" The paragraph states, \\"If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine.\\" Earlier in the paragraph, it mentioned that the fine for beating a dog is 100, so the same fine for repeatedly beating a woman would also be 100. This is why the other answer, \\"no,\\" is incorrect."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Write an article based on this summary: Leicestershire chief executive Wasim Khan says the club need new signings to improve their limited-overs results. Article:","completion":"Title: Leicestershire County Cricket Club Seeks New Signings to Improve Limited-Overs Results Introduction: Leicestershire County Cricket Club's chief executive, Wasim Khan, recently spoke about the club's ongoing struggle to improve their limited-overs results in the recent seasons. Khan asserted that the club needs to invest in new signings to enhance their overall performance in shorter formats of the game, such as T20 and One-Day cricket. Considering the club's track record, it is evident that Leicestershire has been underperforming, especially during the Royal London One-Day Cup and the Vitality Blast T20 tournament. Current Situation: Leicestershire has faced a series of defeats and disappointments that have led to questions about the team's makeup and capabilities in limited-overs cricket. It is important to note that the club has had very few victories in the shorter format to boast of in the recent past. Despite the club's rich history, they have been struggling to recapture their success in the past few years. This places them at a critical juncture where the club must reassess its strengths, identify its weaknesses, and formulate a comprehensive strategy to recuperate. Wasim Khan's View: Khan's proposal of signing new players is well-founded, given that the current team has failed to make a significant impact in the limited-overs competitions. Bringing in fresh talent and experience could steer Leicestershire towards the road to success in both T20 and One-Day cricket. Wasim Khan envisions an exciting and rewarding future for the club and is determined to make the necessary changes to reignite its potential. Potential Signings: Leicestershire County Cricket Club will be assessing various domestic and international players as potential signings for the upcoming season. The club should focus on integrating a balanced mix of youth and experience, as it is essential to groom the younger talents under the guidance of seasoned players. Acquiring players with exceptional skills in batting, bowling, and fielding is imperative, as it elevates the team's overall capabilities, increases their chances of outperforming their opponents, and could encourage better performances from existing players. The Importance of Coaching and Support Staff: While new player signings are crucial, it is also vital that the club focuses on strengthening their coaching and support staff. The role of the coaching and support staff in honing the skills of the team members and creating a cohesive unit cannot be overlooked. Engaging experienced coaches and support staff can help the club maintain effective communication, instill discipline, and create strategies that maximize the potential of existing and new players alike. Conclusion: Leicestershire County Cricket Club is at a pivotal point in its journey to reestablish their dominance in limited-overs cricket. Wasim Khan's proposal for new signings is a crucial step towards achieving success in the T20 and One-Day formats. As the club seeks to turn a new leaf, it must prioritize a balanced blend of youth and experience with an exceptional skill set that helps enhance the overall team performance. Furthermore, investing in exceptional coaching and support staff will prove invaluable in creating a well-rounded and capable team. With these initiatives in place, Leicestershire can confidently look toward a bright and successful future in limited-overs cricket."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

In the cosmic scheme of things, this was relatively minor. But very annoying. I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet.

Tucker was born Sofya \\"Sonya\\" Kalish (in Russian, Sof'ia <<Sonia>> Kalish) in 1887 to a Jewish family en route to America from Tulchyn, Podolia Governorate, Russian Empire, now Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine. (\\"Sonya\\" is a nickname for the name \\"Sofya\\", the Russian form of the name Sophie.) The family adopted the surname Abuza, settled in Hartford, Connecticut, and opened a restaurant. At a young age, she began singing at her parents' restaurant for tips. In 1907, Tucker made her first theater appearance, singing at an amateur night in a vaudeville establishment. It was here that she was first made to wear blackface during performance, as her producers thought that the crowd would tease her for being \\"so big and ugly.\\" By 1908, she had joined a burlesque show in Pittsburgh but was ashamed to tell her family that she was performing in a deep southern accent wearing burnt cork on her face. While touring later that year, luggage including her makeup kit was lost, and Tucker was allowed to go on stage without the blackface. She then stunned the crowd by saying, \\"You all can see I'm a white girl. Well, I'll tell you something more: I'm not Southern. I'm a Jewish girl and I just learned this Southern accent doing a blackface act for two years. And now, Mr. Leader, please play my song.\\" Tucker also began integrating \\"fat girl\\" humor, which became a common thread in her acts. Her songs included \\"I Don't Want to Get Thin\\" and \\"Nobody Loves a Fat Girl, But Oh How a Fat Girl Can Love.\\" In 1909, at the age of 22, Tucker performed with the Ziegfeld Follies. Though she was a hit, the other female stars refused to share the spotlight with her, and the company was forced to let her go. This caught the attention of William Morris, a theater owner and future founder of the William Morris Agency, which would become one of the largest and most powerful talent agencies of the era. Two years later, Tucker released \\"Some of These Days\\" on Edison Records, written by Shelton Brooks. The title of the song was later used as the title of Tucker's 1945 biography. In 1921, Tucker hired pianist and songwriter Ted Shapiro as her accompanist and musical director, a position he would keep throughout her career. Besides writing a number of songs for her, Shapiro became part of her stage act, playing piano on stage while she sang, and exchanging banter and wisecracks with her in between numbers. Tucker remained a popular singer through the 1920s and became friends with stars such as Mamie Smith and Ethel Waters, who introduced her to jazz. Tucker learned from these talented women and became one of the first performers to introduce jazz to white vaudeville audiences. In 1925, Jack Yellen wrote one of her most famous songs, \\"My Yiddishe Momme\\". The song was performed in large American cities where there were sizable Jewish audiences. Tucker explained, \\"Even though I loved the song and it was a sensational hit every time I sang it, I was always careful to use it only when I knew the majority of the house would understand Yiddish. However, you didn't have to be a Jew to be moved by My Yiddishe Momme.\\" During the Hitler regime, the song was banned by the German government for evoking Jewish culture. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"\\"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in this article.

Everybody on my bus was panicking.\\" He added: \\"I did not see him coming over the bridge but I saw everybody laying on the bridge, not moving.\\" A group of young boxers were also caught up in the incident. They were leaving a press conference ahead of a World Series Boxing event when they came face to face with the alleged assailant. \\"We heard a loud bang and screaming and then I noticed some smoke. I thought it was a car crash,\\" Frazer Clarke, 25, from Burton-on-Trent, told the Press Association. \\"I looked towards the front gate and people were running, a police officer and a fellow coming to the gate with two knives. \\"He was stabbing the police officer with the knives. \\"The police officer was stumbling and fell on the floor. Another police officer walked toward the guy with the knives and shot him twice. \\"Then people started shouting at us to get inside. Time stood still and I was shocked.\\" Conservative MP Grant Shapps told BBC News: \\"I was walking through the Cloisters when the division bell rang. There were a lot of people in Portcullis House, where the offices are, and as we were streaming across to vote, we heard shouting and saw police officers, guns drawn, pointing towards the gate. \\"Then I heard four shots in quick succession. Instantly, there were police officers by our sides saying get down, then get back, and we went inside behind the palace walls.\\" Former education secretary Nicky Morgan told the Press Association: \\"I was walking from Portcullis House along the path of Old Palace Yard when suddenly shots rang out. \\"It takes a moment to realise that is actually gunfire and at that point people were yelling: 'Get down, get back!' \\"We have at the back of our mind all the time that something terrible can happen. The first thing is is that actually gunfire? Have you misheard? But the reaction of the officers around made it very clear this is a very serious situation.\\" George Eaton, the New Statesman's political editor, watched the incident unfold from the press gallery inside the Commons. He told Sky News: \\"I saw a large crowd fleeing the attacker who appeared to be carrying a knife. \\"He then entered the gates of Parliament and charged at officers. We now know that one of them was sadly stabbed. He was then very swiftly shot by armed police.\\" Michelle Langham was visiting the Houses of Parliament at the time. She was shut in the central lobby after the incident and said lots of school children were there. \\"We were in the cafe when it happened. We saw a policeman down on the floor. We saw a lot of commotion. Everyone who was out on the street was told to get into the cafe. There were lots of people screaming,\\" she said. \\"We haven't been told anything about the casualties, everything we are getting is from social media. Inside we are not being told anything.\\" One witness, Ismael, was waiting at a traffic light near Westminster Bridge. He said: \\"As I was waiting for the light to change the car sped up and passed me. \\"That small shop after the traffic light... that's the first victim hit... second after a few metres and the third and by then it clicked that something was going on. \\"It (the car) continued... by the end of the bridge - I don't know what's happening but there was a lot of people on the pavement and the car went straight.\\" Richard Tice was coming out of the Tube station as the events unfolded. He told BBC News: \\"I came out of Westminster Underground and it was clear something dramatic had happened. \\"I was ushered on to the bridge and, looking up and down, there were at least eight figures on the west pavementâ€¦ and then the car crashed at the south end of the bridge.\\" Steve Voake was on the bridge itself. He said: \\"I was just walking across the bridge and suddenly a bus stopped and everybody started screaming and people came off the bus and they seemed very upset. \\"And then I saw what appeared to be a trainer by the side of the road and then on the other side of the road there was a body and when I looked further up there was another body and then when I looked over the side of the bridge there appeared to be a body in the water as well.\\" Mr Voake said he tried to stop others coming onto the bridge. Bradford Buck, from Connecticut in the US, saw the incident unfolding. \\"Police cars just kept coming one after another after another, I've never seen such a quick response,\\" he said. \\"My wife and I came up from Westminster underground, we walked across to Parliament and there was a car crashed into the gate there. \\"Police officers were running with machine guns, and there was a man down right next to the car.\\" Fearing for their safety, Mr Buck and his wife sheltered behind some concrete, before police moved them to safety. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"A man in a car hit some people and then hurt a police officer. Some police officers saw the man and told him to stop, but he didn't listen. So they shot him. Many people saw this happen and were scared. The police then helped to keep everyone safe.

A blacklight (or often black light), also referred to as a UV-A light, Wood's lamp, or simply ultraviolet light, is a lamp that emits long-wave (UV-A) ultraviolet light and not much visible light. Is it true that are black lights and uv lights the same thing?","completion":"Yes, black lights and UV lights refer to the same type of light source, but it is essential to understand the distinctions within the broader category of ultraviolet (UV) light. Ultraviolet light is a form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than that of visible light but longer than X-rays. It is present in sunlight and has various applications like disinfection, air purification, and fluorescence. The term UV light encompasses a range of wavelengths divided into three subcategories: UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C. Black lights primarily emit UV-A light, which is the least harmful type of UV radiation. It is often referred to as long-wave ultraviolet light, with wavelengths ranging from 320 to 400 nanometers. Black lights are typically used in environments where a unique type of illumination is required, such as in parties, concerts, or to make fluorescent materials glow in dark. In addition to their recreational use, black lights also play roles in detecting counterfeit currencies, analyzing artwork for repairs or forgeries, and identifying minerals in geology. UV lights, on the other hand, can also refer to the other two subcategories of ultraviolet radiation. UV-B light, with wavelengths ranging from 280 to 320 nanometers, is known for its effects on human health, such as an increased risk of skin cancer and cataracts with overexposure. UV-B radiation is essential, however, for the production of vitamin D in the human body. UV-C light, with wavelengths between 100 and 280 nanometers, constitutes the shortest and most destructive form of ultraviolet radiation. Because of its germicidal properties, it is extensively used in sterilization, disinfection, and water purification processes. UV-C is entirely absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere and does not reach the surface. Artificially produced UV-C light sources, such as germicidal lamps or UV-C LED lights, serve various industrial and medical applications. In summary, black lights and UV lights can be considered the same thing in the context that both emit ultraviolet radiation. However, it is crucial to note that black lights specifically emit UV-A light, which has different applications and properties compared to the more harmful UV-B and UV-C radiation."},{"prompt":"What happens to airplanes when they hit the ground?

Here is the complete process including the first step: 1. Consumption and ingestion of food: The individual consumes food, which is then ingested as it enters the digestive system. 2. Food begins to be processed by the digestive system: The digestive process starts in the mouth, where food is chewed and mixed with saliva to break it down into smaller pieces. The food then travels down the esophagus and into the stomach, where it is further broken down by stomach acids and enzymes. 3. The pancreas releases enzymes to aid digestion: The pancreas is an essential part of the digestive system and releases enzymes such as amylase, lipase, and protease to help break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into simpler molecules that can be absorbed by the body. 4. Digested food affects the amount of sugar in the blood: The digested food components, such as glucose (from carbohydrates), amino acids (from proteins), and fatty acids (from fats), are absorbed into the bloodstream, which increases the blood sugar level. 5. The pancreas releases one hormone to lower the blood sugar (glucose) level: In response to the elevated blood sugar level, the pancreas secretes the hormone insulin, which helps to lower blood sugar levels by promoting the uptake and storage of glucose by the body's cells. 6. The pancreas releases another hormone to raise the blood sugar (glucose) level: If the blood sugar levels drop too low, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon, which acts to increase blood sugar levels by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen (stored glucose) in the liver and the release of glucose into the bloodstream."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Find the right ending to this passage. Kevin Pietersen's autobiography has seemed to be an endless stream of sad score-settling. But while the former England batsman’s claims of a bullying culture are certainly worthy of investigation, it’s KP’s mass of contradictions that leap off the page. Here’s the best (or worst) of them… England's James Anderson (left) reacts with team-mates Kevin Pietersen (centre) and Graeme Swann after he takes a wicket against India during a Test at Lord's in 2011 Skating on thing ice After the removal of Peter Moores and Pietersen’s demotion from the captaincy, England travelled to the West Indies in early 2009. Pietersen relates that he ‘gave it my best’ upon being back in the ranks. ‘I had come to the Caribbean and gone out of my way to make things as smooth as possible for Straussy,’ he insists. He has always said that","completion":"his relationship with the new captain, Andrew Strauss, was robust and unwavering. They shared an understanding and mutual respect on and off the field that would often be a source of strength during challenging times. However, this notion does raise eyebrows given the tension and controversy that later surrounded them. At times, he even suggests that the dressing room atmosphere improved with his own demotion. Pietersen goes on to elaborate on his relationship with each of his teammates, reiterating his claim that the bullying culture was something he stood against. He mentions Matt Prior, casting him in a less than flattering light, whom he alleges to be one of the proponents of this culture. The book is laced with such accusations, with Pietersen taking the opportunity to detail the incidents that led to his alienation within the team. Reminiscing of the time during the four-match Test series against South Africa, he explains how he felt lonely and ostracized. Despite scoring an impressive century in the second innings at Headingley, he emphasizes how it was a solitary one. He describes that this was the time he first felt rejected by his own team and started questioning his own place in it. His claim about swashbuckling all-rounder Ian Bell being insecure about his place in the team, despite being on the top of his game is an interesting perspective. According to Pietersen, an accomplished batsman like Bell feeling insecure was a clear indication of the level of fear and intimidation prevalent in the dressing room. Many of Pietersen’s accounts reveal a certain amount of self-pity and an apparent necessity to vindicate himself from all accusations ever made against him. The book provides, on many occasions, a blow-by-blow account of incidents detailing his high-octane journey through international cricket. This journey, according to Pietersen, is filled with a sense of betrayal and victimhood, primarily at the hands of his English teammates and the English Cricket Board(ECB). Yet, despite the influx of stinging revelations, Pietersen also acknowledges his culpability for certain actions. He admits he could've possibly handled situations better, communicated more effectively, instead of being grandiose or confrontational. However, it's his adamancy about not being the 'only' one that stands out. In this narrative journey, Pietersen certainly provides engrossing, and occasionally eyebrow-raising insight into the inner workings of international cricket, revealing the highs and lows of his tumultuous career. In ending, KP's autobiography serves not only as a platform for airing his grievances but also provides a precious window into his many successes, thunderous performances, indelible friendships, and his enduring love for the beautiful game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For kids,happiness has a magical quality.Their delight at winning a race or getting a new bike is unreserved . In the teenage years the concept of happiness changes.Suddenly it's conditional on such things as excitement,love and popularity.I can still recall the excitement of being invited to dance with the most attractive boy at the school party. In adulthood the things that bring deep joy-love,marriage,birth-also bring responsibility and the risk of loss.For adults,happiness is complicated .

Two mature males (cocks or roosters) are set to fight each other, and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed. Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour. The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter. Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of cruelty to animals. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Why has cockfighting has been banned in many cultures during the last century?","completion":"Cockfighting has been banned in many cultures during the last century for several reasons, primarily due to concerns about animal welfare, as well as evolving societal values and legal implications. Here are some detailed factors that explain why cockfighting has been banned in various countries: 1. Animal Cruelty: Cockfighting involves putting two roosters in a ring or pit where they fight each other until one is critically injured or killed. The birds often sustain severe injuries, such as punctured lungs, broken bones, and gouged eyes. Animal rights activists and the general public have increasingly recognized this practice as inhumane and cruel, leading to bans on the sport. 2. Societal Values: Over the past century, there has been a shift in societal values and an increasing emphasis on animal welfare and rights. As people become more aware of the suffering and cruelty involved in cockfighting, support for the sport has dwindled, leading governments to enact legislation to protect animals from such activities. 3. Illegal Gambling: Cockfighting often involves illegal gambling, with spectators wagering large sums of money on the outcome of the fights. Governments around the world have enacted laws to curb illegal gambling, and banning cockfighting is an essential part of this effort. By banning the activity, governments can reduce the instances of illegal gambling and the associated social and economic issues. 4. Public Health Concerns: Cockfighting can pose potential health risks to both humans and animals. The transfer of infectious diseases between birds and humans, such as avian influenza, is a significant concern. Moreover, cockfights can facilitate the spread of diseases among the birds themselves, which may lead to an epidemic within the poultry population. 5. Legal Implications: As cockfighting becomes illegal in various jurisdictions, the sport has increasingly been pushed underground. Participants in illegal cockfighting rings may face severe legal consequences if caught, including fines, imprisonment, or even the seizure of their birds. This has deterred many potential cockfighters and led to a decline in the prevalence of the sport. 6. International Pressure: As more countries ban cockfighting, they may exert pressure on neighboring nations to follow suit. This international peer pressure can create a domino effect, leading to widespread bans across a region or even the world. In summary, cockfighting has been banned in many cultures during the last century due to concerns about animal cruelty, evolving societal values that demand greater empathy and care for other living beings, illegal gambling, public health concerns, legal implications, and international pressure. As awareness of animal welfare continues to grow, more countries are likely to implement bans on this cruel and inhumane sport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Geologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes. To understand the differences, they have made a chart where they divided the earth into two regions, region A and region B. In region A many earthquakes happen, but in region B no earthquakes happen. In which region the plates would move, region A or region B? A:","completion":"To determine in which region the plates would move and make the area more susceptible to earthquakes, let's analyze the situation step by step: Step 1: Understand the cause of earthquakes Earthquakes are primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates. These plates are constantly moving and interacting with each other, causing stress along their boundaries. When the stress becomes too great, the energy is released in the form of seismic waves, generating an earthquake. Step 2: Compare the regions Region A has many earthquakes, while Region B has no earthquakes. Step 3: Identify the relationship between plate movement and earthquakes Since earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates, it's reasonable to assume that areas with more earthquakes experience more frequent and/or significant plate movement. Step 4: Draw conclusions Based on the information provided, it's likely that the plates in Region A would move more than in Region B. The higher frequency of earthquakes in Region A suggests that there is greater tectonic activity in this area, leading to increased stress along plate boundaries and ultimately causing earthquakes. In contrast, the lack of earthquakes in Region B suggests that the plates in this region either move very little or that their movement does not generate significant stress to cause earthquakes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My family and I celebrated Memorial Day by having brunch here. From what I saw, most of the items on the menu are your typical breakfast/brunch items: eggs, bacon, crepes, etc. I'm sure they're all cooked great BUT I really encourage you to get the menu items that make this restaurant unique! It seems that a very popular choice is Chicken Adobo Fried Rice Omelette. Yup, thats: fried rice lathered in chicken adobo sauce and chicken, wrapped in an egg omelette - making it look like a burrito. It is indeed very good, and that's an endorsement coming from a Pinoy. For those not too familiar with Filipino food, the rice/chicken part WILL be salty, so if you're not in to salty foods, this may not be for you. Despite being a big fan of that dish, my family members around me got it so I just picked off their plates. I myself got the Kalua Benedict with country potatoes. What makes the benedict special is its shredded pork. The pork is so tender and moist, its a unique substitution from what you typically have on benedicts. My dad and uncle both got the Loco Moco, and although I didn't get to taste it, they both gave their endorsements. We all ordered nutella crepes, and that plate is very large! We were able to split it among 6 peoples as a perfect dessert. What a gem! Mahal na mahal kita!

Summarize: It has been lifted on to a huge purpose-built ship which will transport it to England to be scrapped. Shell wants to leave the legs in place. The 24,000 tonne Brent Delta platform topsides sat on a three-legged gravity-based structure in 140 metres of water. The platform lies 115 miles north east of Shetland. It is one of four which is due to be removed from the field in the coming years. Unusually for a platform, the legs of Brent Delta are made of concrete which makes it much more difficult to decommission than one with steel legs. Allseas, the company which operates the decommissioning vessel Pioneering Spirit, said it had set a world lifting record with the removal of the platform. The topsides have now been sea-fastened on board the vessel for transportation to Teesside. Brent Delta was one of the first platforms to be built in the very early days of Britain's oil and gas industry. It sits about 115 miles (185km) north-east of Shetland in a cluster of four platforms which make up the Brent field. Its sister, Brent Bravo, produced its first oil in 1976. At its peak, in 1982, the four platforms were producing more than half a million barrels of oil a day. Being one of the first, it's now at the end of its life and has to be removed. Brent Delta is the first major piece of infrastructure to be decommissioned in the North Sea. More than 100 platforms are forecast to be completely or partially removed over the next decade in the waters of the UK and Norway.","completion":"The Brent Delta platform, located 115 miles northeast of Shetland, has been lifted onto a purpose-built ship for transportation to England to be scrapped.

With songs such as \\"Maybellene\\" (1955), \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" (1956), \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" (1957) and \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" is a 1956 hit single by Chuck Berry, originally released on Chess Records, with \\"Drifting Heart\\" as the B-side. The lyrics of the song mention rock and roll and the desire for rhythm and blues to replace classical music. The title of the song is an imperative directed at the composer Ludwig van Beethoven to roll over in his grave in reaction to the new genre of music that Berry was promoting. The song has been covered by many other artists, including the Beatles and the Electric Light Orchestra. \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine ranked it number 97 on its list of the \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". - \`\` Around and Around '' is a 1958 rock song written and first recorded by Chuck Berry .

It was written and recorded in 1955 by Chuck Berry, and inspired/adapted from the Western Swing fiddle tune \\"Ida Red,\\" which was recorded in 1938 by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. Berry's song tells the story of a hot rod race and a broken romance. It was released in July 1955 as a single by Chess Records, of Chicago, Illinois. It was Berry's first single and his first hit. \\"Maybellene\\" is considered one of the pioneering rock-and-roll songs: \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine wrote, \\"Rock & roll guitar starts here.\\" The record is an early instance of the complete rock-and-roll package: youthful subject matter; a small, guitar-driven combo; clear diction; and an atmosphere of unrelenting excitement.

First Sentence: \\"To understand quantum phase transitions, it is useful to contrast them to classical phase transitions (CPT) (also called thermal phase transitions).\\" In this sentence, the main subject is \\"quantum phase transitions,\\" and it suggests contrasting them with \\"classical phase transitions\\" (also called \\"thermal phase transitions\\"). So, it implies that quantum phase transitions are different from classical (or thermal) phase transitions, and understanding their differences can help us comprehend quantum phase transitions better. 2. Second Sentence: \\"To understand thermal phase transitions, it is useful to contrast them with classical phase transitions (CPT) (also referred to as quantum phase transitions).\\" This sentence has \\"thermal phase transitions\\" as its main subject, and it suggests contrasting them with \\"classical phase transitions\\" (which are, confusingly, also referred to as \\"quantum phase transitions\\"). This sentence implies that understanding the differences between thermal phase transitions and classical phase transitions (or quantum phase transitions, as the sentence calls them) can improve our understanding of thermal phase transitions. Comparing Sentence 1 and Sentence 2, we can see that they don't have the same meaning and are somewhat contradictory. Sentence 1 is comparing quantum phase transitions to classical/thermal phase transitions, while Sentence 2 is comparing thermal phase transitions to classical/quantum phase transitions.

Q:A wild baby bison at Yellowstone National Park had to be killed because of tourists. The tourists thought that the baby bison looked cold. They put it in their car and drove to a park ranger station. A ranger described the action of the tourists as a \\"dangerous move\\" because adult bisons can look after their babies very well and they will attack to protect their young. Park rangers took the animal from the car and set it free. But, sadly, the baby was refused by its family because it had the smell from humans. Yellowstone National Park explained on Facebook that the smell from people can cause parent animals to refuse to accept their young. The park tried again and again to make the baby bison lives with its parents. After several times they had to give up. Many people expressed anger at both the tourists and the park. The park said that they did not have the ability to care for a young bison. They also said that it is \\"not the task of the park to save animals\\". The tourists were fined 110 for touching park wildlife. Park rules say that visitors to Yellowstone should stay at least 22 meters away from all wildlife, and at least 90 meters away from bears and wolves. One ranger said that Yellowstone recently added many safety signs that say staying near the wildlife there is dangerous to humans and animals as well. Those signs are written in English and other languages. From the passage, we can learn that _ . A) we must keep away from any wild animal B) we should care about wild animals in a right way C) we'll be fined if we save a bison in the park D) we'd better write safety signs in many languages A:","completion":"From the passage, we can learn that we should care about wild animals in the right way. The incident at Yellowstone National Park involving the baby bison highlights the importance of understanding and respecting the natural behavior of wild animals. In this case, the tourists, despite having good intentions, interfered with the baby bison's family dynamics and ultimately caused its rejection and death. It is crucial for people visiting natural parks and wildlife reserves to understand the rules and guidelines set in place for the safety of both humans and animals. In the case of Yellowstone National Park, the rules clearly state that visitors should maintain a safe distance from wildlife (at least 22 meters away from all wildlife and at least 90 meters away from bears and wolves). These rules are in place to avoid any potential harm, disruption, or negative consequences for either the wildlife or visitors. Additionally, it is essential that visitors follow the advice of park rangers and other experts who understand the wildlife's behaviors and needs. In the baby bison incident, the park ranger recognized the danger of removing the animal from its natural environment and attempted to re-integrate it into its family to no avail. Park officials also emphasized that it is not the responsibility of the park to save animals. While it may seem counterintuitive, interfering with wild animals in an attempt to help them often does more harm than good. Natural parks and reserves are meant to provide animals with the space and freedom to thrive in their natural habitats, and human interference often upsets the delicate balance of these ecosystems. Moreover, the passage highlights the importance of having safety signs in multiple languages. This ensures that visitors from various backgrounds can understand the rules and potential hazards of interacting with wildlife, ultimately reducing the risk of unintentional harm or interference. In conclusion, the passage teaches us the importance of caring about wild animals in the right way by respecting their natural habitat and behavior, adhering to park rules, and understanding the potential consequences of our actions on these delicate ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How the Tiny Israeli TV Company Keshet Became an International Player The media production and distribution company Keshet International did not even exist four years ago. Since then, its rise has been meteoric. Last year, the company—a subsidiary of Israel-based Keshet Media Group—had six shows on TV in the U.S.—including Dig, Homeland, and Tyrant—and has sold programs in more than 50 territories. Today, it has shows playing on every continent except Antarctica. This foothold is only set to grow with the opening of U.S.-based Keshet Studios, along with a co-production deal with Universal TV and a first look deal at NBC. So, how did a TV production company with a staff of barely 50 people become a worldwide phenomenon within the first few years of existence? Perhaps unsurprisingly, by giving viewers something they hadn’t seen before. Keshet Media Group CEO Avi Nir brought the show Hatufim to the U.S., where it would become Homeland, ushering in an era of increased openness to edgy foreign content. “It all starts with a great idea first,” says Patrick Moran, executive vice president of ABC Studios. According to Moran, despite a barrage of competition from new media producers and broadcasters, the primary concern at studios and networks is still finding unique content, regardless of where it originates. It also helped that Keshet International got started at a time of unprecedented need for programming, thanks to the proliferation of cable channels and new platforms like Netflix and Hulu. According to a study from FX Networks, there were 409 scripted shows on TV in 2015, up from 211 in 2009. Still, with more outlets and shows comes more competition to stand out and attract audiences. Legacy players often accomplish this with big advertising campaigns and the use of well-tested concepts. But for an upstart Israeli studio, throwing money at problems was not an option. “Our way to an audience was by being different,” says Nir. “We are not about cookie cutter shows.” The mere premise of Keshet’s biggest hit, Hatufim, courted controversy in its home market. Any show on kidnapped soldiers and prisoner exchanges is almost guaranteed to stir up strife in Israel, a country with a history of bitter prisoner exchanges, not to mention the 2006 war against Hezbollah that was sparked, in part, by the group’s abduction of Israeli soldiers. The company has also employed its unconventional philosophy in developing talent. “People are very slow to provide financial backing to writers. What Avi and Keshet have done is to really find lot of voices that had not been heard prior and gave them the money and room to grow,” says Bert Salke, president of Fox 21 Television Studios, which produces the Keshet shows Homeland and Tyrant. Keshet International’s growth took off when Nir decided to build on his early forays into the U.S. in order to move Keshet Media Group away from its reliance on the small Israeli market. “They need their formats to travel,” says WME (William Morris Endeavor) head of television Rick Rosen, the agent who represents Keshet. So Nir went to London to sell media executive Alon Shtruzman on the idea of starting a company to develop, shop, produce, and distribute shows around the world. As COO of the streaming service Playcast and formerly vice president of content at the Israeli cable company HOT, Shtruzman understood the technical changes roiling the media industry and had programmed hundreds of hours of television. At HOT, Shtruzman had greenlit In Treatment, a daily show created by Hagai Levi, Keshet’s former head of drama, that was one of the first shows to be “binge watched,” giving Shtruzman experience in non-linear programming before the term “binge watching” existed. Shtruzman jumped at the opportunity. “Israel doesn’t play safe, so I never played it safe. In all my jobs it was always building, disrupting, changing, adjusting to new tech, adjusting to new environments,” Shtruzman says. The process of finding people to build Keshet Studios in the U.S. took Shtruzman two years. One of those he hired—as president of scripted content—was Peter Traugott, who has produced and overseen shows such as The Simpsons, COPS, and Just Shoot Me. “If you look at the head count at Keshet International versus other international companies, it has been a very scrappy, bootstrap company,” says Traugott. Despite being smaller than its competitors, Keshet was one of the first companies to enter both the Chinese and Korean markets with locally produced TV shows. It has also struck co-development and co-production deals with local players across Latin America, the U.K., and Europe. But it is in the U.S. market that Keshet International has had the most impact, becoming an influential part in the expansion of at least one major U.S. television studio in the process. “In the last six years, we went from a studio with one or two shows on the air, and now we are one of the leading cable studios. Keshet has a lot to do with that,” says Fox 21 Television Studios president Bert Salke, who describes Homeland as the most successful show in his studio’s history. Still, not every Keshet show has been a hit. Allegiance, the company’s American adaptation of the Israeli spy drama The Gordin Cell, was cancelled by NBC in 2015 after five poorly rated episodes. And Rising Star, Keshet’s 2014 foray into the talent show genre—a shopworn format at the time—did not go as planned. Keshet jazzed up the concept with new technology from app startup Screenz that allowed audience members to vote on contestants in real time, and the show quickly sold internationally when it was unveiled. But it was cancelled just as quickly due to poor ratings in several key markets, including the U.S. “I think the show was at the point where the whole genre was wearing out,” Nir admits today. Considering Keshet’s missteps and short track record, some in the industry are not convinced that the young company can be more than a small player. “Keshet has a stable of proven writers and producers who have created hits in the past,” one senior level studio executive told Fortune, noting that the company has seen success “on a small scale.” Still, the failures of Rising Star and Allegiance do not seem to have crippled the market for Keshet shows. Today, the company has 20 shows currently in development in the U.S. Shtruzman says that Keshet’s main push in the future will be to gain more control of its content abroad, mainly by continuing to enter into co-production and production deals with deficit financing (as opposed to less risky but less lucrative licensing deals) as well as content distribution. “We develop, produce, distribute; we control the value chain of our shows. I think it’s the only way to build a significant business,” says Shtruzman. For now, though many in the industry say that the current pace of production is unsustainable, there seems to be consensus that the need for content will continue to be strong, even if it is not clear where that content will live or how it will be paid for. “Right now we are in the middle of so much content being produced, and I think we will start to see that constrict a bit,” says Patrick Moran of ABC Studios. “But ultimately I still think good material will trump everything else.” Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Keshet had developed In Treatment and brought it to the U.S. What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the rapid rise to success of Keshet International, an Israeli media production and distribution company. Despite only existing for four years, the company has had six successful TV shows in the U.S., and has sold programs in over 50 territories. Due to its success, Keshet Studios will open in the U.S., allowing for co-production deals with Universal TV and a first look deal at NBC. Keshet's success is thought to stem from its ability to provide unique content and develop undiscovered talent, alongside its willingness to take risks and adapt to changes within the industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which case would most likely see the substance turning into liquid, case B or case C? Hint: Start right above point on the temperature axis and follow the red line vertically. At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state. As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify. For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid. The line segment represents the process of sublimation, where the substance changes directly from a solid to a gas. At a sufficiently low pressure, the liquid phase does not exist. The point labeled is called the triple point . The triple point is the one condition of temperature and pressure where the solid, liquid, and vapor states of a substance can all coexist at equilibrium.

Solve this instance: SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--Congress finds that-- (1) certain scattered parcels of Federal land in Gilpin County, Colorado, are administered by the Secretary of the Interior as part of the Royal Gorge Resource Area, Canon City District, Bureau of Land Management; (2) these land parcels, which comprises approximately 133 separate tracts of land, and range in size from approximately 38 acres to much less than an acre have been identified as suitable for disposal by the Bureau of Land Management through its resource management planning process and are appropriate for disposal; and (3) even though the Federal land parcels in Gilpin County, Colorado, are scattered and small in size, they nevertheless by virtue of their proximity to existing communities appear to have a fair market value which may be used by the Federal Government to exchange for lands which will better lend themselves to Federal management and have higher values for future public access, use and enjoyment, recreation, the protection and enhancement of fish and wildlife and fish and wildlife habitat, and the protection of riparian lands, wetland, scenic beauty and other public values. (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to authorize, direct, facilitate and expedite the land exchange set forth herein in order to further the public interest by disposing of Federal lands with limited public utility and acquire in exchange therefor lands with important values for permanent public management and protection. SEC. 2. LAND EXCHANGE. (a) In General.--The exchange directed by this Act shall be consummated if within 90 days after enactment of this Act, Lake Gulch, Inc., a Colorado Corporation (as defined in section 4 of this Act) offers to transfer to the United States pursuant to the provisions of this Act the offered lands or interests in land described herein. (b) Conveyance by Lake Gulch.--Subject to the provisions of section 3 of this Act, Lake Gulch shall convey to the Secretary of the Interior all right, title, and interest in and to the following offered lands-- (1) certain lands comprising approximately 40 acres with improvements thereon located in Larimer County, Colorado, and lying within the boundaries of Rocky Mountain National Park as generally depicted on a map entitled \`\`Circle C Church Camp'', dated August 1994, which shall upon their acquisition by the United States and without further action by the Secretary of the Interior be incorporated into Rocky Mountain National Park and thereafter be administered in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations generally applicable to the National Park System and Rocky Mountain National Park; (2) certain lands located within and adjacent to the United States Bureau of Land Management San Luis Resource Area in Conejos County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 3,993 acres and are generally depicted on a map entitled \`\`Quinlan Ranches Tract'', dated August 1994; and (3) certain lands located within the United States Bureau of Land Management Royal Gorge Resource Area in Huerfano County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 4,700 acres and are generally depicted on a map entitled \`\`Bonham Ranch- Cucharas Canyon'', dated June 1995: Provided, That it is the intention of Congress that such lands may remain available for the grazing of livestock as determined appropriate by the Secretary in accordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations: Provided further, That if the Secretary determines that certain of the lands acquired adjacent to Cucharas Canyon hereunder are not needed for public purposes they may be sold in accordance with the provisions of section 203 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and other applicable law. (c) Substitution of Lands.--If one or more of the precise offered land parcels identified above is unable to be conveyed to the United States due to appraisal or other problems, Lake Gulch and the Secretary may mutually agree to substitute therefor alternative offered lands acceptable to the Secretary. (d) Conveyance by the United States.--(1) Upon receipt of title to the lands identified in subsection (a) the Secretary shall simultaneously convey to Lake Gulch all right, title, and interest of the United States, subject to valid existing rights, in and to the following selected lands-- (A) certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County, Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal Meridian, Section 18, Lots 118-220, which comprise approximately 195 acres and are intended to include all federally owned lands in section 18, as generally depicted on a map entitled \`\`Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July 1994; (B) certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County, Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal Meridian, Section 17, Lots 37, 38, 39, 40, 52, 53, and 54, which comprise approximately 96 acres, as generally depicted on a map entitled \`\`Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July 1994; and (C) certain unsurveyed lands located in Gilpin County, Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 73 West, Sixth Principal Meridian, Section 13, which comprise approximately 11 acres, and are generally depicted as parcels 302-304, 306, and 308-326 on a map entitled \`\`Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July 1994: Provided, however, That a parcel or parcels of land in section 13 shall not be transferred to Lake Gulch if at the time of the proposed transfer the parcel or parcels are under formal application for transfer to a qualified unit of local government. Due to the small and unsurveyed nature of such parcels proposed for transfer to Lake Gulch in section 13, and the high cost of surveying such small parcels, the Secretary is authorized to transfer such section 13 lands to Lake Gulch without survey based on such legal or other description as the Secretary determines appropriate to carry out the basic intent of the map cited in this subparagraph. (2) If the Secretary and Lake Gulch mutually agree, and the Secretary determines it is in the public interest, the Secretary may utilize the authority and direction of this Act to transfer to Lake Gulch lands in sections 17 and 13 that are in addition to those precise selected lands shown on the map cited herein, and which are not under formal application for transfer to a qualified unit of local government, upon transfer to the Secretary of additional offered lands acceptable to the Secretary or upon payment to the Secretary by Lake Gulch of cash equalization money amounting to the full appraised fair market value of any such additional lands. If any such additional lands are located in section 13 they may be transferred to Lake Gulch without survey based on such legal or other description as the Secretary determines appropriate as long as the Secretary determines that the boundaries of any adjacent lands not owned by Lake Gulch can be properly identified so as to avoid possible future boundary conflicts or disputes. If the Secretary determines surveys are necessary to convey any such additional lands to Lake Gulch, the costs of such surveys shall be paid by Lake Gulch but shall not be eligible for any adjustment in the value of such additional lands pursuant to section 206(f)(2) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (as amended by the Federal Land Exchange Facilitation Act of 1988) (43 U.S.C. 1716(f)(2)). (3) Prior to transferring out of public ownership pursuant to this Act or other authority of law any lands which are contiguous to North Clear Creek southeast of the City of Black Hawk, Colorado in the County of Gilpin, Colorado, the Secretary shall notify and consult with the County and City and afford such units of local government an opportunity to acquire or reserve pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 or other applicable law, such easements or rights-of-way parallel to North Clear Creek as may be necessary to serve public utility line or recreation path needs: Provided, however, That any survey or other costs associated with the acquisition or reservation of such easements or rights-of-way shall be paid for by the unit or units of local government concerned. SEC. 3. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EXCHANGE. (a) Equalization of Values.--(1) The values of the lands to be exchanged pursuant to this Act shall be equal as determined by the Secretary of the Interior utilizing nationally recognized appraisal standards, including, to the extent appropriate, the Uniform Standards for Federal Land Acquisition, the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, the provisions of section 206(d) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716(d)), and other applicable law. (2) In the event any cash equalization or land sale moneys are received by the United States pursuant to this Act, any such moneys shall be retained by the Secretary of the Interior and may be utilized by the Secretary until fully expended to purchase from willing sellers land or water rights, or a combination thereof, to augment wildlife habitat and protect and restore wetlands in the Bureau of Land Management's Blanca Wetlands, Alamosa County, Colorado.

The use of any water rights acquired pursuant to this section shall be limited to water that can be used or exchanged for water that can be used on the Blanca Wetlands. Any requirement or proposal to utilize facilities of the San Luis Valley Project, Closed Basin Diversion, in order to effectuate the use of any such water rights shall be subject to prior approval of the Rio Grande Water Conservation District. (b) Restrictions on Selected Lands.--(1) Conveyance of the selected lands to Lake Gulch pursuant to this Act shall be contingent upon Lake Gulch executing an agreement with the United States prior to such conveyance, the terms of which are acceptable to the Secretary of the Interior, and which-- (A) grant the United States a covenant that none of the selected lands, (which currently lie outside the legally approved gaming area) shall ever be used for purposes of gaming should the current legal gaming area ever be expanded by the State of Colorado; and (B) permanently hold the United States harmless for liability and indemnify the United States against all costs arising from any activities, operations (including the storing, handling, and dumping of hazardous materials or substances) or other acts conducted by Lake Gulch or its employees, agents, successors or assigns on the selected lands after their transfer to Lake Gulch: Provided, however, That nothing in this Act shall be construed as either diminishing or increasing any responsibility or liability of the United States based on the condition of the selected lands prior to or on the date of their transfer to Lake Gulch. (2) Conveyance of the selected lands to Lake Gulch pursuant to this Act shall be subject to the existing easement for Gilpin County Road 6.

Question: What is the first name of the person who released three instrumental albums, Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar, Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More, and The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar? Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1980, Zappa cut his ties with record distributor Phonogram after the label refused to release his song \\"I Don't Wanna Get Drafted\\". It was picked up by CBS Records and released on the Zappa label in the United States and Canada, and by the CBS label internationally.After spending much of 1980 on the road, Zappa released Tinsel Town Rebellion in 1981. It was the first release on his own Barking Pumpkin Records, and it contains songs taken from a 1979 tour, one studio track and material from the 1980 tours. The album is a mixture of complicated instrumentals and Zappa's use of sprechstimme (speaking song or voice)—a compositional technique utilized by such composers as Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg—showcasing some of the most accomplished bands Zappa ever had (mostly featuring drummer Vinnie Colaiuta). While some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, some of whom found them sexist, the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and \\"The Blue Light\\" have been described as a \\"hilarious critique of the willingness of the American people to believe anything\\". The album is also notable for the presence of guitarist Steve Vai, who joined Zappa's touring band in late 1980.The same year the double album You Are What You Is was released. Most of it was recorded in Zappa's brand new Utility Muffin Research Kitchen (UMRK) studios, which were located at his house, thereby giving him complete freedom in his work. The album included one complex instrumental, \\"Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear\\", but mainly consisted of rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics directed at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy. \\"Dumb All Over\\" is a tirade on religion, as is \\"Heavenly Bank Account\\", wherein Zappa rails against TV evangelists such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson for their purported influence on the U.S. administration as well as their use of religion as a means of raising money.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia? Nielsen is perhaps most closely associated outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In Symphony No. 2 (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).The title of Symphony No. 3, Sinfonia Espansiva (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the \\"outward growth of the mind's scope\\". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. Symphony No. 4, The Inextinguishable (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of timpani are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as \\"the life force, the unquenchable will to live\\".Also frequently performed is the Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In Symphony No. 6 (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony...","completion":"The full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia, is Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22).

England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Weardale is a dale, or valley, of the east side of the Pennines in County Durham, England. Large parts of Weardale fall within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) the second largest AONB in England and Wales. The upper valley is surrounded by high fells (up to O.D. at Burnhope Seat) and heather grouse moors. The River Wear flows through Weardale before reaching Bishop Auckland and then Durham, meeting the sea at Sunderland. - County Durham (locally ), occasionally Durhamshire, is a county in North East England. The county town is Durham, a cathedral city, whilst the largest settlement is Darlington. It borders Tyne and Wear to the north east, Northumberland to the north, Cumbria to the west and North Yorkshire to the south. Historically, the county included southern Tyne and Wear, including Gateshead and Sunderland. - Wearside is an area of North East England centred on the continuous urban area of Sunderland by the River Wear, and in the wider sense, including separate neighbouring settlements such as Seaham. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington. - The River Wear in North East England rises in the Pennines and flows eastwards, mostly through County Durham to the North Sea in the City of Sunderland.

This led to the discovery that the Earths crust was broken up into regions, or plates. Earthquakes happen most often along these plate boundaries. This was evidence that continents can move. The movements of the plates are called plate tectonics. The Earths crust is divided into plates. There are about a dozen large plates and several small ones.

Tanya looked thinner than Megan because","completion":"Tanya looked thinner than Megan because she had recently adopted a series of significant lifestyle changes, which have resulted in a notable transformation in her physical appearance, overall health, and self-confidence. Some of the factors contributing to Tanya's slimmed-down look in comparison to Megan include diet, exercise, stress management, and sleep quality. Firstly, Tanya has been focusing on improving her diet, with an emphasis on consuming nutrient-dense, whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. She has been mindful of portion sizes, ensuring that her caloric intake is appropriate for her height, weight, and activity level. Additionally, Tanya has limited her intake of high-calorie, low-nutrient foods such as processed snacks, sugary beverages, and fast food. This conscious shift in dietary habits has allowed Tanya to lose excess body fat, making her appear thinner than Megan who may not be adhering to a similar nutrition plan. Secondly, Tanya has incorporated regular exercise into her routine, participating in a combination of cardiovascular training, strength training, and flexibility exercises. Her cardio workouts, which include activities like running, swimming, or cycling, have not only helped her shed unwanted pounds but also improved her overall cardiovascular health. Meanwhile, her strength training routines have contributed to the development of lean muscle mass, which can further enhance her slim appearance. The added flexibility exercises, such as yoga or Pilates, have helped Tanya maintain proper posture and reduce muscle imbalances, both of which contribute to a leaner figure. Thirdly, Tanya has been working on managing stress levels by practicing mindful techniques like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or engaging in activities that bring her joy and relaxation. High-stress levels can cause the body to produce excess cortisol, which can lead to weight gain, particularly in the abdominal area. By keeping her stress levels in check, Tanya has minimized this risk and maintained a more slender silhouette than Megan, who may be experiencing higher levels of stress. Lastly, Tanya has prioritized improving her sleep quality by establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing pre-sleep routine, and ensuring her sleep environment is conducive to restful slumber. Adequate sleep is crucial for weight management and overall health as it allows the body to properly recover and rejuvenate, maintaining an optimal hormonal balance that can prevent weight gain. Megan may not be receiving enough quality sleep or may have sleep disturbances that are contributing to her weight status, making her appear less thin in comparison to Tanya. In summary, Tanya looked thinner than Megan because she has been dedicated to creating a healthier lifestyle by making smart dietary choices, engaging in regular exercise, managing stress effectively, and prioritizing sleep. These positive habits have allowed her to shed excess weight, build lean muscle mass, and maintain a more slender appearance than her friend Megan, who may not be making the same conscious efforts to promote her own well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Sridevi Kapoor (born Shree Amma Yanger Ayyapan; 13 August 1963 - 24 February 2018) was an Indian actress and film producer who starred in Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Malayalam, and Kannada films. Regarded as Indian cinema's biggest female superstar, she was the recipient of a National Film Award, two Filmfare Awards and three Filmfare Awards South. Sridevi ranked among the highest-paid actors in the 1980s and 1990s and is considered to be one of the most popular actresses of Indian cinema. Sridevi made her debut as child artiste with the 1967 Tamil film Kandan Karunai at the age of 4, and started her acting career in lead role as a child with M. A. Thirumugam's 1969 devotional Tamil film Thunaivan and continued to act as a child artist in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada films. Context: On 20 February 2018, Sridevi and her youngest daughter Khushi had flown to Al Jazirah Al Hamra in Ras al-Khaimah, United Arab Emirates, to attend the wedding of her nephew Mohit Marwah. She decided to spend a couple of days in Dubai to shop for eldest daughter Janhvi Kapoor's 21st birthday, after the wedding. Her husband Boney Kapoor was not present with them on the wedding day as he had to attend a meeting in Lucknow on 22 February. However he had already planned a surprise visit to his wife, with whom he spoke on the morning of 24 February, where she told him that \\"Papa (that's how Sridevi addressed Boney), I'm missing you.\\" According to Kapoor, he took a 15:30 flight to Dubai and reached Jumeirah Emirates Towers Hotel around 18:20 (Dubai time) in room 2201 where the actress was staying. She and Kapoor briefly met and chatted for half an-hour or so. Afterwards they decided to have dinner. Sridevi went to bathe and get dressed for dinner, while Kapoor waited in a living room. After 15-20 minutes, around 19:00, he called out the actress as they were getting late but was unable to get a response. Kapoor went to knock the bathroom door, which had not been locked from inside and sensed that something was wrong. He opened the door and found the actress completely immersed and unresponsive in the bathtub. It remains unclear whether Sridevi fell unconscious after or before the drowning. Sridevi was pronounced dead on 24 February 2018 at 19:00 GMT at her hotel room where her husband had found her. At first, it was announced by her brother in-law Sanjay Kapoor to the Indian media that the cause of death was a cardiac arrest, but the investigation to her death began early Sunday morning around 2:30, and the case was transferred to Dubai Public Prosecution by Dubai Police, where General Department of Forensic Evidence, Dubai revealed that the cause of death was \\"accidental drowning\\". The toxicology report later also revealed that traces of alcohol were found in her body, and water was found in her lungs. After rumors that news of her death was an Internet hoax, her brother-in-law, Sanjay Kapoor, confirmed that it was true. Her fans, co-stars and other Bollywood stars posted condolences on Twitter to mourn the death. After few days of police investigation, on 27 February, Sridevi's case was closed, and her body was flown back to Mumbai, India by her husband and her stepson, Arjun Kapoor, on a private jet belonging to Anil Ambani. Her funeral took place on 28 February, at the Vile Parle Seva Samaj Crematorium in Mumbai. Sridevi was cremated with state honours and also received a gun salute at her funeral.

I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields.

Anthony Howell acted as an emergency goalkeeper as Alfreton Town's two goalkeepers were out injured. Nicky Law's side were thrashed 5-1 in their replay against Lincoln City. Alfreton's request to sign a goalkeeper was turned down by the FA. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Alfreton Town's Emergency Goalkeeper Anthony Howell in 5-1 Loss Against Lincoln City Step 1: Begin with a brief introduction, focusing on the unusual situation of Anthony Howell acting as an emergency goalkeeper due to Alfreton Town's regular goalkeepers being injured. --- In a twist of fate for Alfreton Town Football Club, Anthony Howell, a midfielder, was forced to act as an emergency goalkeeper during their recent replay match against Lincoln City. With the team's two primary goalkeepers sidelined due to injuries, Howell stepped in to fill the crucial spot. Step 2: Explain and analyze the match outcome. --- The situation proved to be challenging for the non-league side, as they suffered a crushing 5-1 defeat at the hands of their opponents, Lincoln City, in the replay. The lack of experience in the goalkeeper position was evident throughout the game, with Howell's unfamiliarity and skillset imbalance contributing to Alfreton Town's heavy loss. Step 3: Detail the club's request to the FA and provide context. --- Prior to the match, Alfreton Town had approached the Football Association (FA) with a request to sign a specialist goalkeeper to fill in the void caused by the injuries sustained by their two regular keepers. Unfortunately for the team, their request was denied by the FA, leaving them with little choice but to put Howell in goal. Step 4: Highlight Alfreton Town manager Nicky Law's strategy for dealing with the situation. --- Despite the adverse conditions, Alfreton Town manager Nicky Law attempted to make the best of the situation by placing his trust in Howell to defend the goal. The team's strategy revolved around minimizing the impact of their goalkeeping weakness, while focusing on maintaining a strong offense to counterbalance the deficit. Step 5: End with a summary and potential implications for both the club and the FA process. --- In conclusion, Anthony Howell's emergency role as goalkeeper led to a difficult outcome for Alfreton Town, with the team falling to a 5-1 defeat against Lincoln City. The match has raised questions about the FA's decision to reject their request for a goalkeeper signing and the need for more flexible regulations in such situations. Additionally, this challenging experience is likely to serve as a learning opportunity for both the team as they prepare for future matches and the FA as they refine their processes to better accommodate the unexpected hurdles faced by football clubs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let me explain the reasoning behind this choice: Step 1: Understanding the question The question is asking what you are covered with when you are taking a bath. This means we are looking for a condition or substance that typically covers a person during a bath. Step 2: Eliminating irrelevant or incorrect options a. Cleanness - This refers to a state of being clean, which may be achieved after taking a bath, but it's not something that physically covers you while you're bathing. b. Exfoliation - This is a process that can be performed during a bath (e.g., using a scrub or body brush), but it is not something that inherently covers you as you bathe. c. Use water - While it is true that water is a necessary component of taking a bath, the option \\"use water\\" does not describe something that covers you during a bath. d. Wetness - This is a direct result of being in contact with water, so it is a plausible option. e. Rash - This refers to a skin reaction, which wouldn't typically occur during a bath, unless one is dealing with an allergic reaction to a product used during bathing. However, it is not inherent to the bathing process. Step 3: Selecting the correct option Based on the elimination of other options and the determination that \\"wetness\\" is directly related to being in contact with water during a bath, I can confidently conclude that the correct choice is \\"wetness\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, \\"I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\\" His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as \\"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\\". In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as \\"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\\". Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sound's Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as \\"aggressively bisexual in appeal\\". Brett Farmer places the \\"orgasmic gyrations\\" of the title dance sequence in Jailhouse Rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a \\"spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image\\". In the analysis of Yvonne Tasker, \\"Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display.\\"Reinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various Hollywood stars and starlets, from Natalie Wood in the 1950s to Connie Stevens and Ann-Margret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s.
