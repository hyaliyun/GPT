In this post-credits scene, you can see Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders making uncredited cameo appearances as their respective characters, Nick Fury and Maria Hill, who were the former director and deputy director of S.H.I.E.L.D. The post-credits scene takes place after the main events of the film, where Thanos has successfully wiped out half of the universe's population using the Infinity Gauntlet. This scene shows the immediate aftermath of the snap, where people on Earth begin to disintegrate. As Maria Hill and Nick Fury witness this, they realize the severity of the situation they are in. In a desperate attempt to call for help, Nick Fury uses a modified pager to send a message just before he disintegrates. The pager falls to the ground and continues to send the message. The screen on the pager then displays the star symbol associated with Carol Danvers, also known as Captain Marvel. This end-credit scene serves as a setup for the introduction of Captain Marvel in the subsequent film and hints at her involvement in the events of Avengers: Endgame. In summary, there is indeed an end-credit scene in Avengers: Infinity War, which features Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders as their characters Nick Fury and Maria Hill, connecting the events of the film to the upcoming Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame movies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Q:Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered.

She received her B.A. from St. Olaf College in 1918 and taught one year of high school before she became an instructor at Augustana College in 1921–22. She studied at the University of Minnesota in 1922–24, then taught at Bethany College from 1925 to 1926. Larson received her Ph.D. from Columbia University and The Wheat Market and the Farmer in Minnesota, 1858–1900 in 1926. She then taught at Southern Illinois University in 1926–28 before she became a research associate at the Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration in 1928. Together with N. S. B. Gras, she wrote Jay Cooke, Private Banker in 1936 and she was the editor of the Bulletin of the Business Historical Society in 1938.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Another effective way to help your child obey is by praising or rewarding them when they are behaving appropriately. When you see your daughter eating her food instead of throwing it, say, “Mindy, I love how you are eating and using good table manners. Keep that up and you’ll earn your favorite dessert!” Experts believe positive reinforcement such as praise and rewards is much more effective than a consequence. Rather than lecturing or withholding privileges when undesirable behavior occurs, they suggest ignoring it and only giving your attention when your child is behaving appropriately. The goal is to get the child to do more positive behaviors to get more attention. This encourages the child to behave well, leaving less opportunity for misbehavior. For example, the parent might ignore it when their child throws food but lay on the praise when they eat as they should. If your child knows and understands what’s expected of them, they are less likely to break the rules. Sit down with your child and explain your family’s rules. Keep the rules clear, simple, and consistent. Also, make them aware of any consequences, such as if rules are broken, gaining points on a chart. When disciplining the child, discuss the rule, its consequence, and how the child can do better. For instance, your rules might sound like, \\"Walk indoors. No running!\\" \\"Complete homework before playtime,\\" or \\"Clear away your area after an activity, such as homework or arts and crafts.\\" As an example, you might have a rule to treat others with respect. If your child throws a tantrum, you could talk to them about how it's disrespectful for them to behave that way. Then give them an example of how they could express their emotions differently. Post the rules in plain sight, so your child is constantly reminded of how they should behave. Try pinning them to the wall near your points chart (or jar), posting them on the fridge, or hanging a sign up on your kitchen door. It's important that your child learn to follow rules even when no one is watching. Resist the urge to micromanage the child's behavior. For example, you could have the child check off positive behaviors, such as doing their homework and cleaning up after themselves. If you have multiple children, teach them to help each other follow the rules, rather than to tattle. For example, if one child notices that the other is running in the house, she could say, \\"Hey, we're supposed to walk when we're in the house. You could get hurt or break something.\\" Maintain the same rules and the same consequences within your household to help your child establish norms of behavior. That way, they know what to do, and what will happen if they don’t comply. Try to be consistent across contexts and caregivers. For instance, the child shouldn’t be able to break the rules simply because friends are visiting. Similarly, mom shouldn’t have one set of rules while dad has another. You should also have the same expectations for your child even when you are tired. Don't let them use your exhaustion as a free pass to misbehave. In addition, your rules should be consistent between your children—one child shouldn't be allowed to break rules and not have consequences enforced. When other children visit your home, they should follow the same rules as your children. Ask your child to explain the rules to their friends or relatives when they get to your home, as this will help reinforce the child's understanding of the rules. Some kids have bucketfuls of energy and they get into trouble because they don’t know how to effectively channel it. Give your child plenty of opportunities to move their bodies and work their minds. They’ll be less likely to misbehave, as a result. Let your child go outside to burn off energy or dedicate a special place inside where they can play. Try keeping fun coloring books, puzzles, and games nearby to keep them preoccupied. Be realistic when it comes to your child. Don’t expect an energetic child to sit quietly for hours at a time. Observe how your child functions and set up parameters that increase their odds of being obedient.","completion":"This article suggests that praising and rewarding good behavior, setting clear and consistent rules, and giving children opportunities to burn off energy can help them obey and behave well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Known by his alias, \\"The Phantom,\\" he lives an extravagant lifestyle, keeping a low profile. However, John grows disillusioned with his career path and the impact it has on the world's hidden treasures. One day, while reluctantly delivering a stolen Aztec artefact to a shady collector, John unwittingly gets pulled into an ancient prophecy. The artefact holds a powerful secret that, if unlocked, could change the course of human history. The secret lies deep within the Amazon rainforest, known as the heart of Amazonia. Act 2: Journey to the Heart Realizing the weight of responsibility, John decides to return the artefact to its rightful place. He reaches out to his only confidant, Maddy, a brilliant anthropologist and amateur historian. With her knowledge of Aztec culture and history, she becomes the keys to solving the mysterious prophecy. The two embark on a perilous journey to the Amazon rainforest, using Maddy's extensive knowledge to track the artefact's origins. Along their way, they face dangerous challenges, including wild animals, treacherous terrain, and wrathful spirits guarding the artefact. Also, they are being pursued by a dangerous crime syndicate and a corrupt government agency who are just as eager to harness the artefact's hidden powers—fame, fortune, and power. Act 3: The Amazon Unleashed As they venture deeper into the heart of Amazonia, John begins to understand the magnificence and untamed beauty of the jungle. There, they meet Imara, a member of a lost tribe that was the original keeper of the artefact. Imara shares her tribe's knowledge of the artefact and the prophecy, which foretells the return of the spirit of the Amazon and the chance to unleash its full power. As they continue to unravel the prophecy's mystery, the group finds themselves immersed in fierce battles against the human enemies pursuing the artefact and the powerful spirits that defend it. The Amazon rainforest begins to reveal its mystical and magical qualities, involving John, Maddy, and Imara in a quest far greater than they ever imagined. Act 4: The Final Battle In the heart of the Amazon, the group discovers the temple where the artefact must be returned. With time running out, they face off against the syndicate and corrupt agency now joined forces to claim the artefact's power. The epic battle ensues, involving the forces of nature, powerful spirits, and the extraordinary skills and determination of John, Maddy, and Imara. As the climactic fight intensifies, the spirit of the Amazon awakens, revealing its true form as an ancient guardian that can reshape the fate of the world. With the spirit's guidance, John manages to return the artefact to its rightful place, unleashing the hidden power that restores harmony to Amazonia and the world. Epilogue: A New Beginning With the task completed, the spirit of the Amazon grants John, Maddy, and Imara its gratitude and blessings. Recognizing their selfless act, the once-rich Phantom decides to devote the rest of his life to preserving the world's cultural treasures and working alongside Maddy and Imara to protect Earth's natural wonders. The adventure leaves a deep impact on their lives, rediscovering their true identities and purpose. John, Maddy, and Imara decide to remain friends, vowing to protect the world's mysteries and their newfound bonds with the spiritual guardians that have given them a second chance.

Erica MacKinnon and Bill Sneed have lived all over the world and spent a couple of years in a rented Los Angeles duplex considering whether to move to Miami or Seattle, Oakland or Portland, Maine. Instead, nearly a year ago, the business and life partners packed up and headed to Detroit, which they had visited months earlier in search of computer coders for their small commercial digital-animation company. “We spent three days in Detroit, and we just fell in love with the city,” said MacKinnon, 38. “We couldn’t believe the mix of the location and the water and the people.” They also appreciated the expansive 90-year-old brick homes priced below most nondescript L.A. bungalows. Those homes, in Detroit neighborhoods filled with 4,000- to 7,000-square-foot beauties, are in hot demand, both by newcomers to Michigan and Detroit suburbanites. New residents have come to Detroit from Paris, Panama, New York, Washington and San Francisco, lured to the city by its creative vibe, sense of urban adventure and affordable homes — even when they buy abodes with a butler’s pantry and third-floor servants’ quarters. [Detroit tries unconventional approach to restoring its housing market] Buyers think: “Why not trade a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan and have an 8,800-square-foot mansion in Detroit for half of that?” said Kenan Bakirci, an agent for Max Broock who for almost 20 years has focused on Palmer Woods and Sherwood Forest, two historic neighborhoods in north-central Detroit. In a city where homes still can cost less than a beat-up Chevrolet, demand has revved up for luxury residences that look as if a Bentley or vintage Cadillac belongs in their garages. These high-end homes in the city’s historic neighborhoods frequently attract multiple offers and often sell above the listing price, real estate agents say. Detroit is a city of empty lots and faded or abandoned homes, and the poverty rate is more than twice the national average. Many blue-collar workers live in suburban bungalows, and executives own sprawling homes in the suburban cities of Grosse Pointe or Bloomfield Hills. Many people are not aware of Detroit’s mansion districts, where auto barons and wealthy business owners spared no expense to build homes from 1900 to 1929. Homes in the Palmer Woods neighborhood have living rooms large enough to seat 110 at a jazz concert. Some come with carriage houses and basement bars big enough for 50 guests. “Homes that are move-in ready get heated action — multiple offers within the first week,” said Ryan Cooley, who leads O’Connor Realty and landed Sneed and MacKinnon their home. Some receive eight or more offers, he said. In September, MacKinnon and Sneed moved into a stately 1923 brick home with room for an art studio for Sneed, guest rooms for visits by nieces and nephews, and a home office for their Yankee Peddler animation and design company. They beat out several other offers for the home in Indian Village, one of the half-dozen Detroit neighborhoods where mansions and luxury homes or condominiums are found. [Why this 24-year-old is buying up abandoned homes in Detroit] Betty J. Warmack has sold homes in Detroit, mainly in Indian Village, for more than 30 years and says she has never seen this much demand and multiple offers. “I sold an attorney from New York a house, a psychiatrist from New York a house and a blogger” from Europe bought in Indian Village, a neighborhood on Detroit’s east side that is on the National Historic Register, she said. “It’s quite a comeback.” Homes that four years ago rarely sold for more than 200,000 fetch twice that amount if they are ready for their new owners to move in, real estate agents say. About 15 homes sold for 500,000 or more last year through October, more than double the seven high-end sales for the same period in 2014, according to Realcomp, which runs the city’s multiple-listing service. A few carry price tags of more than 1 million, a rarefied amount that only one Detroit home has sold for since 2006. That home, the Alfred J. Fisher mansion in Palmer Woods, went for 1.6 million in 2014 — more than homes in the tony suburbs fetched that year, according to Realcomp. It sold again last year, for 1.55 million to General Motors President Daniel Ammann and his wife, Pernilla, a partner in a New York advertising agency. (A high-profile mansion once owned by Motown Records founder Berry Gordy Jr. in the Boston-Edison neighborhood was taken off the market in July.) Austin Black II, a broker and owner of City Living Detroit, says he is amazed at how many executives have decided that it’s time to live in the city of Detroit, because for years they would house-hunt only in the nicer suburbs, where there were 217 million-dollar homes that sold in 2014 and 229 through October, Realcomp data shows. Inventory in the city has been low for months, Black said, with only a handful of homes for sale in prime neighborhoods. It’s gotten so tight, he said, that he has gone door to door in a few neighborhoods seeking people who are ready to put their homes up for sale. “I have 20 or so clients who are ready and able to purchase a home right now. Inventory doesn’t exist,” Black said. [Michael Bolton is trying to save Detroit. Yes, that Michael Bolton.] Demand in the mansion districts is so high and inventory so low, Black and others say, that some buyers are opting for adjoining neighborhoods, with stately but less elegant homes. The rising home prices may begin to persuade current homeowners to cash in their mansions and elegant abodes, some of which could fetch record or near record prices. But “because the market is doing so well lately, some sellers get aggressive with pricing” and those homes sell much slower, Black said. To many, the influx of new residents is one of several signs that Detroit may finally be on a roll. Quicken Loans Chairman Dan Gilbert, a Detroit native, is one of the city’s largest commercial landowners, purchasing more than 80 properties downtown for 2.2 billion. And the Kresge and Skillman foundations, JPMorgan Chase and others have committed millions of dollars to revitalization. Still, those efforts are not enough to jump-start the real estate market and undo the prolonged structural decline of Detroit’s housing stock. So city officials have introduced efforts to either raze or auction abandoned houses. And a community bank is experimenting with a program to renovate vacant houses and, if necessary, absorb a loss to sell them to buyers who may not qualify for traditional loans. Detroit has neighborhoods that have been ravaged by years of neglect and middle-class flight. It’s a city where dozens of homes are purchased at auction for as little as 1,000 to 7,000. That helps explain why in Detroit and three adjoining cities, homes sold for a median price of 20,158 through October of last year, which is up from the 15,011 median in 2014 and more than double the median price of 9,751 in 2012, according to Realcomp. Despite an influx of entrepreneurs, artists and hipsters, Detroit’s population fell from 951,000 in 2000 to about 680,250 in 2014. So new residents are moving into a city full of contrasts: Population and employment bases­ have declined for decades; crime and insurance for home and auto are high. Yet new restaurants and art galleries are opening, and high-end shops are starting to show up from New York, Germany and elsewhere. [For downtrodden Detroit, hopes of revitalization ride streetcar rails] Demand for larger luxurious homes may be an indication of Detroit’s comeback; buying has heated up since the city filed for bankruptcy in July 2013 (it emerged about 17 months later). Tech start-ups and boutiques have opened, and investors from China and Europe started buying commercial properties or blocks of homes, many in marginal neighborhoods. Sneed and MacKinnon said they knew that the market was competitive and that they wanted a home in Indian Village, citing its architectural beauty and proximity to the Detroit River and Belle Isle, a 985-acre island park. So they moved to Detroit in frigid February and rented a loft near downtown. “I wanted . . . to be ready when spring hit for any houses on the market,” MacKinnon said. “We wanted a beautiful, craftsman, old historic home.” They looked at eight homes and then saw the one they bought: a 4,878-square-foot property on a double lot filled this past summer with peonies, hostas and wind chimes. The Georgian revival has a big homey kitchen and a beautiful fireplace in the living room, four bedrooms on the second floor, and a third-floor office and fifth bedroom. It was spacious without being grand and just felt right from the moment they walked in, MacKinnon said. So they were aggressive and offered 430,000 — well above the 395,000 asking price. The owner accepted in two days. They have learned about their home’s history from him: It was built in 1923 at a cost of 12,750 for W.J. Davidson, who worked in General Motors’ executive offices, and was said to be a wedding present. Despite being self-employed, Sneed and MacKinnon had pre-qualified for a larger loan, so they landed a mortgage quickly using a local lender. Home insurance was a bit trickier, but after shopping around, they are satisfied with the policy’s 2,400 annual premium. Their new home requires some improvements — paint and hardwood floors, electrical and fire- and security-alarm upgrades — but basically it was ready for them to move in, except for cleaning out items left in the basement and a few small repairs. “We have had personal invites to join Thanksgiving parties and 100-year house parties, which is something that never happened in Los Angeles. Back there we never knew our neighbors,” MacKinnon said. [JPMorgan is betting 100 million on Detroit. Can it leverage a lot more?] Family members have come for visits, including MacKinnon’s mother and sister, who have shown up three times, she said. Other guests say they were misinformed about Detroit, from negative headlines, and appreciated the food culture, parks and how easy it is to get downtown. For some higher-priced deals, buyers need to put down more cash because their homes may not appraise at the prices they are paying, some agents said. Some offer all-cash purchases — an easy choice for New Yorkers who sell their 3 million apartment and buy a 500,000 mansion. About 40 percent of high-end purchases are all-cash sales, Cooley estimates. Nationwide, 27 percent of housing purchases were all cash in November, often by investors, according to the National Association of Realtors. Valrie Honablue, a psychiatrist who grew up in Panama, paid cash for her first Detroit home in 2010. She was living in Atlanta when she read about Motown’s real estate opportunities. “The prices are so low; something is wrong,” she said. So she drove to the city to see for herself. She bought one in Indian Village. Shortly after moving to Detroit, she left for “the job of a lifetime” but bounced back within two years, drawn by “the people and the possibilities” and the beautiful homes. Her second Detroit home had been vacant for 17 years when she bought it in June 2014. She got it for a bargain price but expects to spend five or six years renovating it, partly to spread out the improvement costs. Warmack, her agent, calls her “the pied piper of Detroit.” A dozen people have followed her to the city and bought homes. Many who move to Detroit bring their jobs or businesses with them. Sneed and MacKinnon are among them. “We just couldn’t get ahead” in Los Angeles, Sneed said. Now after nearly a year in Detroit, they operate their Yankee Peddler animation company from a loft, own a huge home with oversize gardens, and have made new friends who clue them into culture, festivals, dog parks and more. “We know we’re taking a gamble. . . . But there’s a passion here,” Sneed said. They have turned into Detroit boosters and are eager to celebrate their home’s 100th birthday in seven years. Said MacKinnon: “I can’t believe I live on this street. It blows me away how beautiful these streets are.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Detroit's historic neighborhoods, with 4,000 to 7,000sq ft houses, are attracting multiple offers from buyers trading smaller apartments in cities like New York and San Francisco to buy mansions for a fraction of the price.

Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction. Have you ever seen a sign that says, slippery when wet? This too has to do with friction.

Given the below context: The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\".

Answer the questions at the end based on the text. Lebanon, officially known as the Lebanese Republic, is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity. At just 10,452 km (4,036 sq. mi.), it is the smallest recognized country on the entire mainland Asian continent. The earliest evidence of civilization in Lebanon dates back more than seven thousand years, predating recorded history. Lebanon was the home of the Canaanites/Phoenicians and their kingdoms, a maritime culture that flourished for over a thousand years (c. 1550–539 BC). In 64 BC, the region came under the rule of the Roman Empire, and eventually became one of the Empire's leading centers of Christianity. In the Mount Lebanon range a monastic tradition known as the Maronite Church was established. As the Arab Muslims conquered the region, the Maronites held onto their religion and identity. However, a new religious group, the Druze, established themselves in Mount Lebanon as well, generating a religious divide that has lasted for centuries. During the Crusades, the Maronites re-established contact with the Roman Catholic Church and asserted their communion with Rome. The ties they established with the Latins have influenced the region into the modern era. 1. About how long ago was the first civilization in Lebanon? 2. Was this before recorded history? 3.

Question: Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend took a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase? Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different.

Terrill hesitated for a moment, his eyes darting back and forth between the beautiful woman and the door. He knew they were running out of time, but he couldn't bear the thought of leaving her behind. Step 2: Show the character's internal struggle I chose to illustrate Terrill's dilemma, torn between the woman he cares about and the impending danger outside.

As he felt a pang of guilt, he carefully placed a gentle kiss on her forehead, and whispered a soft promise to return. Step 3: Have the character make a decision while demonstrating his feelings for the woman This is crucial in showing Terrill's attachment to the woman and the sacrifice he is making by leaving her side. It foreshadows the possibility of him coming back for her later in the story. Steeling himself, Terrill hurried towards the door, unbolted the lock, and swung it open. A man in a tattered coat, desperate and sweating, stood before him. \\"They're coming, Terrill, we have to get out of here now,\\" he urged, glancing nervously down the dark hallway.

This also suggests that there is a broader conflict occurring outside the immediate setting. Nodding, Terrill reluctantly followed his companion down the hallway. He glimpsed back one last time, only to see that she had never looked so beautiful even with her eyes growing dim. He prayed that he'd be able to save her before it was too late.

And David said, 'Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?'\\" This verse comes from 1 Samuel, a book in the Old Testament of the Bible. The passage takes place during the reign of King Saul, the first king of Israel, and narrates a dialogue between David and King Saul's servants. In this situation, David, who later becomes the second king of Israel and one of its most notable figures, is reacting to the proposal of becoming Saul's son-in-law. The words spoken by Saul's servants suggest that David is to be married to one of King Saul's daughters in recognition of his heroism and victories against the Philistines. Upon hearing this proposal, David expresses his thoughts and asks the servants if they think it is a minor matter for him to become the king's son-in-law. He emphasizes that he is a poor man, perhaps referring to his humble origins or his lack of wealth at the time. Additionally, David describes himself as being lightly esteemed, meaning he may not hold a high social status or be highly valued by others in that moment. David's response indicates that he is not sure he is worthy of such an elevated position, despite his heroic deeds. This verse highlights David's humility and his awareness of the great responsibility that comes from becoming part of a royal family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I know that the answer to the question \\"Which of the following musical traits did not become more common during the Romantic era: chromatic, tonally colorful, or codified?\\" is in \\"The music of the Romantic era, from roughly the first decade of the 19th century to the early 20th century, was characterized by increased attention to an extended melodic line, as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling romanticism in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like nocturnes, fantasias, and preludes being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized. The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing. The art song (or Lied) came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of grand opera, ultimately transcended by Richard Wagner's Ring cycle.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","completion":"'Codified'. During the Romantic era, music became more chromatic, tonally colorful, and dissonant, meaning it strayed from the fixed, established (or codified) norms that characterized the Classical era. This period of music transitioned away from the codified forms, and moved towards more free-form pieces such as nocturnes, fantasias, and preludes, where the conventional exposition and development of themes were often disregarded or minimized. Thus, while chromaticism and tonal color became more common, within their complex and rich harmonies, and emotional expressivity, the codified structures didn't become more common but were rather seen as less prominent in the Romantic era musical composition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Although I love this movie, I can barely watch it, it is so real. So, I put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers. I remembered it vividly, but just wanted to see if I could find something I hadn't seen before........I didn't: that's because it's so real to me. Another \\"user\\" wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary. I'm all for that ! It's absolutely obvious that most of these people who've made comments about \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" may not have been born when it was released. They are mentioning other movies Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman have appeared in, at a later time. I'll be just as ruinously frank: I am 82-years-old. If you're familiar with some of my other comments, you'll be aware that I was a professional female-impersonator for 60 of those years, and also have appeared in film - you'd never recognize me, even if you were familiar with my night-club persona. Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this film ? YOU BET I DO !!.... ....and am not the least bit ashamed. If you haven't run-into some of them, it's your loss - but, there's a huge chance you have, but just didn't know it. So many moms, dads, sons and daughters could surprise you. It should be no secret MANY actors/actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of \\"Midnight Cowboy\\". Who is to judge ? I can name several, current BIG-TIME stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities, and weren't the least bit damaged by their time spent there. I make no judgment, because these are humans, just as we all are - love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility: you name the attributes, they are all there, no matter what the package looks like. The \\"trivia\\" about Hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of \\"Ratzo\\" is a gem - he can be seen driving his auto all around Los Angeles - how do you think he gets his input? I can also name lots of male-stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money. Although the nightclub I last worked in for 26 years was world-famous and legit, I can also name some HUGE stars that had to be constantly chased out our back-street, looking to make a pick-up. This should be no surprise today, although it's definitely action in Hollywood and other cities, large and small. Wake-up and smell the roses. They smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue. Some of the \\"users\\" thought \\"Joe Buck\\" had been molested by his grandma. Although I saw him in her bed with a boyfriend, I didn't find any incidence of that. Believe-it-or-not, kids haven't ALWAYS had their own rooms - because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going-on in the master-bedroom. Whose business? Hoffman may have begged for change on the streets, but some of the \\"users\\" point-out that Jon Voight was not a major star for the filming of \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" - his actual salary would surprise you. I think he was robbed ! No one can doubt the clarity he put into his role, nor that it MADE him a star for such great work as \\"Deliverance\\". He defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it: few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie. The end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open, but society has always been hip. I also did not find any homosexuality between \\"Ratzo\\" and \\"Joe\\" - they were clearly opposites, unappealing to one another. They found a much purely higher relationship - true friendship. If you didn't understand that at the end of the movie, then you've wasted your time. \\"Joe's\\" bewilderment, but unashamed devotion was apparent. Yes, Voight deserved an Oscar for this role - one that John Wayne could never pull-off, and he was as handsome in his youth. Hoffman is Hoffman - you expect fireworks. He gave them superbly. Wayne got his Oscar. Every character in this film was beautifully defined - if you don't think they are still around, you are mistaken. \\"The party\\" ? - attend some of the \\"raves\\" younger people attend.....if you can get in. Look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs - you'll see every outrageous personality. Brenda Viccaro was the epitome of society's sleek women who have to get down to the nitty-gritty at times. If you were shocked by her brilliant acting, thinking \\"this isn't real\\", look at today's \\"ladies\\" who live on the brink of disrepute....and are admired for it. The brutality \\"Joe\\" displayed in robbing the old guy, unfortunately, is also a part of life. You don't have to condone it, but it's not too much different than any violence. \\"Joe\\" pointedly named his purpose - in that situation, I'd have handed-over the money quicker than he asked for it. That's one of the scenes that makes this movie a break-through, one which I do not watch. I get heartbroken for both..... John Schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eye-opener- Waldo Salt didn't write from clairvoyance. Anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history, and should be proud for the honesty of it. Perhaps \\"only in America\\" can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations, while other movie-makers make no compunction in presenting it to the public.

Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields.

His earliest and strongest musical influence was Django Reinhardt, the gypsy guitarist. Byrd was best known for his association with Brazilian music, especially bossa nova. In 1962, Byrd collaborated with Stan Getz on the album \\"Jazz Samba\\", a recording which brought bossa nova into the mainstream of North American music. - Bossa nova is a genre of Brazilian music, which developed and was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s and is today one of the best-known Brazilian music genres abroad. The phrase \\"bossa nova\\" means literally \\"new trend\\". A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following in the 1960s, initially among young musicians and college students. - Stanley \\"Stan\\" Getz (February 2, 1927 June 6, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as \\"The Sound\\" because of his warm, lyrical tone, his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman's big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as \\"one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists\\". Getz went on to perform in bebop and cool jazz groups, but is perhaps best known for popularizing bossa nova with the worldwide hit single \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" (1964) performed with Astrud Gilberto, and for his work done under the influence of João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim. - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - Jazz Samba is a bossa nova album by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd released by Verve Records in 1962. \\"Jazz Samba\\" signaled the beginning of the bossa nova craze in America.

Lees worked as a newspaper journalist in his native Canada before moving to the United States, where he was a music critic and lyricist. His lyrics for Antonio Carlos Jobim's \\"Corcovado\\" (released as \\"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\\"), have been recorded by such notable singers as Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Queen Latifah, and Diana Krall. Lees married his wife Janet in 1971. - \\"Desafinado\\", a Portuguese word (usually rendered into English as \\"Out of Tune\\", or as \\"Off Key\\"), is the title of a bossa nova song composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim with lyrics (in Portuguese) by Newton Mendonça. The English language lyrics were written by Jon Hendricks and \\"Jessie Cavanaugh\\" (a pseudonym used by The Richmond Organisation). Another English lyric, more closely based on the original Portuguese lyric (but not a translation) was written by Gene Lees, and appears on some recordings as well. The version by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd (from the album \\"Jazz Samba\\") was a major hit in 1962, reaching number 15 and number 4 on \\"Billboard\\"s pop and easy-listening charts, respectively; their definitive rendering also reached number 11 in the UK, while Ella Fitzgerald's version made number 38.

It was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner, who is still the magazine's publisher, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine shifted focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. In recent years, it has resumed its traditional mix of content. - Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer often referred to as the First Lady of Song, Queen of Jazz and Lady Ella. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a \\"horn-like\\" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing. - Antônio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim (January 25, 1927December 8, 1994), also known as Tom Jobim, was a Brazilian composer, pianist, songwriter, arranger and singer. He was a primary force behind the creation of the bossa nova style, and his songs have been performed by many singers and instrumentalists within Brazil and internationally. - Jon Hendricks (born September 16, 1921) is an American jazz lyricist and singer. He is considered one of the originators of vocalese, which adds lyrics to existing instrumental songs and replaces many instruments with vocalists (such as the big-band arrangements of Duke Ellington and Count Basie).

James Palotta slammed Benatia, calling him poisonous and a liar. Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Mehdi Benatia's Controversial £20M Sale to Bayern Munich: A turmoil in the Football World\\" The world of football was rocked when it became known that 27-year-old football star, Mehdi Benatia, was sold to Bayern Munich for £20 million. The transfer drew wide attention not just for the significant sum involved, but for the controversy and subsequent war of words that ensued between Benatia and his former club, AS Roma. Firstly, it is important to address the aspect of financial transaction involved in the deal. Benatia was sold to Bayern Munich for a staggering amount of £20 million. In the high-stakes world of football, such transactions are common. However, what makes this deal stand out is the claim by Mehdi Benatia that he was 'forced out' of Roma as the club needed the money. Benatia, an established central defender, was only 27 at the time - an age considered as being in the prime for a footballer. The fact that the Moroccan international claimed that he was forced out of the club raised eyebrows. To put it into context, it's as if a valuable piece of an orchestra has been removed, not because it was out of tune, but because there is more financial value in selling it. This brings up questions on whether the integrity of the sport is being compromised for financial gains. Moving on from the financial aspect, it is also necessary to delve into the repercussions that this particular transfer had on personal relationships and reputations within the club. James Palotta, AS Roma President, had strong words for Benatia following the transfer. He slammed the footballer calling him 'poisonous' and a 'liar'. Clearly, this sale didn't just have a financial impact, but resulted in a personal feud between the club administration and the player. These tags, 'poisonous' and 'liar', attached to Benatia by Palotta, painted a very negative image of the player. They painted a picture of a footballer who was disruptive and dishonest – two characteristics which are not associated with professional sportspersons. In conclusion, the sale of Mehdi Benatia to Bayern Munich was more than just a regular transfer. It was a saga filled with accusations, controversies and a hefty financial transaction. It left a mark on the reputation of the player, stirred the integrity of the sport, and created a ripple in the football community, which still resonates. The transfer is a reminder of the complex relationships, financial factors and personal egos that are at play in the world of professional football."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the difference between earlier strips and these strips? Context: Shorter, black-and-white daily strips began to appear early in the 20th century, and became established in newspapers after the success in 1907 of Bud Fisher's Mutt and Jeff. Humour strips predominated at first, and in the 1920s and 1930s strips with continuing stories in genres such as adventure and drama also became popular. Thin periodicals called comic books appeared in the 1930s, at first reprinting newspaper comic strips; by the end of the decade, original content began to dominate. The success in 1938 of Action Comics and its lead hero Superman marked the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books, in which the superhero genre was prominent. Answer:","completion":"The difference between earlier strips and these strips is that the earlier strips were shorter, black-and-white daily strips that predominantly focused on humor.

Please answer the following question: Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes.

Choices: - ground - sand box - michigan - warm bed - warm place The rationale to choose \\"sand box\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"A cat would prefer to relieve itself in a sandbox. Cats have a natural instinct to bury their waste, making the sandbox the most suitable option amongst the given choices. The rationale for choosing \\"sandbox\\" is as follows: 1. Ground: While cats may occasionally relieve themselves on the ground, especially if they are outdoors and no suitable substrate is available, it is not their preferred choice. 2. Sandbox: Cats have a natural preference for a soft, granular substrate like sand, which allows them to easily dig a small hole to bury their waste. This helps them keep their environment clean and odor-free, as well as minimizing the risk of attracting predators or other threats. Therefore, a sandbox makes an ideal place for a cat to relieve itself. 3. Michigan: This is not a suitable answer as Michigan is a U.S. state and does not describe a specific environment where a cat could relieve itself. 4. Warm bed: Cats are unlikely to relieve themselves in a warm bed as they are instinctively clean animals and do not want to soil their sleeping area. 5. Warm place: While cats do enjoy spending time in warm, comfortable spots, they will not usually choose to relieve themselves in such areas, as they typically seek to keep their living space clean. In summary, a sandbox is the best choice among the given options for a cat to relieve itself, as it provides a suitable environment that aligns with their natural instincts to bury their waste and maintain a clean living space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the popular mind, the history of Hong Kong, long the entryway to China for Westerners, begins in 1841 with the British occupation of the territory. However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine. After reading the above, is \\"The Portuguese\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who were the first Europeans to control the greatest port in the East?\\"?","completion":"Yes, \\"The Portuguese\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"Who were the first Europeans to control the greatest port in the East?\\" based on the information provided.

Yes or no? Answer: There have also been three authors who wrote one book each, Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham), Sebastian Faulks and Jeffery Deaver . Question: who did james bond work for Answer:","completion":"James Bond, the famous literary character created by Ian Fleming, works for the British Secret Service, specifically the \\"00\\" branch. The iconic secret agent, Agent 007, has been the protagonist in numerous books, movies, and other media since his debut in the 1953 novel, \\"Casino Royale.\\" The character's employment under the British Secret Service is a central aspect of his identity and forms the basis for many of the plotlines in the series. The British Secret Service, also known as MI6 (Military Intelligence, Section 6), is a governmental agency responsible for conducting intelligence and espionage operations in foreign nations. The fictional \\"00\\" section, of which Bond is a part, consists of elite agents with a unique license to kill, enabling them to execute their missions with skill and precision. As for the three authors mentioned in the question - Kingsley Amis (writing under the pseudonym Robert Markham), Sebastian Faulks, and Jeffery Deaver - they have indeed written James Bond novels, continuing the character's literary legacy after Fleming's death in 1964. Each author brought their distinct style and interpretation of the famous secret agent, further enriching the world of James Bond and his thrilling adventures fighting criminal masterminds and global conspiracies. Throughout the series, James Bond works closely with his superiors, particularly M, the head of MI6, and other notable characters like Miss Moneypenny and Q, who provide him with cutting-edge gadgets and expert assistance. Bond's employment by MI6 often puts him in dangerous situations, requiring him to travel to exotic locations, infiltrate criminal organizations, and protect the interests and security of the United Kingdom. In conclusion, the famed literary character James Bond works for the British Secret Service (MI6), serving as a globetrotting \\"00\\" agent tasked with undertaking high-risk espionage missions for the nation's security. The character's steadfast commitment to his work and extraordinary exploits have made him one of the most popular figures in spy fiction, with his adventures being chronicled not only by creator Ian Fleming but also by various authors like Kingsley Amis, Sebastian Faulks, and Jeffery Deaver, who have carried on the tradition and entertained fans for decades."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: China Unicom Boycott of Google May Signal Fallout Is Spreading (For more stories about Google in China, see {EXTR <GO>}.) By Mark Lee March 25 (Bloomberg) -- China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd.’s boycott of Google Inc.’s search engine signals the fallout from the U.S. company’s defiance of government censorship is spreading, analysts said. Unicom doesn’t use Google search boxes on its phones and only works with companies that abide by Chinese law, President Lu Yimin told reporters yesterday in Hong Kong. On March 23, billionaire Li Ka-shing’s Tom Online Inc. said it stopped using Google on its portal. “If you were partnering with Google in China, your business plans have just fallen apart,” Bertram Lai, head of research at CIMB-GK Securities in Hong Kong, said by phone. “You need to scramble and find new partners.” Google’s decision to stop censoring its Chinese service has spurred speculation that advertisers may switch to rival search engines such as that of Baidu Inc. In the U.S., Go Daddy Group Inc., the world’s largest registrar of domain names, said yesterday it’s refusing to offer new site identities in China, citing increased Internet spying by the government on its citizens. Chinese partners for Google’s search operations need to review their business ties as the U.S. company’s Internet service license in China needs to be renewed soon, said Fang Meiqin, research director at BDA China Ltd., a Beijing-based telecommunications industry consultant. Sale Postponed Google said in January that it postponed to an unspecified date the sale of two handsets co-developed with Unicom, after the U.S. company said its stand on Internet censorship may lead to its exit from China. Lu denied Unicom was involved in the phones’ development. “Unicom has dropped Google from its handset plans because Google no longer operates within China,” Lai, who rates Unicom shares “underperform,” said. “It makes sense for them to make the decision immediately” to avoid the costs of reprogramming handsets to remove Google later, he said. Mountain View, California-based Google, which has partnerships with China Mobile Ltd. and Sina Corp., said March 22 it began routing China-based subscribers to an unfiltered search service on its Hong Kong site, following through on a Jan. 12 statement to end self-censorship of its Google.cn portal. Google’s redirection of its search queries is effectively a pullout from China, reducing the appeal for advertisers, Steven Chang, the Shanghai-based chief executive officer for China at Zenith Optimedia, which buys ads from Google and Baidu on behalf of clients, said in an interview this week. ‘Advertisers Will Switch” “If traffic at Google’s Hong Kong site is not as good as the Chinese site, advertisers will switch,” Elinor Leung, head of Internet research at CLSA Ltd., said this week. Chinese companies including Baidu, Tencent Holdings Ltd., and Sohu.com Inc. will benefit, she said. Baidu, operator of the country’s biggest search engine, rose 2.3 percent to 608.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday, while Sohu dropped 1.9 percent. Elaine Feng, executive vice-president at Tom Online, said the company only works with partners that are compliant with regulations. She said the Chinese Internet company ended its relationship with Google after the expiry of an agreement, without giving details on the timing. Go Daddy’s announcement came two days after Google said it stopped self-censorship. Christine Jones, executive vice president and general counsel of the Scottsdale, Arizona-based registrar, disclosed the company’s change in policy at a hearing of a congressionally mandated commission yesterday in Washington. Partnerships Google teamed with China Mobile in January 2007 to offer mobile and Internet services in the world’s most populous country. The U.S. firm also struck a partnership with Sina to provide search on China’s third-most visited Web portal. Rainie Lei, spokeswoman at China Mobile, didn’t reply to e- mail and phone messages seeking comment. Cathy Peng, a spokeswoman at Sina declined to say if the company plans to retain its search agreement with Google. Baidu, based in Beijing, accounted for 58.6 percent of China’s online search market last quarter, compared with 35.6 percent for Google, according to research company Analysys International. --Editors: Mark McCord, Suresh Seshadri.

China Unicom said the Google search function would not be provided on phones using the US company’s Android-based operating system. Unicom said the handsets’ manufacturers would choose which search engines to use instead. “We are willing to work with any company that abides by Chinese law . . . we don’t have any co-operation with Google currently,” said Lu Yimin, Unicom’s president. The Chinese government has struggled in recent days to respond to Google’s decision to redirect Chinese users of its search function to its uncensored Hong Kong site. Internet users using Google have experienced widely divergent search results in different parts of the country and at different times of the day, in part a reflection of splits in the Chinese government over how to react to the US group’s move. But Unicom’s statement is confirmation that Google’s stance against censorship in China could carry a substantial commercial cost, through its exclusion from the fast-growing mobile internet market in the country. According to official Chinese figures, the country has 384m internet users, but 745m mobile subscribers, many of them regular users of the internet on their handsets. Last year, China Unicom and its two competitors started third-generation mobile businesses and have signed up millions on customers to the higher-end services. In January, after announcing its intention to stop censoring its search engine in China, Google delayed the launches of two Android-based mobile handsets that Samsung and Motorola had developed for Unicom. Unicom’s website has since started taking pre-orders for the Motorola device. China Unicom did not explain the delay or say when the phones would be launched. Analysts said China Unicom was likely to take a blow from its decision. “Their distribution of the iPhone is not going very well, and therefore Android was an important part of their strategy,” said Charice Wang, an analyst at Ovum, the telecoms research company. China Mobile, the world’s largest mobile operator, offers more than a dozen smartphones running on its own platform which is based on Android and which feature Google as one search engine among others. So far, the company has not said whether it will drop Google. But last week, Wang Jianzhou, chairman, was already playing down the company’s co-operation with Google, saying that the two did not have an exclusive relationship. “They are likely to switch to Baidu soon,” said Ms Wang, the Ovum analyst, referring to Google’s Chinese competitor in internet search. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"China Unicom, a big phone company in China, has decided to stop using Google's search engine on its phones. This is because Google decided not to follow the Chinese government's rules about controlling what people can search for on the internet. This could be bad for Google because China has a very big market for mobile phones and the internet, and now people might start using other search engines like Baidu instead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. Question: Who said the national guard will help with border surveillance?

The reviewer has expressed their satisfaction with the earrings, mentioning that they find them \\"adorable,\\" with a perfect size for young girls and well-made silver settings. The amethyst stones also seem to have impressed the reviewer with their matching and beautiful shade of purple. However, the review does highlight a couple of downfalls, such as the delicate posts that seem easy to bend and the insecure backings. These concerns led the reviewer to give it a 4-star rating instead of 5. Despite these issues, the reviewer still appreciates the product's value for its price and mentions that the earrings come in attractive packaging consisting of a small black drawstring bag placed inside a small black jewelry box.

By the middle 1950s, he had become one of the best-loved and most successful children's book writers in the world. His books are very popular with young readers. They enjoy the invented words and the pictures of unusual funny animals and plants. In 1954, life magazine published a report about school children who could not read. The report said many children's books were not interesting. Doctor Seuss strongly hoped to help children and decided to write books that were interesting and easy to read. He used words with the same ending sound, like fish and wish. He did not receive training in art. Yet, he drew the pictures for most of his books. In 1957, Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat. He used less than 230 words to write the book and even a six-year-old should be able to read it. It was a fun story and easy to read. Children loved it. Their parents loved it, too. Today it is still one of the stories they like best. The success of The Cat in the Hat made him want to write more books for children. In 1960, he wrote a book using less than fifty words. The book is called Green Eggs and Ham. In 1984, Doctor Seuss won a Pulitzer Prize . He was honored for the education and enjoyment his books provided American children and their parents. He died at the age of 87, but his influence remains. Millions of his books have been sold worldwide. People say his books helped change the way American children learned to read. Yet, his books are loved by people of all ages. Doctor Seuss once said, \\"I do not write for children. I write for people.\\" Question: People like his books because the books _ . Options: A: are cheap and easy to get B: were written in different languages C: are easy and interesting to read D: were written with invented words Answer:","completion":"People like his books because the books are easy and interesting to read (Option C) and were written with invented words (Option D). According to the article, Doctor Seuss wrote books that were both captivating and easy to read making them particularly appealing to younger readers. This was a deliberate effort on his part to address the issue of children's books not being interesting, as was reported by Life magazine in 1954. His books are also known for the invented words they contain and the depictions of unusual, humorous animals and plants, adding to their unique appeal and distinguishing them from other children's literature. This made his books not only accessible to children but also highly entertaining, helping to change the way American children learned to read. However, despite the popularity of his books among children, Doctor Seuss insisted that he wrote for people of all ages, not just for children. This is reflected in his continued global popularity, years after his death, among readers young and old. His use of recurring end sounds in words (rhyming words), while making the books easier to read for beginners, also added a rhythmic and fun element to the reading experience, making his books more appealing to a broader audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Metallica opted for extensive touring instead of releasing a single or video to promote the album. Metallica spent March to August 1986 touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. During sound checks, the group played riffs from Osbourne's previous band Black Sabbath, which Osbourne perceived as a mockery toward him. Referring to that occasion, Ulrich stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for its excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname \\"Alcoholica\\". The band members occasionally wore satirical T-shirts reading \\"Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All\\". The band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica's music, unlike in the smaller towns they've visited. \\"In the B-markets, people really don't know what we're all about. But after 45 or 50 minutes we can tell we've won them over. And fans who come to hear Ozzy go home liking Metallica.\\" Metallica won over Osbourne's fans and slowly began to establish a mainstream following.The tour, however, was notable for several incidents. Hetfield broke his wrist in a mid-tour skateboarding accident, and his guitar technician John Marshall played rhythm guitar on several dates. The European leg of the Damage, Inc. Tour commenced in September, with Anthrax as the supporting band. After the performance of September 26 in Stockholm, the band's bus rolled over on a stretch of icy road the following morning. Burton was thrown through a window and killed instantly. The driver was charged with manslaughter but was not convicted.

The Turkish foreign minister said it had summoned the US ambassador, John Bass, and asked for an investigation. During the key visit, a brawl erupted between protesters and Turkish security personnel, injuring 11 people. Police called it a \\"brutal attack\\" on protesters, but Turkey blamed the violence on pro-Kurdish demonstrators. Meanwhile, US State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said \\"the conduct of Turkish security personnel... was deeply disturbing\\". \\"The State Department has raised its concerns about those events at the highest levels,\\" she added. The incident happened on Tuesday outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington, hours after Mr Erdogan met US President Donald Trump. Video footage of the clash showed men in suits charging past police to kick and punch protesters. \\"A written and verbal protest was delivered due to the aggressive and unprofessional actions taken, contrary to diplomatic rules and practices, by US security personnel,\\" the Turkish foreign minister said in a statement. The \\"lapses of security\\", it added, \\"were caused by the inability of US authorities to take sufficient precautions at every stage of the official programme\\". US officials have already summoned the Turkish ambassador over the violence, which was described by Washington police as a \\"brutal attack on peaceful protesters\\". But the Turkish embassy said the demonstrators were linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), and had aggressively provoked Turkish-Americans gathering to greet the president.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Pick from: a). no; b). yes;","completion":"b). yes Both questions are inquiring about the same information, which is pricing strategies for software projects. In order to provide a detailed answer, I will discuss various factors to consider and various pricing models that are commonly used. When charging for a software project, it is important to consider the following factors: 1. Project complexity: Software projects can range from simple to highly complex. The more complex the project, the more time and effort it will require from you and your team, and this should be factored into the price. 2. Project scope: Determine the overall scope of the project. This includes the features and requirements of the software, as well as integration with other systems, design, testing, and ongoing support. 3. Time and resources: Consider the time and resources required to complete the project. This includes team members' salaries, overhead costs, and outside expenses such as licenses and software tools. 4. Market pricing: Research what competitors or similar companies are charging for similar projects to make sure you're pricing your services competitively. Once you have considered these factors, you can choose from several common pricing models for software projects: 1. Fixed price: In this straightforward model, you would calculate the total cost of the project (including time, materials, and overhead costs) and then charge the client a set amount. This option can be appealing to clients, as they know upfront what the project will cost, but it can also be risky for developers if the project scope changes or unforeseen issues arise. 2. Time and materials: With this model, you would charge the client for the actual time and resources spent on the project. This allows for more flexibility in the event of changes or unexpected issues, but can be less attractive to clients who are looking for a fixed price. 3. Retainer: In this model, clients pay a set retainer fee to secure your services for a period of time, and the software project is billed against the retainer. This can be a good option for ongoing projects or when the scope of the project is not yet defined. 4. Value-based pricing: Rather than charging based on time or resources, you would charge the client based on the value your software will provide to their business. For example, if your software leads to increased sales or reduced operational costs, you would charge a percentage of that value. This can be an attractive option for clients looking for a return on their investment but can be difficult to quantify and negotiate. 5. Milestone-based pricing: With this model, you would divide the project into different stages or milestones, and the client would pay for each completed milestone. This can be a good option for projects that have clearly defined stages, allowing the client to manage their cash flow and giving the developer regular payments throughout the project. In summary, when charging for a software project, consider factors such as project complexity, scope, time and resources, and market pricing. Investigate the various pricing models available and choose the best one for your particular project and client's needs. It may also be beneficial to offer multiple pricing options to clients to accommodate their concerns and preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

To further elaborate, the historical town of Watervliet, which once held a prominent position as a sizable region in Albany County, encompassing the present towns of Colonie and Green Island, as well as the city of Watervliet, does not exist as it used to. However, it's important to distinguish between the former town of Watervliet and the city of Watervliet, which still exists today. While the town of Watervliet has been dissolved and no longer possesses the same jurisdiction or land area that it once did, the city of Watervliet stands as a separate, smaller entity within Albany County in New York. The city of Watervliet has evolved from a part of the larger historical town. Over time, the boundaries and jurisdictions of regions change due to various factors, such as population growth, economic interests, and infrastructure developments. In this case, the area that was once the town of Watervliet underwent significant changes as it was divided into different municipalities. Despite these alterations, the legacy and history of the town of Watervliet live on in the names and histories of the areas that it once comprised. So, while the statement \\"Watervliet no longer exists\\" follows given the context provided about the dissolution of the historical town, it is essential to understand that this refers specifically to the former town of Watervliet, not the city of Watervliet, which remains an active part of the Albany County today.

The answer is:","completion":"The \\"family room\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons, primarily because it is a space within a household specifically designed for leisure activities, socializing, and relaxation among family members, including children. In contrast, the other given answers do not typically cater to children engaging in play or match the appropriate context for conducting games. Here's a brief analysis of these options to better understand why \\"family room\\" stands out as the most appropriate answer: 1. Toy store: While a toy store does cater to children and provides a variety of games and playthings, it is essentially a commercial place for purchasing these items, not a location for children to freely play games. 2. Bar: A bar is an establishment primarily intended for adults, focusing on the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. This environment is generally not designed for, nor is it suitable for, children to play games. 3. Casino: Much like a bar, a casino is an adult-centric space built around gambling and betting activities, which are not appropriate or permissible for children. Consequently, a casino would not be a suitable location for children to play games. 4. Table: Although some games, such as board games and card games, can be played on a table, the term \\"table\\" in itself is not a location or a designated place for game-playing. Instead, it is a piece of furniture and therefore cannot be considered a specific place for children to play games. 5. Family room: The family room is a more informal and multipurpose space within households, dedicated to facilitating a comfortable and entertaining environment for family members. This room commonly includes recreational facilities, such as toys, board games, and video games, specifically designed for leisure and amusement. Given the family-oriented nature of this space, children can comfortably and safely engage in gaming activities alongside their family members or peers. In conclusion, based on the human common sense and considerations of appropriate environments and contexts, the \\"family room\\" is the most fitting location for children to play games among the given options.

During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody.

She has won four World Cup overall championships--one of only two female skiers to do so, along with Annemarie Moser-Proll--with three consecutive titles in 2008, 2009, and 2010, plus another in 2012. Vonn won the gold medal in downhill at the 2010 Winter Olympics, the first ever in the event for an American woman. She has also won a record 8 World Cup season titles in the downhill discipline (2008-2013, 2015, 2016), 5 titles in super-G (2009-2012, 2015), and 3 consecutive titles in the combined (2010-2012). In her Olympic debut at the 2002 Winter Olympics at age 17, Vonn raced in both slalom and combined in Salt Lake City, with her best result coming with sixth in combined. On March 4, 2003, she earned a silver medal in downhill in the Junior World Championship at Puy Saint-Vincent, France. Vonn credits a change in her attitude toward training to a bike ride with fellow ski racer Julia Mancuso and Mancuso's father Ciro when Vonn visited them at their home in Lake Tahoe, California. With little biking experience, she quickly found herself miles behind Julia and Ciro. Alone and embarrassed, she realized she needed drastic revision of her training regimen and her attitude toward training if she was going to be successful. On March 24, 2004, Vonn was the downhill silver medalist at the U.S. Alpine Championships at Mt. Alyeska Resort, Girdwood, Alaska. Earlier that year 2004, Vonn climbed onto the World Cup podium for the first time with a third-place finish in downhill in January 2004 at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Her maiden victory in that specialty came at Lake Louise, Alberta, in December 2004. She captured five more World Cup podiums over the next two months. In 2005, she competed in four races at her first World Championships held in Bormio, Italy, pulling in fourth-place finishes in both the downhill and the combined. She was ninth in super-G, but failed to finish the giant slalom. She cited the unexpected appearance of her father, with whom she has a strained relationship, for rattling her before the event.

It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941. - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force. - Raymond Towers \`\` Ray '' Holmes ( 20 August 1914 -- 27 June 2005 ) was a British fighter pilot who was feted by the press as a war hero who saved Buckingham Palace from being severely damaged by German bombing during the Battle of Britain .

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question 1: What are some examples of a catalyst in a chemical reaction? Question 2: What are the catalysts used in chemical reactions of alkenes? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1 and Question 2 are related but not asking the same thing. Question 1 is a general inquiry about examples of catalysts in chemical reactions, while Question 2 is specifically asking about catalysts used in chemical reactions involving alkenes. I will provide long and detailed answers to both questions below. Question 1: What are some examples of a catalyst in a chemical reaction? A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed or changed in the process. Catalysts work by lowering the activation energy needed for a reaction, allowing it to proceed more rapidly. There are many examples of catalysts in various chemical reactions, and they can be classified as heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts, depending on their phase compared to the reactants' phase. Here are some examples: 1. Enzymes: Enzymes are biological catalysts that play a crucial role in living organisms. They are typically proteins that speed up biochemical reactions by binding to specific molecules called substrates. For example, the enzyme amylase catalyzes the breakdown of starch into glucose. 2. Hydrogenation catalysts: In the hydrogenation process, hydrogen gas is added to an unsaturated compound, resulting in a saturated compound. A common example is the hydrogenation of vegetable oils to produce solid margarine. This reaction typically uses a metal catalyst such as nickel, platinum, or palladium. 3. Haber process catalyst: The Haber process is used to synthesize ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. This reaction is carried out at high temperatures and pressures, using an iron-based catalyst. The catalyst increases the rate of conversion, making ammonia production more efficient. 4. Zeolites: Zeolites are porous materials with a high surface area that can act as catalysts in various reactions. They are widely used in the petrochemical industry for processes such as cracking, which involves breaking down large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller, more useful molecules. Zeolites can be tailored to have specific pore sizes and shapes, which allows them to selectively catalyze specific reactions. 5. Acid catalysts: Certain reactions require an acidic environment to proceed. Examples of acid catalysts include sulfuric acid in the synthesis of esters and phosphoric acid in the dehydration of alcohols to form alkenes. Question 2: What are the catalysts used in chemical reactions of alkenes? Alkenes are hydrocarbons containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond. These unsaturated hydrocarbons can undergo various chemical reactions, and specific catalysts are often employed to facilitate these processes. Some examples of catalysts used in alkene reactions include: 1. Metal catalysts: The hydrogenation of alkenes, a process wherein hydrogen is added across the carbon-carbon double bond, is often catalyzed by metals such as palladium, platinum, or nickel. 2. Acid catalysts: The addition of water to an alkene (hydration) is typically performed using an acid catalyst like concentrated sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid. 3. Peroxy acids: In the epoxidation of alkenes, a reaction that involves the conversion of carbon-carbon double bonds to epoxides (three-membered cyclic ethers), peroxy acids like meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) or peracetic acid can be used as catalysts. 4. Lewis acids: Reactions like halogenation (the addition of a halogen, such as chlorine or bromine, across the carbon-carbon double bond), and the addition of hydrogen halides (like HCl or HBr) to alkenes are facilitated by Lewis acids, such as aluminum chloride or boron trifluoride (BF3), which coordinate to the reactants and activate them for reaction. In conclusion, while Question 1 and Question 2 are related, they are not asking the same thing. Question 1 requests general examples of catalysts in chemical reactions, whereas Question 2 specifically targets catalysts used in reactions involving alkenes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is there any value for Re.1 left in India? Which cars have the best re-sale value in India? Do those questions have the same meaning? Available choices: A). no B). yes","completion":"A). No The two questions do not have the same meaning. Let me elaborate on each of them. 1. Is there any value for Re.1 left in India? This question is asking if the Indian Rupee (INR) with a 1 rupee denomination still holds any value or significance in the Indian economy. Though the value of 1 rupee has indeed diminished due to inflation, it still holds value and is in circulation in the form of coins. The 1 rupee coin is still being used for smaller transactions and as change for other denominations. However, when comparing it to higher denomination notes or coins, the purchasing power of 1 rupee is quite limited. 2. Which cars have the best re-sale value in India? This question is asking about the automobile scenario in India, specifically, the cars that have a good resale or residual value after a few years of ownership. Resale value is the amount for which a used car can be sold after a certain period, which depends on factors like brand reputation, condition of the car, demand for that specific model, and other relevant factors. In India, some of the cars with the best resale values are: a) Maruti Suzuki Swift and Swift Dzire: These models are known for their reliability and fuel efficiency, making them popular choices for city driving. As a result, they typically hold their value well in the used car market. b) Toyota Innova: The Toyota Innova is a popular MPV in India due to its durability, low-maintenance costs, and spacious interiors. It is also used extensively by commercial operators like taxi fleet owners, which speaks to its reliability and overall utility. Hence, it has a good resale value. c) Honda City: Honda City has been a popular sedan in the Indian automobile market, mainly due to its impressive fuel efficiency, reliable engine, and comfortable interiors. The long-standing reputation of Honda in the market adds to the resale value of the City. d) Hyundai i10 and i20: The Hyundai i10 and i20 are known for their reliability, stylish design, and fuel efficiency. These models have proven to be popular choices among Indian car buyers, and their demand in the used car market contributes to their high resale value. In summary, these two questions have different meanings. While the first question deals with the value of the 1 rupee denomination in the Indian economy, the second question pertains to cars that have a high resale value in the Indian automobile market."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Because of the unit conventions then in use, the gravitational constant does not appear explicitly in Cavendish's work. Instead, the result was originally expressed as the specific gravity of the Earth, or equivalently the mass of the Earth. His experiment gave the first accurate values for these geophysical constants. The experiment was devised sometime before 1783 by geologist John Michell, who constructed a torsion balance apparatus for it. However, Michell died in 1793 without completing the work. After his death the apparatus passed to Francis John Hyde Wollaston and then to Henry Cavendish, who rebuilt the apparatus but kept close to Michell's original plan.

But Sanders easily dispatched Clinton in Utah and Idaho, the other two Western states that voted Tuesday. Both states held caucuses, a format that has favored Sanders. Story Continued Below Arizona, though, was the biggest prize of the night, with 85 proportionally allocated delegates at stake. With more than 96 percent of precincts counted in the state as of late Wednesday morning, Clinton was ahead 58 percent to 40 percent. Sanders was looking to recapture the burst of momentum he enjoyed after his surprise win in Michigan on March 8. But he entered the day trailing Clinton by double digits in Arizona. Shortly after The AP and networks called Arizona for Clinton, Sanders reminded supporters in San Diego just how far he had come in less than a year, while predicting a better finish in Utah and Idaho. “When we began this campaign, we were considered a fringe candidacy,\\" Sanders said. \\"Well, 10 months later we have now won 10 primaries and caucuses and unless I’m very mistaken, we’re gonna win a couple more tonight.\\" Before launching into a version of his stump speech, the Vermont senator also suggested that his campaign played a role in bringing out voters to the polls, regardless of whether they voted for him.

He then issued a more explicitly triumphant statement once the later outcomes were clear. “I am enormously grateful to the people of Utah and Idaho for the tremendous voter turnouts that gave us victories with extremely large margins,\\" Sanders said. \\"These decisive victories in Idaho and Utah give me confidence that we will continue to win major victories in the coming contests.” Clinton, speaking to supporters in Seattle, said she was \\"proud\\" to have won Arizona before turning her focus to the Republican race. The terrorist attacks in Brussels on Tuesday, she said, underscored the importance and gravity of the presidential election. \\"The last thing we need, my friends, are leaders who incite more fear,\\" she continued. “We can’t throw out everything we know about what works and what doesn’t and start torturing people,\\" she remarked, alluding to Ted Cruz's call for more stringent policing of Muslim communities and Donald Trump's insistence that torture could have prevented the attacks in the European capital that killed 34 (including three suicide bombers) and wounded hundreds. \\"What Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and others are suggesting, it’s not only wrong, it’s dangerous. It will not keep us safe. This is a time for America to lead, not to cower. And we will lead, and we will defeat terrorists that threaten our friends and allies,\\" she said. Sanders campaigned at the U.S.-Mexico border on Saturday, appearing with Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.). Clinton had the support of Arizona Democratic Reps. Ann Kirkpatrick and Ruben Gallego. Unlike the other four candidates left running in either major party, Sanders opted to campaign in Idaho, Utah and Arizona on Monday rather than address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference in Washington, D.C. He delivered a foreign policy speech in Salt Lake City in which he called for a restart of the Middle East peace process. Following Tuesday's primaries, Clinton has 1,214 pledged delegates, while Sanders has 911. Counting pledged superdelegates, Clinton has 1,681 and Sanders 927, according to The AP. The Democratic race next moves to the Saturday caucuses in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington state, where Sanders is likely to do well. \\"Our campaign will continue to compete in every state and will work to amass as many pledged delegates as possible everywhere,\\" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in a memo after Clinton's March 15 sweep. \\"In fact, we already have staff on the ground in every state that votes through the end of April. But our pledged delegate lead is so significant that even a string of victories by Sen. Sanders over the next few weeks would have little impact on Sec. Clinton’s position in the race.\\" Clinton's allies in Congress are calling on Sanders to wind down his campaign or, short of that, stop attacking the former secretary of state directly.

When we moved in a month ago, Mary wanted to get a dog to keep out burglars. However, we finally decided that it would be cheaper to put an iron grille in front of the door and get a burglar alarm. Last week, I went to a shop and bought an alarm for just over PS200. It consists of a control unit with three smaller units. I put the control unit in the lounge and put the other units in place by the front door, back door and lounge windows. That night I soon fell asleep because I was confident that no one could get into our house undetected. At about 1:50 a.m. I woke up suddenly and heard the siren. It was like an ambulance driving right through our bedroom. I couldn't leave the siren on all night. I went downstairs in the dark. When I reached the bottom of the stairs, I switched on the light and looked around. Oh my gosh. The back door was unlocked. I rushed to lock it and it was just at that exact moment that the 'burglar' disappeared behind a curtain. Guess what? It was an ordinary house lizard .Apparently the alarm system had been made for American or European homes in which lizards are never seen. I switched the alarm off and sat down to watch.

Context: Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W.

This is really nothing but a showcase for her looks and talent. She does a very good job. The story itself is, on the face of it, pretty nonsensical. After a car crash, some friends are possibly dead, but keeps on living their previous lives, while all sorts of mysterious things happen. Some bad guys are after them, but we never really find out who they are (possibly they were the ones in the other car, but we certainly don't hear anything about why they are after them).

A disc jockey, often abbreviated as DJ, is a person who plays existing recorded music for a live audience. Most common types of DJs include radio DJ, club DJ who performs at a nightclub or music festival, and turntablist who uses record players, usually turntables, to manipulate sounds on phonograph records. Originally, the \\"disc\\" in \\"disc jockey\\" referred to gramophone records, but now \\"DJ\\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files on a CDJ or laptop. The title \\"DJ\\" is commonly used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted pseudonyms or stage names. Several techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the cueing, equalization and audio mixing of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques. Club DJ turntable techniques include beatmatching, phrasing and slip-cueing to preserve energy on a dance floor. Turntablism embodies the art of cutting, beat juggling, scratching, needle drops, phase shifting, back spinning and more to perform the transitions and overdubs of samples in a more creative manner (although turntablism is often considered a use of the turntable as a musical instrument rather than a tool for blending recorded music). Professional DJs may use harmonic mixing to choose songs that are in compatible musical keys. Recent advances in technology in both DJ hardware and software can provide assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques and skills. Examples include phrasing and beatmatching, which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs automatic synchronization of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled \\"sync\\". Most DJ mixers now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in beats per minute (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources. In the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques.","completion":"This text is about a disc jockey, commonly referred to as a DJ.

Please answer the following question: Background: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future. Paragraph: Rob always confuses the terms climate and weather. He found it's better to compare them if he needs to learn more about their characteristics. To make things easier, he labeled the weather of his city as char A. Then he labeled the climate of this city as char B. Once finished with learning their characteristics, Rob focused on climate change issues. For that, he labeled the climate of present time as char C and climate just before industrial revolution as char D. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Does char A represent longer or shorter time period than char B? A:","completion":"Char A represents a shorter time period than char B. In the paragraph, char A is used to represent the weather of Rob's city, while char B represents its climate. Weather is a temporary condition and can change quickly, while climate is the long-term average of weather patterns in a particular location. Since weather conditions are temporary and ever-changing, they cover a shorter time period compared to climate, which covers a longer time period, encompassing the overall trends and variations in weather experienced in a location."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both exceptionally bright, they would often dream of a life out of the small town atmosphere, fantasizing a life in the vibrant, bustling city of Chicago. Our film opens, touching on their monotonous small town life and modest parental home. Their supportive yet overbearing parents are introduced who, due to a fear of loneliness, subtly undermine their children's proposed steps toward independence. Daniel, a talented computer programmer, and Jane, an ambitious business student, finally realize the need to break free when their parents' subtle undermining becomes direct opposition to their dreams. Inspired by a shared desire for autonomy, they decide to save their earnings to purchase a flat in the city, their sanctuary in the hustle of life. At first, Daniel and Jane face numerous challenges. Balancing full-time jobs, saving money, and, most challenging, keeping their plans a secret from their parents. Some comedic relief ensues as they narrowly dodge their parents' suspicions, toss and turn with financial dilemmas, and misunderstanding about their shared space in their future flat. In the climax of the movie, their parents accidentally stumble upon Daniel and Jane's secret savings stash. The confrontation pits the twins' dreams up against their parents' understanding of a successful life. With heated argument, they finally get their parents to see their perspectives, accomplishments, and grownup decisions. Their parents allow them to move out, not quite supportive but accepting their children's pursuit of independence. The movie concludes with Daniel and Jane moving into their city flat, finding their freedom in the midst of the echoing city noises. The film, \\"Stepping Stones,\\" is a delightful family drama with a touch of comedy about the universal pursuit and struggles of independence, sibling alliance, and the bittersweet art of letting go for parents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Steven Frederic Seagal was born in Lansing, Michigan on April 10, 1952, the son of medical technician Patricia (1930-2003) and high school math teacher Samuel Seagal (1928-1991). His mother was of Dutch, English, and German ancestry, while his paternal grandparents were Russian Jews who immigrated to the U.S. He also has Irish and Mongolian heritage. When Seagal was five years old, his parents relocated to Fullerton, California. Seagal moved to Japan at some point between 1971 and 1973. The date of his journey has become a point of contention due to Seagal's statement that he studied with Morihei Uyeshiba, the founder of aikido, who died in 1969. Terry Dobson, a fifth-degree black belt who studied with the master from 1961 to 1969, dismissed this claim, saying, \\"That story is bull. [Back then] I never heard of Steven Seagal.\\" By 1974 Seagal had returned California. That year he met Miyako Fujitani, a second-degree black belt and daughter of an Osaka aikido master who had come to Los Angeles to teach aikido. When Miyako returned to Osaka, Seagal went with her. The following year they married and had a son, Kentaro, and a daughter, Ayako. He taught at the school owned by Miyako's family (though he is often stated to have been the first non-Asian to open a dojo in Japan). As of 1990, Miyako and her brother still taught there, and her mother was the chairwoman. Seagal initially returned to Taos, New Mexico, with his student (and later film stuntman) Craig Dunn, where they opened a dojo, although Seagal spent much of his time pursuing other ventures. After another period in Japan, Seagal returned to the U.S. in 1983 with senior student Haruo Matsuoka. They opened an aikido dojo, initially in North Hollywood, California, but later moved it to the city of West Hollywood. Seagal left Matsuoka in charge of the dojo, which he ran until the two parted ways in 1997. Seagal helped train Brazilian Mixed Martial Artist Lyoto Machida, who credited Seagal for helping him perfect the front kick that he used to knock out Randy Couture at UFC 129 in May 2011.

Those who knew Nidal Malik Hasan before he was a major in the Army -- and the suspect in last week's mass killing at Fort Hood -- say he was long known for militant Islamist views. Doctors who crossed paths with Hasan in medical programs paint a picture of a subpar student who wore his religious views on his sleeve. Several doctors who knew Hasan spoke to CNN, but only on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation of the shooting, which left 12 soldiers and one civilian dead and dozens of other people wounded. Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who faces 13 counts of premeditated murder, \\"was clearly espousing Islamist ideology\\" during his time as a medical student at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, one of his former classmates told CNN. Hasan's family has revealed little about him, saying in media interviews that Hasan was a \\"good American\\" and a lifelong Muslim who complained he was harassed in the Army because of his religion. His former classmates describe a much more militant Hasan. His presentations for school were often laced with extremist Muslim views, one source said. \\"Is your allegiance to Sharia law or the United States?\\" students once challenged Hasan, the source said. \\"Sharia law,\\" Hasan responded, according to the source. The incident was corroborated by another doctor who was present. The source recalled another instance in which Hasan was asked if the U.S. Constitution was a brilliant document. Hasan replied, \\"No, not particularly,\\" according to the source. The former classmate told CNN that he voiced concerns about Hasan to supervisors at the school. A second former medical school colleague of Hasan said several people raised concerns about Hasan's overall competence. Even though Hasan earned his medical degree and residency, some of his fellow students believed Hasan \\"didn't have the intellect\\" to be in the program and was not academically rigorous in his coursework. Hasan \\"was not fit to be in the military, let alone in the mental health profession,\\" this classmate told CNN. \\"No one in class would ever have referred a patient to him or trusted him with anything.\\" The first classmate echoed this sentiment. Hasan was \\"coddled, accommodated and pushed through that masters of public health despite substandard performance,\\" the classmate said. He was \\"put in the fellowship program because they didn't know what to do with him.\\" The second classmate said he witnessed at least two of Hasan's PowerPoint discussions that included what he described as extremist views. In these presentations, which were supposed to be about health, Hasan justified suicide bombings and spoke about the persecution of Muslims in the Middle East, in the United States and in the U.S. military, the source said. Some in the crowd rolled their eyes or muttered under their breath, he said, and others were clearly uncomfortable. Those in the audience, which included program supervisors, did not loudly object to Hasan's presentations, but did complain to their higher-ups afterward. The supervisors expressed \\"appreciation, understanding and agreement\\" that the complaints would be discussed, but it was unclear what action, if any, came, the source said. When the classmate challenged Hasan personally, Hasan dodged the questions, the source said. Despite the controversy that his schoolwork created, classmates did not view Hasan as mentally unstable or psychotic, the source said. Questions remain over how much Hasan's behavior and actions in school were reflected in his personnel files. Col. Kimberly Kesling, deputy commander of Clinical Services for Darnell Medical Center at Fort Hood and Hasan's supervisor at the post, told reporters last week that Hasan was doing a good job in Texas. \\"As a supervisor, I am aware of the job performance of people coming into our organization, that is part of our credentialing process,\\" Kesling said. \\"The types of things that were reported to me via his evaluation report were things that concerned me, but did not raise red flags toward this [the shootings] in any way, shape, or form.\\" \\"His evaluation reports said that he had some difficulties in his residency, fitting into his residency, and we worked very hard to integrate him into our practice and into our organization, and he adapted very well, was doing a really good job for us,\\" she said. Prompted by reports of former classmates, however, Army investigators would like to speak with people who have had contact with Hasan and who may have information about his activities and behavior, Maj. Gen Kevin Bergner, head of U.S. Army public affairs, said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates weighed in on the information surfacing about Hasan. \\"I deplore the leaks that have taken place,\\" he said on a trip to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. People are talking about \\"what they know, which is one small piece of the puzzle.\\" \\"They don't know whether or not what they're leaking might jeopardize a potential criminal investigation and trial,\\" he said. \\"People who have a piece of this, frankly, ought to keep quiet and let the authorities go forward on this in an organized and comprehensive way,\\" Gates said. Hasan came under investigation last year when his contacts with radical imam Anwar al-Awlaki were intercepted by terrorism investigators monitoring the cleric's communications, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. An employee of the Defense Department's Criminal Investigative Services, assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force, decided to drop the investigation after reviewing the intercepted communications and Hasan's personnel files. Hasan remained hospitalized Thursday from gunshot wounds he received from two police officers who responded to last week's shooting. CNN's Brian Todd and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.

The family released a photo of the boy but not his name. (Photo: Family photo via Rady Children's HospitalñSan Diego) A kayaker who helped rescue a teen attacked by a shark off a California beach says the shark stalked the kayak during the life-and-death race to shore. The 13-year-old boy was \\"free diving\\" – without scuba gear – when he was attacked Saturday morning off Beacon's Beach in Encinitas, 25 miles north of San Diego. The youth was airlifted to a local hospital and his condition was stabilized, Encinitas Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said. Chad Hammel said he was lobster hunting with two friends when he heard shouts. Hammel thought someone was excited because they had caught \\"some big bugs\\" on the first day of the lobster-diving season. \\"But it kept going, and I realized he was yelling, 'I got bit!'\\" Hammel told OnScene TV.

Witnesses said the attack happened in about 9 feet of water, more than 100 yards from shore, Giles said. Some estimated the shark at 11 feet long. The first day of lobster-diving season draws big crowds, and dozens of people were on the beach and in the water when the attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. Giles said investigators will attempt to determine the species of shark that attacked the boy. A shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, he said. In April 2017, a woman was badly injured by a shark off of San Onofre Beach, about 30 miles north of Encinitas. Two weeks ago a Brazilian tourist was killed by a shark while boogie boarding off of Cape Cod in Massachusetts.

Larry Giles told reporters earlier at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas, about 27 miles (43 kilometers) north of downtown San Diego. The attack occurred just before 7 a.m., during the opening hour of California's popular spiny lobster season. The boy was attacked in about 9 feet (2.7 meters) of water approximately 150 yards (137 meters) offshore. He was brought to shore by three bystanders, Giles said. Emergency responders arrived, and the boy was flown by helicopter to the trauma center. \\"He was conscious, he was above water, and the bystanders were able to get him up on the beach ... and he was talking all the way to when he was being transported,\\" the captain said. The three rescuers were identified only as an off-duty police officer from nearby Oceanside, an off-duty state lifeguard and a friend who were also diving for lobsters. Giles said the trio provided a \\"tremendous amount of aid to that young man.\\" Witnesses estimated the shark was about 11 feet (3.3 meters) long, but the type was not known, he said. Lifeguards immediately turned to clearing people out of the water. Giles noted there were multiple other divers in the area. The waters off about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) of beach were ordered closed for 48 hours, and a nearby surfing competition was canceled before it got underway. Lifeguards were being brought in from various agencies while a San Diego County sheriff's helicopter scouted from the air. In the immediate hours after the attack, there was no sign of shark activity or signs of typical prey such as seals, dolphins and porpoises, although a seal was reported in the area earlier, Giles said. \\"This is a nonfatal incident; we don't want anybody else getting injured,\\" he said. The most recent fatal shark attack in the area was in 2008 when a swimmer was killed at Solana Beach. A more recent attack along the Camp Pendleton coast of north San Diego County was not fatal. Earlier this month, a man died after being bitten by a shark off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark while free-diving off Beacon's Beach in Encinitas, California. The teen was in critical but stable condition at Rady Children's Hospital after the attack that occurred during the opening hour of the state's popular spiny lobster season. A kayaker and his friends, who were off-duty first responders, rescued the teenager, pulling him into their kayak and attempting to stanch the bleeding as they headed for shore, pursued by the shark. Encinitas Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said Beacon's and other nearby beaches would be closed until further notice, and a surf contest was canceled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The first and second sentences present contradictory statements, which means that the truth of one implies the falsity of the other. We need to analyze each sentence to understand the implications. Sentence 1: \\"Uh, on my job we had a lot of Workmen's Comp cases.\\" This sentence indicates that there have been a significant number of Workmen's Compensation cases at the speaker's workplace. Workmen's Compensation cases are usually associated with injuries and illnesses incurred by employees during the course of their work. The presence of multiple cases suggests that there might be some safety concerns or hazardous working conditions in this particular workplace. Sentence 2: \\"There was never a Workmen's Comp case at my job.\\" In this statement, the speaker claims that there have never been any Workmen's Compensation cases in their workplace – essentially stating that the workplace has had no issues related to work-related injuries or illnesses. Given the contradictory nature of these two sentences, it is impossible for both to be true at the same time. If the first sentence is true (that there indeed were many Workmen's Comp cases at the workplace), then the second sentence must necessarily be false, as a significant number of cases negates the claim that there were none. On the other hand, if the second sentence is true (there were never any Workmen's Comp cases), then the first sentence is false, as it wrongly states that the workplace had many cases. In conclusion, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is false. They cannot both be true simultaneously due to their contradictory nature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Though researchers generally believe that sexual orientation is not determined by any one factor but by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, with biological factors involving a complex interplay of genetic factors and the early uterine environment, they favor biological models for the cause.

That is, individuals do not choose to be homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, or asexual. While current scientific investigation usually seeks to find biological explanations for the adoption of a particular sexual orientation, there are yet no replicated scientific studies supporting any specific biological etiology for sexual orientation.

Answer:","completion":"The question you asked is quite broad as there have been numerous individuals who have held the office of Chief Minister in different countries and states. Chief Minister is the executive head of government in a state or territory. For example, in India, each state has its own Chief Minister, while in the United Kingdom, First Ministers are the head of government in their respective devolved administrations, such as Scotland and Wales. To provide you with a comprehensive answer, I will mention a few notable Chief Ministers from various regions. 1. India: India has 28 states and 8 Union Territories, each with its own Chief Minister, making it impossible to list all of them here. However, a few notable individuals include: - Jawaharlal Nehru: The first Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh (1946–50), who later became the first Prime Minister of India. - Jyoti Basu: The longest-serving Chief Minister in India, who held the position for West Bengal from 1977 to 2000. - Jayalalithaa: A prominent female politician who served as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for several non-consecutive terms between 1991 and 2016. 2. United Kingdom: In the United Kingdom, the First Ministers are the leaders of their respective devolved administrations, and a few notable individuals include: - Nicola Sturgeon: The current First Minister of Scotland, serving since 2014. - Mark Drakeford: The current First Minister of Wales, in office since 2018. - Arlene Foster: The former First Minister of Northern Ireland, who held the position from 2016 to 2021. 3. Australia: In Australia, each state has a Premier who acts as the Chief Minister. A few noteworthy examples are: - Daniel Andrews: The current Premier of Victoria, serving since 2014. - Gladys Berejiklian: The former Premier of New South Wales, who held the position from 2017 to 2021. - Annastacia Palaszczuk: The current Premier of Queensland, in office since 2015. 4. Canada: In Canada, the term \\"Premier\\" is used instead of \\"Chief Minister\\" for the head of government in each province or territory. A few notable Premiers include: - John Horgan: The current Premier of British Columbia, serving since 2017. - François Legault: The current Premier of Quebec, in office since 2018. - Doug Ford: The current Premier of Ontario, in office since 2018. These are just a few examples of Chief Ministers, First Ministers, or Premiers from different regions around the world.

These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them.

Edison attempted to counter this advantage by introducing Amberol cylinders in 1909, which could play for 4½ minutes at 160 rpm.

Answer:","completion":"William II, Margrave of Meissen, also known as Wilhelm the Rich, was born on 23 April 1371. He was the second son of Margrave Frederick \\"the Strict\\" of Meissen and Catherine of Henneberg. His mother, Catherine of Henneberg, was born in approximately 1334 and died on 15 July 1397. She was a member of the House of Henneberg, a German noble family whose rule extended across parts of Thuringia, Franconia, Hesse, and today's Bavaria. Catherine was the daughter of Count Heinrich II of Henneberg and his wife, Jutta of Brandenburg-Salzwedel. His father, Frederick \\"the Strict\\" of Meissen, was born on 30 November 1332 and died on 21 May 1381. He was a prominent member of the House of Wettin and held the title of Margrave of Meissen, which was a noble rank equivalent to a medieval marquess or a modern ranking of a crown prince. Regarding his spouse, it is said that William II might have been married to Amelia of Mazovia, a Polish noblewoman. However, this information is debated, and according to historian Karlheinz Blaschke, it is likely that he remained unmarried throughout his life. William II, along with his brothers Frederick I, the Elector of Saxony, and George, jointly inherited the Osterland and Landsberg under the division of Chemnitz in 1382. When Margrave William I \\"the One-eyed\\" died in 1407, William II and his brother Frederick I also inherited part of Meissen.

The most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind (i.e. gale force), the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI), and the radius of vanishing wind. An additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to 1×10−5 s−1.On Earth, tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes, from 100–2,000 kilometres (62–1,243 mi) as measured by the radius of vanishing wind. They are largest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin. If the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two degrees of latitude (222 km (138 mi)), then the cyclone is \\"very small\\" or a \\"midget\\". A radius of 3–6 latitude degrees (333–670 km (207–416 mi)) is considered \\"average sized\\". \\"Very large\\" tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8 degrees (888 km (552 mi)). Observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed), radius of maximum wind, latitude, and maximum potential intensity.Size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. Additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch, longer duration, and enhanced wave setup.The upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the atmosphere, which at low latitudes is 15,000–18,000 metres (50,000–60,000 ft).

Murray Newton Rothbard (; March 2, 1926 - January 7, 1995) was an American heterodox economist of the Austrian School, a historian, and a political theorist whose writings and personal influence played a seminal role in the development of modern right-libertarianism. Rothbard was the founder and leading theoretician of anarcho-capitalism, a staunch advocate of historical revisionism, and a central figure in the twentieth-century American libertarian movement. In 1953, in New York City, he married JoAnn Schumacher (1928-1999), whom he called Joey. JoAnn was his editor and a close adviser, as well as hostess of his \\"Rothbard Salon\\". They enjoyed a loving marriage, and Rothbard often called her \\"the indispensable framework\\" behind his life and achievements. According to Joey, patronage from the Volker Fund allowed Rothbard to work from home as a freelance theorist and pundit for the first fifteen years of their marriage. The Fund collapsed in 1962, leading Rothbard to seek employment from various New York academic institutions. He was offered a part-time position teaching economics to the engineering students of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1966, at age 40. This institution had no economics department or economics majors, and Rothbard derided its social science department as \\"Marxist.\\" However, Justin Raimondo writes that Rothbard liked his role with Brooklyn Polytechnic because working only two days a week gave him freedom to contribute to developments in libertarian politics. Rothbard continued in this role for twenty years, until 1986. Then 60 years old, Rothbard left Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute for the Lee Business School at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he held the title of S.J. Hall Distinguished Professor of Economics, an endowed chair paid for by a libertarian businessman. According to Rothbard's friend, colleague and fellow Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Rothbard led a \\"fringe existence\\" in academia, but was able to attract a large number of \\"students and disciples\\" through his writings, thereby becoming \\"the creator and one of the principal agents of the contemporary libertarian movement.\\" Rothbard maintained his position at UNLV from 1986 until his death. Rothbard founded the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1976 and the Journal of Libertarian Studies in 1977. In 1982, he co-founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama, and was vice president of academic affairs until 1995. The Institute's Review of Austrian Economics, a heterodox economics journal later renamed the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics, was also founded by Rothbard in 1987. After Rothbard's death, Joey reflected on Rothbard's happiness and bright spirit. \\"...he managed to make a living for 40 years without having to get up before noon. This was important to him.\\" She recalled how Rothbard would begin every day with a phone conversation with his colleague Llewellyn Rockwell. \\"Gales of laughter would shake the house or apartment, as they checked in with each other. Murray thought it was the best possible way to start a day.\\" Rothbard was irreligious and agnostic toward the existence of God, describing himself as a \\"mixture of an agnostic and a Reform Jew.\\" Despite identifying as an agnostic and an atheist, Rothbard was critical of the \\"left-libertarian hostility to religion\\". In Rothbard's later years, many of his friends anticipated that he would convert to Catholicism, but he never did. The New York Times obituary called Rothbard \\"an economist and social philosopher who fiercely defended individual freedom against government intervention.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: When did he get married?","completion":"Murray Rothbard got married in 1953.

But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The answer to the question: Who does Elsa Brinkman start to fall in love with? is inside the article: Agent Bart Langner finds Elsa Brinkmann, a would-be actress who looks and sounds just like Lylah Clare, a flamboyant star who fell to her death in suspicious circumstances 20 years ago. He persuades arrogant director Lewis Zarkan, who had been married to Lylah, to see her. The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean, who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah. Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella. As filming continues, her identification with her rôle gets more intense. She also begins to fall in love with Zarkan, who is happy to sleep with her but his priority is to get his film finished. By the last day of shooting, her personality seems to have merged with that of the outrageous Lylah whose fatal fall, we learn, was prompted by the jealous Zarkan. To antagonise him, she first lets him find her in bed with the gardener. Then, as he directs her in a circus scene, she leaps to her death from the high-wire. The resulting publicity makes his film a huge success. Tragedy later comes when Zarkan himself is shot and killed by Rossella. A final sequence (in this case, a TV commercial for dog food that interrupts the film itself) suggests that the world of Hollywood is literally one of dog eats dog., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"Elsa Brinkmann starts to fall in love with the director, Lewis Zarkan. In the article, it is mentioned that Elsa is persuaded by Agent Bart Langner and Zarkan to participate in a film where she would play the role of Lylah Clare, Zarkan's late flamboyant wife who passed away 20 years ago under suspicious circumstances. As the filming progresses, Elsa's identification with her role becomes more intense, and she develops feelings for Zarkan. Although Zarkan sleeps with Elsa, his primary focus remains on completing the film. Ultimately, their tragic and complicated relationship seems to reflect the fallen star Lylah's story, culminating in Elsa's death, similar to Lylah's, and Zarkan's eventual murder by Rossella.

By the middle 1950s, he had become one of the best-loved and most successful children's book writers in the world. His books are very popular with young readers. They enjoy the invented words and the pictures of unusual funny animals and plants. In 1954, life magazine published a report about school children who could not read. The report said many children's books were not interesting. Doctor Seuss strongly hoped to help children and decided to write books that were interesting and easy to read. He used words with the same ending sound, like fish and wish. He did not receive training in art. Yet, he drew the pictures for most of his books. In 1957, Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat. He used less than 230 words to write the book and even a six-year-old should be able to read it. It was a fun story and easy to read. Children loved it. Their parents loved it, too. Today it is still one of the stories they like best. The success of The Cat in the Hat made him want to write more books for children. In 1960, he wrote a book using less than fifty words. The book is called Green Eggs and Ham. In 1984, Doctor Seuss won a Pulitzer Prize . He was honored for the education and enjoyment his books provided American children and their parents. He died at the age of 87, but his influence remains. Millions of his books have been sold worldwide. People say his books helped change the way American children learned to read. Yet, his books are loved by people of all ages. Doctor Seuss once said, \\"I do not write for children. I write for people.\\" Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

Article: The Gunpowder Plot was conspiracy to kill King James I, as well as the members of the House of Lords and Commons at the re-opening of Parliament. It was designed by a group of Catholics in protest against the anti-Catholic laws that were being introduced by the king. Robert Catesby was the leader of the group. It was he and his cousin, Thomas Wintour, and two other friends, Thomas Percy and John Wright, who formed the center of the group. They were joined by nine more men; among them was Guy Fawkes, from the city of York in the north of England. Fawkes found a store room directly under the House of Lords and rented it out under the false name of John Johnson. The conspirators stored thirty-six barrels of gunpowder there, and Fawkes, who was an explosives expert, was to light the fuses on 5th November 1605. The plot failed because one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, sent a letter to his relative, who was a member of the House of Lords. The letter warned him not to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament. The letter was passed on to the authorities, who took action. Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar on the night of 4th November with the thirty-six barrels and a number of fuses. He was imprisoned and ill-treated, eventually giving away the names of the conspirators. Soldiers of the king surrounded Holbeach House, in the Midlands, where they knew the conspirators to be hiding. In the fight that followed, four of them were shot dead, including Catesby and Percy, who were actually killed by the same bullet. The others were imprisoned and hanged along with Guy Fawkes on 31st January 1606. These days, on 5th November, children all over Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by building huge bonfires and lighting fireworks. It's a family tradition and an occasion to eat potatoes baked by the flames. There is always a 'guy' on top of the fire, a model of Guy Fawkes, dressed in the clothes of the 17th century.

I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

On selvää, että toimenpiteiden käyttöönotto pankkien tarjoaman tiedon standardoimiseksi on välttämätöntä, jotta kuluttajat voivat tehokkaasti arvioida ja vertailla eri pankkipalveluita ja tuotteita. Tämä auttaa heitä löytämään itselleen parhaiten sopivan vaihtoehdon ja mahdollistaa paremman kilpailun finanssialalla. Ensimmäinen askel tiedon standardoimiseksi voisi olla selvien ja ymmärrettävien käyttöehtojen luominen, jotka kattavat kaikki pankkituotteet ja -palvelut. Tämä tarkoittaa, että pankkien tulisi käyttää yhteistä terminologiaa ja esittää hinnat ja kulut selkeällä ja yksinkertaisella tavalla. Tämän ansiosta kuluttajat voivat helposti verrata eri pankkien tarjouksia samalla mittakaavalla. Lisäksi pankkien tulisi parantaa avoimuuttaan ja tiedonantoaan. Tämä voi tarkoittaa, että pankkien on julkaistava selkeät ja helposti saatavilla olevat tiedot tuotteistaan ja palveluistaan verkkosivuillaan sekä asiakaspalvelussaan. Tietoja on myös päivitettävä säännöllisesti, jotta kuluttajat saavat aina ajantasaiset tiedot käytössään. Yksi tapa edistää vertailukelpoisen tiedon saatavuutta on luoda keskitetty, puolueeton ja helppokäyttöinen verkkosivusto, joka sisältää kaikki tarvittavat tiedot eri pankkien tarjoamista tuotteista ja palveluista. Tämä sivusto voisi toimia apuna kuluttajille, jotka etsivät itselleen sopivaa pankkituotetta tai -palvelua, ja auttaa heitä tekemään tietoon perustuvan päätöksen. Lopuksi on tärkeää, että pankkien tiedon standardointitoimenpiteisiin liittyvät määräykset ja ohjeistukset ovat selkeitä, ja että valvontaviranomaiset valvovat niiden noudattamista. Tämä varmistaa, että kaikki markkinoilla toimivat pankit noudattavat samoja sääntöjä ja että kuluttajille annetaan tasapuoliset ja yhdenmukaiset tiedot vertailun pohjaksi. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että pankkien tarjoaman tiedon standardoiminen on välttämätöntä, jotta kuluttajat voivat vertailla eri vaihtoehtoja helpommin ja valita itselleen sopivimman pankkituotteen tai -palvelun. Tämä edellyttää selkeiden käyttöehtojen, avoimuuden ja tiedonannon parantamisen sekä keskitetyn vertailutietosivuston luomista. Samalla on tärkeää, että valvontaviranomaiset valvovat näiden toimenpiteiden noudattamista ja varmistavat, että pankit toimivat yhdenmukaisesti ja vastuullisesti."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do not buy this and, if you must use this bc your boss gives it to you, buy a Pearlcorder or even a Panasonic, pay for it yourself if your boss won't, because it will save you hours and hours of frustration. You could probably use a Dora the Explorer or Barbie Doll tape player to better effect that this trashy Sony, in my opinion.P.S. I gave it one star bc this site won't let you give zero or negative stars. .S Answer:","completion":"After reading the review, I would conclude that this review would decrease the chances of me buying the product. Step 1: Analyze the reviewer's experience. The reviewer states that they have received the product from multiple employers and even bought one on their own. This indicates that they have had multiple experiences with the product, which provides credibility to their review. Step 2: Assess the reviewer's opinion on the product's price. The reviewer mentions that the product is inexpensive compared to other transcribers on the market. While this might be seen as a positive aspect, the reviewer argues that the low price may be a reflection of the product's poor quality. Step 3: Evaluate the reviewer's issues with the product. The reviewer claims to have thrown away numerous micro-cassettes, thinking they were faulty, before realizing that the problem lay with the transcriber itself. This suggests that the product's performance is significantly below expectations and may cause costly mistakes. Step 4: Consider the reviewer's recommendations. The reviewer urges potential buyers not to purchase the product and even suggests buying a different brand or model, even if it means paying out of pocket. This implies a strong negative sentiment about the product and that alternatives are likely to offer a better experience. Step 5: Take note of the overall rating. The reviewer gives the product a one-star rating, only because the site doesn't allow for zero or negative stars. This further emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the product. In summary, the reviewer's negative experience with the product, their frustrations, and their strong recommendation against purchasing it would decrease the chances of me buying the product."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Walter. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it. Suicide. Walter wasn't suicidal. I know that, know it for a fact. But he is dead. Why? I am not foolish enough to suspect \\"foul play\\" as they say in the mystery stories. No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either. He was a little crazy, but not that kind of crazy. Still I keep half expecting to pick up my voice and hear his voice yell, \\"Gotcha!\\" But it is no joke. I know he is dead. (Later) Got a package today. From Walter. Scary considering what I wrote about expecting him to call. I can't express the chill I got when I saw his name on the label. A message from the dead. Surely it's not a good Omen. It's a painting. Or at least I think it is. The package is the right shape, and knowing Walter it seems likely, but...I haven't yet worked up the courage to open it yet. I'm afraid of what I might find. April 3, 2006 Went to the funeral today. Walter's wife, Martha, was in hysterics. Can't say I blame her.

Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. those areas that are close to the work of large equipment, electronic devices, locations of harmful emissions, etc., called tehnopatogennymi. Make this proper case.","completion":"Tehnopatogennymi areas, also known as technopathogenic zones, are specific locations close to the operation of large equipment, electronic devices, or areas with harmful emissions. These areas are characterized by the potentially adverse impact on human health, the environment, and overall well-being. In these zones, the presence of man-made sources substantially contributes to an unhealthy environment. Technopathogenic areas can also impede the functioning of electronic devices and generate safety hazards to the population. Some of the most prominent examples of tehnopatogennymi zones consist of sites near industrial facilities, power plants, telecommunication towers, and electronic waste disposal areas. Other examples include areas with high levels of air and noise pollution or those exposed to hazardous substances. People living or working in tehnopatogennymi zones can experience a wide range of negative health effects, including respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. Prolonged exposure to harmful emissions and electromagnetic radiation can lead to a decreased quality of life and an increased risk of developing chronic health conditions. The adverse impact of tehnopatogennymi zones is not limited to human health. The surrounding environment can also experience significant degradation in these areas. Habitats for native plants and animals can be disrupted, leading to a loss of biodiversity and imbalances within local ecosystems. Furthermore, soil and water contamination can occur, threatening the availability and quality of essential natural resources. To minimize the harmful effects of tehnopatogennymi areas, several measures can be taken by both the public and private sectors. These include: 1. Implementing strict regulations for the construction and operation of large industrial facilities, particularly those that produce hazardous emissions or generate significant noise pollution. 2. Encouraging the sustainable use of technology and fostering research to develop cleaner, more environmentally friendly methods for energy production, telecommunication, and waste disposal. 3. Establishing buffer zones or green spaces between tehnopatogennymi areas and residential communities to reduce exposure to harmful substances. 4. Conducting regular environmental monitoring and risk assessments to identify potential technopathogenic zones and the relevant health hazards they pose. This information can be used to inform the public, allowing them to make informed decisions about the proximity of their homes or workplaces to these areas. 5. Investing in public awareness campaigns and educational programs to inform the general public about the dangers associated with exposure to harmful emissions and electromagnetic radiation. This can lead to a change in behavior and encourage the adoption of preventative measures, such as using protective equipment or limiting the time spent in these areas. 6. Enhancing collaboration between government agencies, local authorities, industry stakeholders, and environmental organizations to formulate effective policies and strategies to manage and mitigate the negative impact of tehnopatogennymi zones on human health and the environment. In conclusion, tehnopatogennymi areas pose a significant threat to both human health and the environment. By implementing proper regulations, promoting sustainable technology, and increasing public awareness, we can work together to reduce the adverse effects of these dangerous zones and create a healthier, more sustainable world for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Entering a cave, two cavemen hunters stumble upon a large extraterrestrial life form. One is killed by the creature while the other one fights and wins, stabbing the creature to death, but he is also infected by a black oil-like substance which crawls into his skin. In 1998, in the same area, when a group of boys are digging a deep hole, a young boy named Stevie falls down the hole and finds a human skull. As he holds it, black oil seeps into his body until it reaches his head, causing his eyes to turn black. Later, four firefighters descend into the hole to rescue him, but do not come out. A team of biohazard-suited men arrives on the scene. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully have been assigned to other projects since the closure of the X-Files. They are helping investigate a bomb threat against a federal building in Dallas. Mulder inspects a building across the street from the supposed target and discovers the bomb in a vending machine. Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud stays behind to disarm the bomb as Mulder and Scully evacuate the building. Unknown to the agents, Michaud makes no effort to disarm the bomb, which detonates. Returning to Washington, D.C., Mulder and Scully are chastised because, in addition to Michaud, five people were apparently still in the building during the bombing. There are scheduled separate hearings at which their job performances will be evaluated. That evening, Mulder encounters a paranoid doctor, Alvin Kurtzweil, who explains that the victims were the firefighters and boy, that they were already dead, and that the bomb was allowed to detonate in order to destroy evidence of how they died.

Question: Process: - Green is a color that gathers sunlight easily - Sunlight is gathered by the leaves of the plant - The sunlight is broken down into glucose through photosynthesis - The glucose travels the plant - The plant uses that glucose as energy to grow. Question: suppose less pollution in the air happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"Less air pollution is expected to have a positive, or more effect on the process of photosynthesis, thereby influencing the production of more sugar (glucose) and oxygen in plants. To understand this, it's essential to note that photosynthesis is a process that heavily relies on the availability of sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide (CO2). Firstly, photosynthesis occurs when plants absorb sunlight through their green pigment, chlorophyll. This sunlight contributes to the chemical reaction that converts CO2 and water into glucose and oxygen. Glucose provides the necessary energy that allows plants to grow while oxygen is released back into the atmosphere. Under conditions of high pollution, the air is often filled with particulates and harmful gases such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. These pollutants can obstruct the sunlight from reaching the plants, thereby limiting the light energy that plants can absorb for photosynthesis. Furthermore, these pollutants can directly damage the stomata, the part of the plant where CO2 is absorbed, disrupting the intake of CO2, which is a critical component of photosynthesis. When the pollution levels are reduced, more sunlight can reach the green leaves of the plants, enhancing their ability to carry out photosynthesis. With more sunlight, the plants can break down more CO2 into glucose and subsequently produce more energy for growth. At the same time, the reduction of harmful gases means less damage to the stomata, boosting the plant's efficiency in absorbing CO2. This increase in CO2 absorption coupled with the availability of more sunlight leads to more glucose being produced. The increase in photosynthesis also means that more oxygen is being produced as a byproduct. This is because oxygen is released when water is broken down during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. So, less pollution allows a more efficient breakdown of water due to increased available sunlight, leading to more oxygen being produced. In conclusion, a decrease in air pollution would result in more sunlight and CO2 being available for photosynthesis. This increased availability leads to more glucose and oxygen being produced, facilitating the plant's growth and contributing to healthier and cleaner air. Therefore, it is fair to say that reduced pollution has a direct, positive, or 'more' effect on the photosynthesis process by allowing plants to produce more sugar and oxygen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as \\"probably the odd man out at that point\\", he stated he \\"didn't participate as much because of that\\". Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell.\\" King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and \\"added too much singing\\". Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: \\"There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that's me personally.

No. The right answer to the question \\"what produces a hormone that helps cells absorb sugar from the blood?\\" is not \\"the ribs.\\" The correct answer is \\"the pancreas.\\" The pancreas is a vital organ located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It serves two primary functions - an exocrine function, where it secretes enzymes into the small intestine for digestion, and an endocrine function, where it produces hormones like insulin and glucagon, which regulate and maintain proper blood sugar levels. Insulin is the specific hormone that assists cells in absorbing sugar (glucose) from the blood. When there is an increase in glucose levels in the blood after a meal, the pancreas releases insulin. Insulin then helps cells absorb the glucose by binding to receptors on the cell surface, enabling them to take up glucose from the bloodstream. In contrast, the ribs are part of the skeletal system and provide structural support to the thoracic cavity, protecting the organs inside, such as the heart and lungs. They do not have any function related to hormone secretion or blood sugar regulation.

However, the usage is so limited that federal laws and other official acts do not require to be decreed in Romansh. Romansh has its origins in the vulgar Latin spoken by the Romans, but due to its limited number of speakers, over the course of time, it has developed into several different dialects. Despite its minimal use, Switzerland has made efforts to preserve this linguistic part of its heritage. For instance, public broadcasting service, Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, provides television and radio news in Romansh. There are also newspapers, literature and music in the language, and some schools in the areas where it is spoken offer classes in Romansh. In conclusion, while Romansh is the least popular official language in Switzerland, it still serves a crucial role in representing the cultural and linguistic diversity of the nation, demonstrating the country's respect for its varied regional heritage and its commitment towards their preservation."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What form of operations you can do on a computer?\\" Context: \\"A computer does not need to be electronic, nor even have a processor, nor RAM, nor even a hard disk.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: Valerie Plame is employed by the Central Intelligence Agency, a fact known outside the agency to no one except her husband and parents. She is an agent involved in a number of sensitive and sometimes dangerous covert operations overseas.Her husband, Joseph C. Wilson, is a diplomat who most recently has served as a U.S. ambassador to Gabon, Sao Tome and Principe. Due to his extensive background, Wilson is approached by Plame's CIA colleagues to travel to Niger and glean information as to whether yellowcake uranium is being procured by Iraq for use in the construction of nuclear weasons. Wilson determines to his own satisfaction that it is not.After military action is taken by George W. Bush, who justifies it in a 2003 State of the Union address by alluding to the uranium's use in building weapons of mass destruction, Wilson submits an op-ed piece to the New York Times claiming these reports to be categorically untrue.Plame's status as a CIA agent is subsequently revealed in the media, the leak possibly coming from White House officials including the Vice President's chief of staff and national security adviser, Scooter Libby, in part to discredit her husband's allegation that the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq. As a result, Plame is instantly dismissed from the agency, leaving several of her delicate operations in limbo and creating a rift in her marriage.Plame leaves her husband, further angered by his granting of television and print interviews, which expose them both to public condemnation and death threats. Wilson ultimately persuades her, however, that there is no other way to fight a power as great as that of the White House for citizens like them. Plame returns to him and testifies before a Congressional committee, while Libby is convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice and given a 30-month prison sentence, although President Bush commutes the jail time on Libby's behalf. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given movie plot, a suitable question could be: How does Valerie Plame and her husband, Joseph C. Wilson, navigate the challenges they face after her identity as a CIA agent is leaked, and what consequences do the individuals responsible for the leak, especially Scooter Libby, face for their actions? The detailed answer: The main conflict in the story arises when Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA agent is leaked to the public, likely by White House officials, in an attempt to discredit her husband Joseph C. Wilson's claims that the Bush administration manipulated intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq. As a result, Plame's career with the CIA comes to a sudden end, and the couple faces public condemnation and even death threats. This not only disrupts their professional lives but also creates a rift in their marriage. Initially, Valerie Plame leaves her husband due to his decision to give interviews to television and print media. These interviews, meant to expose the truth, further expose the couple to public scrutiny and danger. However, Wilson ultimately convinces Plame that using media platforms is the only way for them to fight against the enormous power of the White House and make their voices heard. Reunited, Valerie Plame testifies before a Congressional committee to give her account of the events and to shed light on how her identity was leaked. The investigation leads to the conviction of Scooter Libby, the Vice President's chief of staff and national security adviser, on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. He is sentenced to 30 months in prison. However, President Bush decides to commute the jail time given to Libby, which demonstrates the power dynamics at play and the potential limitations in seeking justice against high-level political figures. Throughout the story, Valerie Plame and Joseph C. Wilson struggle to balance their personal and professional lives in the face of adversity. They learn the importance of standing up against an unjust system, despite the risks and potential personal consequences. The movie plot offers an interesting exploration of the abuse of power within the political landscape and the measures individuals must take to fight for truth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The home-schooling trend began in the U.S.in the 1980s with parents keeping their children out of public schools so they could provide religious education at home. Today,as the home-schooling trend continues to grow,parents are more likely to consider home schooling as an option because they believe schools don't do a very good job of teaching and are occasionally dangerous places.But can parents really do a better job? The answer in many cases is yes.In many studies,students taught at home ranked average or above average when compared to students who went to public schools.More importantly,these students were often more self-directed and have a greater depth of knowledge.They were well prepared for academic challenges.

Please answer this question: castaway whos story led to the novel robinson crusoe?","completion":"The story that led to the creation of the novel \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" is the real-life tale of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish sailor who was marooned on a deserted island and survived for more than four years. Born in 1676 in the coastal town of Lower Largo, Fife, Scotland, Selkirk was a headstrong and independent young man who would later inspire Daniel Defoe to write the classic novel. Before venturing on his own, Alexander Selkirk had sailed with the buccaneers, specifically under the command of English privateer and explorer, William Dampier. In 1703, he joined the expedition led by Dampier to plunder Spanish ships and territories in the Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans. Selkirk served as the sailing master aboard one of the vessels, the Cinque Ports, commanded by Captain Thomas Stradling. In 1704, the Cinque Ports and its companion ship, the St. George, had reached the Juan Fernández Islands off the coast of present-day Chile. At that point, the Cinque Ports was in poor condition, and Selkirk began to question its seaworthiness. He raised his concerns with Captain Stradling, advising him to have the ship repaired. However, Stradling dismissed Selkirk's concerns, and the two men's argument escalated to a boiling point. Selkirk, convinced of the ship's impending doom, insisted on being left behind on the uninhabited island of Más a Tierra (presently known as Robinson Crusoe Island). Realizing that his debate with Captain Stradling was fruitless, Selkirk managed to salvage a few belongings — including a musket, gunpowder, carpenter's tools, a knife, a Bible, some clothing, and navigation equipment — and requested to be left ashore. Stradling complied, and marooned Selkirk on the remote island. Despite his initial hardships, Selkirk proved to be incredibly resourceful and adaptable in his new environment. He used the resources available on the island to survive profoundly. He hunted wild goats, which had been introduced by earlier sailors, to obtain food and clothing. With the help of feral cats, he controlled the rat infestation, which threatened his food supply and safety. Furthermore, he cultivated vegetables, constructed two huts from local materials, and eventually found a level of comfort in his isolation. After over four years of living alone on the island, Selkirk was finally rescued on February 2, 1709, by the privateer vessel, the Duke, under the command of Woodes Rogers. Rogers wrote an account of Selkirk's ordeal, and the story became widely known in England. Daniel Defoe used Selkirk's astonishing tale as inspiration for his novel \\"Robinson Crusoe,\\" published in 1719, although he modified the story and added various fictional elements. Defoe's novel went on to achieve great success and literary significance, ultimately securing a place in the canon of world literature. Nevertheless, the real-life story of Alexander Selkirk's remarkable survival on a deserted island serves as a testament to human resilience and resourcefulness, transcending the boundaries of fiction and establishing itself as an iconic, adventurous, and inspiring tale."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why.

His work includes the Viriconium sequence of novels and short stories (1971-1984), Climbers (1989), and the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy, which consists of Light (2002), Nova Swing (2006) and Empty Space (2012). He is widely considered one of the major stylists of modern fantasy and science fiction, and a \\"genre contrarian\\". The Times Literary Supplement described him as 'a singular stylist' and the Literary Review called him 'a witty and truly imaginative writer'. Harrison's enduring fantasy sequence concerning the fictitious city of Viriconium consists of three novels and various short stories and novels written between 1971 and 1984. Viriconium is known as the Pastel City. Both universal and particular, the city has a shifting topography and history, and is sometimes known by names such as 'Uroconium'. The first book, The Pastel City (1971), presents a civilization in decline where medieval social patterns clash with the advanced technology and superscience energy weapons that the citizens of the city know how to use but have forgotten how to engineer. The more complex second novel is A Storm of Wings (1982). It is set eighty years later than The Pastel City. and stylistically it is far denser and more elaborate. A race of intelligent insects is invading Earth as human interest in survival wanes. Harrison brilliantly depicts the workings of civilization on the verge of collapse and the heroic efforts of individuals to help it sustain itself a little longer. The third novel, In Viriconium (1982) (US title: The Floating Gods), was nominated for the Guardian Fiction Prize during 1982. It is a moody portrait of artistic subcultures in a city beset by a mysterious plague. Where the previous books in the series held some sword and sorcery elements, In Viriconium goes beyond black humour into a coma of despair. The short story \\"A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium\\" (1985; later retitled \\"A Young Man's Journey to London\\") is set in our world. It explains that Viriconium can be visited via a mirror in a bathroom in a cafe in England.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what is storm of wings about?","completion":"A Storm of Wings, the second novel in the Viriconium sequence, is about a civilization that is on the verge of collapse.

The Time Traveler shows Jackie future television footage of the assassination and funeral of John F. Kennedy (Victor Slezak). Shortly thereafter, the Time Traveler speaks to the president and to Attorney General Bobby Kennedy (Vince Grant), giving them details of their respective assassinations and of the public revelations of JFK's sex scandals.

Mail the certificate to the pedigree association.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: How to Transfer Pet Ownership via a Registration Certificate Introduction Transferring the ownership of a pet is a vital step when giving or selling your beloved animal to a new owner. Legitimate organizations make use of registration certificates to ensure that the change of ownership is properly documented and authenticated. This article will guide you through the process of locating your pet's registration certificate, filling in the transfer information, and mailing the certificate to the pedigree association. Step 1: Locate the pet's registration certificate The very first step in transferring pet ownership is locating your pet's registration certificate. This document serves as the official record of your pet's pedigree and ownership history. It is issued by pedigree associations such as the American Kennel Club or the Cat Fanciers' Association, among others. Most pet owners receive this certificate upon the initial registration of their pet. If you have misplaced it or haven't yet received it, you can contact the pedigree association that your pet is registered with to acquire a replacement or verify if the pet is registered. Step 2: Fill in the transfer information on the back of the certificate Once you have the registration certificate in hand, turn it over and locate the transfer information section on the back. This section is where you will provide all the necessary details about the new owner, including their name, address, and contact information. It is essential to provide accurate details to ensure that the new owner is easily reachable should any issues arise. Double-check the information and confirm with the new owner to avoid any errors or confusion. Step 3: Sign the certificate as the old owner As the current owner of the pet, you will need to record your signature on the registration certificate to officially transfer the ownership to the new owner. Be sure to sign legibly and include the date of transfer alongside your signature. It is a good idea to use a pen with permanent ink to avoid smudging or fading over time. It's also recommended to make a photocopy of the completed and signed certificate for your records before mailing it to the pedigree association. Step 4: Mail the certificate to the pedigree association The final step in the process is to mail the signed registration certificate to the pedigree association responsible for issuing the document. Choose a secure and reliable method for mailing the certificate, such as registered mail or a courier with tracking capabilities. Check if the association has specific mailing instructions that you need to follow. Be sure to follow these guidelines to prevent any delays in processing the transfer. Conclusion Transferring pet ownership through a registration certificate may seem like a daunting task, but following these steps will make the process much simpler. By locating and filling in the transfer information on the certificate, and mailing it to the pedigree association, you are safeguarding your pet's pedigree records and ensuring a smooth transition for both the new owner and your beloved animal companion. Remember always to double-check the accuracy of the information on the certificate and to use secure mailing methods for the safe and timely transfer of the documentation.

Hence, the question is about what might happen if he continues to or starts drinking again. Possible consequences of continued or resumed drinking could include: 1. Strained family relationships: The man's drinking may lead to conflicts, arguments, and emotional distress within his family, which could damage trust and the emotional bonds between family members. This might further hinder communication and increase frustration in the relationships with his spouse and children. 2. Health issues: Excessive alcohol consumption over time could result in several health problems both in the short and long term. Short-term impacts may include hangovers, nausea, and headaches. Prolonged alcohol abuse can lead to liver damage, heart disease, elevated blood pressure, neurological damage, and in some cases, even cancer. 3. Financial instability: The financial burden of alcohol consumption to support his habit could lead to monetary instability. He may struggle to meet the needs of his family, experience difficulties in maintaining a steady job, and encounter increased debts or loans. 4. Mental health concerns: Alcohol abuse could contribute to the development or exacerbation of mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety. This may further strain interpersonal relationships and affect his overall quality of life. 5. Decreased job performance and career impacts: Alcohol consumption could impair his cognitive abilities, concentrating, and decision-making skills at his job. This could lead to a decline in job performance, which in turn may result in job loss, long-term unemployment, or difficulties in finding new career opportunities. 6. Addiction and dependency: If the man starts drinking again, he may be prone to developing alcohol dependence or addiction, which could be extremely challenging to overcome without professional help or support from friends and family. 7. Legal problems: Alcohol consumption may lead to risky behaviors that could result in legal issues, such as driving under the influence (DUI), engagement in public altercations, and domestic disputes. Legal problems may also cause additional financial strains and further damage family life. 8. Loss of personal interests: With the focus on alcohol consumption, he may lose interest in previously enjoyed hobbies and activities, negatively impacting his personal development and family relationships. As such, the consequences of the man's potential drinking habits could have negative effects on his health, financial stability, relationships, and overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which test saw higher concentrations of the products, test C or test D? Hint: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information and Le Chatelier's principle, test C observed a forward reaction while test D observed a reverse reaction. When a forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. Conversely, when the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. Therefore, test C saw higher concentrations of the products in comparison to test D. In test C, the stress applied to the system caused the forward reaction to be favored, leading to an increase in product concentrations and a decrease in reactant concentrations as the system tried to establish a new equilibrium. In test D, however, the system responded to the applied stress by favoring the reverse reaction, causing the product concentrations to decrease and the reactant concentrations to increase, as the system attempted to counteract the stress and establish a new equilibrium position."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Short movie review: promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"To determine the critic's thinking, I will analyze the given short movie review: \\"promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip.\\" Step 1: Identify the phrases that describe the movie A. \\"promises a new kind of high\\" - This suggests an expectation of a unique and interesting experience. B. \\"delivers the same old bad trip\\" - This implies that the movie failed to live up to its expected promise and provided a negative experience similar to other bad movies. Step 2: Analyze the overall tone of the review The tone in phrase A seems initially positive due to the mention of \\"a new kind of high.\\" However, phrase B presents a contrasting and negative outcome, as the movie ends up delivering \\"the same old bad trip.\\" Step 3: Determine the critic's overall opinion As the review concludes with a negative description of the movie, it shows that the movie failed to meet the promising expectations. This indicates that the critic's opinion is negative, not positive. Conclusion: The critic was thinking negatively of the movie. Therefore, the answer is (1) negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

First, we need to isolate the variable i by getting it on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 115*i from both sides of the equation. 120*i - 115*i = 115*i - 115*i 5*i = 0 Now, we need to solve for i. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 5. 5*i / 5 = 0 / 5 i = 0 So the solution for i is 0.

What is the best way to: microwave bowl Available options: 1. can hold ideas 2. can hold carrots Answer:","completion":"The best way to microwave a bowl depends on what you're trying to achieve. If you want to heat up its contents, the best approach would be: 1. Choose the right type of bowl: Make sure the bowl is microwave-safe. This means it should not have any metallic parts, should not be plastic or melamine, and should be labeled as microwave-safe. 2. Choose the content: Based on the available options, it seems like the goal is to either heat up ideas or carrots. Since ideas can't be heated physically, the best choice would be to use the bowl to hold and heat carrots. Step-by-step process: 1. Prepare the carrots: Wash, peel, and cut the carrots into desired shapes and sizes. 2. Place the carrots in the microwave-safe bowl: Ensure the bowl is spacious enough to avoid overcrowding the carrots. This way, they will heat up evenly. 3. Cover the bowl: Use a microwave-safe lid or a microwave-safe plate to cover the bowl. This helps retain moisture and steam, which aids in cooking the carrots evenly. 4. Set the microwave: Adjust the microwave power to medium or around 50% of its total capacity. This is a good starting point to ensure the carrots don't overcook too quickly. 5. Microwave the carrots: Heat the carrots in the microwave for around 3-4 minutes. Keep an eye on them and check every minute or so to ensure they don't overcook or burn. Stir the carrots to ensure even cooking. 6. Check for desired tenderness: After 3-4 minutes, check the carrots for tenderness by inserting a fork into one of the carrot pieces. If the fork goes in easily, the carrots are ready. If not, continue microwaving in 1-minute increments until they reach the desired tenderness. 7. Carefully remove the bowl: Use oven mitts or a towel to remove the hot bowl from the microwave. Be cautious when lifting the lid or plate covering the bowl, as steam may escape. 8. Serve and enjoy: Use a serving utensil to transfer the cooked carrots onto plates, or serve them directly from the bowl.

Sentence from a movie review: utter mush ... conceited pap Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the given sentence from the movie review, it is evident that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer. The terms \\"utter mush\\" and \\"conceited pap\\" clearly imply that the reviewer had a strong negative reaction to the movie and did not find it enjoyable or well-made. \\"Utter mush\\" suggests that the reviewer found the movie to be lacking in substance, coherence, and overall quality. This term implies that the movie failed to engage the reviewer intellectually or emotionally, leaving them disappointed and unfulfilled. Moreover, it might indicate that the plot was overly sentimental, clichéd, or poorly executed, resulting in a lackluster viewing experience. \\"Conceited pap\\" further emphasizes the negative perception of the movie. The word \\"conceited\\" implies arrogance, self-importance, or an inflated sense of the movie's own worth. Thus, the reviewer might be expressing that the movie overestimated its own value, possibly with pretentious themes or an unwarranted air of superiority. The term \\"pap,\\" on the other hand, denotes something of little substance or value, usually indicating bland, insipid, or uninspiring content. In the context of a movie review, this suggests that the movie was unoriginal and dull, failing to leave any meaningful impact on the reviewer. In conclusion, based on the reviewer's use of the phrases \\"utter mush\\" and \\"conceited pap,\\" it is certain that they viewed the movie negatively. These terms communicate an unfavorable reaction to the movie's quality, content, and overall impact, painting a picture of a weak and disappointing viewing experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Options: - enlightenment - confusion - loss of innocence - solution - sadness Explain why a human would choose \\"sadness\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human might choose \\"sadness\\" as the answer to the question because learning about world poverty can evoke strong emotions and empathy, especially when confronted with the harsh realities of poverty and its effects on individuals and communities. There are several reasons why learning about world poverty could lead to feelings of sadness: 1. Empathy: As humans, we are capable of empathizing with the pain and suffering of others. When we learn about people living in extreme poverty, it is natural to feel sad for the hardships they face daily, such as lack of access to food, clean water, healthcare, and education. 2. Inequality: Learning about world poverty can create a sense of sadness due to the vast inequalities that exist between the various countries and communities. People may feel disheartened knowing that some individuals have abundant resources, while others struggle to meet their basic needs. 3. Helplessness: The enormity of the poverty problem might make some individuals feel overwhelmed and helpless, which can lead to a sense of sadness. They might be uncertain about how to contribute towards solving the issue or may feel that their efforts could be insignificant in the larger scheme of things. 4. Reflection on own privilege: Gaining awareness about world poverty can force individuals to confront their own privilege and disparities in their lives compared to those in poverty. This realization can lead to feelings of guilt, which may contribute to overall sadness. 5. Challenges to beliefs: Learning about world poverty can challenge one's long-held beliefs or assumptions about the world, potentially leading to sadness. For example, if a person believed that the world was mostly fair and just, knowing about the extent of poverty might make them question that perspective. While learning about world poverty can lead to sadness for these reasons, that same awareness can also inspire empathy, action, and a desire for a more equitable world, encouraging people to work towards meaningful solutions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While both inquire about the potential replacement for social media, they distinctly differ in the time frame being considered. The first question, \\"What will replace social media?\\" is open-ended in regard to when this shift might occur. The query might be asking about potential future developments, whether near or far, that could potentially supplant the prevalence and influence of social media. This inquiry might lead to discussion on a range of advancements in technology or societal shifts like augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, or even possibilities like a mass return to more traditional forms of communication due to potential feelings of overload or negative effects from current social media usage. On the other hand, the second question, \\"What will replace social media in 2016?\\" confines the discussion to what could or did replace social media during that specific year. Since 2016 has already passed, this question can only be addressed by looking at historical data and technological trends of that period. Given that we know social media use continued to grow in and after 2016, with platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter maintaining strong presences and new platforms like TikTok beginning to make their mark in the years that followed, it is clear that no significant replacement occurred during that year.

He has voted in every single election since 1951-52 - when India held its first general election after gaining independence from British rule. Indians began voting in a nine-phase election on Monday. Voting will take five weeks, with results due on 16 May. More than 814 million people are eligible to vote in a poll dominated by corruption and high inflation. Mr Negi, who lives in the Himalayan village of Kalpa in Kinnaur district, will cast his vote on 7 May, the day voting will be held in all five seats of Himachal Pradesh. The Election Commission of India has held him up as an example to others, and Google India recently put out a video on Mr Negi - #PledgeToVote tells the \\"true story of a man who never missed an opportunity to vote\\". Election Commission of India Since the video went up on 24 March, it has been viewed by nearly 1.7 million people around the world. The short film begins with Mr Negi sipping tea at home, looking out at the spectacular snow covered peaks. Then, he puts on his coat and cap, picks up his walking stick and begins his journey to the polling centre. Walking upright and sure-footed on the snow-covered road which winds through apple orchards and pine woods, he arrives at the polling station to a grand welcome by fellow tribespeople before casting his vote. The film also describes Mr Negi as the country's first voter - it says that independent India's first polling station was set up at Kalpa months before elections were held in the rest of India in February 1952. \\"Before the roads got blocked in deep winter, we voted several months ahead of the rest of India on 25 October 1951,\\" Mr Negi says. \\"Since then I have voted in every general election and the state assembly elections. On 7 May, I will vote for a record 16th time [in a general election],\\" he adds. The video has him saying: \\"I still remember that day all those years ago. It was snowing heavily as I walked to vote for the first time.\\" Mr Negi refuses to divulge which party has his support. \\"I will vote for a party which will sincerely attempt to change the country and provide a good government.\\" He is not particularly excited by the Nota (None of The Above) option the Election Commission has introduced for the first time in these elections. Nota gives the voter an option to reject all candidates. \\"I am not in favour of Nota.

One day, Kevin traveled from his home in the United States of America to Erin's house in England. They then thought to take a sudden trip around the world. They first traveled by plane around Europe, where they saw many different people and sights. They then took a boat to Africa and Asia, where they went on a trip through the mountains. Later in the month, they traveled to China by train and were allowed to see how different life was over there. Next they took another plane to Australia, where they had a lot of fun seeing kangaroos and a different type of English speaking people. After spending a week in Australia, Kevin and Erin took a really long plane ride to North America, where they drove across the land. They saw everything from the mountains to forests.

Information: - In zoological nomenclature, a subphylum is a taxonomic rank below the rank of phylum. - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. - Starfish or sea stars are star-shaped echinoderms belonging to the class Asteroidea. Common usage frequently finds these names being also applied to ophiuroids, which are correctly referred to as brittle stars or \\"basket stars\\". About 1,500 species of starfish occur on the seabed in all the world's oceans, from the tropics to frigid polar waters. They are found from the intertidal zone down to abyssal depths, below the surface. - Tube feet are small active tubular projections on the oral face of an echinoderm, whether the arms of a starfish, or the undersides of sea urchins, sand dollars and sea cucumbers. They are part of the water vascular system. - The term sand dollar (or sea cookie or snapper biscuit in New Zealand, or pansy shell in South Africa) refers to species of extremely flattened, burrowing sea urchins belonging to the order Clypeasteroida. Some species within the order, not quite as flat, are known as sea biscuits. Related animals include other sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and starfish. - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\" \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\" \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives. - Eleutherozoa is a subphylum of echinoderms . They are mobile animals with the mouth directed towards the substrate . They usually have a madreporite , tube feet , and moveable spines of some sort , and some have Tiedemann 's bodies on the ring canal . All living echinoderms except Crinoidea belong here . - The madreporite is a lightcolored calcareous opening used to filter water into the water vascular system of echinoderms. It acts like a pressure-equalizing valve. It is visible as a small red or yellow button-like structure, looking like a small wart, on the aboral surface of the central disk of a sea star. Close up, it is visibly structured, resembling a \\"madrepore\\" (stone coral, Scleractinia) colony. From this, it derives its name. - Scleractinia, also called stony corals or hard corals, are marine animals in the phylum Cnidaria that live on the seabed and build themselves a hard skeleton. The individual animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc with a mouth and a fringe of tentacles. Although some species are solitary, most are colonial. The founding polyp settles on the seabed and starts to secrete calcium carbonate to protect its soft body. Solitary corals can be as much as across but in colonial species the polyps are usually only a few millimetres in diameter. These polyps reproduce by budding but remain attached to each other, forming a multi-polyp colony with a common skeleton, which may be up to several metres in diameter or height according to species. - Sea urchins or urchins, archaically called sea hedgehogs, are small, spiny, globular animals that, with their close kin, such as sand dollars, constitute the class Echinoidea of the echinoderm phylum. About 950 species of echinoids inhabit all oceans from the intertidal to deep. The shell, or \\"test\\", of sea urchins is round and spiny, typically from across. Common colors include black and dull shades of green, olive, brown, purple, blue, and red. Sea urchins move slowly, feeding primarily on algae. Sea otters, starfish, wolf eels, triggerfish, and other predators hunt and feed on sea urchins. Their roe is a delicacy in many cuisines. The name \\"urchin\\" is an old word for hedgehog, which sea urchins resemble. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'. A:","completion":"Subject Entity: Subphylum Eleutherozoa Object Entity: Phylum Echinodermata The relation of 'parent taxon' is present between Subphylum Eleutherozoa and Phylum Echinodermata, as Eleutherozoa is a subphylum under the phylum Echinodermata."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: The apparent silence of IS sources on the issue could be evidence that something has happened to al-Baghdadi. But there was a similar lack of official IS denial of rumours that the group's spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, had been killed in air strikes earlier this year - something that later turned out to be unfounded. A Twitter account purportedly belonging to Adnani has claimed Baghdadi should be on his way to a speedy recovery, but the account is almost certainly fake, as it refers to Adnani in the third person at one point. Were it real, Twitter would have deleted it some time ago, having cracked down on all traces of an official IS presence on its platform. Regardless of the veracity of the present reports, it is of interest to assess what impact Baghdadi's death would have on the fortunes of IS. IS is heavily invested in the image of Baghdadi, who had projected himself as a caliph for a year before a caliphate was declared in June 2014. One of the signs of this was Baghdadi's original declaration rebranding the group as Isis - the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant- in April 2013, an evolution from the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI). Isis implied an Islamic state entity whose presence in Iraq and Syria was a mere geographic accident, and subject to future expansion. ISI on the other hand, had implied an independent emirate that could perhaps be subsumed into the long-term global project of al-Qaeda. The shift from ISI to Isis was marked with slogans such as \\"the promised project of the caliphate\\" and songs like \\"Close ranks and pledge allegiance to Baghdadi\\". Thus, IS's basis for claiming to be a state and caliphate is closely tied to Baghdadi's persona, which initially thrived on hiding behind audio messages. Key also to Baghdadi's legitimacy in the eyes supporters is his claimed lineage from the Prophet Muhammad's family and tribe, as well as scholarly knowledge of religious jurisprudence. The problem then is to find a viable successor to Baghdadi in the event of his death. No other figure in IS is publicly cultivated to claim the position of caliph, with credentials of education in Islamic law. In addition, the persona of Baghdadi is credited with ISI's rise, to a transnational entity that controls contiguous territory and has all the trappings of a state. Senior figures within IS - such as members of the Shura Council, which supposedly gave legitimacy to the caliphate declaration - remain otherwise unknown. Nothing suggests that other high-ranking IS figures, such as Adnani and field commanders such as Omar Shishani and Shaker Abu Waheeb, are being projected as potential successors to Baghdadi. Therefore IS could find itself in disarray in the event of Baghdadi's death if it cannot immediately achieve consensus on a successor who can live up to his legacy and command allegiance from the world's Muslims. Indeed, the group's rank-and-file is by no means monolithic. Many members - particularly from likeminded jihadi groups such as Jamaat Ansar al-Islam- have pledged allegiance on the notion that IS is a \\"winning horse\\" that can project itself as a caliphate. If that credibility disappears, the pledges of allegiance, which it should be noted are made to Baghdadi as \\"caliph of the Muslims\\", could well vanish. Members would then revert to their original group identities, reducing Islamic State's ranks. Summary:","completion":"The silence of IS sources regarding al-Baghdadi's health could imply that something has happened to him, but similar silences have previously proven unfounded. IS is heavily invested in Baghdadi's image, and its claims of being a state and caliphate are closely tied to his persona. If Baghdadi were to die, finding a successor with his religious knowledge and lineage could be problematic, leading to potential disarray in the group. Furthermore, the \\"winning horse\\" perception of IS could dissipate, causing members to revert to their original group identities and reducing the Islamic State's ranks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given equation: -45f - 25f + 7560 = 25f + 13f Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left-hand side, we have -45f and -25f. Combining these: -45f - 25f = -70f On the right-hand side, we have 25f and 13f. Combining these: 25f + 13f = 38f Now, our equation becomes: -70f + 7560 = 38f Step 2: Isolate the variable 'f' by moving the terms with 'f' to one side of the equation and constants to the other side. To move the 38f term from the right-hand side to the left-hand side, we need to subtract it from both sides: -70f - 38f = 38f - 38f - 7560 Adding the like terms: -108f = -7560 Step 3: Solve for 'f'. Now, to isolate 'f', we'll divide both sides by -108: f = -7560 / -108 When we calculate the right-hand side, we get: f ≈ 70 So, the solution to the given equation is f ≈ 70."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Outside ancien régime France, natural history was an important part of medicine and industry, encompassing the fields of botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology and mineralogy. Students in Enlightenment universities and academies were taught these subjects to prepare them for careers as diverse as medicine and theology.

She is friends with Laurie and two other female co-workers, but she lives in a lonely existence in a small apartment in Clinton Gardens. One typical day after work, her boss, Albert, sends his workers home while he tries to please a buyer for his clothing designs. As the four ladies walk down the street, they must march past leering and dirty men who make obscene remarks and come-ons at them. Laurie protests and insults them vehemently, but Thana is silent because she is physically and mentally a mute. When the three friends leave to enter a subway station for their destination home, Thana goes off on her own. After grocery shopping in a local supermarket, Thana, walking home, is grabbed by a mugger who rapes her in a deserted alley before stealing her purse. Thana stumbles into her apartment unaware that it is being robbed. Held at gunpoint by the burglar, she is raped a second time. But afterwards, Thana grabs an iron and bludgeons the intruder to death. Momentarily stunned by what she did, Thana drags his dead body to the bathroom and places it in the bathtubThe next day, Thana goes to work as usual. It is clear at this point that she doesn't enjoy her job because Albert is always yelling at all his female employees, or acts patronizingly towards her. When she accidentally burns a shirt that she is ironing when the images remind her of the previous day's event, Albert further yells at her.

Donatien Alphonse Francois de Sade was born on 2 June 1740, in the Hotel de Conde, Paris, to Jean Baptiste Francois Joseph, Count de Sade and Marie Eleonore de Maille de Carman, cousin and Lady-in-waiting to the Princess of Conde. He was his parents' only surviving child. He was educated by an uncle, the Abbe de Sade. In Sade's youth, his father abandoned the family; his mother joined a convent. He was raised with servants who indulged \\"his every whim,\\" which led to his becoming \\"known as a rebellious and spoiled child with an ever-growing temper.\\" Later in his childhood, Sade was sent to the Lycee Louis-le-Grand in Paris, a Jesuit college, for four years. While at the school, he was tutored by Abbe Jacques-Francois Amblet, a priest. Later in life, at one of Sade's trials the Abbe testified, saying that Sade had a \\"passionate temperament which made him eager in the pursuit of pleasure\\" but had a \\"good heart.\\" At the Lycee Louis-le-Grand, he was subjected to \\"severe corporal punishment,\\" including \\"flagellation,\\" and he \\"spent the rest of his adult life obsessed with the violent act.\\" At age 14, Sade began attending an elite military academy. After 20 months of training, on 14 December 1755, at age 15, Sade was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant, becoming a soldier. After 13 months as a sub-lieutenant, he was commissioned to the rank of cornet in the Brigade de S. Andre of the Comte de Provence's Carbine Regiment. He eventually became Colonel of a Dragoon regiment and fought in the Seven Years' War. In 1763, on returning from war, he courted a rich magistrate's daughter, but her father rejected his suitorship and instead arranged a marriage with his elder daughter, Renee-Pelagie de Montreuil; that marriage produced two sons and a daughter. In 1766, he had a private theatre built in his castle, the Chateau de Lacoste, in Provence. In January 1767, his father died.

Young married couple Andrew Hinklin and Clara Hinklin née Fields, who were college sweethearts, are well matched: both are unexciting and unmotivated, only wanting to carve out a plain, simple uninteresting life for themselves. Their marriage is not helped by Clara's opinionated mother living with them in their small one bedroom apartment. However, Clara does wish that their life would be a little more exciting as Andrew said on their honeymoon that their married life would be, least of all by Andrew acknowledging their latest wedding anniversary, their fifth. Clara's wish takes an unexpected turn when Andrew, at work, is assigned to show the visiting Mr. Battingcourt Jr. - the younger half of the head of their London office and who is majority shareholder of their accounting firm - a good time while he's in the US. \\"Batty\\" as he is affectionately called by his friends is a party animal, and Andrew, who Batty rechristens \\"Hinky\\", feels he has to party along all in the name of job security. Clara feels that she is losing her stable husband Andrew to Hinky the party animal. Feeling he is partly to blame for the Hinklins' marital problems, Batty advises Clara that she can make herself more exciting to Hinky by changing her demeanor and appearance, more like Mercedes Vasquez, a beautiful and exciting woman who Clara could resemble if made up correctly. Clara agrees to Batty's plan to come to one of their parties masquerading as exotic Latina Dolores Alvaradez, to woo Hinky and thus ultimately show him that she can be exotic like he probably now wants.

Q: Problem: a couple who own an appliance store discover that if they advertise a sales discount of 10 % on every item in the store, at the end of one month the number of total items sold increases 15 %. their gross income from sales for one month increases by what percent ? Options: a. 1.5 %, b. 2.5 %, c. 3.5 %, d. 4.5 %, e. 5.5 % A:","completion":"Let us break down the problem step by step. Step 1: Rephrase the problem If the couple gives a 10% discount, the total items sold increases by 15%. We need to find the increase in their gross income from sales at the end of one month. Step 2: Assume initial values for easy calculation Let's assume that the couple initially sells 100 items at 100 each (without discount). This means their initial monthly gross income was 10,000 (100 items x 100). Step 3: Calculate the new selling price and item quantity after the 10% discount With the 10% discount, the new selling price becomes 90 (10% off from 100). Since the number of items sold increases by 15%, the new total quantity of items sold becomes 115 (100 + 15% of 100). Step 4: Calculate the new monthly gross income With the new selling price and item quantity, the new monthly gross income will be 10,350 (115 items x 90). Step 5: Calculate the increase in gross income Now we need to find the percentage increase in the monthly gross income. The increase in gross income is 10,350 - 10,000 = 350. Step 6: Find the percentage increase in gross income To find the percentage increase, divide the increase in income by the initial income and multiply by 100: (350 / 10,000) × 100 = 3.5% Therefore, the correct answer is c. 3.5%."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: The album was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as \\"probably the odd man out at that point\\", he stated he \\"didn't participate as much because of that\\". Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell.\\" King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and \\"added too much singing\\". Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: \\"There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that's me personally.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the church that is of red brick and Pevsner considered it \\"astonishingly restrained.\\" In 1859 Burges began work with Ambrose Poynter on the Maison Dieu, Dover, which was completed in 1861. Emulation of the original medieval style can be seen in his renovation of the grotesque animals and in the coats of arms incorporated into his new designs. Burges later designed the Council Chamber, added in 1867, and in 1881 began work on Connaught Hall in Dover, a town meeting and concert hall. The new building contained meeting rooms and mayoral and official offices. Although Burges designed the project, most of it was completed after his death by his partners, Pullan and Chapple. The listed status of the Maison Dieu was reclassified as Grade I in 2017 and Dover District Council, the building's owner, is seeking grant funding to enable a restoration, focussing on Burges's work.In 1859–60, Burges took over the restoration of Waltham Abbey from Poynter, working with Poynter's son Edward Poynter and with furniture makers Harland and Fisher. He commissioned Edward Burne-Jones of James Powell & Sons to make three stained-glass windows for the east end, representing the Tree of Jesse. The Abbey is a demonstration of Burges's skills as a restorer, with \\"a profound sensitivity towards medieval architecture.\\" Mordaunt Crook wrote of Burges's interior that, \\"it meets the Middle Ages as an equal.\\" In 1861–2, Burges was commissioned by Charles Edward Lefroy, secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons, to build All Saints Church, Fleet, as a memorial to Lefroy's wife. She was the daughter of James Walker, who established the marine engineering company of Walker and Burges with Burges's father Alfred, and this family connection brought Burges the commission. Pevsner says of Fleet that \\"it has no shape, nor character nor notable buildings, except one,\\" that one being All Saints.

A:","completion":"The name of the church that is made of red brick and was considered \\"astonishingly restrained\\" by Pevsner is All Saints Church, Fleet. This church was commissioned in 1861-2 by Charles Edward Lefroy, secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons, as a memorial to his wife. The project was designed by Burges, who happens to have a family connection with Lefroy through his father, Alfred Burges's, partnership in a marine engineering company established by James Walker, Lefroy's father-in-law. According to Pevsner, despite Fleet's lack of shape, character, or notable buildings, All Saints Church stands out. The church's interior is simply decorated yet stands out for its massive sculpture, particularly of the tomb of the Lefroys and of the gabled arch below which the tomb originally sat. This simplicity and restraint outside and inside the church impressed Pevsner who lauded it as \\"astonishingly restrained\\".

The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead. She says she is all right and gets on the train, but drops unconscious once aboard. When she recovers, she finds herself seated in a compartment across from Miss Froy, who has evidently helped her.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How was Euthydemus threatened?\\" is in \\"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

However, after being victorious in the field, Antiochus realized the advantages of maintaining the status quo and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimizing the Greco-Bactria dynasty.

The question talks about specialized toys, such as AK47's and MiGs. Both of these items are related to weaponry and military equipment. Step 2: Analyze the options. The options provided are free trade zones, Russia, industrial park, Napoleon, and workers. Step 3: Identify the appropriate response. Among the options, Russia is known for manufacturing iconic weapons, such as the AK47 and MiG aircraft. Since these specific items are mentioned in the question, the link to Russia is the strongest. Step 4: Confirm the choice. The other options like free trade zones, industrial park, and workers do not provide a direct connection to the mentioned toys. Napoleon could create confusion, as he is associated with military history but not with these specific examples. Therefore, Russia is the most suitable answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bug's Life was too much, too fast--he was \\"dazed and exhausted\\" by the visuals, and seemed to ignore the story completely) Okay, first off, I'm 26 years old, have a job, go to school, and have a fiance'. So maybe I'm nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being \\"wowed\\" by each frame visually. How can you not empathize with Flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life? \\"Heck\\" indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy. Of course, it's beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...). Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!). But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color. No, A Bug's Life would be static if it were all that and no story. But, I'm glad to say, it's not! A Bug's Life has real heart. Yes, there's a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them! Just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think! Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has. This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing. The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. It doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots. Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not \\"dumbing down\\" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not. All I can think is, if you can see A Bug's Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point. Final words: A+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie); if you loved Toy Story you'll most likely love this (PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won't know what you're missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay? How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is extremely positive and passionate. The reviewer is strongly defending the movie \\"A Bug's Life\\" against criticisms they perceive as unjust. They feel very connected to the characters and story, and admire the amount of detail and artistic value in the animation, as well as the complexity and subtlety of the narrative. The reviewer argues that the movie achieves a balance between compelling storytelling and impressive visuals. They also commend Pixar for assuming intellect and emotional complexity in their audience, and making a movie that functions on many different levels, offering richly satisfying viewing experiences for both children and adults. Furthermore, they believe that the movie has genuine heart and emotional resonance, and can be profoundly relatable and comforting in its depiction of a wide range of human experiences and emotions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: A mother in Australia was told by a doctor that her new born son was dead but she helped to bring him back to life by holding the baby against her body.

Given the question: Information: - A nightclub (also known as a discothèque, disco, dance club or club) is an entertainment venue and bar which serves alcoholic beverages that usually operates late into the night. A nightclub is generally distinguished from regular bars, pubs or taverns by the inclusion of a stage for live music, one or more dance floor areas and a DJ booth, where a DJ plays recorded music and where coloured lights illuminate the dance area. Another distinction is that whereas many pubs and sports bars aim at a mass market, nightclubs typically aim at a niche market of music and dancing enthusiasts and clubgoers. The upmarket nature of nightclubs can be seen in the inclusion of VIP areas in some nightclubs, for celebrities and their guests. Nightclubs are much more likely than pubs or sports bars to use bouncers to screen prospective clubgoers for entry. Some nightclub bouncers do not admit people with ripped jeans or other informal clothing as part of a dress code. The busiest nights for a nightclub are Friday and Saturday night. Most clubs or club nights cater to certain music genres. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - Nelson Ackerman Eddy (June 29, 1901 March 6, 1967) was an American singer and actor who appeared in 19 musical films during the 1930s and 1940s, as well as in opera and on the concert stage, radio, television, and in nightclubs. A classically trained baritone, he is best remembered for the eight films in which he costarred with soprano Jeanette MacDonald. He was one of the first \\"crossover\\" stars, a superstar appealing both to shrieking bobby soxers as well as opera purists, and in his heyday, he was the highest paid singer in the world. - A baritone is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range lies between the bass and the tenor voice types. It is the most common male voice. Originally from the Greek , meaning \\"deep (or heavy) sounding\\", music for this voice is typically written in the range from the second F below middle C to the F above middle C (i.e. FF) in choral music, and from the second A below middle C to the A above middle C (A to A) in operatic music, but can be extended at either end. The baritone voice type is generally divided into the baryton-Martin baritone (light baritone), lyric baritone, \\"Kavalierbariton\\", Verdi baritone, dramatic baritone, \\"baryton-noble\\" baritone, and the bass-baritone. - Bobby soxer is a 1940s sociological coinage describing the often very zealous fans of traditional pop music, in particular its creators like singer Frank Sinatra. Bobby soxers were usually teenage girls and young adult women from about 12 to 25. Fashionable adolescent girls wore poodle skirts and rolled down their socks to the ankle. In high schools and colleges, the gymnasium was often used as a dance floor; however, since street shoes and street detritus might damage the polished wood floors, the students were required to remove their shoes and flop dance in their bobby socks, hence the phrase \\"sock hop\\". - The Love Parade is a 1929 American Pre-Code musical comedy film about the marital difficulties of Queen Louise of Sylvania (Jeanette MacDonald) and her consort, Count Alfred Renard (Maurice Chevalier). Despite his love for Louise and his promise to be an obedient husband, Count Alfred finds his role as a figurehead unbearable. - Maurice Auguste Chevalier (September 12, 1888 January 1, 1972) was a French actor, cabaret singer and entertainer. He is perhaps best known for his signature songs, including \\"Louise\\", \\"Mimi\\", \\"Valentine\\", and \\"Thank Heaven for Little Girls\\" and for his films, including \\"The Love Parade\\" and \\"The Big Pond\\". His trademark attire was a boater hat, which he always wore on stage with a tuxedo. - Sharon Rich (born June 11, 1953) is an author and film historian, best known for the biography \\"Sweethearts\\" about 1930s singing stars Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. She was close friends for many years with Jeanette's older sister, actress Blossom Rock (aka Marie Blake). Along with interviewing hundreds of people, Rich had access to many collections of private letters, Eddys personal scrapbooks, diary entries, FBI files and MacDonalds unpublished autobiography. As follow up documentation to \\"Sweethearts\\", Rich has written several additional books and edited and written over seventy magazine articles. In 1995 she was awarded a Dame of Merit by the Knights of Malta for her contribution to History and Literature. - Sweethearts : The Timeless Love Affair On screen and Off Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy is biographical book by Sharon Rich . First published in hardback in 1994 by Donald I. Fine , Inc. , the book covers the relationship of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy . Rich drew heavily on Eddy 's mother , who had kept Eddy 's diaries and letters . - Edith Marie Blossom MacDonald (August 21, 1895 January 14, 1978), known as Blossom Rock, was an American actress of stage, film and television. She was occasionally billed as Marie Blake or Blossom MacDonald. Her younger sister was screen actress and singer Jeanette MacDonald. - One Hour with You is a 1932 American Pre-Code musical comedy film about a married couple who find themselves attracted to other people. It was produced and directed by Ernst Lubitsch \\"with the assistance of\\" George Cukor, and written by Samson Raphaelson, from the play \\"Only a Dream\\" by Lothar Schmidt. It stars Maurice Chevalier, Jeanette MacDonald and Genevieve Tobin and features Charles Ruggles and Roland Young. A French-language version, called \\"Une heure près de toi\\" was made simultaneously, with Lili Damita playing Genevieve Tobin's role. - Love Me Tonight is a 1932 American Pre-Code musical comedy film produced and directed by Rouben Mamoulian, with music by Rodgers and Hart. It stars Maurice Chevalier as a tailor who poses as a nobleman and Jeanette MacDonald as a princess with whom he falls in love. It also stars Charles Ruggles as a penniless nobleman, along with Charles Butterworth and Myrna Loy as members of his family. - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Jeanette Anna MacDonald (June 18, 1903 January 14, 1965) was an American singer and actress best remembered for her musical films of the 1930s with Maurice Chevalier (\\"The Love Parade\\", \\"Love Me Tonight\\", \\"The Merry Widow\\" and \\"One Hour With You\\") and Nelson Eddy \\"Naughty Marietta\\", \\"Rose-Marie\\", and \\"Maytime\\"). During the 1930s and 1940s she starred in 29 feature films, four nominated for Best Picture Oscars (\\"The Love Parade\\", \\"One Hour with You\\", \\"Naughty Marietta\\" and \\"San Francisco\\"), and recorded extensively, earning three gold records.

The Organization of American States is an international organization founded on 30 April 1948, with the purpose of promoting regional solidarity, cooperation, and development among its member countries in the Americas. The establishment of the Inter-American Peace Force on 23 May 1965 came as a response to the United States' intervention in the Dominican Republic, which was undertaken to prevent the emergence of communist influence and the further destabilization of the Caribbean region. The IAPF was primarily composed of over 42,600 United States military personnel, but other countries also contributed troops, adding a multinational dimension to the peacekeeping force. Countries that contributed troops to the IAPF included Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, emphasizing the collective efforts of the OAS to promote peace and stability in the Americas.

Given the question: - Place your non dominate foot on the front of the skateboard - Push off with your other foot on the ground - Keep pushing with your dominate leg - When comfortable put both feet on the skateboard What might be the last step of the process? The answer is:","completion":"The last step of the process, after placing your non-dominant foot on the front of the skateboard, pushing off with your other foot on the ground, consistently pushing with your dominant leg, and placing both feet on the skateboard when comfortable, would be to maintain balance and control while riding the skateboard. To do this, follow these tips: 1. Evenly distribute your weight: Make sure your weight is centered over the skateboard, with both feet relatively equal distances from the nose and tail of the skateboard. Maintain a slight bend in your knees to improve balance. 2. Find your footing: Determine your preferred stance, either with your left foot forward (called \\"regular\\") or your right foot forward (called \\"goofy\\"). Ensure that your non-dominant foot is near the front of the skateboard and your dominant foot is near the back when you're ready to push. 3. Maintain an appropriate posture: Keep your back straight and your shoulders aligned with your hips while riding the skateboard. This helps you maintain balance and control while still allowing for quick movements and adjustments. 4. Look ahead: Focus on the path in front of you, not on your feet or the skateboard itself. This will help you anticipate any obstacles or changes in terrain and adjust your stance accordingly. 5. Practice turning and carving: To turn on a skateboard, gently shift your weight towards your toes or heels, depending on the direction you want to go. For sharper turns, lean more heavily and pivot your hips in the desired direction. 6. Brake safely: To slow down or stop on a skateboard, you can either use the foot braking method or practice drag-stop techniques. For foot braking, gently lower your pushing foot to the ground and let it drag behind you while maintaining balance on the board. For drag-stop techniques, learn how to safely slide or perform powerslides to control your speed. 7. Build confidence and practice: As with any skill, practice is key to becoming a comfortable and confident skateboarder. Build up your skills by riding in safe, open areas free from obstacles and gradually progress to more challenging terrains. By incorporating these tips and techniques into your skateboarding experience, you can successfully complete the process and enjoy a smooth and controlled ride."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Greg Louganis is finally on a Wheaties box, three decades after his four Olympic gold medal wins. The diver won gold at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics, and though he didn't come out as gay until 1995 (when he also revealed he was HIV-positive), Louganis has argued in the past that rumors of his sexual orientation kept him off Wheaties boxes at the time (a charge Wheaties denies). Now, after a Chicago woman's petition, he's finally getting the honor, the Chicago Tribune reports. Julie Sondgerath started the petition last summer after watching an HBO documentary on Louganis; it eventually got more than 40,000 signatures, and on Tuesday, General Mills announced that Louganis would appear on \\"Wheaties Legends\\" boxes, which will be in stores for three to six months starting in May. Swimmer Janet Evans and track and field star Edwin Moses will also be featured on the boxes, which are intended for athletes who have retired from competition. Sondgerath sent a link to her petition to Louganis right after she started it, and he thanked her, but \\"I think really he resigned himself to the fact it wasn't going to happen,\\" Sondgerath tells the Tribune. (General Mills says the petition didn't directly impact its decision to feature Louganis.) \\"Back in '95, I wasn't expected to live very long because we thought of HIV-AIDS as a death sentence,\\" Louganis tells NPR. \\"So to be here today, now 56, the box means so much more to me than it would have then because I feel like I'm being embraced as a whole person, not just for my athletic achievements.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Greg Louganis, Olympic Diving Legend, Finally Graces Wheaties Box Amidst Speculation of Past Discrimination Three decades after his last Olympic gold medal win, Greg Louganis – a legendary American diver – has finally secured his spot on the Wheaties cereal box. In the past, Louganis has argued that rumors concerning his sexual orientation kept him from receiving this honor, a claim that Wheaties denies. Now, thanks to a petition by a Chicago woman, he is being celebrated as a Wheaties Legend alongside swimmer Janet Evans and track and field star Edwin Moses. Louganis won two gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and another two at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, but despite his incredible achievements, he was not honored with a Wheaties cover. Often referred to as \\"The Breakfast of Champions,\\" Wheaties was known for featuring accomplished athletes on its cereal boxes and was seen as an acknowledgment of one's sporting prowess. Many speculate that it was Louganis' sexual orientation – which he publicly acknowledged as gay in 1995 alongside announcing that he was HIV-positive – that kept him away from the recognition he truly deserved. It wasn't until Julie Sondgerath, a Chicago woman, started a petition last summer after watching an HBO documentary on Louganis' life, that the athlete's fans came together to rectify this past oversight. Her petition ultimately gathered over 40,000 signatures, and on Tuesday, General Mills announced that Greg Louganis, Janet Evans, and Edwin Moses, would appear on \\"Wheaties Legends\\" boxes, which are dedicated to athletes who have retired from competition. These special edition boxes are set to hit stores for a span of three to six months starting in May. Although General Mills has denied that the petition directly impacted its decision, Louganis supporters are ecstatic. Sondgerath, the woman behind the petition, shared with the Chicago Tribune how Louganis seemed to have given up on receiving this honor, thanking her for her efforts, but having resigned himself to the idea that it would never happen. The emotional weight of this event is not lost on Louganis himself. Speaking to NPR, he reflected on his journey, saying, \\"Back in '95, I wasn't expected to live very long because we thought of HIV-AIDS as a death sentence. So to be here today, now 56, the box means so much more to me than it would have then because I feel like I'm being embraced as a whole person, not just for my athletic achievements.\\" As Greg Louganis graces the Wheaties Legends box this year, it serves as a powerful reminder of the battles athletes like him have fought, both in and out of the sporting world. His story is inspiring countless others and stirs conversations around diversity, inclusion, and the acknowledgement of talented individuals regardless of their background or personal choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Adrian Durham. I was at Carrow Road to watch Norwich 0-0 Manchester City, and here is the Durham Dossier. Lots of expensive attacking players forgot how to score. Blunted: Strikers Edin Dzeko (left) and Alvaro Negredo (right) were left frustrated at Norwich. Manuel. Pellegrini. He hasn’t won anything in Europe as a manager, but he’s. been gifted a golden opportunity to do something special and historic at. Manchester City. It looks to me like he was out-coached by Mourinho on. Monday and had no answer, and you could even argue he was out-coached by. Chris Hughton at Norwich. Expectations: Manuel Pellegrini will be considered a failure if he can't win a trophy this season. Nous: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho out-thought Pellegrini in their midweek clash. Read Mark Ryan's report from Carrow Road. Fernandinho has been brilliant but Pellegrini has struggled to cope. without the midfielder. The elite managers are made of stronger stuff. than that. And when you need a goal I’m not sure Aleksandar Kolarov for Alvaro Negredo was. the right substitution, and indeed City didn’t score and didn’t really. threaten after that substitution. In fact Norwich looked more likely to. win it. Martin Demichelis made Chico Flores look like Rambo at one point in the second half. Being useless, the Argentine centre back completely misjudged a bouncing ball and realised it was about to sail over his head to send Gary Hooper clear on goal. Back to your feet: Manchester City's Martin Demichelis spent too much time on the ground at Carrow Road. So after feeling the slightest touch of Gary Hooper’s fingertips on his back he threw himself forward to the ground, and somehow referee Jon Moss bought it and blew for a free kick. Demichelis was booed, I suspect by his own fans as well as the Norwich faithful. Maybe Yaya Toure was frustrated with his own dreadful performance but. that’s no excuse to kick out at an opponent who’s on the floor. Ricky van Wolfswinkel and Yaya went for a ball, for some strange reason. the Ivorian decided to flick a boot at the Dutchman. He should have. seen red, City are lucky he didn’t. Another one missed by ref Jon Moss,. who should have stuck to drumming with Culture Club. In pain! Ricky van Wolfswinkel is left on the deck after receiving a kick from Yaya Toure. Distraught: The pair went up for a ball together and Van Wolfswinkel was left incandescent with rage. Norwich fans were magnificent, getting behind their team, even if celebrating a home draw like they’d won a trophy was a touch over the top. But that song they sing – 'On The Ball, City' - is just plain wrong. Not giving up: A Norwich fan sings loud and proud during the uninspiring 0-0 draw. Its opening line probably didn’t make sense when it was first penned in 1902: 'Kick off, throw in, have a little scrimmage.' Does this only have meaning in Norfolk? Fair play to them, they sung it very loud and proud. Unfortunately the last line 'Hurrah we’ve scored a goal' (I’m not joking) had no relevance to this game. Nathan Redmond. The Norwich teenager has got pace and balance, his touch is usually excellent, but his final ball – be it a shot or a cross – needs improvement. He can play wide and in the hole, and Man City really struggled to keep him quiet. If his rate of progression continues I expect him to be in the England picture by the time World Cup 2018 comes around, if not Euro 2016. Prospect: Nathan Redmond flew down the Norwich wing on more than one occasion on Saturday. Tempted to give it to Ricky van Wolfswinkel who has now scored just once in his 17 appearances. For £8.5m Norwich City expect more, that’s big money for them. But it has to go to Stevan Jovetic. He cost £22m and he looks like the kind of striker who might have the occasional brilliant game, but at Carrow Road he looked lazy and languid, and not physically made for a dust-up with the Premier League’s centre-half beasts. He was a poor man’s Dimitar Berbatov. He was taken off, unsurprisingly. Must improve. Abysmal: City's Stevan Jovetic needs to pull up his socks and prove why they spent so much money on him. Joleon Lescott’s contract is running out and he’s failed to rediscover his title winning form under the new boss; Matija Nastasic has gone backwards; and Demichelis – a genuine Pellegrini signing – is frankly awful. City have one decent centre back, Vincent Kompany. That’s poor squad management. If Pellegrini wins the quadruple or a treble then he’s a genius. If he wins a trophy he’s done well in his first season. If he wins nothing with this City squad he’s failed. Reliance: Vincent Kompany is the only world class centre defender that City have. Joseph Yobo. 13-and-a-half years after first playing in the Premier League, he slotted in straight away and looked solid at the back for Norwich alongside Sebastien Bassong. He was David Moyes first signing at Everton, and was excellent for the Toffees. If he continues the form he showed on his Canaries debut then that will be a shrewd signing from Hughton, because defensively they’ve not been great this season. Solid: Joseph Yobo is back playing in England after a spell in Turkey with Fenerbahce. Chris Hughton may possibly be doing just that. In December 1982, as a 24-year-old full back at Spurs, Hughton was interviewed about his football philosophy. The subsequent article in a football magazine was titled: 'Less Attacking – More Success'. It seemed to be a philosophy he was pursuing rigidly at Norwich, but without the success bit. But at Cardiff last week (even in defeat) Hughton’s side attacked and created chances. Against Manchester City you’d have been forgiven for thinking he would send his side out to defend. But with Anthony Pilkington, Nathan Redmond and Hooper all starting, it was more 4-3-3 than 4-5-1. Unfortunate: Gary Hooper thought he had scored for Norwich but it was ruled out for offside. Even when Hooper was injured half way through the second half Hughton resisted any temptation to sit deep, making a like-for-like substitution bringing van Wolfswinkel on. Hopefully he won’t revert to negative, defensive ways because Norwich were good to watch.Now he just needs to teach his strikers to score. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"- Norwich 0-0 Manchester City - Lots of expensive attacking players forgot how to score - Manuel Pellegrini has struggled to cope without midfielder Fernandinho - Yaya Toure's poor performance led him to kick out at an opponent, and should have seen a red card - Norwich fans were magnificent, supporting their team throughout the match - Nathan Redmond showed great potential as a future England player - Stevan Jovetic was disappointing, performing lazily and being taken off the pitch - Manchester City's poor squad management has left them with just one decent center back, Vincent Kompany - Joseph Yobo's return to the Premier League showed solidity in Norwich's defense - Chris Hughton's potential shift in football philosophy might bring success to Norwich Norwich City's game against Manchester City ended in a goalless draw, as the attacking players from both sides struggled to score throughout the match. Manchester City's coach, Manuel Pellegrini, has had a difficult time coping without midfielder Fernandinho. Yaya Toure's performance was also underwhelming, leading him to kick out at an opponent and potentially earning a red card. The Norwich fans were unwavering in their support for their team.

Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the two towns and their food production methods. - Silver town: sustainable, no use of fertilizers or pesticides - Gold town: uses fertilizers and pesticides Step 2: Determine which town's method contributes to fertilizer runoff. - Fertilizer runoff is caused by excess fertilizers being carried away from fields by rain or irrigation water, resulting in the contamination of nearby water bodies. Step 3: Compare the towns based on their food production methods. - Since Silver town is sustainable and doesn't use any fertilizers or pesticides, it doesn't contribute to fertilizer runoff. - Gold town, on the other hand, uses fertilizers in their food production. This makes it more likely for their fields to experience fertilizer runoff, as excess nutrients from their fertilizer use can be carried away by rainwater or irrigation.

Write an article with the title: \\"Republicans ‘rein in’ the IRS in new budget after years of grievances\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Republicans ‘rein in’ the IRS in new budget after years of grievances Introduction: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has faced ongoing criticism and allegations of mismanagement for years. Now, after years of grievances, the Republican Party has taken decisive action to \\"rein in\\" the tax agency. The new budget, which has been passed by the GOP-dominated legislature, is set to make significant changes to how the IRS operates to improve its reputation, efficiency, and effectiveness. Step 1: Explain the issues with the IRS Over the years, the IRS has faced numerous scandals and criticisms. These issues range from inefficiency in processing tax returns, the targeting of conservative groups for enhanced scrutiny, and budget mismanagement. The agency has faced bipartisan condemnation, with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressing frustration at the apparent unwillingness of the IRS to address these concerns. Step 2: Present the new budget's provisions The new budget, crafted by the Republican Party, is designed to address and rectify these long-standing concerns. Among its provisions, the budget includes the following measures: - Increased transparency: The IRS will now be required to disclose more information on how it spends taxpayer dollars, as well as providing regular reports to Congress on its management performance and internal audits. - Enhanced oversight: The budget establishes a new oversight board to monitor the IRS, ensuring that the agency is held accountable for any mismanagement or failures in service. - Streamlined processes: The IRS will be encouraged to invest in modernizing its IT infrastructure, hiring additional personnel, and implementing more efficient processes that improve the speed and accuracy of tax return processing. Step 3: Analyze the impact on the IRS These measures are expected to have a significant impact on the IRS. With increased transparency and oversight, it will become significantly more challenging for the agency to continue its current practices without facing repercussions. This, in turn, should create a more efficient and effective tax collection agency that can better serve its taxpayers. Additionally, the investment in modernizing the IRS's IT infrastructure will likely lead to a more streamlined and user-friendly experience for taxpayers. In the long run, this could result in an increase in taxpayer compliance and a reduction in tax fraud and evasion. Step 4: Discuss potential criticisms While the new budget's provisions are aimed at addressing the concerns and grievances surrounding the IRS, there are critics who believe that the measures do not go far enough. Some argue that the budget does not provide enough funding to truly overhaul the agency, while others believe that the entrenched bureaucracy within the IRS may prevent meaningful change from taking place. Step 5: Conclusion In conclusion, the Republican Party's new budget aims to tackle the years of grievances surrounding the IRS, with provisions designed to increase transparency, provide better oversight, and modernize the agency's processes. While critics argue that the measures may not be sufficient to bring about transformative change, the new budget represents a significant step towards addressing the systemic issues that have plagued the IRS and improving the agency's public reputation and performance. Only time will tell if these measures will be successful in reining in the IRS and ensuring that the agency operates more efficiently and fairly for the benefit of all taxpayers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Petroleum jelly products like Vaseline act as a shield, helping to seal in the natural moisture of your eyelashes and eyebrows. Just simply put some Vaseline petroleum jelly on the roots of your eyelashes before going to bed. Rinse your eyelashes with warm water in the morning. You can even rub the Vaseline on your eyebrows. You could use a Q-Tip or clean mascara brush to apply. Try applying Vaseline to your eyelashes every night while you sleep and in weeks you should have longer, thicker eyelashes. While some holistic health practitioners warn against petroleum jelly, the kind that you can buy in stores is regarded as safe by both the FDA and Health Canada. However, petroleum jelly from unregulated markets may be dangerous. Stick to brand names from trusted retailers if you use this treatment. These oils are known to strengthen and stimulate eyelash growth. You could also mix them together. Just pour a few drops of the oil onto a Q-Tip, and then coat your eyelashes with it. Keep it on your lashes for a few minutes (around 5-8 minutes) and then rinse. Do this once a day for 1-2 weeks, and you should notice the effect soon. Also apply olive or coconut oil on your eyelids and on the skin under your eyes every night (before you go to bed) for a noticeable effect. Apply olive or coconut oil with a cotton swab. Plan not to use eye makeup on days when you use oil, as the oil could cause cosmetics like mascara to run or bleed. Despite the disgusting idea of rubbing raw eggs on your eyelashes, eggs are a very good way of getting lengthy, healthy eyelashes. The high protein in eggs can help create thicker and longer eyelashes. In addition, eggs contain biotin and B vitamins that play a major role in improving the overall texture of your lashes. Just beat 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of glycerin until you get a thick, creamy texture. Then rub this mixture onto your eyelashes using a cotton swab and keep on for 15 minutes. Rinse off using cold water. Repeat this remedy 3 times a week for a few months. Look for glycerin at your local drugstore, pharmacy, craft store, or grocery store. Use a clean brush or a cotton swab to apply castor oil on your lashes before going to bed. You can also add a few drops of vitamin E oil to the castor oil before applying. Leave it on overnight, then rinse it off with lukewarm water in the morning. Alternatively, mix together 2 tablespoons each of castor oil and fresh aloe vera gel. Apply it on your eyelashes using a cotton swab. Leave it on overnight, then rinse it off the next morning. You could also add a few drops of the oil to your mascara tube. The peels are rich in vitamins C and B, folic acid and other nutrients that promote the growth of eyelashes. Also, when infused in olive or castor oil, they will help enhance the cleansing and stimulating properties of the oil. Put 1 tablespoon of moderately dried lemon peels in a container. Pour enough olive or castor oil into the container, so that the peels get soaked. Allow the mixture to sit for a couple of weeks. Using a clean mascara stick, apply the oil on your eyelashes before going to bed. Leave it on overnight, then wash it off with warm water in the morning. Follow this remedy for a few months to get encouraging results.","completion":"This article is all about how to make your eyelashes and eyebrows longer and thicker by using natural products like Vaseline, olive oil, coconut oil, eggs, lemon peels, and castor oil, which are all safe to use at home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On returning to London, Moore undertook a seven-year teaching post at the Royal College of Art. He was required to work two days a week, which allowed him time to spend on his own work. His first public commission, West Wind (1928–29), was one of the eight reliefs of the 'four winds' high on the walls of London Underground's headquarters at 55 Broadway. The other 'winds' were carved by contemporary sculptors including Eric Gill with the ground-level pieces provided by Epstein. 1928 saw Moore's first solo exhibition, held at the Warren Gallery in London. In July 1929, Moore married Irina Radetsky, a painting student at the Royal College. Irina was born in Kiev in 1907 to Ukrainian–Polish parents. Her father did not return from the Russian Revolution and her mother was evacuated to Paris where she married a British army officer. Irina was smuggled to Paris a year later and went to school there until she was 16, after which she was sent to live with her stepfather's relatives in Buckinghamshire. Irina found security in her marriage to Moore and was soon posing for him. Shortly after they married, the couple moved to a studio in Hampstead at 11a Parkhill Road NW3, joining a small colony of avant-garde artists who were taking root there. Shortly afterward, Hepworth and her second husband Ben Nicholson moved into a studio around the corner from Moore, while Naum Gabo, Roland Penrose, Cecil Stephenson and the art critic Herbert Read also lived in the area (Read referred to the area as \\"a nest of gentle artists\\"). This led to a rapid cross-fertilization of ideas that Read would publicise, helping to raise Moore's public profile. The area was also a stopping-off point for many refugee artists, architects and designers from continental Europe en route to America—some of whom would later commission works from Moore.

To provide a detailed answer, it is important to understand the factors that played a role in Tim Kaine being chosen as Hillary Clinton's running mate. Tim Kaine, a moderate Democrat, was selected for several reasons: 1. Experience: Tim Kaine had an extensive political background, having served as the Mayor of Richmond, Governor of Virginia, and later as a U.S. Senator from Virginia. This experience made him an attractive choice for balancing the presidential ticket. 2. Swing State Advantage: Virginia is an important swing state in U.S. presidential elections, and having a running mate from this region was likely to help Clinton's chances of winning the state. Tim Kaine's popularity in Virginia made him a valuable asset for this purpose. 3. Bilingual Skills: Tim Kaine was fluent in Spanish, which could help Hillary Clinton connect with the growing Hispanic population in the United States. Kaine's language abilities and dedication to Hispanic causes potentially positioned the Clinton ticket in a favorable light within this significant voting bloc. 4. Safe Choice: Due to his moderate political views and affable personality, Tim Kaine was seen as a non-controversial and safe choice. He was unlikely to alienate any specific group or create unnecessary conflict within the Democratic Party. 5. Compatibility: It is generally believed that Clinton and Kaine had a good working relationship and compatible policy views. Their combined expertise in foreign and domestic policy created a complementary partnership focused on a strong and stable administration. In summary, the answer to both questions is yes, as they essentially ask for an explanation of the circumstances and reasons behind the selection of Tim Kaine as Hillary Clinton's running mate in the 2016 US Presidential Election."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Please Describe Yourself is the debut studio album by the British alternative rock band Dogs Die in Hot Cars. It was first released on 12 July 2004 in the United Kingdom on V2 Records. After releasing several limited-edition singles and the extended play \\"Man Bites Man\\", the band released the album to critical praise. - The Man Bites Man EP was a CD containing 4 tracks that was used to promote Dogs Die in Hot Cars , who were at the time working on their debut album : Please Describe Yourself . The release was limited to 1000 copies . The third track on this CD was used in an advertising campaign for Boots . Also , the recording of \`\` Pastimes & Lifestyles '' found on this EP is different from that of the version found on their debut - the most notable difference being that the bridge before the last chorus on this version is longer . Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley ( who produced the band 's debut album ) produced the first track on this CD , while Paul Tipler produced tracks 2 and 4 , and track 3 was produced by Craig Macintosh - the band 's lead singer . - An EP (short for extended play) is a musical recording that contains more tracks than a single, but is usually unqualified as an album or LP. An EP originally referred to specific types of vinyl records other than 78 rpm standard play (SP) and LP, but it is now applied to mid-length CDs and downloads as well. - Dogs Die in Hot Cars is a Scottish band from St. Andrews consisting of members Craig Macintosh (vocals, guitar), Gary Smith (vocals, guitar) Ruth Quigley (vocals, keyboards, French horn), Lee Worrall (bass and glockenspiel) and Laurence Davey (drums and percussion). - V2 Records (or V2 Music) is a record label that was purchased by Universal Music Group in 2007, and then by PIAS Entertainment Group in 2013. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). What entity does 'man bites man' has the relation 'instance of' with? Answer:","completion":"\\"Man Bites Man\\" has the relation 'instance of' with an Extended Play (EP). It is a type of musical recording that contains more tracks than a single but is not considered a full-length album or LP.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Background: Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic. Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume. Paragraph: Many years ago there was a beach Called Coast Brigs where many coral and other life lived. A refinery that burned coal was built nearby and over time the water nearby became very acidic. The coral and marine life died because of this but a few miles north on another beach named Greendale the same creatures are surviving just fine. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will building a refinery at Greendale cause the acidity of the water to increase or decrease? Answer:","completion":"Building a refinery at Greendale could likely cause the acidity of the water to increase. The associated process of burning fossil fuels, particularly coal, results in an increase in carbon dioxide emissions. This excess carbon dioxide eventually enters the Earth's oceans, leading to ocean acidification, which as explained, is the process how carbon dioxide decreases the pH level of seawater, turning it more acidic. In the provided background information, it is clearly indicated that the refinery built near Coast Brigs contributed to the acidity of the water in that area. Over time, the water body near the refinery became so acidic that it led to the death of coral and other marine organisms in the vicinity. Evidently, the burning of coal in the refinery led to the rise in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which then got absorbed in the ocean waters, thereby raising the acidity. Once an area of the ocean becomes too acidic due to this process, it can pose severe repercussions for the marine ecosystem. In the case of Coast Brigs, it resulted in the death of corals and marine life. This acidification tends to destroy the calcium carbonate structures of many marine organisms including shellfish and corals, which is the building block of their skeletons and shells, and thus, it impacted their survival. Drawing on this information, it is reasonable to expect that if a similar refinery were to be built at Greendale, then there would likely be a similar rise in the acidity of the surrounding water. The burning of fossil fuels would release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which would then be absorbed by the oceans, leading to an increase in acidification. As a result, the marine organisms in Greendale, like the corals and shellfish that are currently surviving, might also be at risk of dying due to the increased acidity. However, it is important to take note that this conclusion is a projection. It relies on the assumption that the process at the new refinery would be identical to the one near Coast Brigs and that environmental conditions are overall similar. In reality, factors like further distance from the water body, cutting-edge technology to limit emissions, variation in ocean currents and temperatures, and stronger environmental legislations might mitigate some of the potential negative effects. Despite that, the basic premise remains that refineries which burn coal contribute globally to the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, thus, theoretically increasing ocean acidification."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are celebrated on their feast day, October 8. Known for their unwavering faith and dedication to their beliefs, these saints hold a significant place in Christian history. Also known as Palazia and Laurentia, the two saints were likely born in the Eastern Roman Empire. Details about their early life and family background remain largely unknown. However, what is known is that they devoted their lives to spreading the message of Christianity and faced untold suffering for their belief. In 302 AD, during the time of the Roman Emperor Diocletian, Christians were severely persecuted, and many were subjected to horrific torture or killed. Yet, despite the oppressive atmosphere, Palatias and Laurentia continued to preach and convert people to Christianity. Their resilience and courage in the face of persecution made them beloved figures in the early Christian church. Ultimately, their unyielding commitment to their faith led to their capture by the Roman authorities. They were both brutally tortured and eventually executed in Ferma, a region near Ancona, Italy. Their death marked the end of their earthly lives but also solidified their status as Christian martyrs. In recognition of their sacrifice, a major shrine was erected in their honor at the Ancona Cathedral in Italy. The cathedral is not only an architectural masterpiece but also serves as a testament to the unbreakable spirit of Saints Palatias and Laurentia. Today, the memory of Saints Palatias and Laurentia is commemorated through their feast day on October 8 and the Ancona Cathedral, acting as a constant reminder of their perseverance and commitment to their faith.

Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Which genus has a larger number of members when comparing between Gymnocladus and Mucuna? Answer:","completion":"After comparing between the Gymnocladus and Mucuna genera, it becomes apparent that Mucuna has a larger number of species within its genus. The Gymnocladus genus belongs to the Fabaceae family and has only two main recognized species: Gymnocladus dioicus, also known as the Kentucky coffeetree, and Gymnocladus assamicus, found in South Asia. This genus is composed of deciduous trees characterized by large bipinnate compound leaves and clusters of flowers that produce large seed pods. On the other hand, the Mucuna genus, which is also a part of the Fabaceae family, comprises approximately 100-150 species. This genus consists of climbing vines and shrubs widely distributed across tropical regions. Mucuna species are characterized by trifoliate leaves, flowers with a distinct \\"lip\\" on the lower keel petal, and seed pods covered with bristles. Some well-known members of this genus are Mucuna pruriens (velvet bean) and Mucuna gigantea (giant Mucuna). In conclusion, the Mucuna genus has a considerably larger number of members as compared to the Gymnocladus genus, making Mucuna the more diverse and widespread of the two genera."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No The statement \\"The island of Jamaica offers a wealth of activities, sites, and attractions\\" does not support the conclusion that \\"Jamaica has no coastline.\\" In fact, being an island, Jamaica is surrounded by coastlines on all of its sides. As a Caribbean island, Jamaica is known for its beautiful beaches and coastal attractions. Jamaica's coastline measures approximately 1,022 kilometers (635 miles), offering a variety of stunning landscapes and seascapes. The island is known for its white-sand beaches such as Negril's Seven Mile Beach, Montego Bay's Doctor's Cave Beach, and Ocho Rios' Dunn's River Falls. These pristine coastal areas are popular destinations for both relaxation and adventure, enticing visitors from around the world to engage in activities such as sunbathing, swimming, snorkeling, and scuba diving. Moreover, Jamaica's coastline is also home to vibrant coral reefs, teeming with diverse marine life. Located off the coast of Port Antonio, the Blue Lagoon is a famous natural harbor with deep blue waters that are rich in marine creatures, providing excellent snorkeling opportunities. Another noteworthy coastal attraction is the Luminous Lagoon in Falmouth, where visitors experience a glowing natural phenomenon called bioluminescence, created by microscopic organisms living in the water. Aside from its sandy shores, Jamaica's coastline boasts other attractions such as historic port towns and picturesque fishing villages. Port Royal was once a notorious pirate hub in the 17th century, and its remnants can still be seen today. Other coastal communities like Treasure Beach, Old Harbour, and Little Bay offer visitors an authentic glimpse into the lives and culture of Jamaicans who reside by the sea. Furthermore, Jamaica's coastal areas contribute significantly to the island's economy, culture, and ecology. The tourism and fishing industries, for example, support the livelihoods of numerous local families and contribute to the preservation of traditional ways of life. The coastal ecosystems, including mangroves, sand dunes, and seagrass beds, provide essential habitats for a wide array of species and serve vital functions in maintaining environmental health, such as filtering pollutants, mitigating erosion, and fostering biodiversity. In conclusion, Jamaica not only has a coastline, but it is an essential aspect of the island's appeal, offering a wealth of activities, sites, and attractions for visitors to explore. The coastline's striking beauty, abundant marine life, and significant cultural and ecological value make it a defining feature of this Caribbean destination.

Center your title in bold type at the top of the contract like this:Independent Contractor Agreement After each name, include the title by which you will refer to that party throughout the contract. If dealing with a business, include its full legal name with the “Inc.” or “LLC” suffix; do not include the names of the individuals signing the contract on behalf of that business. Here are two examples: This Independent Contractor Agreement (\\"Agreement\\") is made and entered into by and between, John Doe (\\"Contractor\\") and Jane Smith (\\"Client\\"). John Doe (\\"Contractor\\") and Jane Smith (\\"Client\\") agree as follows: . . . The length of the description will depend on the complexity of the job. There is no reason to make the description more complicated than necessary. Nevertheless, you should define the scope of work with sufficient clarity that the client knows the work he or she will be getting and you know what work falls inside or outside the contract. “Contractor will help Client throw a party” is too broad. Will you provide food and music, or will you simply hire caterers and musicians to provide these services? Will you hire crew to set-up the party and/or provide cleanup? You need to provide sufficient detail so that the work doesn’t spiral beyond what you thought you were hired to do. You could write, “Contractor will organize Client’s party by hiring caterers, musicians, florists, and crew to perform set-up and take-down. Contractor will also supervise these same.” Sometimes a short description will work. This works best for businesses that provide services that can be summarized in a brief paragraph. For example, a social media consultant might describe the job as follows: “Setting up and maintaining social media accounts for Client with Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Developing and implementing social advertising campaign, and training current staff to continue with social marketing efforts.” If you can use a short description, then you might want to type: \\"Contractor will provide Client with the following services:\\" and then leave some blank lines or space. By doing this, you can reuse the same contract for multiple jobs. With each new job, you can just type or write in the description. Some tasks are self-explanatory. If you are confident there will be no dispute over what work is to be performed, you may want to use general terms for this section of the contract. An example of general terms (as opposed to specific) would be to say \\"paralegal services,\\" \\"secretarial services,\\" or \\"consulting,\\" instead of describing all of the functions of a paralegal, secretary, or consultant. Using general terms will allow you to leave this section unchanged from contract to contract, thereby reducing errors, and speeding up the process of producing a contract for each client. If you provide a service that relies heavily on technical or design specifications, describing a project in your freelancing contract may mean your contract is several pages long and changes drastically from one client to the next. For services such as this, you may want to describe the job as providing client with \\"services described in the attached project plan.\\" By doing this, you can then attach each client’s personal project plan to his or her contract. Using this format gives you the flexibility of describing each job in detail without having to change your entire contract for each new job.

By Leon Watson for MailOnline A father battered senseless by a man who taunted his daughter has angrily condemned British 'joke justice' after prosecutors let his attacker off with just a £400 fine. Supermarket worker David Tait, 42, was beaten up and suffered multiple injuries to his face when he confronted a young man for insulting his 16-year old daughter Faye. Father-of-three Mr Tait suffered a fractured cheek, broken nose and had to have a metal plate inserted under his right eye socket with doctors warning he might be left partially sighted. Scroll down for video David Tait (left) has angrily condemned British 'joke justice' system after prosecutors agreed to drop a GBH charge against his attacker who had earlier taunted his 16-year old daughter Faye (with her father, right) Mr Tait said he saw","completion":"red when the man started hurling vile insults at his daughter, and he felt he had no choice but to confront the offender in an effort to protect her. He recalls the attacker, who appeared intoxicated, becoming increasingly aggressive as Mr. Tait attempted to calmly defuse the situation. The verbal altercation quickly escalated into a physical one, with the man launching a brutal assault on Mr. Tait. Despite several witnesses stepping forward and confirming the severity of the crime, the assailant faced minimal consequences in the form of a £400 fine. The Tait family, outraged by the lenient penalty, has been voicing their disappointment and frustration with the British justice system. Mr. Tait believes that such a light punishment not only fails to deter criminals, but also sends a dangerous message to would-be offenders, emboldening them to escalate their violent behavior. Seeking to bring attention to the issue, the Tait family has launched a campaign advocating for harsher penalties for those who commit violent acts against others, particularly when they involve unprovoked attacks on children. In addition, they are striving to garner public support, with Mr. Tait regularly sharing his story and expressing his desire for justice to be served. In response to their efforts, numerous people have come forward to share their own experiences with the British 'joke justice' system, revealing the inadequacy and failure to punish offenders as a significant problem. Together, the community is joining forces through social media campaigns, petitions, and public demonstrations to raise awareness and demand change in the way these cases are handled. As public interest grows and pressure mounts, politicians and legal authorities are being forced to review current policies and acknowledge the system's shortcomings. Discussions on revising the guidelines to impose stricter consequences for those who cause severe physical harm are now underway, with hopes that future cases will see a more appropriate response to violent offenders. Mr. Tait's bravery in confronting his daughter's harasser and his continued efforts to fight for justice have inspired many to join his cause. Through sharing his story and speaking out, he has rallied the support of his community and brought national attention to the deficiencies of the criminal justice system. In doing so, he has instigated important conversations about violence and the need for reform, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that no one has to suffer the same indignity and lack of justice that his own family has experienced. While the road to change may be long and challenging, the Tait family remains resolute in their pursuit of a more just legal system for the people of Britain, one that holds criminals accountable for their actions and provides a sense of closure and security for victims and their families."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - Slobozia District (Raionul Slobozia) is an administrative district of Transnistria, Moldova. It is the southernmost district of Transnistria, located mostly south of Tiraspol. Its seat is the city of Slobozia, located at , on the river Dniester. The district contains 4 cities/towns and 12 communes (a total of 24 localities, including small villages/hamlets): - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. - Tîrnauca (Romanian \\"Ternivka\\", , \\"Ternovka\\") is a commune and village in the Slobozia District of Transnistria, Moldova, situated on the east bank of the river Dniester, between Tighina and Tiraspol. It is notable for being home to the largest bottle-shaped building in the world, the Butylka hotel and museum. - A is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features a large number of extremely small \\"rooms\\" (capsules) intended to provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require the services offered by more conventional hotels. - Tiraspol (Russian and ) is internationally recognised as the second largest city in Moldova, but is effectively the capital and administrative centre of the unrecognised Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria). The city is located on the eastern bank of the Dniester River. Tiraspol is a regional hub of light industry, such as furniture and electrical goods production. - Butylka ( Russian for bottle ) is the name of a museum and hotel , sometimes also called the Spirit Museum Hotel . It is located in the village Tîrnauca ( Ternovka ) , 10 km from Tiraspol , the capital of Transnistria . The museum is notable for being housed inside a five - story structure shaped like a giant bottle . It is listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest building in the world in the shape of a bottle . The museum features owner Grigory Korzun 's vast collection of liquor . - The Dniester River, or Dnister River ( translit. \\"Dnister\\", , ) is a river in Eastern Europe. It runs first through Ukraine and then through Moldova (from which it separates the breakaway territory of Transnistria), finally discharging into the Black Sea on Ukrainian territory again. - Moldavia (or \\"\\", Romanian Cyrillic alphabet: ) is a historical region, and former principality in Eastern Europe, corresponding to the territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Dniester river. An initially independent and later autonomous state, it existed from the 14th century to 1859, when it united with Wallachia as the basis of the modern Romanian state; at various times, Moldavia included the regions of Bessarabia (with the Budjak) and all of Bukovina. - A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a fridge and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flatscreen television and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours. In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities. - A bottle is a rigid container with a neck that is narrower than the body and a mouth. By contrast, a jar has a relatively large mouth or opening which may be as wide as the overall container. Bottles are often made of glass, clay, plastic, aluminium or other impervious materials, and typically used to store liquids such as water, milk, soft drinks, beer, wine, cooking oil, medicine, shampoo, ink, and chemicals. A device applied in the bottling line to seal the mouth of a bottle is termed an external bottle cap, closure, or internal stopper. A bottle can also be sealed by a conductive \\"innerseal\\" by using induction sealing. - A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public. - Transnistria (Moldovan: ), officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR ); also called Transdniester, Trans-Dniestr, Transdniestria, or Pridnestrovie, is a self-proclaimed republic on a strip of land between the River Dniester and the border with Ukraine, recognised only by three non-United Nations (UN) states. The region is considered by the UN to be part of Moldova. The PMR controls most of the territory to the east of the River Dniester, and also the city of Bender and its surrounding localities on the west bank, in the historical region of Bessarabia. - Moldova (or sometimes ), or Moldavia, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. The capital city is Chiinu. - Bessarabia (; \\"Bessarabiya\\"; \\"Besarabiya\\") is a historical region in Eastern Europe, bounded by the Dniester river on the east and the Prut river on the west. Today Bessarabia is mostly occupied by modern-day Moldova, with the Ukrainian Budjak region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian Chernivtsi Oblast covering a small area in the north. - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world. - Clay is a fine-grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter. Clays are plastic due to their water content and become hard, brittle and nonplastic upon drying or firing. Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilicate minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure. Depending on the soil's content in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red. Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 45 m, and colloid chemists use 1 m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 m and silt particles as being larger. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.

The time and money that doctors spend on their medical education is probably one reason for this problem. A visit to a doctor's office costs from 15 to 50 dollars. It's so expensive. Many people in the United States think that doctors are overpaid. However, most doctors disagree. They say that they were asked to study medicine for a long time. Tuition for many years of medical education costs a lot of money. Doctors say that it is necessary for most medical students to borrow money from the bank to pay their tuition. Because their money must be repaid to the bank, young doctors need to receive a lot of money for their work. So they charge people high prices for medical care. Therefore the cost of medical care in America is high. Because high tuition is one cause of high costs, one way to lower costs would be to have medical school that are free or have low tuition. Question: The main idea of the passage is that _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"the high cost of tuition in medical schools is one reason for the high cost of medical care in the USA\\"?

(Associated Press) With each new bit of information, the picture emerging is of pilots who were supposed to be closely monitoring the plane's airspeed, but who didn't realize until too late that the aircraft was dangerously low and slow. Nothing disclosed so far by the National Transportation Safety Board investigators indicates any problems with the Boeing 777's engines or the functioning of its computers and automated systems. \\"The first thing that's taught to a pilot is to look at the airspeed indicator. It is the most important instrument in the cockpit,\\" said Lee Collins, a pilot with 29 years and 18,000 hours experience flying a variety of airliners. \\"Airspeed is everything. You have airspeed, you live. You don't, you die.\\" Investigators are still trying to nail down hundreds of details about the crash last Saturday that killed two people and injured dozens. NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman has cautioned against reaching conclusions. But investigators already know a great deal. They've listened to the Boeing 777's voice recorder, which captured the last two hours of conversation in the cockpit. They've downloaded its flight data recorder, which captured 1,400 indicators of what was happening on the plane, from the temperatures inside and out to the positions of cockpit instruments. The flight's four pilots have been interviewed, as have passengers and dozens of witnesses. Air traffic control recordings and video of the flight's last moments, including the crash itself, have been examined. Here's what investigators have revealed about a Seoul-to-San Francisco flight that was normal until its last minutes, when the wide-body jet carrying 307 people rapidly lost altitude: The pilot flying the plane, Lee Gang-kuk, 46, had nearly 10,000 hours of flying experience, but just 35 hours flying a Boeing 777. He had recently completed training that qualified him to fly passengers in the 777, and was about halfway through his post-qualification training. He was seated in the left cockpit pilot seat. In the co-pilot position was Lee Jeong-Min, an experienced captain who was supervising Lee Gang-kuk's training. It was Lee Gang-kuk's first time landing a 777 in San Francisco. At 11:19:23 PDT, after a nearly 11-hour flight, the plane was traveling over the San Francisco Peninsula. The weather was near perfect, sunny with light winds. Lee Jeong-Min and a third pilot sitting in a jump seat just behind the main seats, a first officer, were supposed to be monitoring the plane's controls. One of their most important jobs was to closely monitor the plane's two airspeed indicators. In the U.S., if an amber bar is more than five knots above or below the target speed during landing, the pilot flying is supposed to abort and make another attempt, according to pilots interviewed by The Associated Press. As the plane descended to 1,600 feet, the autopilot was turned off. At 1,400 feet, the plane's airspeed was about 170 knots. The flight data recorder shows the plane's autothrottle _ similar to a car's cruise control _ was set on idle during the approach, Hersman said, and that there were multiple commands at times given to the autothrottle and autopilot. At 11:26:58 and 1,000 feet, the pilots made contact with the airport tower. When they were cleared to land 12 seconds later, the plane's altitude had dropped to about 600 feet. The plane was configured for its approach and the landing gear was down. The airspeed was about 149 knots. A target speed of 137 knots was set. At 500 feet there was an audible automated altitude alert. The airspeed was about 134 knots. At this point that pilots realized they weren't properly lined up with the runway, Hersman said. \\"Between 500 and 200 feet, they had a lateral deviation and they were low. They were trying to correct at that point,\\" she said. At 200 feet and another automated altitude call out, the airspeed had slowed to 118 knots _ well below the target level. At this point, U.S. pilots would typically call for an aborted landing because the plane was more than 5 knots below its target speed, Collins said. But at no point in between 500 and 100 feet does the voice recorder show the pilots making any comment related to airspeed, Hersman said at a briefing Thursday. Hersman said at earlier briefings that it was not until 200 feet _ 16 seconds before impact _ that Lee Jeong-Min, the instructor pilot \\"recognized the auto-throttles were not maintaining speed.\\" At 125 feet and 112 knots, both throttles started moving forward, indicating more fuel was being sent to the engines to increase power and speed. That was eight seconds before impact. Even if the autothrottles weren't fully turned on, either of the pilots in the two front seats could reach down and manually push the throttle levers forward to increase power. It was about this time that the cockpit voice recorder indicated the first officer _ the third pilot seating behind the front two pilots _ realized the plane was traveling too slowly and called for an increase in speed. A second later, Lee Gang-kuk's yoke can be heard rattling violently on the voice recorder. This is the sound of a stick shaker going off, a piece of safety equipment that tells a pilot the plane is about to stall because it has slowed to a dangerous speed and lost lift. When the pilots in the two front seats realized the plane was in trouble, they both reached for the throttle. Passengers heard a loud roar as the plane revved up in a last-minute attempt to abort the landing. At three seconds before impact, the plane reached its slowest speed of 103 knots. Its engines were at 50 percent power and power was increasing. At this time, one of the pilots called for an aborted landing. At one and a half seconds before impact, another of the pilots calls for an aborted landing. At 11:28, with the airspeed up three knots, the landing gear, followed by the plane's tail, collided with the seawall just short of Runway 28 Left. The plane careened wildly before slamming down onto the tarmac and sliding about 1,000 feet. The tail was sheared off and three flight attendants seated in the back of the plane fell out. Rocks from the seawall and pieces of the mangled landing gear were strewn along the runway. The NTSB's investigation is being followed closely by pilots in the U.S. and around the world. At one gathering of pilots in Dallas Wednesday night, the discussion centered on why the Asiana pilots didn't realize their low speed sooner. No one had an answer. \\"There are a lot of very experienced airline pilots who are scratching their heads right now,\\" Collins said. ||||| US crash investigators looking into the Asiana accident have provided an unusual amount of information to the public. Is that heading off conspiracy theories or creating confusion? From Twitter pictures of the burned cabin to a second-by-second account of the aircraft’s flight speed, investigators are being unusually forthcoming with details about the Asiana Airlines crash at the San Francisco airport, leading some to champion a new era of transparency while others warn it does more harm than good. In the days since the July 6 crash, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has released detailed information about its investigation including timelines, pictures, and information about the pilot’s background that some transportation analysts say is unprecedented. “The NTSB has always been available to answer journalists’ questions after aviation accidents, but it often took a degree in aeronautics or long years on the airline beat to understand what was being said. This crash, however, is being explained in real time and in much simpler terms than in the past,” former transportation journalist Micheline Maynard wrote in a Forbes column this week. In the past five days the agency has tweeted and posted multiple pictures of the aircraft on its website, uploaded videos of its daily briefings, and provided thorough accounts of the plane speed, hours of experience of the pilots, and cockpit conversations. In comparison, information about the last fatal accident in the United States involving a commercial flight was slower and more traditional. When a Continental Express flight crashed while approaching the Buffalo airport in February 2009, there was no social media stream with photo and video footage. The new transparency is particularly worrisome to the Air Line Pilots Association, which released a statement this week saying that it is “stunned by the amount of detailed operational data from on-board recorders released by the [NTSB] this soon into the investigation.” The union, which represents only American pilots, has particular reason to be concerned with much of the preliminary media reports focusing on what role pilot error played in the crash. But it contends that the level of information released could adversely affect the investigation: “It is imperative that safety investigators refrain from prematurely releasing the information from on-board recording devices,” the organization wrote. “We have seen in the past that publicizing this data before all of it can be collected and analyzed leads to erroneous conclusions that can actually interfere with the investigative process.” Deborah Hersman, chairman of the NTSB, responded to the criticism by telling the press her organization is responsible to the public. “We are the advocate for the traveling public,” Ms. Hersman said Tuesday. Hersman, who at age 39 became the youngest chairman of the NTSB when she was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2009, has become the face of the new transparency push as she holds daily press conferences in San Francisco and multiple interviews with cable news outlets. “Since she's taken over, it seems like information has been much more accessible to the public,\\" Frank Pitre, a lawyer who closely follows the agency and is representing two passengers who were on the Asiana flight, told the San Francisco Chronicle. Hersman also faces a public with more tools at its disposal for doing its own investigative work. Websites like Flight Aware provide radar data for the Asiana Flight, and anonymous users quickly posted what they claim as the tape of the conversation between air-traffic controllers and the Asiana pilots “What we know is that if you don’t put the facts out there, in a vacuum other people will create them,” Hersman said in an interview with CBS News. Her organization’s use of social media channels is “about having a conversation with the people who care about the work you do.” According to Bloomberg, which pulled user comments from the forums at Flyertalk.com, Hersman's approach is earning mixed reviews. Among the postings: astroflyer: “In the age of twitter, I don’t think it makes sense to withhold any findings at all until 9 months down the road. A large plane crashed at a major American airport. People want to know why and whether the cause might be relevant to their own future flying.” Milepost: “I expect tomorrow D. Hersman will be detailing the pilots meals and calorie counts, their favorite colors, and answering the eternal question: boxers or briefs. I still think too much raw data is being disclosed in isolated bits and pieces that allow for too much amateur conjecturing, without having gone through the critical review and piece-it-all together analysis.” ||||| SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tapes of 911 emergency calls made moments after an Asiana Airlines jet crashed at San Francisco airport last Saturday reveal panic and confusion, and highlight some possible problems as emergency services raced to the scene. Passengers evacuate from a Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft after a crash landing at San Francisco International Airport in California July 6, 2013 in this file handout photo provided by passenger Eugene Anthony Rah released to Reuters on July 8, 2013. REUTERS/Eugene Anthony Rah/Handout via Reuters/Files The crash of the Boeing 777 killed two and injured more than 180. The first police and fire personnel arrived at the crash scene in about two minutes, and local officials said brave rescue efforts and effective triage of the many wounded likely saved lives. Still, the 11 minutes of 911 tapes released by the California Highway Patrol portray a tense and sometimes chaotic situation as severely injured passengers awaited help. “There are people laying on the tarmac with critical injuries, head injuries. We’re almost losing a woman here,” one passenger said in a taped call, stating she had been waiting for 20 to 30 minutes. The tapes appear to confirm witness accounts that several people were left unattended near the end of the runway as emergency crews focused on the main crash site. “We have people over here who weren’t found,” another 911 caller said. Three flight attendants and one Chinese student, who died in the accident, were ejected from the back of the plane after the tail broke off, according to National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Deborah Hersman. Officials are also investigating whether one of the two Chinese teenagers killed in the crash was run over by a fire truck, according to the San Francisco Fire Department. The large number of non-English-speaking passengers also presented some unexpected problems. “We’re looking at this, and what we can learn from it,” Rob Dudgeon, deputy director of the department of emergency management at the city and county of San Francisco, said in a phone interview on Thursday. ‘SOMETHING OUT OF A NIGHTMARE’ At a news conference on Monday, police and firefighters described a dramatic scene of running up an emergency escape chute to board the burning aircraft, handing out knives so crew could cut trapped people free, and tearing away seats and luggage to clear choked exit paths. “It was like something out of a nightmare,” said San Francisco police officer Jim Cunningham, describing a plane cabin filling with thick black smoke as rescuers worked to free a few trapped passengers even after most had gotten off safely. The call to evacuate the plane was made 90 seconds after it came to a halt on the runway, Hersman said on Wednesday. The crew first told passengers to remain seated, but an evacuation began after a flight attendant reported seeing fire outside the plane. The NTSB will examine whether proper evacuation procedures were followed, Hersman said, adding that “hindsight is 20/20.” Some passengers on the taped 911 calls reported not seeing ambulances and fire trucks. But emergency responders say procedures call for not bringing vehicles too close to the scene, in order to avoid chaos and collisions. In this case, there was also a worry that the plane could explode, said Mindy Talmadge, a spokesman for the San Francisco Fire Department. “There’s active fire, and there’s fuel leaking, and there’s debris all over the field, the last thing you want to do is take a chance of the plane exploding,” she said in a phone interview on Thursday. A fire burned through much of the plane’s cabin, although Hersman said the fuel tanks did not rupture. Dudgeon said procedures called for a methodical approach in identifying the injured, starting in one spot and working forward. That could potentially leave some victims unattended for many minutes. “If you start to worry about go here, go there, you miss things,” Dudgeon said. “As a paramedic, when you’re doing triage, you start where you are. You keep moving forward until you’ve triaged everybody.” Naj Meshkati, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies aviation safety, said he recalled other plane crashes where passenger groups were overlooked initially. “In this day and age that we have the GPS and the surveillance camera system, I think something should be changed and could be changed,” he said, adding that overall emergency response at the crash “worked beautifully.” Some 40 to 50 ambulances were sent to the crash site, said Dr. John Brown, medical director for Emergency Management Services, San Francisco. Some left the scene with up to five injured people in them to make sure the critically injured arrived quickly at hospitals, he said. ‘OVERALL, SYSTEM WORKED WELL’ The most sensitive issue for responders in the aftermath of the crash was whether they may have inadvertently caused one of the fatalities. Robert Foucrault, coroner for San Mateo County, where the airport is located, said autopsy results on how two Chinese teenage girls died would be released in about two weeks. Emergency personnel declined to comment specifically on the matter. Dudgeon said that generally speaking, emergency-vehicle drivers are trained to look everywhere around them. “Everybody’s eyes are everywhere,” he said. “It’s heads on a swivel.” The triage of the injured resulted in some non-English speaking victims being separated from their families. Most of the passengers on the flight were Chinese and Korean, and it is not clear if any of the emergency responders spoke those languages. Passenger Eugene Rah recalled helping a non-English speaker whose injured wife was sent to San Francisco General Hospital. “He was very nervous,” Rah said on Monday, adding that for several hours the man was not sure where his wife was or what condition she was in. Medical personnel say the most important thing is to make sure the most critically injured patients get treatment as quickly as possible, even if it means separating families. “The psycho-social issues are real, but they’re trumped by the medical issues,” said Chris Barton, chief of emergency medicine at San Francisco General Hospital, which received 66 injured passengers and crew. In some cases, when uninjured Korean or Chinese children arrived at the hospital with their injured parents, the hospital admitted the children to the pediatric ward so they would have a place to stay and would not be separated from their recuperating parents, he said. Barton and other area hospital staffers said the response by emergency personnel on the crash site was impressive, with patients arriving promptly and with initial care, such as drip systems for intravenous fluids, already handled. “Overall, the system worked well,” Barton said. “The triage, the communication.” That was not always apparent to passengers on the scene. Slideshow (3 Images) “There’s not enough medics out here,” one 911 caller said, saying a woman on the runway was “pretty much burned, very severely on the head, and we don’t know what to do. “She will probably die soon if she doesn’t get help,” the female caller said. “Is there any way we can assist her?” To another caller, who said he had yet to see a fire truck, the dispatcher said, “We are responding, trust me.” ||||| The wreckage of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 lies near the San Francisco runway July 7. (Photo: NTSB via Getty Images) Story Highlights Light may have been sunlight reflecting off the bay Investigators found the plane was too low and too slow in its approach The worst of the fire came around the right engine Federal crash investigators say the Asiana Airlines pilot who saw a bright light before the crash said it didn't affect the plane's approach into San Francisco International Airport. Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, had said Wednesday that the pilot complained of a bright light that temporarily blinded him. She clarified Thursday that the pilot saw the light while about 500 feet in the air and that it might have been sun reflecting off the bay, but that the pilot wasn't sure. Hersman said the pilot described turning his head and then looking back and finding that his vision wasn't impaired because he could still see the plane's controls. She said neither of the pilots mentioned the light during interviews and there is no discussion about it on the cockpit-voice recorder. \\"The light source was straight in front of the airplane but not on the runway,\\" Hersman said. \\"He stated that he did not think the light affected his vision.\\" Two passengers died in the crash when Flight 214 slammed into a seawall Saturday at the end of the runway. The impact ripped off the back of the plane and tossed three flight attendants and their seats onto the runway. Investigators found the plane was too low and too slow in its approach, but the investigation into whether pilots or equipment are to blame is expected to take 12 to 18 months. Hersman added details in her final on-scene briefing about the plane's approach from 500 feet above ground, when the plane was going 134 knots. The crew's target was to land at 137 knots, but the plane slowed to 103 knots just before impact. Hersman said there was no mention of the plane's speed until nine seconds before impact, when it was about 100 feet in the air. \\"Almost immediately after that is the first comment about speed,\\" Hersman said. Then at three seconds before impact and again at 1.5 seconds before, crewmembers call to abort the landing, Hersman said. The worst of the fire came around the right engine, which leaked oil after the crash, Hersman said. But she said firefighters entering the cabin at the left door just in front of the wings found nearly pristine seats before the fire spread inside and destroyed them. The floor was damaged a bit between the third and fourth doors, and worst behind the fourth door. After gathering perishable information at the scene, she said, investigators will spend months sifting through data and interviews to determine what happened. \\"This is just the tip of the iceberg,\\" Hersman said.

Given the below context: Against this background, a \\"great assembly\\" was organised by the Manchester Patriotic Union formed by radicals from the Manchester Observer. The newspaper's founder Joseph Johnson was the union's secretary. He wrote to Henry Hunt asking him to chair a meeting in Manchester on 2 August 1819. Johnson wrote: Nothing but ruin and starvation stare one in the face [in the streets of Manchester and the surrounding towns], the state of this district is truly dreadful, and I believe nothing but the greatest exertions can prevent an insurrection. Oh, that you in London were prepared for it. Unknown to Johnson and Hunt, the letter was intercepted by government spies and copied before being sent to its destination. The contents were interpreted to mean that an insurrection was being planned, and the government responded by ordering the 15th Hussars to Manchester. The mass public meeting planned for 2 August was delayed until 9 August. The Manchester Observer reported it was called \\"to take into consideration the most speedy and effectual mode of obtaining Radical reform in the Common House of Parliament\\" and \\"to consider the propriety of the 'Unrepresented Inhabitants of Manchester' electing a person to represent them in Parliament\\". The magistrates, led by William Hulton, had been advised by the acting Home Secretary, Henry Hobhouse, that \\"the election of a member of parliament without the King's writ\\" was a serious misdemeanour, encouraging them to declare the assembly illegal as soon as it was announced on 31 July. The radicals sought a second opinion on the meeting's legality which was that \\"The intention of choosing Representatives, contrary to the existing law, tends greatly to render the proposed Meeting seditious; under those circumstances it would be deemed justifiable in the Magistrates to prevent such Meeting.\\"On 3 August, Hobhouse conveyed the view of the Attorney-General that the magistrates were incorrect to declare 9 August meeting illegal as it was called to consider the election of a representative and...

Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

She felt alone and hopeless. Then she went into the kitchen and grabbed what she needed before going back up to her room quietly. She switched on the TV and started eating...and eating...for hours, until it was all gone.

It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \\"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California. \\"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \\"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper. Like most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own. Besides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help. And it might even make things worse, like it did for Carla, who's 15 now and is recovering from BED. \\"My parents would always tease me about my weight, so when I was 14, I went on a very restrictive diet,\\" she says. When you can't have something, you only want it more, so every time Carla would have a bite of something that wasn't allowed on her strict diet. She would quickly lose control and binge .

These are virtually still images revealing the key elements of the film: Justine (Kirsten Dunst) the bride in deep melancholy with birds falling behind her; of a lawn with trees and a sundial with two different shadows; Pieter Breughel's Hunters in the Snow (often used as interpretation of an idealised nostalgia) the non existent 19th hole (limbo) and the Black Horse collapsing catastrophically in slow motion (id/ego battle); Justine as a bride being swept along by a river; and her being held back by her wedding dress; and finally Justine and her nephew building their magic cave before the earth crashes into Melancholia becoming one.

Her mother ,Gaby (honesty) is brutally; ruthlessly and pathologically honest which gets her thrown out of the wedding.

In 1961 a Mennonite University College was named after him in Waterloo , Ontario . - Friesland (official) or Frisia is a province in the northwest of the Netherlands. It is situated west of Groningen, northwest of Drenthe and Overijssel, north of Flevoland, northeast of North Holland, and south of the North Sea. In 2010, the province had a population of 646,000 and a total area of . - The Swiss Brethren are a branch of Anabaptism that started in Zürich, spread to nearby cities and towns, and then was exported to neighboring countries. Today's Swiss Mennonite Conference can be traced to the Swiss Brethren. - In the Christian gospels, the ministry of Jesus begins with his baptism in the countryside of Roman Judea and Transjordan, near the river Jordan, and ends in Jerusalem, following the Last Supper with his disciples. The Gospel of Luke states that Jesus was \\"about 30 years of age\\" at the start of his ministry. A chronology of Jesus typically has the date of the start of his ministry estimated at around AD 2729 and the end in the range AD 3036. Jesus' \\"Early Galilean ministry\\" begins when after his Baptism, he goes back to Galilee from his time in the Judean desert. In this early period he preaches around Galilee and recruits his first disciples who begin to travel with him and eventually form the core of the early Church as it is believed that the Apostles dispersed from Jerusalem to found the Apostolic Sees. The \\"Major Galilean ministry\\" which begins in Matthew 8 includes the commissioning of the Twelve Apostles, and covers most of the ministry of Jesus in Galilee. The \\"Final Galilean ministry\\" begins after the death of John the Baptist as Jesus prepares to go to Jerusalem. - The Mennonites are Christian groups belonging to the church communities of Anabaptist denominations named after Menno Simons (14961561) of Friesland (which today is a province of the Netherlands). Through his writings, Simons articulated and formalized the teachings of earlier Swiss founders. The early teachings of the Mennonites were founded on the belief in both the mission and ministry of Jesus, which the original Anabaptist followers held to with great conviction despite persecution by the various Roman Catholic and Protestant states. Rather than fight, the majority of these followers survived by fleeing to neighboring states where ruling families were tolerant of their radical belief in believer's baptism. Over the years, Mennonites have become known as one of the historic peace churches because of their commitment to pacifism.

Astronomy was Samuel's favorite subject in school but Jason didn't like it because","completion":"of the complex concepts and calculations involved. However, the two friends always managed to find common ground in other areas, such as sports, music, and video games. They had been friends since kindergarten, and now, as high school sophomores, they had developed a deep understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses. One day, their astronomy teacher, Mr. Hemsworth, announced that there would be a stargazing event at the local planetarium as part of an upcoming project. Attendance was optional, but the event had the potential to significantly boost the students' grades. Samuel's excitement was palpable, and although Jason wasn't particularly fond of astronomy, he agreed to attend the event as his best friend's emotional support. The event was scheduled for a Saturday evening and coincided with a meteor shower that was expected to be visible from their town. The boys arrived at the planetarium early in order to secure the perfect spot. Samuel enthusiastically set up his telescope while Jason, not as interested in stargazing, focused on preparing some snacks they had brought with them for the evening. As the sky grew darker, more and more people arrived at the planetarium. Enthusiastic students, families, and amateur astronomers all gathered for what promised to be an unforgettable experience. Even Jason began to feel a growing sense of wonder at the sight of the community coming together over astronomy, a subject he'd once thought was boring and uninteresting. The meteor shower began at exactly 9:35 PM, just as predicted. Streaks of light crisscrossed the sky, eliciting gasps of awe and admiration from the gathered crowd. Samuel adjusted his telescope to capture the perfect view and invited Jason to take a look. Although Jason was still not a fan of the complexities of astronomy, he appreciated the beauty of the moment and felt a surge of happiness for his friend's excitement. As the evening wore on, Samuel pointed out several constellations and celestial bodies to Jason, explaining their significance and the myths and stories attached to them. To his surprise, Jason found himself becoming more and more enamored with the astronomical phenomenon taking place above their heads. The thought of the universe existing beyond their small town, with its billions of stars and mysteries waiting to be discovered, filled him with a sense of wonder and curiosity. The meteor shower reached its peak around midnight, sending dozens of shooting stars across the sky. Many of the attendees began making impromptu wishes as they witnessed the celestial event unfold. It was then that a remarkable thought struck Jason. Even though he didn't fully comprehend the mathematical and scientific concepts behind astronomy, he realized that there was an innate beauty and poetry to it all. History, mythology, and science were intertwined in the stars, and the boundlessness of the cosmos was both humbling and inspiring. As he continued to gaze up at the night sky, Jason found himself captivated by the vastness of space and the endless possibilities that lay within it. When the event finally concluded, and the crowd began to disperse, Jason turned to Samuel with a newfound appreciation for the subject his best friend held so dear. \\"You know, Samuel,\\" he said thoughtfully, \\"maybe astronomy isn't so bad after all.\\" Samuel chuckled and clapped his friend on the back, grinning from ear to ear. \\"I knew I'd get you hooked one day, Jason,\\" he replied, confident that their friendship had reached a new level of understanding and mutual appreciation. From that day on, Jason took an active interest in astronomy, and the two friends often spent their evenings under the stars, sharing their thoughts and dreams about the universe and beyond, their friendship growing stronger with each passing night. And although the mathematical complexities of the subject still eluded Jason, he had come to understand that sometimes, it was the wonder, beauty, and the shared moments that truly mattered."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While a member of Blood Pollution, Chris was also a singer in a local church choir and had a pretty girlfriend, Emily Poule, who managed his band. Chris also worked as a photocopier technician.Chris and his compatriots go to a Steel Dragon concert. In the parking lot they paper every car in sight with flyers for their next gig.

Question 1: How did the British treat the native Maori when they first arrived in New Zealand? Did they treat them like the Indigenous Australians? Question 2: How did the U.K treat the Maoris when they first arrived on New Zealand? Choose from: A). no. B). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To answer these questions, I'll begin by researching the British colonization of New Zealand and their interactions with the native Maori population, as well as the interactions between the British and the Indigenous Australians. Step 1: Research British colonization of New Zealand and their interactions with the Maoris During the early periods of British colonization, New Zealand was treated mostly as a possible site for future settlements. These settlements would be managed by the New Zealand Company, which was founded by Edward Gibbon Wakefield. The British aimed to trade and establish a partnership with the Maori people. In 1840, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, which granted the British Crown sovereignty over New Zealand while acknowledging Maori ownership of land and allowing them rights as British citizens. Step 2: Research interactions between British colonizers and Indigenous Australians The colonization of Australia by the British began in 1788 when the First Fleet arrived in Sydney. The initial interactions were primarily characterized by a lack of understanding and occasional armed conflicts between the colonizers and Indigenous Australians. Unlike in New Zealand, no formal treaty was signed between the British colonizers and Indigenous Australians. Step 3: Compare the treatment of the two indigenous populations There were notable differences in the treatment of Maori people in New Zealand and Indigenous Australians. The Treaty of Waitangi established a foundation for partnership and cooperation between the British and Maori, while no such agreement existed in Australia. While both groups faced significant challenges and injustices, the Maoris had a more formal recognition of their rights when compared to Indigenous Australians. Now, I'll answer the questions based on the research: Question 1: The British treated the native Maori people in New Zealand with an intention to establish a partnership and cooperation, which led to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. This treatment was different from how they treated Indigenous Australians, who did not have a similar treaty and experienced more conflict. Question 2: Based on the information provided, the answer to this question is: A). no. The answers to these two questions are different, as Question 1 is a descriptive answer explaining the treatment of the Maori people and the Indigenous Australians, while Question 2 is a multiple-choice question asking whether the treatment of the Maoris was similar or different."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We are given that the length is thrice its width, so we can write this as L = 3W. The area of the rectangular plot is given as 675 square meters, and since area = length × width, we can write this as A = L × W, or 675 = 3W × W. Multiplying the equation gives us 675 = 3W^2. To find W, we need to divide 675 by 3, which gives us: W^2 = 675/3 W^2 = 225 Now, finding the square root of both sides: W = √225 W = 15 meters So the width of the rectangular plot is 15 meters, which corresponds to option 'b'."},{"prompt":"Question: Q: What is the term for the development of an embryo inside an egg within the mother’s body until it hatches?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hattie McDaniel (June 10, 1895 - October 26, 1952) was an American stage actress, professional singer-songwriter, and comedian. She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. In August, 1950, McDaniel suffered a heart ailment and entered Temple Hospital in semi-critical condition. She was released in October to recuperate at home, and she was cited by United Press on Jan. 3, 1951, as showing \\"slight improvement in her recovery from a mild stroke.\\" McDaniel died of breast cancer at age 57 on October 26, 1952, in the hospital on the grounds of the Motion Picture House in Woodland Hills, California. She was survived by her brother Sam McDaniel. Thousands of mourners turned out to celebrate her life and achievements. In her will, McDaniel wrote, \\"I desire a white casket and a white shroud; white gardenias in my hair and in my hands, together with a white gardenia blanket and a pillow of red roses. I also wish to be buried in the Hollywood Cemetery\\"; Hollywood Cemetery, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, is the resting place of movie stars such as Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino. Its owner at the time, Jules Roth, refused to allow her to be buried there, because, at the time of McDaniel's death, the cemetery practiced racial segregation and would not accept the remains of black people for burial. Her second choice was Rosedale Cemetery (now known as Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery), where she lies today. In 1999, Tyler Cassidy, the new owner of the Hollywood Cemetery (renamed the Hollywood Forever Cemetery), offered to have McDaniel re-interred there. Her family did not wish to disturb her remains and declined the offer. Instead, Hollywood Forever Cemetery built a large cenotaph on the lawn overlooking its lake. It is one of Hollywood's most popular tourist attractions. McDaniel's last will and testament of December 1951 bequeathed her Oscar to Howard University, where she had been honored by the students with a luncheon after she had won her Oscar. At the time of her death, McDaniel would have had few options. Very few white institutions in that day preserved black history. Historically, black colleges had been where such artifacts were placed. Despite evidence McDaniel had earned an excellent income as an actress, her final estate was less than 10,000. The IRS claimed the estate owed more than 11,000 in taxes. In the end, the probate court ordered all of her property, including her Oscar, sold to pay off creditors. Years later, the Oscar turned up where McDaniel wanted it to be: Howard University, where, according to reports, it was displayed in a glass case in the university's drama department. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Were there any other requests?","completion":"Yes, Hattie McDaniel had some other requests in her will.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The oxygen travels to the lungs through the windpipe - The air sacs in the lungs send the oxygen into the blood stream - The carbon dioxide in the blood stream is transferred to the air sacs - The lungs expel through the nose or mouth back into the environment. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the process of respiration is: 1. Inhalation of air through the nose or mouth: The process of respiration begins with the inhalation of air through the nostrils or mouth. As air enters the respiratory system, it passes through the nasal or oral cavity where it becomes filtered, moistened, and warmed. The air then travels through the pharynx (throat) and larynx (voice box) before it enters the trachea (windpipe). To summarize, the complete process of respiration should be as follows: 1. Inhalation of air through the nose or mouth: Air is inhaled through the nostrils or mouth and passes through the nasal or oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx before entering the trachea. 2. The oxygen travels to the lungs through the windpipe: Inhaled air proceeds down the trachea, which branches into two bronchi, one for each lung. The bronchi further subdivide into smaller bronchioles, which ultimately terminate in tiny air sacs called alveoli. 3. The air sacs in the lungs send the oxygen into the bloodstream: The alveoli are surrounded by a dense network of capillaries, allowing for the exchange of gases between the air and blood. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli and binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, while carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses from the blood into the alveoli. 4. The carbon dioxide in the bloodstream is transferred to the air sacs: As the oxygen in the alveoli binds to hemoglobin and becomes part of the blood, the carbon dioxide that was previously bound to the hemoglobin is released. This carbon dioxide then diffuses across the alveolar walls, entering the air within the alveoli to be expelled from the body. 5. The lungs expel carbon dioxide through the nose or mouth back into the environment: Once the exchange of gases has taken place in the alveoli, the now carbon dioxide-rich air is carried back through the bronchioles, bronchi, and trachea during exhalation. The air passes through the larynx, pharynx, and finally, the mouth or nose, where it is expelled into the environment."},{"prompt":"Q:Facts: - residence: south sioux city , nebraska - state legislature: nebraska - preceded: l. patrick engel - party: democrat - district: 17th - term end: 2010 - succeeded: dave bloomfield - term start: 2009 - state: nebraska - birth date: 6 july 1955 - birth place: sioux city , iowa Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of robert giese .

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the band that achieved huge commercial success with its second album, Nevermind? from the following article ? The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity. In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called \\"college rock\\".A 1985 Rolling Stone feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, \\"Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead.\\" By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including indie rock, gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.As American alternative bands like Sonic Youth, which had grown out of the no wave scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years.

He noticed when he rolled his ball across the sand that it moved slower than when he rolled it across a wooden plank. This is because the _____ has less resistance. (A) wooden plank (B) sand Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"sand\\" and \\"wooden plank\\". A:","completion":"The ball moved slower when Ben rolled it across the sand compared to when he rolled it across the wooden plank. This was due to a difference in resistance offered by the two surfaces. In this scenario, the wooden plank has less resistance, making it easier for the ball to roll across and maintain its speed as compared to the sand. When an object, such as a ball, moves over a surface, it experiences resistance due to the contact between the object and the surface. This resistance, also known as friction, opposes the motion and causes the object to decelerate and eventually come to a stop. In the case of the sand, there is more resistance because the individual sand particles interact with the ball and each other, creating a greater frictional force. The irregular-shaped sand particles and the fact that they can shift position cause more surface area for friction to act upon. This increased friction slows the ball down more quickly than when it rolls over the wooden plank. On the other hand, the wooden plank is a more uniform and smooth surface. There is less contact area between the ball and the wooden plank, meaning there is less friction and resistance acting on the ball. As a result, when the ball rolls on the wooden plank, it is able to maintain its speed better and roll farther. In summary, the ball rolled slower when rolling on sand because of the increased resistance from the friction between the ball and the sand particles, whereas the ball rolled faster on the wooden plank due to less resistance offered by its smoother surface. Based on the question, the correct answer is \\"wooden plank.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The provided short movie review describes the movie as \\"bad,\\" which indicates a negative opinion. However, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the critic's perspective, it would be ideal to have a longer and more detailed review. A detailed movie review would cover various aspects of the film, such as the plot, the characters, the performances, the cinematography, the music, and the overall impact on the audience. In a more detailed review, the critic would discuss what specifically they found to be unsatisfactory about the movie. Were the performances subpar, or did the plot have inconsistencies that made the film confusing and unengaging? Did the movie fail visually, with poor special effects or uninspired cinematography? Was the music obtrusive and detracting from the movie-watching experience, or was the pacing too slow or too fast? A well-rounded review would also typically make note of any redeeming qualities the movie might have, despite the critic's overall negative opinion. For instance, the critic might point out an impressive performance from an actor or an interesting choice made by the director. Even if the critic concluded that the movie was \\"bad,\\" they might still acknowledge some bright spots worth praising. Moreover, within a detailed review, the critic would often compare the movie to other films within the same genre, examining if there are better alternatives available or if the movie stands out as a particularly weak example of its kind. The critic may also look at how the movie fares from a cultural or social perspective, assessing if it portrays relevant themes or tries to send a meaningful message – and if it succeeds in doing so.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews.

The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head.

With my new phone, I just place the phone into the charging dock and my phone is charge wirelessly. and a hint : Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction.

Summarize this article: (CNN) There's more to Eric Casebolt than the video that showed the former police corporal slamming a bikini-clad teenage girl to the ground in McKinney, Texas, his lawyer told reporters Wednesday. And there's more to that day than those seven minutes caught on video, attorney Jane Bishkin said. \\"The video that everyone has seen only depicts a small part of Eric's actions that day,\\" Bishkin said, noting that Casebolt had responded to two suicide calls earlier Friday. Casebolt resigned on Tuesday, days after a YouTube video showing his response to reports of fighting at a McKinney pool party sparked swift allegations of racism. Bishkin said the suicide calls Casebolt dealt with earlier in his shift that day took an \\"emotional toll\\" on the 10-year veteran of the force. The officer's first stop of the day was an apartment complex, where a man had shot himself in the head in front of his family by the pool. Then, he headed to a home where a teenage girl was threatening to jump off her parents' roof. There, Casebolt helped calm the girl down so she could be taken to the hospital, Bishkin said. When reports of possible trespassing at a pool in McKinney's Craig Ranch neighborhood came through, Casebolt was \\"reluctant to respond ... given what he had just been through,\\" his attorney said. But he felt it was duty to go to the scene after there were reports of \\"possible violent assaults,\\" she said. The video tells some of the story, but not all of it, his attorney said. \\"With all that happened that day, he allowed his emotions to get the better of him,\\" Bishkin said. \\"Eric regrets that his conduct portrayed him and his department in a negative light. He never intended to mistreat anyone, but was only reacting to a situation and the challenges it presented. He apologizes to all who are offended. That day was not representative of the 10-year service to the community of McKinney, and it is his hope that by his resignation the community may start to heal.\\" His attorney said that race had nothing to do with how the officer responded. \\"He believed that those who fled were possible suspects,\\" Bishkin said. \\"He was not targeting minorities. In fact, he also detained a white female who you do not see on the video. His effort to gather information was hampered by some teenagers who were instructing others to defy police instructions.\\" Bishkin said the former officer didn't appear at a press conference Wednesday because he's faced death threats since the video went viral. \\"He's worried for his family. He's worried he may be followed,\\" she said. \\"And until that threat subsides, he's going to be in an undisclosed location.\\" Police chief: He was out of control Only one person was arrested after Friday's incident, and the charges against him were later dropped, police said Tuesday. McKinney's police chief has called Casebolt's actions \\"indefensible,\\" but said it's too soon to say whether the former officer will face charges over what happened. \\"Our policies, our training, our practice, do not support his actions,\\" Chief Greg Conley said. \\"He came into the call out of control, and as the video shows, was out of control during the incident.\\" The police union defended the former officer. \\"He was a dedicated and decorated officer who in this instance was placed in a high-stress environment that he was not fully prepared for,\\" Daniel Malenfant of the McKinney Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #107 told reporters, noting that Casebolt had won an \\"officer of the year\\" award in the past for his service. Tackled girl: 'My back was hurting bad' Dajerria Becton, the girl seen taken to the ground by Casebolt, told local station KDFW she had obeyed the officer's order to leave. \\"He told me to keep walking,\\" she said. \\"And I kept walking, and then I'm guessing he thought we were saying rude stuff to him.\\" That's when things got physical, she said. \\"He grabbed me, twisted my arm on my back and shoved me in the grass and started pulling the back of my braids,\\" Becton told KDFW. In the video, the officer places her hands behind her and kneels on her back. \\"I was telling him to get off me because my back was hurting bad,\\" Becton said. Becton wasn't charged, McKinney police said. An attorney representing Becton said the 15-year-old has been having a hard time and sleeping and eating since the incident. She's shaken by what happened -- and by all the media attention that has turned the once-anonymous teenager into a face seen around the world, attorney Hannah Stroud told reporters. Stroud said police violated Becton's civil rights, but she's still investigating what happened and trying to decide on her next steps. At this point, one thing is clear, she said: Casebolt's resignation shouldn't put an end to the police investigation. And no matter how difficult the officer's day was before he came to the pool, she said, nothing justifies how he responded. \\"Each of us operates under stress. There are appropriate ways to handle stress,\\" she said, \\"and Officer Casebolt's actions were clearly in no way appropriate, and they also do not provide a defense for what occurred.\\" ||||| \\"He does recognize that his emotions got the best of him, and the prior suicide calls put him in an emotional place that he would have preferred not to been in when responding to this call,\\" Bishkin said. ||||| DALLAS (AP) — A white Texas police officer was not targeting minorities when he wrestled a black teenage girl to the ground and brandished his gun outside a pool party, his lawyer said, but rather was fraught with emotion after responding earlier to two suicide calls.

Casebolt... (Associated Press) In this frame from video, McKinney law enforcement officials including Police Chief Greg Conley, front right, listen to Mayor Brian Loughmiller during a news conference at police headquarters, Tuesday,... (Associated Press) As activists demanded Wednesday that prosecutors charge former officer David Eric Casebolt, his attorney Jane Bishkin said Casebolt apologizes for his treatment of the girl and to others offended by his actions Friday at a community pool in the Dallas suburb of McKinney. \\"With all that happened that day, he allowed his emotions to get the better of him,\\" Bishkin said of her client, who is known to friends and family as Eric. However, the attorney for Dajerria Becton, the 15-year-old girl whom Casebolt subdued, said that while her client's family appreciated Casebolt's apology, his stress is not an adequate defense. \\"There are appropriate ways to handle stress, and Officer Casebolt's actions were in no way appropriate,\\" Hannah Stroud said Wednesday. Stroud also said the family will not decide on a next step until she and the city have completed their fact-finding, but they believe excessive force violated Dajerria's civil rights. Casebolt's first call that day was to an apartment complex where a man had fatally shot himself in front of his wife and children, Bishkin said. The former officer of the year, who resigned Tuesday, then went to a home where a teenager was threatening to kill herself by jumping from the roof of her parents' home. \\"Eric's compassion during these two incidents is a testament to his character,\\" Bishkin said, acknowledging that they had taken an \\"emotional toll\\" and made him reluctant to respond to the pool party. Ultimately, he did after hearing a violent assault had occurred, she said. Cellphone videos taken by people at the pool show Casebolt running after black teens and ordering them to the ground, then forcing the teen girl onto her stomach and placing his knees on her back. At one point, he drew his firearm after two young black men charged forward in apparent protest of the girl's treatment but holstered the weapon when two other officers intervened. Police say officers were responding to reports of teens unauthorized to use the pool who were jumping a fence to gain entry. Residents of the middle-class neighborhood have said teens attending an end-of-school party at the pool and adjacent park were acting unruly. Local and national civil rights groups held a protest Wednesday in front of the McKinney Police Department, asking that prosecutors charge the 41-year-old ex-corporal for his actions. Police Chief Greg Conley has called his actions \\"indefensible.\\" \\"We will keep on assembling and protesting until this officer is charged,\\" said Dominique Alexander with the Next Generation Action Network, based in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie. Grand juries too often have sided with police accounts of violent encounters with minorities, according to Pamela Meanes, president of the Washington, D.C.-based National Bar Association, the nation's oldest association of predominantly black lawyers and judges. That pattern has changed with the proliferation of cellphones, she told media. \\"I wonder what the narrative would be if there was no tape from this particular scene,\\" she said. Bishkin said Casebolt was \\"not targeting minorities,\\" adding, \\"he also detained a white female, who you do not see on the video.\\" The protesters did not specify what charge should be filed against Casebolt, but Heath Harris, a former Dallas County prosecutor who's representing the one person charged in the fracas, said video appears to show Casebolt could be accused of a misdemeanor count of official oppression, which covers the mistreatment or unlawful detention of people by a public servant. The Collin County district attorney's office did not respond to a call seeking comment. Meanes acknowledged teens at the pool should have done more to comply with police orders. \\"I think it's a good opportunity for America to have a conversation about mutual respect,\\" she said. McKinney police have said charges, including evading arrest, against Harris' client, 18-year-old Adrian Martin, will be dropped. Harris said Martin does not intend to sue for being arrested and jailed. \\"What his family is more interested in is making sure other kids don't find themselves in a similar situation,\\" Harris said. Meanwhile, Bishkin said death threats against Casebolt have forced him and his family to leave their home for an undisclosed location. Daniel Malenfant, president of the McKinney Fraternal Order of Police, said Casebolt hopes his resignation will \\"restore peace in the community.\\" \\"He was a dedicated and decorated officer, who in this instance was placed in a high-stress environment that he was not completely prepared for,\\" Malenfant said. ___ Associated Press reporters Jill Craig in McKinney and Jamie Stengle in Dallas contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"Former police officer Eric Casebolt's lawyer, Jane Bishkin, has spoken out about the incident in which Casebolt was recorded slamming a teenage girl to the ground at a pool party in McKinney, Texas.

Computer security Computers control functions at many utilities, including coordination of telecommunications, the power grid, nuclear power plants, and valve opening and closing in water and gas networks. The Internet is a potential attack vector for such machines if connected, but the Stuxnet worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computers not connected to the Internet can be vulnerable to physical damage caused by malicious commands sent to industrial equipment (in that case uranium enrichment centrifuges) which are infected via removable media. In 2014, the Computer Emergency Readiness Team, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, investigated 79 hacking incidents at energy companies. Q: How did the Stuxnet worm infect industrial equipment?","completion":"The Stuxnet worm infected industrial equipment through a multi-step process: 1. Initial Infection: Stuxnet primarily spread through infected removable media, such as USB drives. When a user unknowingly plugged an infected USB drive into a computer, the worm would automatically execute itself, exploiting a vulnerability in the way Windows processed shortcut files. 2. Privilege Escalation: Once executed, Stuxnet would exploit several other vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system to escalate its privileges, giving it greater control over the infected computer. 3. Propagation: After gaining control, Stuxnet would search for other vulnerable computers on the same network to infect. It utilized multiple propagation techniques, including copying itself to shared network resources and exploiting a vulnerability in Windows Print Spooler. 4. Target Identification: Stuxnet was designed to specifically target industrial control systems (ICS) using Siemens Step7 software, which is commonly used to manage Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). When Stuxnet found a suitable target, it would intercept and monitor communications between the infected computer and the PLC. 5. Payload Delivery: The ultimate goal of Stuxnet was to sabotage the target system, in this case, uranium enrichment centrifuges. It achieved this by modifying the PLC's programming code, causing the centrifuges to spin at speeds that would eventually damage them, while simultaneously sending false feedback to make the system look like it was functioning normally. In summary, the Stuxnet worm infected industrial equipment by initially spreading through removable media, propagating through networks, identifying specific target systems, and ultimately delivering its payload to sabotage the equipment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year.

Please answer this question: The organic chemical compound C12H22O11 is better known as what additive?","completion":"The organic chemical compound C12H22O11 is better known as sucrose, a common additive used primarily as a sweetening agent in various food products and beverages. Sucrose, which is composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) atoms, is a disaccharide carbohydrate sugar that is obtained mainly from sugar cane and sugar beet. It is often referred to simply as sugar, table sugar, or cane sugar. Sucrose is formed through the combination of a glucose molecule (C6H12O6) and a fructose molecule (C6H12O6) with the removal of a water molecule (H2O). The resulting structure, which can also be represented as (C6H11O5)2, is a non-reducing sugar that can be hydrolyzed to yield glucose and fructose in a 1:1 ratio. This hydrolysis typically occurs during digestion in humans, breaking down sucrose into glucose and fructose, which are then absorbed through the small intestine and utilized as energy sources by the body. As an additive, sucrose is a popular choice for sweetening food products and beverages due to its pleasant taste, relatively low price, and versatile applicability. It's been used for centuries in various culinary applications, such as baking, cooking, and preserving food items. In addition to its sweetening properties, sucrose can contribute to the texture, stability, and mouthfeel of food items as well. Some potential drawbacks of excessive sucrose consumption include tooth decay, obesity, and other health-related problems that may arise due to the overconsumption of added sugars. Moreover, a subset of the population with a rare genetic disorder called hereditary fructose intolerance cannot safely metabolize fructose and should thoroughly avoid consuming sucrose. In conclusion, the organic chemical compound C12H22O11, also known as sucrose, is widely used as an additive in the food and beverage industry for its sweetening properties, versatility, and affordability. It is essential to be aware of the potential health risks associated with excessive sugar intake and maintain a balanced diet for overall wellbeing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: Holst had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears. From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Schütz Choir, Roger Norrington. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963. When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess.On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the Snape Maltings. From 1972 Holst was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes and developed into the Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, with its own training orchestra. By this time Imogen's performances at the festival had become increasingly rare, but in 1975 she conducted a concert of Gustav Holst's brass band music, held outdoors at Framlingham Castle. A report of the event described an evening of \\"persistent drizzle ... until a diminutive figure in a special scarlet dress took the conductor's baton. The band was transformed, and played Holst's Suite as it has never been played before\\".Britten had been in poor health since undergoing heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died. Holst was unsure that she could maintain a working relationship with Pears alone, and on reaching the age of 70 in 1977, decided she would retire as artistic director after that year's festival. She made her... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who gave up the conductorship of the Purcell Singers in 1967?

Benjamin likes to stuff bell peppers when Robert comes over, but","completion":"this time he wanted to surprise his friend with something new and exciting. Benjamin always enjoyed cooking and experimenting with unique recipes, but this time he had a strong desire to outdo himself. Benjamin started planning a few days before Robert's visit. He browsed through a myriad of cookbooks, watched countless cooking shows, and scoured the internet for fresh ideas. He even called his mother, a fantastic chef in her own right, for some suggestions. A mixture of cuisines and flavors inundated his mind, making it difficult to make a decision. Ultimately, Benjamin narrowed his list down to three potential dishes: a Moroccan tagine with lamb and apricots, Thai-style basil chicken with aromatic jasmine rice, and stuffed zucchini boats filled with quinoa and roasted vegetables. Realizing that he could not make the decision alone, he sought advice from his sister Amelia, a fellow food enthusiast and his most trusted critic. After discussing the options with Amelia, Benjamin decided to prepare an elaborate three-course meal for Robert. He finalized the menu, which included a Vietnamese fresh spring roll appetizer, followed by the Moroccan tagine as the main course, and a decadent chocolate mousse for dessert. This menu catered to a symphony of different flavors, textures, and cultures, an experience he believed Robert would never forget. The day before Robert's visit, Benjamin went to the local farmers market to search for the freshest and finest ingredients. He picked up colorful bell peppers, ripe tomatoes, crisp baby spinach, succulent lamb, aromatic herbs, fragrant spices, and other ingredients that would paint a picturesque culinary canvas. On the day of the dinner, Benjamin woke up early, ready to tackle the ambitious menu. He started by marinating the lamb in an enchanting mixture of spices, allowing it to soak in the nuanced flavors for hours. He then prepared the chocolate mousse, carefully melting chocolate and meticulously folding it into whipped cream. As the evening approached, Benjamin worked tirelessly in the kitchen, ensuring that every element of the meal was cooked to perfection. The fragrances wafting through his home were intoxicating, further fueling his motivation to create an unforgettable feast. When Robert arrived, he was in awe of the beautiful tablescape that Benjamin had set. Elegant linen napkins, sparkling silverware, and an unpretentious bouquet of wildflowers graced the table, accentuating the warm and inviting atmosphere. They started with the Vietnamese fresh spring rolls, delighting in the symphony of textures and flavors - tender shrimp, crisp vegetables, fragrant mint, and the tangy dipping sauce that tied all the elements together. As they moved on to the Moroccan tagine, Robert's eyes widened at the first taste of the tender, spiced lamb and sweet apricots, perfectly complemented by a fluffy bed of couscous. The combination of bold flavors and the lamb's melt-in-your-mouth texture resulted in a dining experience that exceeded both of their expectations. Finally, it was time for dessert. The rich, velvety chocolate mousse offered the perfect ending to the exquisite meal, its decadent flavors serving as a celebration of their friendship. Throughout the evening, Benjamin and Robert savored each dish, discussing the recipes and the art of cooking, as well as sharing stories and laughter. It was through this shared love of food that their friendship had blossomed, and Benjamin felt immense satisfaction in knowing that he had not only surprised his friend but also created memories that would last a lifetime. This culinary journey they embarked on together proved that bonds forged in the kitchen were ones that could withstand the test of time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve -2371*w + 2630*w + 3626 = 0 for w.","completion":"To find the solution for w, we need to isolate w on one side of the equation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve the given linear equation: 1) First, simplify the equation by combining the w-terms. -2371w + 2630w = 259w (since -2371 + 2630 = 259) Now, the equation becomes: 259w + 3626 = 0 2) Next, we want to isolate w by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. To do this, we need to subtract 3626 from both sides. 259w + 3626 - 3626 = 0 - 3626 This simplifies to: 259w = -3626 3) To completely isolate w, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 259. 259w / 259 = -3626 / 259 When we perform the division, we get the following result: w = -14 (approximately) So, the solution for the given equation, -2371w + 2630w + 3626 = 0, is w ≈ -14."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that had their hand out to a 1-foot-tall gnome? , can you please find it? In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother—both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa—were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.\\"The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford.

Who played bass guitar in the Beatles?","completion":"Paul McCartney played bass guitar in the Beatles, one of the most influential and groundbreaking bands in the history of popular music. McCartney, born on June 18, 1942, in Liverpool, England, was a co-founder of the band alongside John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. In addition to playing bass guitar, McCartney was also a singer, songwriter, and occasional guitarist and keyboardist for the Beatles. The Beatles were initially formed in Liverpool in 1960, but it wasn't until 1962 that McCartney assumed the role of bass guitarist. Before becoming the band's bassist, McCartney primarily played rhythm guitar and piano. When the original bass player, Stuart Sutcliffe, left the band to pursue a career in art, McCartney took over that role, with some reluctance. Initially, McCartney played the bass using a Höfner 500/1 violin bass, which eventually became his signature instrument. This bass had a symmetrical double-cutaway body design, making it easy to use for left-handed players like McCartney. Throughout his tenure with the Beatles, Paul McCartney would also play the Rickenbacker 4001S, Epiphone Casino, and Fender Jazz bass guitars. As a bassist, McCartney quickly became innovative in his style, incorporating influences from Motown, R&B, and jazz. He developed a melodic approach to the instrument that was different from most rock bands of the era, emphasizing countermelodies and often utilizing chord progressions to complement the main vocal lines. As a result, McCartney's bass lines were not just the foundation but also an integral part of the overall compositions. McCartney contributed significantly to the band's songwriting efforts as well. Together with John Lennon, he became part of one of the most successful songwriting duos in music history – Lennon-McCartney. They wrote many of the Beatles' hit songs and classics, including \\"Hey Jude,\\" \\"Let It Be,\\" \\"Yesterday,\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" among others. The Beatles' catalog showcases McCartney's versatility in different musical styles, ranging from tender ballads to hard rock songs. The Beatles disbanded in 1970, but Paul McCartney's career was far from over. He went on to form the band Wings, with his wife Linda McCartney, and released several successful albums as both a solo artist and with his new group. Throughout his career, McCartney continued to play bass guitar and make significant contributions to music, garnering immense accolades for his exceptional musicianship, songwriting, and impact on popular culture. In summary, Paul McCartney played bass guitar in the Beatles and made a profound impact on the development of popular music with his innovative playing and exceptional songwriting skills. His influence can still be heard today in countless bands and artists inspired by the enduring legacy of the Beatles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Two friends met after 20 years. Tom had been smoking tobacco all these years and had some health problems related to that, while Randy quit smoking 25 years ago. Which friend had a lower risk of developing cancer of the throat?","completion":"Between Tom and Randy, Randy has a significantly lower risk of developing cancer of the throat due to his decision to quit smoking 25 years ago. Smoking tobacco is one of the primary risk factors for developing throat cancer, as it exposes the cells in the throat to dangerous chemicals and carcinogens. In Tom's case, he has been smoking tobacco consistently for the past 20 years. This prolonged exposure to carcinogens increases the risk of genetic mutations and cellular damage in his throat, which may result in cancerous growths. Additionally, Tom's health problems related to his smoking habit further emphasize the potential detrimental impact on his overall wellness and specifically increase the risk for throat cancer. On the other hand, Randy quit smoking 25 years ago, which means his body has had ample time to repair some of the damage caused by smoking. The human body is remarkably resilient and capable of healing from the effects of smoking. Within a couple of years after quitting, individuals typically experience a significant decrease in their risk of developing smoking-related health problems such as cancer. Since Randy quit smoking 25 years ago, his body has likely healed a significant portion of the damage sustained during his smoking years. As a result, his risk of developing throat cancer is considerably lower than Tom's. It's worth noting that quitting smoking is one of the most effective steps an individual can take to reduce their risk of various cancers, including throat cancer. The sooner a person quits smoking, the better their chances of reducing associated health risks. However, it's essential not to discount the fact that Randy was a smoker at some point in his life. This means that his risk for developing throat cancer, although significantly lower than Tom's, is still elevated when compared to someone who has never smoked at all. Nonetheless, Randy's decision to quit smoking 25 years ago substantially improved his health prospects and decreased his likelihood of facing severe smoking-related health complications in the future, including throat cancer. In summary, both friends have had a history of smoking, which increases the risk of developing throat cancer. However, Randy quit smoking 25 years ago, allowing his body to repair much of the damage caused by smoking, resulting in a considerably lower risk for throat cancer in comparison to Tom, who has continued to smoke all these years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This fictional character was the main protagonist of the well-known American television medical drama series, \\"House,\\" which aired on the Fox network from 2004 to 2012. Dr. Gregory House, portrayed by British actor Hugh Laurie, was the head of the Department of Diagnostic Medicine at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Known for his unconventional approach to medicine, his sarcastic wit, and his unique problem-solving skills, Dr. House built and led a team of specialized doctors to help him diagnose unusual and complex cases, often resorting to unorthodox treatments. In the earlier seasons, Dr. House's original diagnostic team consisted of Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps), a neurologist with a background in criminal psychology; Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), an intensivist and surgeon from Australia; and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), an immunologist with a strong moral compass. Throughout the series, this team assisted Dr. House in diagnosing and treating various mysterious illnesses, often facing numerous ethical and medical challenges along the way. Following the conclusion of a few seasons, much of the original team departed from the Department of Diagnostic Medicine for various reasons, and Dr. House sought to form a new team. He began a so-called \\"reality show\\"-style hiring process during Season 4, which involved interviewing and testing numerous medical professionals for their ability to think creatively, perform under high-pressure situations, and effectively contribute to the diagnostic process. By the end of this process, Dr. House chose Dr. Remy \\"Thirteen\\" Hadley (Olivia Wilde), a specialist in internal medicine and genetic medicine with a complex personal history; Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), a skilled plastic surgeon with a knack for understanding human behavior; and Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn), a sports medicine specialist with a talent for outside-the-box thinking. With the new team in place, Dr. House continued to tackle difficult diagnostic cases, using his extraordinary medical intuition and sheer persistence to save lives and uncover the truth behind various illnesses. Throughout the remainder of the series, the team underwent several changes and challenges, as members occasionally departed and returned, each contributing their unique skills and perspectives to the ongoing storylines and medical mysteries encountered by Dr. House and his colleagues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lauren Adrian (Jennifer Lopez), an impassioned American news reporter for the \\"Chicago Sentinel\\" wants to be assigned to the Iraq front-lines to cover the war.

The driver asks her if she minds if he goes to a gas station to fill up, and Eva agrees. However, he takes her to a remote place and assaults and rapes her, together with another man, who then tries to strangle her. The two men, believing she's dead, bury her alive. With the little energy she has left, Eva escapes. Adrian heads to Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Chihuahua, on the U.S.âMexico border to investigate the murders, hoping that if she does well she will be promoted by Morgan to be a foreign correspondent.

She also meets Eva. The three try to find the two killers and have them prosecuted. For this purpose she starts working in the factory, in order to act as bait on the bus ride. The driver tries to assault her in the same way he did Eva, and although police assistance has been arranged, they are at the wrong place. She manages to escape her attacker.

Flow is designed to be more sensitive than a mouse and will allow people to edit documents, draw and control apps by touching it or swiping in mid air above the gadget. Flow, a gadget that responds to gestures and touch could be used to edit documents, draw and control apps, replacing the computer mouse. It can be programmed with shortcuts for more than 30 applications, enabling users to control Spotify with the flick of their wrist or use it to manipulate images in Photoshop. The gadget, designed by engineers in Berlin, Germany, works alongside a desktop or laptop via a Bluetooth connection, with apps such as Final Cut Pro X, SoundCloud, Spotify and YouTube. The engineers and computer scientists are raising money on crowd funding site Indiegogo to put Flow into production. Flow (pictured) works alongside a desktop or laptop via a Bluetooth connection, with apps such as Final Cut Pro X, SoundCloud, Spotify and YouTube. For example, a user could programme the device to skip tracks in a Spotify playlist by swiping in mid-air over the device.

Hypothesis: A girl is outside playing volleyball. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude the hypothesis given the premise. The information provided in the premise does not support the hypothesis. They contain two different scenarios. In the premise, we have a girl playing in a house, positioned between a window and a stack of shelves. Based on this, we don't know what she's playing with or what kind of activity she's engaged in, but it is clear that she is indoors. The environment is defined by the interior features such as a window and a stack of shelves. Other than that, the premise doesn’t give us any piece of information about the girl’s actions other than she is playing. On the other hand, the hypothesis presents a completely different situation where a girl is outside and specifically playing volleyball. Playing volleyball typically requires an outdoor setting or a substantially-sized indoor setting (like a sports hall) to accommodate for the game's requirements. It's a team sport that involves a volley ball and a net, and a significant amount of space for players to move around. The two situations are contrasting in terms of location (inside vs. outside), activity (unspecified vs. playing volleyball), and the environment (between a window and shelf vs. likely in a field or a court). In order for the premise to support the hypothesis, we would need additional information that creates a bridge between the indoor play setup and the outdoor volleyball activity. Something like \\"The girl went outside after playing in the house and started playing volleyball\\" could effectively link the premise to the hypothesis. However, with the current given premises, there's no direct correlation or link that would allow us to deduce the hypothesis from the premise.

Write a question about the following article: Henry Grey matriculated at Trinity College in 1615, and was granted an M.A. that year, during the visit of King James I of England. He married Lady Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter by his second wife, Elizabeth Drury. Lady Anne Cecil was the heiress of the borough and manor of Stamford. In March 1628, Henry was created Earl of Stamford. Just before the outbreak of the English Civil War, he was included as one of the opponents of King Charles I of England, and was made lord lieutenant of Leicestershire. After some operations around Leicester, he occupied Hereford, and when compelled to abandon the city, marched to Cornwall. At the Battle of Stratton, on 16 May 1643, his troops were beaten by the Royalists; driven into Exeter, the Earl of Stamford was forced to surrender the city after a siege of three months. He was certainly no general, and was charged with cowardice. He took no further part in the military operations of the war, although once or twice he was employed on other businesses. The ravages of the Royalists had reduced him to poverty, and distrusted by the House of Commons, he had great difficulty in getting any compensation from Parliament. After a period of retirement, he declared for King Charles II of England during a rising in August 1659, and was arrested, but was soon released.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

Lord considers it as much a traditional \\"cottage garden as Marie Antoinette was a milkmaid\\". Here, as elsewhere, Sackville-West was much influenced by William Robinson, a gardener she greatly admired and who had done much to popularise the concept of the cottage garden. It contains four beds, surrounded by simple paths, with planting in colours that Sackville-West described as those of the sunset. Plants include a range of dahlias, a particular favourite of Nicolson's, and the red-hot poker, which he despised. In a 1937 letter to his wife he observed, \\"I think the secret of your gardening is simply that you have the courage to abolish ugly or unsuccessful flowers.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: Ayam penyet, region, Malaysia. Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"Ayam penyet is a popular traditional Indonesian and Malaysian dish that has gained widespread recognition not only in its regions of origin but also among food enthusiasts from all around the world. Its origins can be traced back to Java, one of the major islands in Indonesia. The dish is known for its distinctive preparation method, unique flavor profile, and its cultural significance in the culinary scenes of both Indonesia and Malaysia. In its essence, Ayam penyet is made up of three main components, namely: the marinated and fried chicken, the spicy sambal, and the steamed rice. However, these elements often come with a variety of side dishes and garnishes that further elevate the taste and presentation of the meal. 1. Marinated and fried chicken: The primary star of Ayam penyet is the chicken. The chicken is typically marinated in a combination of spices and herbs, such as garlic, shallots, coriander, turmeric, and galangal, before being deep-fried to achieve a tender and juicy texture on the inside and crispiness on the outside. The marinating process ensures that the chicken is infused with the rich and flavorful essence of the spices, creating an unforgettable taste. 2. Spicy sambal: The sambal is a crucial element in Ayam penyet as it adds an extra layer of spice and flavor to the dish. This fiery condiment is made from a blend of crushed fresh red and green bird's eye chilies, garlic, shallots, tomatoes, and shrimp paste, among other ingredients. The end result is a tangy, spicy, and slightly sweet sauce that complements the chicken perfectly. Some variations might also include additional ingredients like fermented soybean (tempeh) or roasted peanuts. 3. Steamed rice: Ayam penyet is traditionally served with steamed white rice, providing a filling and neutral base upon which the bold flavors of the chicken and sambal can shine through. The fluffy rice pairs wonderfully with the rich flavors of the dish, helping to balance out the intense spice levels of the sambal. Aside from the main components, Ayam penyet is often garnished with fresh vegetables such as cucumber, tomatoes, and lettuce to add a refreshing crunch, as well as a serving of tempeh or tofu for added protein. Another unique aspect of the dish is the way it is served - the fried chicken is often \\"penyet\\" or \\"smashed\\" with a mortar and pestle to flatten it, making it easier to absorb the flavors of the sambal and other accompanying ingredients. The widespread popularity of Ayam penyet in Malaysia can be attributed to the shared cultural and historical ties between Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as the influences of Javanese cuisine on Malaysian food. The dish has become increasingly common in Malaysia, with numerous restaurants and street food stalls offering their own unique renditions of Ayam penyet. The dish has become a beloved staple in the Malaysian culinary scene, reflecting the rich multicultural heritage that has shaped the country's diverse range of flavors and dishes. In conclusion, Ayam penyet, with its deep-rooted regional origins and rich, savory taste, has become a cherished culinary delicacy that showcases the unique heritage and flavors of both Indonesia and Malaysia. Its methodical preparation of marinated and fried chicken, fiery sambal, and steamed rice helps to create a harmonious blend of textures and flavors that continue to captivate food lovers from all walks of life. As Ayam penyet continues to grow in popularity, it serves as an enduring testament to the power of food in uniting people and cultures across borders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. swords were placed as gifts in rich men’s graves and a sword could also be used as an offering to the divine powers, which inhabited the lakes and bogs. Make this proper case","completion":"Swords have played a significant role in various cultures throughout human history, not only as tools of warfare and status symbols, but also as meaningful objects in religious and spiritual practices. In many ancient societies, swords were placed within the graves of wealthy individuals as gifts, signifying their power and importance in their lifetime. Furthermore, swords were also used as offerings to divine powers that were believed to inhabit lakes, bogs and other natural landscapes. In the case of swords as grave goods, these were typically placed alongside the bodies of the deceased to represent their social standing, military prowess, and authority during their lives. This practice was common in various European cultures, such as the Norse, Celts, and Anglo-Saxons, who considered the sword to be an integral part of a warrior's identity and a symbol of honor. For these societies, the burial of a sword with its owner served as a testament to their achievements in life and ensured their elevated status in the afterlife. In many instances, swords were even personalized for their owners, boasting intricate designs and craftsmanship that showcased the skill of the swordsmith, as well as the power and wealth of the owner. The quality and decorative elements of the sword acted as a visual representation of the individual's accomplishments, and the inclusion of these items in their graves signified the continuation of their influence beyond death. In addition to being burial items, swords also held a significant spiritual and religious importance. Many ancient societies believed that divine powers or spirits resided in natural landscapes, such as lakes, bogs, and rivers. These beliefs led them to make offerings to these entities in the form of valuable objects, including swords, as a way to gain favor and protection. Swords were often chosen for these sacrificial offerings due to their symbolic ties to protection, power, and authority. Rituals involving the deposition of swords in bodies of water were often elaborate affairs, designed to appease the divine beings and ensure the continued prosperity and safety of those making the offerings. In some cases, these offerings were made during periods of unrest or uncertainty, as a plea for protection or assistance from the divine beings. In other instances, the deposition of swords might have been a gesture of gratitude after a successful endeavor, such as a battle or an abundant harvest. Regardless of the specific circumstances surrounding these rituals, the inclusion of a sword in these offerings was a significant and meaningful act. In conclusion, swords held a dual purpose in the lives of many ancient cultures, serving both as symbols of personal power and as objects of spiritual and religious significance. The inclusion of these weapons as gifts in the graves of wealthy individuals and offerings to divine powers highlights the multifaceted nature of these items and the lasting impact they had on the societies that utilized them. Today, the discovery and study of these ancient swords provide valuable insights into the beliefs, practices, and values of past cultures, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of our shared human history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: How do I hide the screw heads when making a worm bin for apartments>","completion":"To hide the screw heads when making a worm bin for apartments, follow these steps: 1. Gather materials: In order to create a worm bin, you'll need the following materials: - A plastic or wooden container with a lid - Drill or an awl - Screws (flat head, countersunk screws are best for this purpose) - Screwdriver or a power drill with a screwdriver bit - Sandpaper - Wood glue (if using wooden boards or panels) - Wood filler or plastic filler (depending on the container material) - Vernier caliper or a ruler - Paint and paintbrush (optional) 2. Measure and mark screw locations: Before drilling, measure and mark the locations where you want to put the screws. This will ensure even spacing and help you avoid any potential mistakes. Make sure to mark the spots in less visible areas, like at the corners or sides of the bin. 3. Pre-drilling holes: Carefully pre-drill the holes into the container material for each marked screw location. This will prevent the material from cracking or splitting when you insert the screws. Ensure the drill bit's diameter is slightly smaller than the screw's diameter. 4. Countersink the holes: Next, countersink the holes using a countersink bit on your drill. This will create a tapered hole that will allow the flat head screws to sit flush with the bin's surface. Make sure not to go too deep, as this might weaken the structure. 5. Assemble the bin: Assemble the worm bin by using wood glue and screws on parts that needed to be attached. Insert each screw into a countersunk hole and fasten it using a screwdriver, ensuring it sits flush with the surface. 6. Fill the gaps: To hide the screw heads completely and create a smooth surface, apply wood filler or plastic filler over the recessed screw heads. Let the filler dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. 7. Sand the surface: Once the filler is dry, use sandpaper to smooth out the filler-filled areas and blend them in with the rest of the container. This will ensure that the heads of the screws are hidden and will be less noticeable. 8. Paint the bin (optional): If you want to give your worm bin a more aesthetically pleasing appearance, consider applying a coat of paint. This can help further conceal the screw heads and give your bin a professional finish.

What is the answer?","completion":"In heraldry, a bar sinister – also known as bend sinister – is a broad diagonal stripe that runs from the top right to the bottom left on a shield. Traditionally, it is said to signify illegitimacy or bastardy in the family lineage of the bearer. However, the true meaning and use of the bend sinister are often misunderstood. Firstly, it is crucial to understand that a heraldic shield, also called an escutcheon, is a representation of a noble person's lineage and family connections. The symbols, colors, and designs used on a shield were meant to tell a unique and identifiable story about the owner and their ancestry. In heraldry, each design element is named and used to signify specific characteristics, qualities, or values of the person who bears the coat of arms. The bend sinister is a broad diagonal band that slants from the top right corner (dexter upper corner) to the bottom left corner (sinister lower corner) of a shield. Contrary to popular belief, the bend sinister does not necessarily signify illegitimacy on its own. In some cases, it may have been used to imply such unofficial connections, but it was never a steadfast rule in the heraldic tradition. The bend sinister had its meanings and variations too. One common misconception is that the bend sinister signifies a stain on the family's honor, owing to a family member's illegitimate birth. However, this interpretation has been mostly discredited by heraldic experts. Historically, it is believed that the bend sinister may have been used to indicate the left-handedness of the bearer, or simply to differentiate between different branches of a family, without implying any negative connotation to the bearer's lineage. Another variant of the bend sinister is the baton sinister – a thinner diagonal stripe running from top right to bottom left, which was used to signify illegitimacy more explicitly. This narrower diagonally drawn line, different from the broad bar sinister, had a more specific meaning and was placed on a shield to clearly mark someone as coming from an illegitimate line. In conclusion, although the bar sinister, or bend sinister, is traditionally attached to the idea of illegitimacy, the concept of its use as a symbol of bastardy is more a romanticized notion than a strict heraldic tradition. The bend sinister might have indeed been used to differentiate or imply a certain connection at times, but it was never a steadfast rule in the practice of heraldry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Then, you need to write down your business' name, how people can talk to you, and where you get your bills. Next, you need to tell them what kind of store yours is - is it a sports store, a big shop with lots of different things, or a shoe shop? You also need to tell them what kind of business you have, when you started it and a special number called a tax ID. Then, you must tell them about the boss of the store - their name, what job they do, and some more info. If there are more bosses, you need to say how much of the business each boss owns - like if you and your brother owned a toy car, you might own 50% each.

He also voiced concern that political considerations are driving U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in to compromise joint security for more false denuclearization promises from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “I am rather pessimistic about whether this negotiation will work out well or not. The only means for North Korea to maintain its regime is its nuclear program. The moment that North Korea gives up its nuclear program, and the moment it opens up to reform, the Kim Jong Un regime will collapse,” said Hong Joon-pyo, the chairman of the Liberty Korea Party. On June 12, Trump and Kim will meet in Singapore to try to reach an agreement to end the North’s threatening nuclear weapons program in exchange for economic incentives and security guarantees that could include a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice that has been enforced since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Many South Korean conservatives had voiced strong support for Trump’s “maximum pressure” polices to force Pyongyang to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons through tough international sanctions in place that ban 90 percent of the country’s trade, and the threat of military action. But they have been troubled by recent statements coming from the Trump administration indicating the United States may be willing to soften its demands for the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of the North’s nuclear program before offering any sanctions relief. Hong is worried that Trump may seek a deal that would quickly end the North’s intercontinental ballistic missile program that directly threatens the U.S., and leave the regional nuclear threat to be resolved later. Trump seems overly intent to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough, Hong said, to shift the media focus away from the ongoing special prosecutor investigation he is facing over Russia’s...

With Detroit's declaration on Thursday of bankruptcy, some of the city's creditors may think so. The museum of the Detroit Institute of Arts, home to 60,000 pieces of art, is also home to the original Howdy Doody marionette puppet that was the star of its own 1950s-era children's show. It was acquired in 2001, according to the DIA's director of communications. \\"It is estimated that the marionette could sell at auction for 400,000 to 500,000,\\" said Gary Busk, a puppet collector who was featured on the television program \\"Antiques Road Show.\\" That would hardly make a dent in the city's immense 18 billion debt. But, despite an opinion from the state's attorney general that appeared to assure Howdy would stay, legal experts say there's still a risk he could wind up packing his bags and riding into the sunset with many of the museum's other residents. The arts institute's director, Graham Beal, maintains that DIA's collection is among the top six in the Western Hemisphere. While he could not specify a value, Beal told CNN in May that it would likely be in the billions of dollars. It was then that that a request by Detroit's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, for an inventory of holdings sparked alarm among Detroit residents and museum administrators that the DIA's collection could be sold to help pay off the city's debt. Then, in June, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette issued an opinion stating that Detroit can't sell the DIA's art, although the city technically owns the collection. \\"It is my opinion, therefore, that the art collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts is held by the City of Detroit in charitable trust for the people of Michigan, and no piece in the collection may thus be sold, conveyed, or transferred to satisfy city debts or obligations,\\" Schuette told CNN in a written statement. He said that he recognized the extreme financial hardships the city is experiencing, and the challenges the city faces, but argued that selling the artwork would \\"damage not only the city's but the state's cultural commonwealth.\\" But the opinion could be for naught, said Eric Scorsone of Michigan State University prior to Thursday's declaration. \\"It's certainly better than nothing, but a state attorney general's opinion is certainly not going to be definitive in federal bankruptcy court,\\" Scorsone said. \\"I don't think that is going to carry a huge amount of weight.\\" Laura Martell, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, echoed that sentiment. \\"He just issued an opinion, which is not binding on anyone and certainly has no legal effect in a bankruptcy case,\\" she said. \\"A bankruptcy judge may or may not find it persuasive on the merits of its analysis, but it has no binding effect.\\" Bill Nowling, spokesman for emergency manager Orr, said that \\"nothing is being considered for sale.\\" \\"All of the city's creditors have asked about the DIA and whether it has been valued -- it has not -- and some creditors have said everything that isn't nailed down should be sold to pay them,\\" Nowling wrote in an e-mail to CNN. \\"That won't happen because the emergency manager's proposed restructuring plan is focused on restoring essential city services.\\" However, Detroit's creditors say promises were made and debts must be paid. \\"If they're talking about not being solvent when they have these assets, they do still have some degree of solvency by selling these assets,\\" said Peter Hayes, a managing director at BlackRock Inc., an investment management corporation whose investors are owed approximately 200 million by the city of Detroit. Even as signs of the coming bankruptcy grew stronger, the DIA's officials remained resolute in their determination to protect their collection. \\"Our position hasn't changed. We only sell works of art to buy works of art,\\" Beal said. \\"We are not given works of art so that we can settle debts made (during) decades of mismanagement and corruption.\\" Howdy Doody is a marionette in the image of a freckled-face boy dressed in cowboy attire. \\"The Howdy Doody Show\\" ran on NBC from 1947 to 1960. One of Muppet creator Jim Henson's Kermit the Frog puppets is also among the DIA's puppet collection, which boasts around 800 pieces. The DIA was founded in 1885 and houses more than 100 galleries, a lecture and recital hall, an art reference library, and a state-of-the-art conservation laboratory, according to the museum's website. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"Detroit's budget is in big trouble, and they owe a lot of money. Some people think that selling special things from the Detroit Institute of Arts, like a famous puppet named Howdy Doody, could help pay off some of the debt. But, selling one puppet wouldn't make enough money to fix the problem. Some people worry that the museum's whole art collection could be sold, but the boss of the museum said they won't sell their art to pay for the city's problems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Fire Department says the blaze broke out on the 50th floor shortly before 6 p.m. Saturday. (AP Photo/Andres Kudacki) (Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) — A raging fire that tore through a 50th-floor apartment at Trump Tower killed a man inside and sent flames and thick, black smoke pouring from windows of the president's namesake skyscraper. New York Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said the cause of Saturday's blaze is not yet known but the apartment was \\"virtually entirely on fire\\" when firefighters arrived after 5:30 p.m. \\"It was a very difficult fire, as you can imagine,\\" Nigro told reporters outside the building in midtown Manhattan. \\"The apartment is quite large.\\" Todd Brassner, 67, who was in the apartment, was taken to a hospital and died a short time later, the New York Police Department said. Property records obtained by The Associated Press indicate Brassner was an art dealer who had purchased his 50th-floor unit in 1996. Officials said four firefighters also suffered minor injuries. An investigation is ongoing. Shortly after news of the fire broke, Trump, who was in Washington, tweeted: \\"Fire at Trump Tower is out. Very confined (well built building). Firemen (and women) did a great job. THANK YOU!\\" Asked if that assessment was accurate, Nigro said, \\"It's a well-built building. The upper floors, the residence floors, are not sprinklered.\\" Fire sprinklers were not required in New York City high-rises when Trump Tower was completed in 1983. Subsequent updates to the building code required commercial skyscrapers to install the sprinklers retroactively, but owners of older residential high-rises are not required to install sprinklers unless the building undergoes major renovations. Some fire-safety advocates pushed for a requirement that older apartment buildings be retrofitted with sprinklers when New York City passed a law requiring them in new residential highrises in 1999, but officials in the administration of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani said that would be too expensive. Nigro noted that no member of the Trump family was in the 664-foot tower Saturday. Trump's family has an apartment on the top floors of the 58-story building, but he has spent little time in New York since taking office. The headquarters of the Trump Organization is on the 26th floor. Nigro said firefighters and Secret Service members checked on the condition of Trump's apartment. About 200 firefighters and emergency medical service workers responded to the fire, he said. Some residents said they didn't get any notification from building management to evacuate. Lalitha Masson, a 76-year-old resident, called it \\"a very, very terrifying experience.\\" Masson told The New York Times that she did not receive any announcement about leaving, and that when she called the front desk no one answered. \\"When I saw the television, I thought we were finished,\\" said Masson, who lives on the 36th floor with her husband, Narinder, who is 79 and has Parkinson's disease. She said she started praying because she felt it was the end. \\"I called my oldest son and said goodbye to him because the way it looked everything was falling out of the window, and it reminded me of 9/11,\\" Masson said. ||||| New York (CNN) A fire broke out at Trump Tower on Saturday, leaving one man dead and six firefighters injured, the New York City Fire Department said. Police identified the man killed as Todd Brassner, 67, a resident of the building's 50th floor. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition but later died, said spokeswoman Angelica Conroy of the Fire Department. Brassner was unconscious and unresponsive when firefighters pulled him out, the New York Police Department said. The medical examiner's office will determine the cause of death. The fire was contained to the 50th floor of the tower, located on Fifth Avenue in New York. It was ruled under control around 9 p.m., two hours after it was originally reported, the FDNY tweeted.

Background: Jon Steven Young (born October 11, 1961) is a former professional American football quarterback who played 15 seasons in the National Football League (NFL) and is best known for his 13 seasons with the San Francisco 49ers. He also played for the NFL Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Los Angeles Express of the United States Football League (USFL). Young played college football for Brigham Young University, setting school and NCAA records en route to being runner-up for the 1983 Heisman Trophy. Young was named the AP's NFL Most Valuable Player in 1992 and 1994, and was the MVP of Super Bowl XXIX. Context: By the start of the 1992 season, it appeared that Young's starting job was in serious peril. In addition to having to compete with Bono, Montana appeared to be close to recovering from his elbow tendon surgery. San Francisco came close to trading Young to the Los Angeles Raiders, but no deal was finalized and it turned out that Montana would not recover in time to start in the opening game. Montana would not return until the final game of the 1992 season, a Monday Night home game against the Detroit Lions. Montana played the entire second half and guided the 49ers to victory. Young ended up as San Francisco's starting quarterback, but once again got off to a rough start. On the fifth play of the opening game at the Giants, he suffered a concussion and was replaced by Bono, who threw two touchdown passes while leading the 49ers to a 31-14 win. The following week, San Francisco lost 34-31 to the Buffalo Bills, despite a career-high 449 passing yards and three touchdowns from Young, in a game that for the first time in NFL history there were zero punts from either team. Young recovered and led the 49ers on a five-game winning streak, capped off by a 56-17 win over the Atlanta Falcons in which Young passed for 399 yards and three touchdowns. After missing most of the next game (a 24-14 loss to the Cardinals) with the flu, he led San Francisco to victory in all of their remaining games of the season, giving the team a 14-2 record. He went on to throw for 227 yards and 2 touchdowns, and rush for 73 yards, in a 20-13 divisional playoff win over the Washington Redskins. The 49ers lost the NFC title game, however, 30-20 against the eventual Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys. Young threw for 313 yards, completing 71.4% of his passes while passing for one touchdown and rushing for another. He also threw two interceptions, but the final one came with the outcome of the game already decided. Young finished the season with 3,465 passing yards and 537 rushing yards, along with an NFL best 25 touchdown passes and 107.0 passer rating, earning him the NFL Most Valuable Player Award and his first selection to the Pro Bowl. He was the first quarterback ever to record a triple digit rating in consecutive seasons. Many credit Young's turnaround to the mentoring of the 49ers' new Offensive Coordinator Mike Shanahan, who worked with Young on combining his running skill with on-the-move passing decisions. Question: What did he do? Answer:","completion":"In the 1992 NFL season, Steve Young faced several challenges, including the possibility of losing his starting position due to the potential return of Joe Montana and competition with Steve Bono. However, Montana's recovery took longer than expected, and Young remained the starting quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers. Despite suffering a concussion in the first game and losing the following week's game, Young displayed his resilience, leading the team on a five-game winning streak. He then led the 49ers to victories in all remaining games, achieving a 14-2 season record. Under the guidance of new Offensive Coordinator Mike Shanahan, Young focused on combining his running skills with on-the-move passing decisions. Throughout the season, Young threw for 3,465 passing yards and 537 rushing yards, scoring an NFL best of 25 touchdown passes and achieving a 107.0 passer rating. As a result, he became the first quarterback to record a triple-digit rating in consecutive seasons. For his remarkable performance, Young was awarded the NFL Most Valuable Player and earned his first selection to the Pro Bowl. Although the 49ers lost the NFC title game against the Dallas Cowboys, Young concluded an impressive season which solidified his status as one of the NFL's top quarterbacks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This strategic move comes at a crucial time when the sports broadcasting giant needs to reestablish its dominance amidst the rising competition. Body: The popular reporter, known for their in-depth analysis and engaging reporting style, left ESPN last year citing personal reasons. Their departure came amidst a wave of high-profile exits that raised concerns about the network's ability to retain top-tier talent. During their time away from ESPN, the reporter gained significant attention and praise for their work with other media outlets. Their return is seen as a major win for ESPN, as some fans and insiders attribute the decline in viewership to the network's inability to hold onto its most beloved reporting assets. Over the past year, ESPN has witnessed several top talents leaving due to a variety of reasons, such as contract disputes and better opportunities elsewhere. These departures led to criticisms about the company's management, citing a lack of strategic direction and adaptability to the changing media landscape. In response to these challenges, ESPN has made significant changes to its structure, including investment in digital platforms and rebuilding relationships with key on-air personalities. The return of the popular reporter marks a new chapter for the network and demonstrates the organization's commitment to providing unparalleled sports coverage to fans around the world. Conclusion: The return of the popular reporter to ESPN signals a promising step forward for the beleaguered network, which has faced extensive scrutiny due to its recent spate of departures. As ESPN looks to reestablish its dominance in the sports broadcasting arena, the restored faith in its ability to retain top talent bodes well for the company's future prospects.

Please answer the following question: Matthew is training to run a marathon. Every day he runs up and down a hill near his house until he is out of breath, then walks around his house until his breathing rate returns to normal. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will breathing rate increase or decrease when the body requires more energy to preform a task such as running? Hint: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Answer:","completion":"The breathing rate will increase when the body requires more energy to perform a task such as running. During physical activities like running, your muscles are working harder and require more energy than in a state of rest or less strenuous activities. This additional energy is obtained through the process of cellular respiration, during which glucose is converted into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) - the direct source of energy for the cells. This process needs oxygen to occur - hence, the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. In cases like Matthew's, where he is training to run a marathon, his body has to go through consistent and intense bouts of exercise. As he runs up and down the hill, his muscles are working overtime and need more ATP, and therefore more oxygen. To meet this increased oxygen demand, his body automatically increases his breathing rate. This is why Matthew finds himself out of breath after his uphill-downhill runs. An increased rate of breathing ensures that more oxygen is taken in with each breath, and more carbon dioxide, a waste product of respiration, is expelled out of the body. This increase in oxygen intake helps to fuel the ongoing cellular respiration and energy production, and therefore helps Matthew to continue his runs. As his breathing rate increases, he's able to continue to fulfill the higher energy requirement of his exercising muscles. Conversely, when Matthew walks around his house and his physical activity level decreases, his muscles don't need as much ATP or oxygen. As a result, his breathing rate decreases to its normal level as his muscle cells return to their baseline metabolic rates. In biological terms, Matthew's increased respiration rate during running isn't just a simple gas exchange with the environment. It showcases the complex interplay between the physical environment and his cellular environment, driven by the chemistry of his body needing oxygen to create energy, and how that correlates with his body's energy usage during physical exertion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 60-year-old woman was taken by ambulance to Southland Hospital after firefighters battled for 30 minutes to cut her from her car. Acting Senior Sergeant Brock Davis of Invercargill, said emergency services were called to the scene of the crash at the crossroads of Motorimu Rd and State Highway I shortly before 5:00 p.m. yesterday. Mr. Davis said a Mitsubishi car driven by a 30-year-old man traveling north on the highway and the woman's southbound Suzuki Alto collided . The man suffered slight injuries in the crash, he said. Invercargill Passenger Transport Ltd driver Bill McDermott and his passengers--New Zealand Aluminum Smelters Ltd workers were first on the scene and alerted emergency services. The scene at the spot was disordered, Mr. McDermott said. \\"There was a car on its side and a guy wandering around who was quite excited,\\" he said. \\"We stopped, got out and found a lady trapped in her car ...... then we noticed flames in the engine bay and the smell of petrol.\\" Mr. McDermott took a fire extinguisher from the bus, doused the flames, and several other workers controlled traffic.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the album \\"Autumn Almanac\\" was on? The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \\"the most beautiful song in the English language\\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \\"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\\". The songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \\"Death of a Clown\\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, \\"Autumn Almanac\\", in early October.

He needs to determine the properties of each state. In which state the distance between particles are smaller, state B or state C? Answer:","completion":"In state B, which is the liquid state, the distance between particles is smaller. In the different states of matter, the arrangement of particles varies: 1. Solid state (state A) - In the solid state, particles are closely packed together in an orderly and fixed arrangement, having a strong intermolecular bond. Typically, solids have a defined shape and volume. 2. Liquid state (state B) - In the liquid state, particles are still relatively close to each other but have slightly more freedom to move compared to the solid state. The intermolecular forces are weaker in a liquid, allowing them to flow and take the shape of the container. Liquids have a defined volume but not a fixed shape. 3. Gaseous state (state C) - In the gaseous state, particles are widely spaced, having the weakest intermolecular forces, which results in them being free to move in any direction. Gases do not have a defined shape or volume and can expand to fill any container they are in. So, in comparison between state B (liquid) and state C (gaseous), the distance between particles in the liquid state (state B) is smaller than in the gaseous state (state C)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: Oaks, which all fall under the genus (Quercus) are wide-spread trees found in temperate climates the world over. There are over 600 known species of Oak, with 55 found in the continental United States. Because there is such a wide variety of oak trees in the world, it can be hard to find characteristics that unite them all. However, they do exist: Acorns are the easiest way to spot an oak tree. If the tree produces acorns, it's an oak. Lobed leaves are leaves that have rounded or pointed knobs extending out from the center line. While a few oaks do not have lobes, all of the leaves are generally symmetrical around a clear median line. Small, scaly bark. Bark on oak trees is variable, but it is generally made up of small, hard, and scaly bits of bark. This is unlike the large, flaky chunks of pines or the wallpaper-like bark on birch trees, and is much more cracked and grooved. Lobes are the bits of leaf that extend out to each side from the center of the leaf, like points on a star. White oaks have rounded lobes while red oaks have pointed ones. This is an important distinction that will cut the number of potential trees you're trying to identify in half. On red oaks, the vein of the leave extends all the way out to the edge, creating this point. Each area has its own assortment of oak species, which is often drastically different from other areas. The species of oak you will encounter changes great depending on where you are in the world, as it is rare for an oak found on the east coast to be found in the west, a southern oak in the north, etc. You can generally figure out your region with a few criteria (examples here are for Continental US): General location -- Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Northwest, Southwest Inland or coastal. Mountainous or flat terrain. The lobes are the sections that extend out from the center of the leaf's stem on both sides. If possible, compare multiple leaves to find the average number of lobes. A few species such as the willow oak have no lobes at all, but most oaks have multiple lobes. Count at least 4-5 leaves when identifying, as this will help when you turn to the field guide. Look at the area between the lobes and determine whether the indentations are deep or shallow. White oak leaves often have variable indentations that alternate randomly between shallow and deep, where red oaks can have dramatic, sharp indentations or none at all. The leaves of evergreen oaks are shiny and dark green all year, but most oaks will turn colors in autumn. Some oaks, such as scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), sport brilliant colors in the fall. White oaks and chestnut oaks are often a dull brown when color comes around. If it's summer, look at whether the leaves are dark green or light green, and whether they're shiny or not, to help determine the species. Evergreen oaks and a couple red oaks such as scrub oak have smaller leaves while most red oaks and nearly all deciduous white oaks have much larger leaves (at least 4 in.). This is one of the more important distinguishing features between similar species of oak. Using the data you've collected, identify your oak tree using a tree manual or field guide. There are dozens and dozens of oak trees out there, and you can't he expected to know them all by heart. Use the above criteria to narrow down your choices, then use the guide to find what oak you're looking at. You can look through the collection of common oak trees below, or consult a Field Guide, found through the US Forestry Service. Turn to the appropriate section. Most guides are divided into a red oak section and a white oak section Narrow your selection down to the oaks specific to your area. A good guide should have distribution maps for each species. Once you have a list of possibilities, look at the pictures for each one to determine your tree.","completion":"Oak trees are special trees that grow in many different places around the world.

This film is an adaptation of the 1935 novel of the same name by C. S. Forester and features a screenplay co-written by John Huston and James Agee. The African Queen is an adventure, war, and romance drama set in Africa during World War I. The film stars Humphrey Bogart as Charlie Allnut, a Canadian boat captain, and Katharine Hepburn as Rose Sayer, the sister of a British missionary. The story follows the unlikely partnership between these two characters, who are forced to work together after German troops destroy the mission where Rose and her brother lived. When Rose Sayer's brother dies from the shock and trauma of the attack, Charlie takes her aboard his small, dilapidated boat named \\"The African Queen.\\" Despite their differences - Rose being a prim and highly moral British woman, and Charlie being a rough-and-tumble boat captain - they set out on a perilous journey down the Ulanga River, planning to torpedo a German gunboat in order to avenge Rose's brother and the civilians attacked by the Germans. Throughout their journey, they face various obstacles such as dangerous rapids, swamps, malaria, leeches, and the constant threat of being captured by the Germans. As they overcome these challenges, they develop a mutual respect and love for each other. Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Charlie Allnut was widely acclaimed and earned him his only Oscar, solidifying his status as one of Hollywood's greatest actors. Bogart's ability to capture the character's gradual transformation from a disheveled and unkempt boat captain to a determined and courageous hero resonated with audiences and remains a memorable performance in the history of cinema. In addition to Bogart's award-winning performance, \\"The African Queen\\" is notable for its groundbreaking on-location filming in Africa, specifically in the Belgian Congo and Uganda. This decision by director John Huston added an authenticity to the film's setting and challenged the conventional Hollywood practice of filming exclusively on studio sets and back lots. The African Queen has stood the test of time as a classic in the world of cinema, and Humphrey Bogart's incredible performance in the film remains a significant achievement in his illustrious career."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media.

Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- After the Republicans and Democrats met at the White House summit on health care, it was clear that the parties are very far away from a bipartisan agreement. Indeed, few participants walked away with the sense that they were any closer to a deal. The White House did make clear that it was willing to move forward on health care without Republican support. The choice now becomes whether Democrats should use the budget reconciliation process to pass some parts of health care legislation. According to recent reports, Democrats are considering having the House pass the bill that was already approved in the Senate and then dealing with a package of additional reforms through reconciliation.","completion":"It seems the most logical way to complete this passage is to summarize the situation as it stands, make a hypothesis on possible outcomes, and indicate what next steps could be from both parties involved. So, here's how it could be completed: If the Democrats proceed with this approach, it will likely result in a high degree of controversy with the potential for political fallout. This could be exacerbated if the Republicans decide to retaliate by employing procedural tactics to delay the Democrats' initiatives. However, the potential benefits for the health care system and millions of Americans, whom the Democrats argue would benefit from this reform, may outweigh such risks from their perspective. The idea is that the Democrats seem to face a dilemma between striving for bipartisan cooperation and acting unilaterally to achieve their stated policy objectives despite potential backlash. The upcoming days will undoubtedly hold intense debate and complex negotiations, after which the final decision will be shaped. Ultimately, the direction of health care reform in the United States will depend entirely on the strategic choices made by both Democrats and Republicans in this contentious policy-making environment. In the meantime, all eyes will be firmly focused on Washington as this significant legislative moment plays out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Translate this to English?","completion":"The Stability Pact concerns the crisis in the Western Balkan countries, in the former Yugoslavia. The Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe is an international initiative aimed at addressing the crises that emerged in the Western Balkan states, particularly in the aftermath of the collapse of the former Yugoslavia. The conflicts and tensions that plagued the region during the 1990s had led to civil war, ethnic tensions, and humanitarian crises. Consequently, the international community, including the European Union (EU), the United States, and other international actors, came together to create the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe in order to promote peace, stability, and regional cooperation. The main goal of the Stability Pact was to establish a stable, secure, and prosperous region through political and economic collaboration among countries in the region, along with the support of the international community. The pact aimed to achieve this objective by fostering good neighborly relations, respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all participating states, and adhering to a set of shared principles and values, such as the rule of law, human rights, and democracy. Several crucial components contributed to the implementation of the Stability Pact. Among them were the promotion of security and stability in the region, the facilitation of economic cooperation and development, and the encouragement of deeper integration with European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Additionally, the international community provided substantial financial and technical assistance to help participating countries overcome existing challenges and build resilient societies, capable of sustaining peace and prosperity. Over the years, the Stability Pact has witnessed some significant achievements. For instance, numerous bilateral agreements among participating countries have contributed to improved relations, and collaboration on various regional initiatives has solidified partnerships. Furthermore, several countries in the region have managed to join the European Union or are actively pursuing that goal as part of their engagement with the Stability Pact. In conclusion, the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe is a critical instrument created to address the challenges that the Western Balkan countries, particularly those that were part of the former Yugoslavia, have been facing in the post-conflict era. By promoting regional stability, security, and economic cooperation, the Stability Pact has made significant strides in helping to build a brighter future for the people in this region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As only Jobs could do, he captivated the audience as he tapped and swiped between screens, watched a YouTube video, and browsed the iTunes store. It was clear from what Jobs had shown critics that day that the iPad created a new class of consumer-friendly tablets, but even though users spent hundreds of dollars on the device many were unhappy with its multitasking features. With the release of iOS 9, Apple AAPL is turning the page on the iPad’s story by adding powerful new features and a redesigned on-screen keyboard to the device. After testing out Apple’s new operating system it’s clear there’s still more work that needs to be done, but definitely worth the upgrade. One of the most obvious changes is a new feature called Slide Over, which allows you to temporarily slide between two apps at one time. In order to access the Slide Over tool users simply have to open slide their finger over to the right edge of the iPad’s screen where a narrow column will appear. Tap on the desired app and it will appear atop the app you’re currently in. I often used slide over to quickly view my schedule, found in the calendar app, and send meeting requests while using Mail. Taking the concept of slide over one-step further is another new feature called Split View. For the first time iPad users will have the ability to run two apps on screen at the same time. Unlike slide over, users can interact with both apps simultaneously, and also adjust the amount of screen real estate each one takes up. The Split view feature was displayed onstage at Apple’s Sept. 9 event to demonstrate how users can work with both Word and Excel document concurrently, sharing content between the two applications. I used it on numerous occasions to conduct research in Safari while writing a story in the Notes app. I wasn’t forced to bounce between apps; I could gather the necessary facts and incorporate them with ease. Unfortunately, sharing content between the two apps isn’t easy and has to be done through copy and paste. Adding a drag-and-drop method, where users could add photos to a Word document from another app, or attaching a PowerPoint presentation to an email seems like a natural fit, alleviating unnecessary steps in the process. Additionally, as more apps are updated and released for iOS 9, in turn, polluting the column of apps you can choose from, the feature will become harder to use. Right now, iOS 9 lacks a method for removing apps or reorganizing the order in which apps are displayed, which is a frustrating omission. A new powerful picture-in-picture feature makes it possible to continue watching videos or conducting FaceTime video calls. Users can, for example, watch a movie while browsing Facebook or Twitter. The video player is adjustable in size and can be placed in any corner of the screen. Slide over and picture-in-picture will work on the iPad Pro, both iPad Air models, as well as the iPad Mini 2 and newer devices. Split-view is limited to the iPad Air 2, iPad Mini 4, and the iPad Pro. Apple also updated the iPad’s virtual keyboard, adding trackpad-like functionality to the device. As you enter text, you can place two fingers on the keyboard in order to activate the new feature. When active, you drag your fingers across the keyboard to move the cursor. A quick double-tap of two fingers on the screen will highlight the nearest word, and continue highlighting until you lift your fingers off the screen. Editing big blocks of text used to be a laborious process, requiring multiple taps, but the new trackpad functionality simplifies this process. At present, my only complaint is that it’s not available across the company’s entire iPhone lineup; only the iPhone 6s will have it thanks to 3D Touch. There’s still a lot of work to be done, but overall, the iPad’s new operating system is a step in the right direction. It makes sense for iOS 9 to introduce the new features now, rather than wait for the iPad Pro to become available. Users can put the iPad’s multitasking prowess to the test over the next two months. Armed with knowledge gained from the experience, consumers can then decide if an iPad Pro is worth purchasing. The iPad is finally growing up—both in size, and feature set. As someone who had already incorporated the iPad, before iOS 9 existed, into my daily work routine, I’m excited to see what the future holds.

To do this, we will move the constant term to the other side by subtracting 112 from both sides. 28x = -112 Step 3: Finally, to get the value of x, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is 28 in this case.

The population of Canada is about 29 million and the capital is Ottawa. The country covers about 9,980,000 square kilometers and six of the world's 24 time areas as well. There are two official languages spoken in Canada: French and English. Many people can speak both English and French. More than 60% of Canadians speak English as their language. About 25% of the Canadians speak French. In one province of Canada where French is the common language, the programmes on TV and radios as well as the teaching in schools are all in French. Today, Chinese has become the first inofficial language in Canada. Canada's climate is not as cold all year around as some may believe. In winter, temperatures fall below freezing point throughout most of Canada. In summer, the southern provinces often experience high levels of temperatures that can reach over 30degC regularly. The weather in Canada is just like the weather in China. It is rather cold in the north while it is fairly warm in the south. Winters in the north last long with snow for half a year. As the cold northern climate, only one-fifth of the land is suitable for farming. As it is known to all, Canada has one-third of the world's supply of fresh water. It has many great lakes. There are five great lakes in the south. And there are many others, especially in the north. It is also rich in natural resources, such as coal, oil, natural gas of which Canadians make use to produce energy. People of northern Canada are called Inuit , who came from Asia and settled in Canada about 4,000 years ago. They used to travel around from place to place with teams of dogs which pulled their baggage. Now, they seldom move. There are about 2,500 Inuit in all.

Answer the following question: This article: The Belarusian government sponsors annual cultural festivals such as the Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk, which showcases Belarusian performers, artists, writers, musicians, and actors. Several state holidays, such as Independence Day and Victory Day, draw big crowds and often include displays such as fireworks and military parades, especially in Vitebsk and Minsk. The government's Ministry of Culture finances events promoting Belarusian arts and culture both inside and outside the country. Belarusian literature began with 11th- to 13th-century religious scripture, such as the 12th-century poetry of Cyril of Turaw.By the 16th century, Polotsk resident Francysk Skaryna translated the Bible into Belarusian. It was published in Prague and Vilnius sometime between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe. The modern era of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century; one prominent writer was Yanka Kupala. Many Belarusian writers of the time, such as Uładzimir Žyłka, Kazimir Svayak, Yakub Kolas, Źmitrok Biadula, and Maksim Haretski, wrote for Nasha Niva, a Belarusian-language paper published that was previously published in Vilnius but now is published in Minsk. After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs. At first, a policy of \\"Belarusianization\\" was followed in the newly formed Byelorussian SSR. This policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the majority of prominent Belarusian intellectuals and nationalist advocates were either exiled or killed in Stalinist purges. The free development of literature occurred only in Polish-held territory until Soviet occupation in 1939. Several poets and authors went into exile after the Nazi occupation of Belarus and would not return until the 1960s.The last major revival of Belarusian literature occurred in the 1960s with novels published by Vasil Bykaŭ and Uladzimir Karatkievich.

Process: - Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves - Other animals use echolocation in generally similar ways - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the location is quiet happens, how will it affect the bat has a lower perception of the sound waves. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation does have an effect on the process of echolocation used by bats and other animals. In quiet or low-noise environments, the efficiency of echolocation can be affected in both positive and negative ways. Let's examine these effects in detail. Positive Effects: 1. Improved signal-to-noise ratio: In a quiet environment, bats can produce high-pitched sounds that encounter relatively little interference from background noise. The reduced noise allows the bat to perceive the reflected sound waves with greater precision, making it easier for the animal to determine the distance, size, and shape of the objects in its vicinity. 2. Enhanced detection range: When the environment is quiet, the sound waves produced by the bat can travel farther without losing strength. As a result, bats can detect objects at a greater distance, giving them a larger operational range. 3. Greater accuracy: In the absence of background noise, bats can more accurately pinpoint the location of objects in their environment. This increased accuracy is crucial for tasks such as hunting prey, navigating, and avoiding obstacles. Negative Effects: 1. Reduced sensitivity: In quiet environments, bats may lower the intensity of their call to avoid drawing attention to themselves. Consequently, the reflected sound waves will also have a lower intensity, making it harder for the bat to accurately perceive the environment. This might lead to a reduction in their overall ability to locate and track objects. 2. Increased vulnerability: Bats and other animals that rely on echolocation may be more vulnerable to predation in quiet environments. As echolocation calls are more distinct against a quiet background, potential predators may be better equipped to locate and target bats. To summarize, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that quiet environments can have both positive and negative impacts on the echolocation capabilities of bats and other animals. A quiet environment can enhance the sensitivity and range of echolocation, as well as improve the accuracy of detecting objects. However, it may also lead to reduced sensitivity and an increased vulnerability to predation. Ultimately, the ability of bats to adapt and adjust their echolocation calls in response to changing environmental conditions plays a significant role in the effectiveness of their echolocation process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean. Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative asiento (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain. A:","completion":"Based on the context provided, the main rival of France on the imperial stage became Britain. While England and the Netherlands entered the Nine Years' War as allies, the conflict eventually left the English as a stronger colonial power than the Dutch. From the early 18th century, Britain emerged as the world's dominant colonial force, with France becoming its most significant competitor in imperial affairs. The rivalry between Britain and France intensified following the death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and the subsequent War of the Spanish Succession. Charles II's bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, the French king's grandson, threatened the prospect of France, Spain, and their colonies uniting, a situation deemed unacceptable by England and other European powers. In response, England, Portugal, and the Netherlands allied with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France. The War of the Spanish Succession lasted from 1701 to 1714 and concluded with the Treaty of Utrecht, which greatly impacted the balance of power among European nations and colonies. Philippe of Anjou renounced his claim to the French throne, and Spain lost its empire in Europe. Britain emerged from the war with an expanded empire, gaining territories such as Newfoundland and Acadia from France, and Gibraltar and Menorca from Spain. The acquisition of Gibraltar provided Britain with a pivotal naval base that allowed it to control key points in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, bolstering its position as a global power in the centuries to come. Furthermore, Spain ceded the lucrative asiento, or the permission to sell slaves in Spanish America, to Britain, granting it a significant economic advantage in the region. With these territorial and economic gains, Britain continued to assert and expand its influence worldwide, often at the expense of its chief rival, France. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the two powers were frequently in conflict, either directly or through proxies, as they sought to maintain and extend their colonial possessions. As a result, Britain's emergence as a dominant colonial power and its steady rise through imperial competition effectively established it as France's main rival on the stage of empire-building and global influence."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Nanjing remained the capital of the Ming Empire until 1421, when the third emperor of the Ming dynasty, the Yongle Emperor, relocated the capital to Beijing. When did Nanjing cease to be the capital?","completion":"Nanjing ceased to be the capital of the Ming Empire in 1421 when the third emperor of the Ming dynasty, the Yongle Emperor, decided to relocate the capital to Beijing. This decision marked a significant change in the political and historical landscape of China. Nanjing, also known as the Southern Capital, held significant importance for the Ming Empire. As the largest city in the world between 1358 and 1425, it boasted a population of 487,000 in the year 1400. The city's prominence during this time period not only reflected its status as an influential political center but also its importance as a cultural, economic, and technological hub. The Yongle Emperor's decision to shift the capital to Beijing can be attributed to several reasons. First and foremost, Beijing's strategic location in the north allowed for better defense against potential threats, such as the Mongols. This geographical advantage was particularly important, given the Ming dynasty's historical conflicts with the Mongols. In addition, the shift to Beijing was also aimed at consolidating the emperor's power and authority. The Yongle Emperor was a powerful and ambitious ruler who sought to strengthen the central government and expand his empire. Establishing a new capital in Beijing enabled him to assert greater control over the vast territory of China and project his influence over neighboring regions. Despite Nanjing's ceasing to be the capital in 1421, the city continued to play a significant role in Chinese history. Notably, it served as the capital of the Republic of China under the Kuomintang government from 1928 to 1949. Today, Nanjing remains an important political, cultural, and economic center in China, with its rich history and contributions to Chinese civilization leaving an indelible mark on the country's development and progress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(A). a pool of molten lava; (B). an ocean with fish; (C). a river flowing north; (D). a crack in the core;...A:","completion":"(A). a pool of molten lava; (D). a crack in the core. To answer the question of which factors need to be present for a tectonic plate movement, first, we need to understand the process. Tectonic plates move due to the convection currents generated by the heat released from the Earth's mantle. Plates are made of solid rock but sit above a layer of partially melted rock, or magma, from the mantle (the layer between the Earth's crust and core). As this partially molten material moves, it drags the plates along with it, causing them to move. (A) A pool of molten lava: A pool of molten rock, or magma, is formed when mantle material melts due to the heat and pressure. This molten material rises towards the surface and can be found beneath tectonic plates, where it contributes to plate movement. Therefore, the presence of molten lava is essential in the process of tectonic plate movement. (D) A crack in the core: Although it is not directly related to the process of tectonic plate movement, cracks in the core (fault lines) can indirectly affect tectonic plate movement. A fault line is a planar fracture in the Earth's surface along which there has been significant displacement as a result of rock-mass movement. Since tectonic plates move along fault lines, the presence of a crack in the core can be considered an essential factor for plate movement. The other options are not essential for tectonic plate movement: (B) An ocean with fish: The presence of an ocean with fish has no direct or indirect influence on tectonic plate movement. Plate movement occurs due to the convection currents generated by the Earth's mantle, and not because of the presence of water or aquatic life. (C) A river flowing north: The direction of a river's flow has no effect on tectonic plate movement. River formation and direction are typically a result of geology, climate, and other factors, but they do not influence the processes that drive plate movement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In his speech held on the occasion of the event, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias affirmed that authorities remain committed to finding a path towards the reunification of the divided island. Cyprus has been divided since 1974, with the northern part being occupied by Turkish forces and declared as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, while the southern part is the Republic of Cyprus, an EU member state. The division has caused considerable political, economic, and social challenges for both sides of the island, and efforts to resolve the situation have been ongoing for decades. Numerous rounds of negotiations and peace talks have been held under the auspices of the United Nations, but a long-lasting and mutually acceptable resolution has not yet been reached. Several key issues need to be addressed in order to achieve the reunification of Cyprus. These include the return of displaced persons, the issue of property rights of individuals affected by the division, security arrangements and the presence of foreign troops, governance structures in a reunited federal state, and the management of natural resources. In his speech, President Christofias emphasized the importance of reunification efforts, calling for a spirit of cooperation, compromise, and mutual respect among all parties involved. He also highlighted the need for sustained and creative diplomacy, taking into account the concerns and aspirations of both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, as well as regional and international stakeholders. Some of the potential benefits of reunification would be the enhancement of regional security and stability, improved economic development and prosperity for all Cypriots, as well as strengthened cooperation and integration with European and international partners. The complex task of reunification will also require support for trust-building measures, the promotion of inter-communal ties and dialogues, and the implementation of confidence-building initiatives. In conclusion, President Christofias's speech aimed to underscore the commitment of the Cypriot authorities to work towards the reunification of the divided island. Such efforts will require patience, determination, and continued engagement from all parties in order to reach a comprehensive, sustainable, and fair solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Air India’s woes with rodent stowaways appear to be continuing after a rat was reportedly spotted on board a plane in the country’s capital. The plane was taken out of service and fumigated after it landed at New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport from the city of Ranchi yesterday, the Times of India reported. It is at least the fourth reported sighting on an Air India aircraft this year. Scroll down for video. Rats on a plane: There have been at least four rodent sightings on Air India flights this year. Earlier this month, cabin crew spotted rats scurrying free in the rear half of a plane as it landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport from Calcutta. The Airbus A321 was carrying about 200 passengers and staff, and it was removed from service and taken to a remote airport bay to be fumigated. In May, the pilot on a flight from New Delhi to London reported a rat in the cockpit, the newspaper reported. But there are conflicting reports about whether a rat was actually on board. Rats were blamed after a domestic flight from Mumbai suffered a two-hour delay in February. Planes must be fumigated even when there is an unconfirmed sighting because the rodents pose a serious threat to the safety of passengers and crew. An Air India aircraft that flew from Ranchi to New Delhi had to be fumigated after a rat was reported on board. Rats can chew on electrical wires and disrupt computer systems aboard an aircraft. The rodents normally sneak onto aircraft via catering vehicles loaded with food. Last year, health inspectors in China found nearly a dozen rats underneath a business class seat after a commercial flight landed at Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport from Hong Kong. Inspectors wearing protective suits and masks boarded the plane and searched through overhead storage bins and behind seats. In 2009, an Air India flight from Amritsar to Toronto was delayed for nearly half a day as staff tried to catch a rat that was spotted on board. The flight was delayed while a replacement aircraft was flown in. Highlights:","completion":"Air India keeps facing problems with rats sneaking onto their planes.

Born on October 27, 1969, in Athens, Georgia, Kasay had an impressive career in NFL that spanned almost two decades. Throughout his career, Kasay played for several teams, including the Carolina Panthers, the New Orleans Saints, and the Seattle Seahawks. When reflecting on Kasay's achievements, one aspect of interest is the difference in yardage between his longest and second longest field goals. In this article, we will delve into Kasay's career and explore the yardage difference between these two remarkable field goals. Step 1: Research John Kasay's Career and Field Goal Statistics To answer the question of how many yards longer John Kasay's longest field goal was compared to his second longest, we would first need to gather accurate information on his field goal records. We can start by researching credible sources such as the NFL's official website, sports-related databases, and notable sports news sources. Step 2: Identify John Kasay's Longest and Second Longest Field Goals After gathering reliable information on John Kasay's field goal records, we can identify both his longest and second longest field goals. To ensure accuracy, it's necessary to cross-reference the information with multiple sources. Step 3: Calculate the Yardage Difference Once we have the yardages for John Kasay's longest and second longest field goals, we can determine the difference by simply subtracting the yardage of his second longest field goal from that of his longest field goal. This will provide us with the yardage difference between the two field goals. Analysis: Upon researching John Kasay's career statistics, we found that his longest field goal was a remarkable 63 yards. This record-setting kick was made during a game between the Carolina Panthers and the St. Louis Rams on October 10, 1999. Kasay's second longest field goal was kicked at a distance of 56 yards. He achieved this feat twice, once in December 2001 and again in November 2002, both times while playing for the Carolina Panthers. Conclusion: In comparing John Kasay's longest and second longest field goals, we find that the difference in yardage is 7 yards. His longest field goal of 63 yards was achieved during a game in 1999, while his second longest field goal of 56 yards was attained twice, in 2001 and 2002. As we celebrate John Kasay's successful career, it's essential to acknowledge his accomplishments, including his incredible long-range field goals, which have undoubtedly left a lasting impact on NFL history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from: --ocean tides; --time of day; --energy from the Sun; --phases of the Moon;...A:","completion":"The correct answer to this question is ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the Moon causes a significant effect on Earth, mainly reflected in ocean tides. The gravitational force exerted by the Moon pulls the Earth's water on its surface, causing the oceans and other large bodies of water to bulge in the direction of the Moon. This bulge occurs on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, as well as on the opposite side. The bulge on the opposite side occurs due to an inertial force called the centrifugal force which counteracts the gravitational pull of the Moon, causing water to be slightly pushed away from the Moon on the far side of Earth. This effect causes sea levels to rise in the areas where the bulge occurs, leading to high tides. In contrast, low tides occur in the regions between the high tide areas where the water has been pulled away. The Earth's rotation makes a full turn every day, causing coastal areas to experience two high tides and two low tides every 24 hours and 50 minutes, approximately. It is essential to understand why the other options are not the correct answer: 1. Time of day: The time of day is determined by the Earth's rotation on its axis relative to the Sun. Although the Moon's gravitational pull has some influence on the Earth's rotation, causing slight variations in the length of a day, it is not the primary factor that defines the time of day. 2. Energy from the Sun: The energy Earth receives from the Sun comes in the form of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, infrared, and ultraviolet. This energy drives the Earth's climate and weather, fuels photosynthesis, and provides the foundation for the life-sustaining processes on the planet. The Moon's gravitational force does not directly affect the energy Earth receives from the Sun. 3. Phases of the Moon: The phases of the Moon are a result of the relative positions of the Sun, Earth, and Moon. As the Moon orbits Earth, it moves through different angles relative to the Sun, causing varying amounts of its illuminated surface to be visible from Earth. Although the Moon's gravitational force has an impact on Earth, particularly the ocean tides, it does not cause the phases of the Moon. In conclusion, the gravitational attraction of the Moon has a significant effect on Earth's ocean tides, as it causes the water to bulge, leading to high and low tide cycles.

Build a movie plot around this: What is the deal Jane made? Jane made the deal to split the money. Answer:","completion":"Title: Broken Trust Genre: Crime, Drama, Mystery Plot Summary: In a small town, an infamous heist takes place, and a tight-knit group of friends finds themselves entangled in its web. Jane, a widowed elementary school teacher, is struggling to make ends meet. Her life takes a dark turn when she is lured into making a dangerous deal with her close friend, Nick, a seemingly kind-hearted mechanic with a dark side. The story revolves around the aftermath of the heist and the web of lies, deceit, and broken trust that follows. Act 1: Introductions We are introduced to Jane, who teaches at a local school in a small, working-class town. She is in deep financial trouble after her husband’s death and struggles to raise her two kids on her own. Nick, Jane's close friend and neighbor since childhood, is shown as a compassionate man, always willing to lend a helping hand. Suddenly, a shocking heist takes place at the local bank, shattering the calm atmosphere of the small town. The mysterious robbers make off with a large sum of money, leaving the townsfolk in disarray. Act 2: A Dangerous Deal With no clues as to the robbers' identities, tension rise in the town. Jane is on the verge of losing her home due to mounting debts, when Nick approaches her with a secret proposal. He reveals that he was involved in the heist and offers to split the money with Jane if she agrees to help him launder the cash. Desperate to ease her family's financial burden, Jane makes the deal to split the money, but they must be careful to avoid suspicion. Act 3: Complications As they work together to launder the stolen money, their friendship begins to strain under the constant threat of getting caught. Jane struggles with her guilt, while Nick's increasingly paranoid and controlling behavior creates tension. The walls close in as two additional members of the heist crew reveal their involvement. They start bullying Jane, and Nick seems powerless to stop them, leading Jane to realize the deal was much more complicated than she initially thought. Act 4: The Betrayal As suspicions among the townsfolk begin to surface, one of the heist members, fearing capture, threatens to expose Jane's involvement. In a shocking twist, Jane discovers Nick has deliberately implicated her in the heist to protect himself and the other team members. Realizing her friendship with Nick was built on lies, Jane feels utterly betrayed. Act 5: Redemption and Resolution Determined to fight back and clear her name, Jane devises a plan to bring the real culprits to justice. She starts gathering evidence against her former friends. Risking everything, Jane confronts Nick and the other perpetrators, forcing a confession out of them. In the climax, the robbers are arrested, and Jane is exonerated. However, the revelation of Nick's involvement in the heist destroys the remaining threads of their friendship. Jane decides to return her share of the money to the authorities, as the cost of her integrity and her family's future is far greater than her need for ill-gotten gains. In the end, Jane finds strength in the friendships she formed along the way with other honest members of the community. With the support of these new friends, she overcomes her financial difficulties and begins to rebuild her life."},{"prompt":"Princess Astrid, Mrs. Ferner is the older sister of a king who ascended to the throne on which day ?

To elaborate more on this statement, a highly heterogeneous agriculture refers to the diverse agricultural practices, land utilization, and crop systems across Europe due to the differences in geography, climate, and cultural factors. This diversity in European agriculture presents a challenge for creating a single policy that can address all the aspects equally and effectively. The statement emphasizes the need for a holistic approach in designing agricultural policies that consider various factors, including economic, environmental, and social aspects, without undermining the distinct regional characteristics of European agriculture. Additionally, the regional differences in Europe, such as variations in traditional farming methods and knowledge, may require a combination of both localized and centralized strategies to ensure the sustainment and development of the agricultural sector. Moreover, this translates to the need for coordination and cooperation between the European Union and national governments, as well as among different stakeholders, such as farmers, businesses, and non-governmental organizations, to develop multi-dimensional policies that cater to the diverse needs of European agriculture. By acknowledging that no single policy is sufficient to tackle the entirety of Europe's agricultural heterogeneity, it highlights the importance of continued dialogue, research, and innovation in finding the best way forward for the sustainability and resilience of agriculture throughout the continent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It does not represent a place or a professional to help with cavity filling. - Doctor: Refers to a general medical practitioner who treats various health conditions. While they can provide advice on overall wellness, they are typically not equipped to deal with specific dental issues such as filling a cavity. - Teeth: This term represents the individual dental structures within the mouth that humans use for eating, speaking, and maintaining facial shape. It is not a place you go to for solving dental problems. - Unbrushed tooth: Refers to a tooth that has not been cleaned by brushing, which may lead to plaque buildup, decay, and cavities.

Electric current is actually the flow of electrons. You may recall, an electron is the outer-most particle in an atom. They have a negative charge. Electricity is the continuous flow of these particles. Electrons are able to move through wires. Their speed can even be measured. The SI unit for electric current (or speed) is the ampere (A). Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. Direct current (DC) flows in only one direction. Direct current is what is used in devices like flashlights. Alternating current (AC) flows in two directions. This is the type of current that flows into your home through wires.

Batman TAS may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet. It's just too damn good. Was Batman Beyond good? \\"Yeah, but it was no TAS.\\" Is Justice League good? \\"It's not too bad, but it's no TAS.\\" The Batman is certainly no TAS, either, but I won't hold that against it. It would be unfair and besides, it has plenty of other problems with it. The concept of a younger, less experienced Batman fighting crime is a fine one, and at times the art is very nice. But all of the rest of the time, the art is worthless Americanime, and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself. It is paced, written, and designed like an Americanime. If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures, I'd watch Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect. The Joker is a homicidal, mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits, unpredictability, and clever gadgets to fight Batman. When he is forced to fight hand to hand, he will either resort to something cheap or be totally outmatched. He is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kung-fu and can leap into twenty feet into the air, accompanied by speed lines. If they had wanted to do that with a villain, there were other less important characters they could have used or *gasp* they could have created a new one entirely. And it's not that re-imaginings are a bad thing, don't get me wrong. TAS (there I go again) took Mr. Freeze from your standard icegun-wielding B villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character. Of course Freeze wasn't exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade, but the point stands. What The Batman does is it takes everything you liked about Batman comics and lore and takes a large, smelly dump on them. Guess what? They were eating corn. It's obvious this show can't stand against TAS but stand it on its own legs and it still doesn't work for me. The plots aren't good and they don't develop any better. They've been written for the demographic of children under twelve. Should children be able to enjoy a show? Of course they should. This shouldn't be an adult show with swearing, nudity, and gratuitous violence. But the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages.

Information: - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985. - The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family. The initial ST model, the 520ST, saw limited release in the spring of 1985 and was widely available in July. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US1. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International.

What is the final step of the following process: - You breathe oxygen into your body through the nose or mouth - The oxygen travels to the lungs through the windpipe - The air sacs in the lungs send the oxygen into the blood stream - The carbon dioxide in the blood stream is transferred to the air sacs Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process after the carbon dioxide is transferred to the air sacs occurs as follows: The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air sacs (alveoli) and bloodstream is known as 'gas exchange.' After the alveoli have successfully received the carbon dioxide from the bloodstream, the body needs to expel it as a waste product. This is achieved through a process called exhalation or breathing out. During exhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles (the muscles between the ribs) relax, and the lungs return to their original, smaller size. As the lung volume decreases, the pressure inside them increases, causing the air, which is now rich in carbon dioxide, to flow out of the lungs. This expulsion of carbon dioxide occurs when the deoxygenated air leaves the alveoli, passes through the bronchioles, and then moves into the bronchi, which eventually connect to the trachea (windpipe). The carbon dioxide-enriched air travels up the trachea and finally leaves the body through either the nose or mouth. In summary, the final step in the process involves the exhalation of carbon dioxide-rich air. This vital method of respiration not only helps to remove waste products from the body but also regulates the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, ensuring an optimal environment for the body's cells and organs to function correctly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

NPR's Nina Totenberg broke the story to the world in 1991, and she joins the NPR Politics podcast team to reflect on what happened, how it happened and why it still matters. \\"I'd been hearing all summer long that there were women who said they were harassed by Clarence Thomas when he was at the EEOC and when he was at the Education Department,\\" Totenberg said. \\"But I could never really prove it. And then I heard about this woman, Anita Hill.\\" That's when everything changed. Listen to the podcast at the audio link above, download it via iTunes or read highlights from the conversation below: On what made Totenberg look for the story Listen to Nina Totenberg's 1991 story 11:04 I'm sitting at the Judiciary Committee hearing where they are voting on Thomas and I see that they all have the same envelope. And [then-Chairman Joe] Biden starts talking about how the confirmation process should not be about rank gossip. And I go, what? What are you talking about? I go out and I start kicking tires. And eventually, I find out what it's about. I call up Anita Hill. She says she won't talk to me unless I have a copy of her affidavit. So I got it. And then I got her. I actually held the story for a day and a half, trying to get Biden to talk to me about what was going on. On the scope of the story Even I didn't really understand how big a deal this was going to be. I remember walking into the Capitol thinking that once again, this would be a joint PBS-NPR live coverage of the hearing and we would be the only people there, and it was an insane asylum in there. Every network on the face of the earth was carrying this live. They carried it live even when the World Series was on! They pre-empted the World Series. It was unbelievable. On the climate of sexual harassment at the time You don't recognize this now, but sexual harassment was a dirty little secret that most women had but they didn't talk about. They were embarrassed by it; it was a hindrance and not a help in any way. Now suddenly, it gets popped into the open. ... But all of those silent, female experiences materialized in the ... phones exploding on Capitol Hill. On why there was so much public support for Thomas He was so furious and so indignant and so hurt by these accusations that it was hard to believe you could be so convincing and not be telling the truth. They were both very convincing witnesses. On the cost of breaking the story I was pilloried during this. I had one of the great stories of any reporter's life. I had worked very hard to get it. And the cost was enormous in terms of negative publicity and people trashing me a lot and senators yelling at me. At one point I had a driver at Nightline who went around the corner [and] stopped and he said to me ... \\"Lady, you better get a gun.\\" On how the story led to an increase in sexual harassment claims The number of cases almost doubled in just two years that were filed at the EEOC. Workplaces began to actually have rules about this. There were rules; there were grievance procedures that people could go to to discuss it. And the other thing is the Judiciary Committee was all male and had always been all male. They made very sure that there were women on the committee right away. On being asked to do a cameo in the movie [HBO] wanted me to re-enact my memory of the questions I asked her, so they could have me asking her questions on the phone the first time we talked and things like that. And I said, \\"We don't do that at NPR. That's called pretend news.\\" On why she'll never reveal her source I didn't even tell my lawyer when they subpoenaed me. I've never told my husband. I'm taking this one to my grave. ||||| \\"Confirmation\\" by Michelle Thompson based on Associated Press photos (Michelle Thompson) In 1991, George H.W. Bush nominated Clarence Thomas for a seat on the Supreme Court, just five days after civil rights icon Thurgood Marshall announced that he was retiring after 24 years. Thomas, despite an impressive résumé, had served as a federal judge for only 19 months. None of the American Bar Association’s Standing Committee for the Federal Judiciary members rated him “well-qualified.” Near the end of his hearing, a former employee of Thomas’s named Anita Hill came forward with sensational allegations of sexual harassment. The testimony took three days, with the hearing broadcast live. The nation was shocked, transfixed and deeply divided. On April 16, HBO will debut “Confirmation,” a movie starring Kerry Washington as Hill and Wendell Pierce as Thomas. Conservatives have already called the screenplay biased, portraying Hill as courageous, Thomas as disingenuous and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. as inept. The subject is still a raw wound for Thomas: “Mere confirmation, even to the Supreme Court, seemed pitifully small compensation for what had been done to me,” he writes in his 2007 memoir “My Grandfather’s Son.” A look at the process, in the words of those who were there. The late Republican senator Arlen Specter (D-Pa.) in his 2000 autobiography “Passion for Truth”: Bush announced that Thomas was the “best qualified” nominee he could find for the high court and that “the fact he was black and a minority had nothing to do with this.” Immediately I said publicly that Thomas was not the best-qualified nominee available and that race was a factor — and properly so. I did not object to Thomas’s nomination because I thought he was entitled to a hearing and because on the record, with his degrees from Holy Cross and Yale Law School plus his tenure on the court of appeals, he appeared at least marginally qualified. The late Democratic senator Paul Simon (D-Ill.) in a 1992 C-SPAN interview about his book “Advice & Consent”: Gerald Ford followed the Constitution by consulting with senators. George Bush did not. Gerald Ford contacted people around the nation and said, “Who would be the best possible person to put on the court?” and then he submitted 20 names to the American Bar Association for their evaluation. George Bush submitted one.

David Ake/AFP/Getty Images) Given his short time on the federal bench, Thomas and his advisers settled on the “Pin Point” strategy: An emphasis on his roots in Pin Point, the poor town in Georgia where he grew up, and his personal story of hard work, family values and character. So Hill’s accusation was especially devastating for him. Thomas’s wife, Virginia, in 1994’s “Resurrection: The Confirmation of Clarence Thomas” by former senator John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), who served as Thomas’s mentor during the hearings: The nature of his anxiety . . . was the humiliation factor. That seemed to be his major concern. Here was this charge that was so against everything he had done in his public life and everything he believes in his private and personal thoughts, a charge being exposed and discussed by what looked like rational people, and it was killing him. Somebody was trying to destroy him and that was the major concern. He kept saying why are they trying to destroy me? He kept asking that question over and over again.

(DAVID AKE/AFP/Getty Images) Anita Hill being sworn in prior to testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on Oct. 11, 1991. (Greg Gibson/AP) Hill began her testimony on Friday, Oct. 11, 1991, and was aggressively questioned by the 14 men who made up the Senate Judiciary Committee. Thomas absolutely denied the allegations before her appearance and again the next day. Hill in her 1997 memoir, “Speaking Truth to Power”: My world has been forever changed by the events that culminated in the “Hill-Thomas” hearings. I am no longer an anonymous, private individual — my name having become synonymous with sexual harassment. To my supporters I represent the courage to come forward and disclose a painful truth — a courage that thousands of others have found since the hearing. To my detractors I represent the debasement of public forum, at best, a pawn, at worst, a perjurer. Living with these conflicting perceptions is difficult, sometimes overwhelming. Simon in the C-SPAN interview: After we were in the hearing for a while, it became apparent that we had something huge on our hands in terms of public attention. That played a role in the Thomas nomination, because on Friday, Anita Hill testified. Friday is a limited television audience. Saturday, Clarence Thomas testified — a much larger audience. People who saw only one of the two believed the one they saw, whichever one that was. I think that was a factor in public opinion being on his side — only one of the factors — and the public opinion being on his side I think was clearly a factor in some of the votes in the Senate. George H.W. Bush in a 1991 letter published in “All the Best,” a collection of his writing: What’s happening to Clarence Thomas is just plain horrible. All the groups that tried to beat him on abortion or affirmative action have now come out of the woodwork. They are trying to destroy a decent man. I do not think they will succeed but they are in a frenzy around here. . . . I know nothing of Ms. Hill but I know a lot about Clarence Thomas, with whom I visited again yesterday and continue to have total confidence in his honor and decency. This is an ugly process and one can see clearly why so many good people elect to stay out of public life. Republicans turned the questioning to Hill and her credibility; Democrats were criticized for allowing that to happen. Biden (D-Del.), the committee chairman, was singled out by liberals for showing deference to Thomas and not calling any witnesses who could support Hill’s testimony. Anita Hill's 1991 testimony at Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation hearing will breathe new life in the HBO movie \\"Confirmation.\\" Considered by many as the sexual harassment tipping point, Hill's allegations paved the way for many modern gender discussions. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post) Former senator Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) in a 2014 interview on the “Death, Sex & Money” podcast: I’d had a wife who’d had much more harassment than Anita Hill. And that’s when I lost my marbles. I thought, “What is this?

Kerry Washington and others say no way.” ||||| \\"Confirmation\\" by Michelle Thompson based on Associated Press photos (Michelle Thompson) In 1991, George H.W. Bush nominated Clarence Thomas for a seat on the Supreme Court, just five days after civil rights icon Thurgood Marshall announced that he was retiring after 24 years. Thomas, despite an impressive résumé, had served as a federal judge for only 19 months. None of the American Bar Association’s Standing Committee for the Federal Judiciary members rated him “well-qualified.” Near the end of his hearing, a former employee of Thomas’s named Anita Hill came forward with sensational allegations of sexual harassment. The testimony took three days, with the hearing broadcast live. The nation was shocked, transfixed and deeply divided. On April 16, HBO will debut “Confirmation,” a movie starring Kerry Washington as Hill and Wendell Pierce as Thomas. Conservatives have already called the screenplay biased, portraying Hill as courageous, Thomas as disingenuous and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. as inept. The subject is still a raw wound for Thomas: “Mere confirmation, even to the Supreme Court, seemed pitifully small compensation for what had been done to me,” he writes in his 2007 memoir “My Grandfather’s Son.” A look at the process, in the words of those who were there. The late Republican senator Arlen Specter (D-Pa.) in his 2000 autobiography “Passion for Truth”: Bush announced that Thomas was the “best qualified” nominee he could find for the high court and that “the fact he was black and a minority had nothing to do with this.” Immediately I said publicly that Thomas was not the best-qualified nominee available and that race was a factor — and properly so. I did not object to Thomas’s nomination because I thought he was entitled to a hearing and because on the record, with his degrees from Holy Cross and Yale Law School plus his tenure on the court of appeals, he appeared at least marginally qualified. The late Democratic senator Paul Simon (D-Ill.) in a 1992 C-SPAN interview about his book “Advice & Consent”: Gerald Ford followed the Constitution by consulting with senators. George Bush did not. Gerald Ford contacted people around the nation and said, “Who would be the best possible person to put on the court?” and then he submitted 20 names to the American Bar Association for their evaluation. George Bush submitted one.

David Ake/AFP/Getty Images) Given his short time on the federal bench, Thomas and his advisers settled on the “Pin Point” strategy: An emphasis on his roots in Pin Point, the poor town in Georgia where he grew up, and his personal story of hard work, family values and character. So Hill’s accusation was especially devastating for him. Thomas’s wife, Virginia, in 1994’s “Resurrection: The Confirmation of Clarence Thomas” by former senator John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), who served as Thomas’s mentor during the hearings: The nature of his anxiety . . . was the humiliation factor. That seemed to be his major concern. Here was this charge that was so against everything he had done in his public life and everything he believes in his private and personal thoughts, a charge being exposed and discussed by what looked like rational people, and it was killing him. Somebody was trying to destroy him and that was the major concern. He kept saying why are they trying to destroy me? He kept asking that question over and over again.

(DAVID AKE/AFP/Getty Images) Anita Hill being sworn in prior to testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on Oct. 11, 1991. (Greg Gibson/AP) Hill began her testimony on Friday, Oct. 11, 1991, and was aggressively questioned by the 14 men who made up the Senate Judiciary Committee. Thomas absolutely denied the allegations before her appearance and again the next day. Hill in her 1997 memoir, “Speaking Truth to Power”: My world has been forever changed by the events that culminated in the “Hill-Thomas” hearings. I am no longer an anonymous, private individual — my name having become synonymous with sexual harassment. To my supporters I represent the courage to come forward and disclose a painful truth — a courage that thousands of others have found since the hearing. To my detractors I represent the debasement of public forum, at best, a pawn, at worst, a perjurer. Living with these conflicting perceptions is difficult, sometimes overwhelming. Simon in the C-SPAN interview: After we were in the hearing for a while, it became apparent that we had something huge on our hands in terms of public attention. That played a role in the Thomas nomination, because on Friday, Anita Hill testified. Friday is a limited television audience. Saturday, Clarence Thomas testified — a much larger audience. People who saw only one of the two believed the one they saw, whichever one that was. I think that was a factor in public opinion being on his side — only one of the factors — and the public opinion being on his side I think was clearly a factor in some of the votes in the Senate. George H.W. Bush in a 1991 letter published in “All the Best,” a collection of his writing: What’s happening to Clarence Thomas is just plain horrible. All the groups that tried to beat him on abortion or affirmative action have now come out of the woodwork. They are trying to destroy a decent man. I do not think they will succeed but they are in a frenzy around here. . . . I know nothing of Ms. Hill but I know a lot about Clarence Thomas, with whom I visited again yesterday and continue to have total confidence in his honor and decency. This is an ugly process and one can see clearly why so many good people elect to stay out of public life. Republicans turned the questioning to Hill and her credibility; Democrats were criticized for allowing that to happen. Biden (D-Del.), the committee chairman, was singled out by liberals for showing deference to Thomas and not calling any witnesses who could support Hill’s testimony. Anita Hill's 1991 testimony at Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation hearing will breathe new life in the HBO movie \\"Confirmation.\\" Considered by many as the sexual harassment tipping point, Hill's allegations paved the way for many modern gender discussions. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post) Former senator Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) in a 2014 interview on the “Death, Sex & Money” podcast: I’d had a wife who’d had much more harassment than Anita Hill. And that’s when I lost my marbles. I thought, “What is this? I mean, for God’s sake, what did he do?” Well, nothing. “Did he touch you?” “No.” “What is it?” “He wanted to talk about Long Dong Silver and pubic hair and coke cans.” “Is that it? Is that it?” “Yes, it is. I wanted you to be aware of his behavior.” And so I was a monster. I was just pissed to the core.

I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. What does the man make his children do now that he is grown?

On the death of his father, his mother had remarried Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in Court and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as Baron Coleraine shortly thereafter.As he was closely associated with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - Warner Music Canada is the Canadian division of Warner Music Group.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Already his first claim, that desires are always artificial, is totally fallacious. When a Jehovah Witness reject gets his own documentary on movies  or anything for that matter - it's time for anyone to get their own. Although far, far more intelligent than, say, Paris Hilton (I know, not too difficult) Zizek's mouth spews just as much baloney as hers, just a different kind. He combines the worst from both his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b*lls***osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories, to rant without a beginning or end, and to connect concepts almost randomly, in the process misusing the English language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love. Example: there are three main Marx brothers hence what a \\"great\\" idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness, the id, the ego and the super-ego. I'm kind of surprised he didn't play a clip from \\"Snowhite\\" and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of Gahannah (Moslem hell). It's like the premise of Schumacher's \\"The Number 23\\": play with numbers long enough, and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want, even linking Ancient Greeks with Princess Di's death. However, there is an entertainment element to TPGTC: watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun. Why watch \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" or any other madhouse drama when you can have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It's like watching an amusing train wreck. Admittedly, he is almost funny on one or two occasions. I have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie-making into an exalted intellectual social science. Giving idiotic movies like \\"Birds\\" this much thought, hence this much credit, probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave. The raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value, and the few ones that do have some intelligence don't require a shrink-turned-philosopher to draw one a map to understand them  unless one is a complete idiot. Zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies. Hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in Slovenia these days... When Zizek showed the bathtub hole in the \\"Psycho\\" shower scene, I thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes; how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in Janet Leigh's blood. Or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents Leigh's vagina, with the blood flowing into it instead of out (as in menstruation), this representing some kind of \\"clever (Zizekian) irony\\". Speaking of which, the real irony is that if Hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene (and the script), his movies wouldn't have been the illogical, far-fetched crap that they often are. The point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about \\"hidden, deep meanings\\". And when you add Zizek's fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology, layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations, you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated - i.e. the easily impressionable and the gullible. Zizek utters a number of (unintentionally) funny things here, one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates Anthony Perkins's cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with \\"the satisfaction of work, of a job well done\\". Don't laugh... Neither Hitchcock nor the writer of \\"Psycho\\" could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that Perkins might be enjoying a job well done - the cleaning of a blood-stained toilet - while they were conceiving/directing that scene. Talk about putting words into one's (dead) mouth, but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to \\"say\\". I like Zizek's initial thoughts on Tarkovsky's terrific \\"Solaris\\", but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in \\"anti-feminism\\" and other nonsense into his theory. Zizek's attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone. \\"I just want to play with it all day!\\" Logic has its rules, and is not supposed to be raped - at least not publicly - by the likes of him. He seems to regard logic, proof, common-sense, and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys; concepts to be either avoided, twisted to fit the end-goal, or simply annihilated. Zizek is the LSD-tripped hippie, and all his favorite movies are his own personal \\"2001\\"s. The fact that Zizek over-focuses on two of the most overrated directors - and ones whose films often LACK intelligence, if anything - such as Hitchcock and Lynch, only further diminishes his already low credibility. I was surprised De Palma didn't feature more prominently; that's another lame director who writes inept scripts. Zizek has a field day with Lynch's incomprehensible \\"Lost Highway\\". There are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it. Zizek's comment that the viewer readily accepts von Trier's laughable, \\"ground-breaking\\" physical set-up in \\"Dogville\\" made me snicker. However, Zizek doesn't only make up stuff as he goes along, he also indulges heavily in the \\"bleedin' obvious\\". Like all \\"social scientists\\" (an oxymoron), he wraps his very trite \\"observations\\" into articulate (if full of spitting) and sometimes complex blankets of language. After all, sociology functions in precisely the same way: it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it's what we already all know, but told in an eloquent way - which fools the more unobservant listener.

She then tried to do the same thing with a glass tube. One of them bent into a circle and the other one broke. Which one did she successfully bend into a circle? (A) the rubber tube (B) the glass tube Choose the answer between \\"a glass tube\\" and \\"a rubber tube\\". Answer:","completion":"The answer to the logic test is \\"a rubber tube.\\" Let's analyze both options: (A) Rubber tube: Rubber is a flexible and elastic material, which means it can be bent and stretched without breaking. This property allows it to return to its original shape after being bent or stretched. When Vicky tried to bend the rubber tube into a circle, its flexibility and elasticity enabled her to successfully create the desired shape. Rubber tubes are often used in applications where flexibility is needed, such as hoses and tubing for various fluid transfer purposes. (B) Glass tube: Glass, on the other hand, is a rigid and brittle material. It is not designed to withstand bending or stretching forces. When Vicky tried to bend the glass tube into a circle, it was unable to handle the stress being applied to it, causing it to crack or break. Glass tubes are used in applications where rigidity and transparency are required, such as laboratory equipment or decorative purposes. However, they are not suitable for applications where bending or manipulation is necessary. Therefore, based on the material properties and the outcome presented in the logic test, Vicky was able to successfully bend the rubber tube into a circle, while the glass tube broke."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength (longer wavelengths require larger apertures). If the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved but the power is greatly reduced. If the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired. The size of aperture that can be used also depends on the size and quality of the optics. To use a very small pinhole, one must use a focusing lens with a low f-number, and ideally the lens should not add significant aberrations to the beam. The design of such a lens becomes increasingly more difficult as the f-number decreases. Paragraph: David needs to purchase a camera for his photography class. He went to the local consumer electronics store to find himself a good camera. Two cameras caught his eye, camera A and camera B. Camera A had a very small pinhole, but camera B had larger aperture.

SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points. Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select. Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts. Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections. Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast. They use Weather Bank as one of their tools. OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide 2 hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well. Lots of complaints. People were complaining that it restricted access to the system. Eliminating point specific calculation. Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits. Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures. No changes to Wheeler Ridge. Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle. Replace windows with operational maximum volumes. If CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows. Scheduling Changes-Nov 1 Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 . No direct dial-up. Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle Copy confirmed noms All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party. However, can still make changes. Can still upload new files. 2 Hour Notice Socal will provide 2 hour notice on Gas Select of OFO. Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers. Gas Select is official notification. Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail. Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free. OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific. OFO's can be declared intraday. Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day. Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on. Don't want to go back and forth. This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works. Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned. Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage. Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week. Can revise expected usage. No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO. Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day of the prior week as proxy. Generators need to revise expected usage. Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal. Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4. Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed. If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules. Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised. If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows: Cycle 1 Nom 1000 ; 0 cut Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized. Will allocate prorata. Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point. In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered. For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week. Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume. For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes. For example: Flow Day 10/4 10/3 Scheduled Volumes Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 2 Intraday 1 Cycle 3 evening cyle 2 on 10/4 Cycle 4 Intraday 1 on 10/4 In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th. ; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th; look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th; look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama has warned Russia that targeted sanctions are \\"ready to go,\\" as the Geneva agreement to de-escalate the crisis falters. Officials have vowed more punitive international actions targeting Russia's economy if Moscow, in their view, continues to aggravate the situation. Key Putin allies, high-profile Russian oligarchs and possibly Russian institutions and companies, will be targeted, CNN has been told. Obama, at a news conference Friday in South Korea, said he would be talking to other European leaders about sanctions against Russia as the Ukraine crisis worsens. The West has already introduced sanctions, imposing financial and visa restrictions on around 30 Russian and Ukrainian officials -- but stopping short of measures that would hit trade. On the flip-side, the","completion":"Russian government, led by President Vladimir Putin, has remained defiant in the face of these warnings. Moscow has responded to the threat of sanctions by ramping up support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and continuing to make strategic moves within the region. This has resulted in further fracturing of diplomatic relations between Russia and the West, as well as increased violence throughout Ukraine. As the crisis deepens and tensions continue to escalate on both sides, the story reaches its climax when a turning point occurs. Several European countries, along with the United States, decide that sanctions alone are not enough to deter Russia's advances. In a bold move, they agree to provide military aid to the struggling Ukrainian government, enabling them to better combat the pro-Russian separatists. This shift in strategy causes Russia to reevaluate its stance. The risk of direct conflict with Western forces and the potential suffering of Russian citizens due to increased sanctions forces President Putin to rethink his approach. In a last-ditch effort to avoid the worst-case scenario, Putin sends emissaries to the negotiating table with the European Union, the United States, and the Ukrainian government. Lengthy and heated negotiations take place, with all parties making tough compromises to reach a deal. Ultimately, Russia agrees to withdraw its support for the separatists in exchange for guarantees that Ukraine will not enact legislation aimed at joining NATO in the near future. Additionally, both sides pledge to work together to stabilize and rebuild war-torn parts of eastern Ukraine with the help of international organizations. The story ends on a cautiously optimistic note. While many challenges remain – rebuilding and sustaining peace in a deeply divided nation, reestablishing trust between Russia and the West, and reevaluating the role of international alliances – the world can breathe a sigh of relief as the threat of an all-out war fades into the background. However, the conclusion is not without its costs. Lives have been lost, economies damaged, and the scars of this crisis will be felt by many for years to come. The question of whether or not this newfound peace will endure remains to be seen, but for now, the world can hope that lessons have been learned and history will not repeat itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When people walk into a Pizza Hut in Tokyo, Rome, or Miami, they know exactly what they are getting. Through franchising, an investor can make use of this brand power by opening a Pizza Hut of his or her own. The risk is low, and the rewards can be big. No wonder franchising is such a successful business model. Franchising had been around for more than 100 years, but its popularity took off in the 1950s. Leading the trend were fast food restaurant like McDonald's. These days, there are franchises in more than eighty-five industries, including dry cleaning, hotels and supermarkets. It's a very big business. In the US, there are some 760,000 franchises, totaling more than 1.5 trillion in yearly revenues (income). There are two sides in a franchise: the franchisor--the owner of the business system and the franchisee--the person who licenses the system. After signing a \\"franchise agreement\\", the franchisee pays a fee. He or she also pays for equipment, supplies, and, if necessary, building costs. The total investment usually ranges from 10,000 to 1,000,000. After the business opens, the franchisee also pays a percentage of sales revenues--called a royalty--to the franchisor. Marking fees must also be paid. In return, the franchisee receives many benefits. Training is among the most common ones. It includes everything from dealing with customers to understanding the company's standards. The franchisor also handles advertising. On top of that, there's the benefit of the brand reputation that the company has built up. All of these benefits make the risk of opening a franchise much smaller than that of starting a business from scratch. However, a franchise can also have drawbacks. If a customer at a single restaurant gets sick, it may hurt every franchise in the system. Running a franchise also means closely following the company's standards. So, one has to give up a degree of independence. You have to do things their way and trust that the system... Question: What is the most important factor to make a franchise successful?

A:","completion":"Before Aubrey reaches the point of tearing Remy apart due to being sick of being bullied, there are a few steps Aubrey can take to address the situation and potentially prevent it from escalating: 1. Speak up: Aubrey should tell Remy that their behavior is not acceptable and that it makes them feel uncomfortable or hurt. This will give Remy a chance to reflect on their actions and possibly change. 2. Share feelings with a trusted friend or family member: Talking to someone who understands and supports Aubrey can provide relief and help them process the situation more effectively. Additionally, they might also suggest helpful advice or strategies. 3. Seek help from an authority figure: Aubrey can report the bullying to a teacher, school counselor, or another adult in a position of authority. They can provide guidance, support, and potentially intervene, addressing the issue with Remy and their parents if necessary. 4. Maintain self-confidence: Aubrey should keep in mind that they do not deserve to be bullied and remind themselves of their strengths and positive qualities. This will help them maintain their self-esteem during difficult times. 5. Document incidents: Keeping a record of bullying incidents can be useful when speaking to authority figures about the situation. Dates, times, locations, and a description of what happened should be included in this record. 6. Practice self-care and stress reduction: Aubrey should engage in activities that promote mental and physical well-being, such as exercise, spending time with positive influences, or engaging in hobbies they enjoy. This will help reduce stress and build resilience against the negative effects of bullying. In summary, Aubrey needs to communicate their feelings, seek support and help from trusted individuals and authority figures, maintain their self-esteem, and engage in self-care activities to address the bullying situation."},{"prompt":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Portuguese.

Article: In the US, elementary and middle schools are advised to give students two and a half hours of physical activity a week. That is what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association recommend. They say high schools should provide about four hours of physical activity each week. Yet many schools across the country have reduced their physical education programs. Criticism of the cuts has led in some places to efforts to give students more time for exercise, not less. The future health of Americans may depend on it. A study reports that life expectancy has fallen or is no longer increasing in some parts of the United States. The situation is worst among poor people in the southern states, and especially women. Public health researchers say it is largely the result of increases in obesity,smoking and high blood pressure. They also blame differences in health services around the country. In 2006, a study found that only 4% of elementary schools provided daily physical education all year for all grades. This was true of 8% of middle schools and 2% of high schools. The study also found that 22% of all schools did not require students to take any P. E. One problem for P. E. teachers is that schools are under pressure to put more time into academic subjects. Also, parents may agree that children need exercise in school. Yet many parents today still have bad memories of being chosen last for teams because teachers favored the good athletes in class. But experts say P. E. classes have changed. They say the goal has moved away from competition to personal performance, as a way to build a lifetime of activity. These days, teachers often lead activities like weight training and yoga. Some parents like the idea of avoiding competitive sports in P. E. class. Yet others surely dislike that idea. _ . Question: Which statement is TRUE? Options: A: High schools in the US should provide fewer hours of physical activity than that in elementary and middle schools. B: Not all schools in the US have reduced their physical education programs. C: 22% of all schools in the US require students to take any P. E. D: 8% of middle schools provide daily physical education all year for all grades now. A:","completion":"The true statement among the given options is B: Not all schools in the US have reduced their physical education programs. The article does mention that \\"many schools across the country have reduced their physical education programs,\\" but it doesn't claim that all schools have done so. The other options are either clearly contradicted by the text or lack sufficient evidence in the article to be considered true. For example, option A contradicts the article's information that high schools should provide more, not fewer, hours of physical activity than elementary and middle schools. Similarly, option D overstates the article's figure, which says that 8% of middle schools provided daily physical education as of 2006, not necessarily \\"now\\". Lastly, option C inversely interprets the fact mentioned in the article that 22% of all schools did not require students to take any P. E.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Japan Quake One Year Anniversary As the surge of water smashed through the factory wall in northeast Japan a year ago, Takumi Tanaka held on to an air hose to stop being swept away. Four days later, he was back at the shattered auto-parts plant, groping through meter-thick mud studded with uprooted trees. One year after Japanâs most powerful earthquake ever, the nationâs top two political parties have record-low approval ratings, signaling widespread discontent at the governmentâs response to the disaster. Japanâs Emperor will lead millions of the countryâs citizens in prayers and remembrances today for the more than 19,000 killed or lost in the quake and tsunami that struck at 2:46 p.m. one year ago. Some train services in Tokyo will halt temporarily as part of the memorial. Less than half of the evacuees from the Fukushima nuclear crisis have filed for compensation from Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) because the application forms are too complex, a survey shows. Flight engineer Tsutomu Kimura had his first look into the smoking ruins of the No. 3 reactor building when his helicopter buzzed over the Fukushima Dai-Ichi (9501) atomic plant three days after it exploded. Chikako Abeâs desk is decorated with flowers and candy at her school in Minamisoma, a reminder of a 17-year-old life cut short a year ago. Instead of attending a graduation ceremony this month, her family will pray on March 11 at the ruins of a house where the sea snatched away the lives of Chikako, her father and two grandparents. The first rules for U.S. reactors imposed in response to last yearâs nuclear disaster in Japan are fueling a debate over the adequacy and cost of the measures. After years of criticism for public- works spending that rewarded political constituents at the cost of adding debt, Japan succeeded in cutting the largesse in half. Now, that legacy of success is hampering an economic rebound. Tokyoâs preparedness for dealing with a major earthquake after last yearâs record temblor in northeast Japan that left more than 19,000 dead or missing may not significantly cut deaths or damage, says Kazuchika Asano, who has studied the cityâs emergency procedures for two decades. As five-year-olds charge through the corridors of a kindergarten in northeast Japan at lunchtime, teacher Junko Kamada says she is still unsure if their food is safe a year after the Fukushima nuclear accident. Japanâs economic rebound from the deepest contraction among advanced nations after Greece and Portugal may be stunted this year as power shortages threaten its western region. Japanâs former Prime Minister Naoto Kan received a mixed assessment of his handling of last yearâs Fukushima nuclear disaster from an independent panel. Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) is set to receive a government bailout that may cost as much as 11 trillion yen (137 billion) after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the largest in Japan since the rescue of the banking industry in the 1990s. Japanâs atomic safety rules are inferior to global standards and left the country unprepared for the Fukushima nuclear disaster last March, the countryâs top nuclear regulator told a parliamentary investigation. A Hawaiian theme park that propped up the economy of a rural Japanese town in Fukushima prefecture for 45 years was forced to close after the March 11 earthquake. Almost a year later, the hula girls have returned. An earthquake of 9.0 magnitude struck Japan on March 11, 2011 at 2:46 p.m. local time, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that engulfed large parts of northeastern Japan and damaged the Fukushima nuclear plant Photographer James Whitlow Delano visited the area near the Fukushima Power Plant that was damaged by the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011 to document how the landscape has changed.","completion":"One year after a big earthquake and tsunami happened in Japan, people are still remembering the 19,000 people who died or were lost. Many people are not happy with how the government helped after the disaster. Some families who had to leave their homes because of the nuclear crisis have not been able to get help because the process is too difficult. Japan's economy is recovering slowly, and the country is working on making their atomic safety rules better. People still worry about their safety, like if their food is safe to eat, and if their city is prepared for another big earthquake."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the most logical next event? How to make lemon mousse Crack 3 whole eggs into a heat-proof bowl. Add the yolks only of 3 separated eggs. Place the egg whites into a separate bowl and refrigerate.","completion":"The most logical next event in making lemon mousse is to prepare the lemon mixture. Here's a step-by-step process, continuing from where you left off: 1. Add sugar to the bowl with the whole eggs and egg yolks: Measure approximately 150g of granulated sugar and add it to the heat-proof bowl containing the whole eggs and egg yolks. 2. Whisk the egg mixture: Using a hand whisk or an electric mixer, whisk the egg and sugar mixture until it is pale, thick, and creamy. This may take a few minutes, depending on the equipment used. The mixture should have a ribbon-like consistency when the whisk is lifted. 3. Add lemon zest and juice: Zest 2-3 fresh lemons, depending on their size, into the egg and sugar mixture. Then cut the lemons and squeeze approximately 160ml of lemon juice, adding it to the mixture as well. Gently whisk the ingredients together until combined. 4. Prepare the double boiler: Place the bowl with the egg, sugar, and lemon mixture over a saucepan filled with simmering water, making sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. The steam from the simmering water will warm the mixture, allowing it to cook gently without scrambling the eggs. 5. Cook the lemon custard: Stir the mixture constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula while it's over the double boiler. This will ensure even cooking and prevent the mixture from sticking to the bowl. Continue to cook until the mixture thickens and reaches a custard-like consistency. The thickening process may take approximately 10-15 minutes. Once the desired thickness is reached, remove the bowl from the heat. 6. Melt the gelatin: While the lemon custard is cooling, prepare the gelatin. Measure approximately 8g of unflavored gelatin and dissolve it in 60ml of cold water. Once it's softened, gently heat the gelatin mixture in the microwave for a few seconds or using a small saucepan until it becomes liquid. Do not overheat the gelatin, as this may affect its ability to set the mousse later on. 7. Combine the custard and gelatin: Once both mixtures have cooled for a few minutes, add the liquid gelatin to your lemon custard. Mix it thoroughly to ensure that the mixtures are fully combined. 8. Whip the cream: In a separate bowl, whip approximately 350ml of heavy whipping cream until it forms soft peaks. Be careful not to over-whip the cream, as this can cause the mousse to become grainy. 9. Fold the cream into the custard mixture: Once the custard has cooled to room temperature, gently fold the whipped cream into the lemon mixture by using a spatula or a large spoon. Be careful not to deflate the mixture while folding. 10. Whip the egg whites: Retrieve the egg whites stored in the refrigerator and whip them using a clean electric mixer or a hand whisk until they form stiff peaks. It is essential to ensure that the bowl and whisk are completely free of grease or moisture, as this can prevent the egg whites from whipping properly. 11. Fold the egg whites into the mousse: Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the lemon mousse mixture using a spatula or a large spoon, being careful not to deflate the mixture. 12. Transfer the mixture to serving dishes: Once all the components are well combined, scoop or pipe the lemon mousse into individual serving glasses, cups, or a large serving bowl. 13. Refrigerate the lemon mousse: Cover the servings with plastic wrap and refrigerate them for at least 4 hours, or ideally overnight. This step is necessary for allowing the mousse to set properly. 14. Garnish and serve: Once the mousse is set, garnish it with lemon zest, whipped cream, or fresh berries before serving.

Plot title: Rabid Movie plot: Rose (Marilyn Chambers) and her boyfriend Hart (Frank Moore) are taking a little spin in the Quebec countryside on Hart's motorcycle when they have an accident. A family in a camper van stops in the middle of the road to argue about directions, and Hart must swerve to avoid them, going off the road and crashing. A patient at the nearby Keloid Clinc for Plastic Surgery witnesses the accident and calls for an ambulance. At the clinic, Murray Cypher (Joe Silver) pitches a promising franchising deal to Dr. Dan Keloid (Howard Ryshpan) and his wife Roxanne (Patricia Gage). Keloid is unconvinced, afraid that he'll become the \\"Colonel Sanders of plastic surgery\\". Just then, an ambulance containing Hart and Rose arrives. Hart has a broken hand, separated shoulder, and a concussion, but Rose, having been pinned under the motorcycle, is more severely injured. Dr. Keloid recognizes that Rose needs immediate surgery and decides to perform a radical procedure on her, one which uses morphogenetically neutral grafts of her own skin to patch the injured tissues in and on her chest and abdomen. The treated skin will be able to form new tissue of whatever type it is grafted to, but it also might lead to cancer.A month or two passes. Hart has already gone home to Montreal, but Rose still remains in a coma at the Keolid Clinic. Then one night, one of the other patients, Lloyd Walsh (J. Roger Periad), hears Rose screaming and goes to her room. She has awakened and is pulling out her I.V. drip tube. In an attempt to warm her and calm her down, Lloyd holds her, and Rose causes some sort of vague injury to him as she holds him. When examined a few hours later, Lloyd can't remember anything afterwards, and the doctor doesn't know what caused his injury to his right arm. They know only that his blood isn't clotting from the small wound and that Lloyd's right side has no feeling.

But some people want to know how long it takes to speak good English. There are plenty of people in the UK for whom even basic English is a problem. According to a census , 726,000 people in England and Wales said they could not speak English well, and another 138,000 said they did not speak it at all. Ling, 40, who arrived five years ago from China, found it difficult to learn English.\\"When I came here, I was pregnant and so I was at home for the next three years. It took me longer to learn as I was very busy with the children.\\"Eventually she was able to begin taking classes and now speaks good conversational English. But even with classes, it can be a long process to pick up the language. Age is the most important factor in language acquisition, says Mila Vulchanova, professor of linguistics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.\\"There is a sensitive period in language learning, which is biologically determined. So the younger the immigrant, the better. Since this decline is only gradual, teenagers are at an advantage over adults,\\"she says. There are a number of systems for grading English. The government expects immigrants to reach\\"ESOL Entry 3\\"or\\"B1 level\\", also called\\"Intermediate 1\\"in Scotland, before they can be granted citizenship. It's equivalent to being able to hold a confident conversation and, although the government does not have a target figure, it might take 360 hours of study to achieve.

Johnson gives him a list of three cities where the President is scheduled to visit and Swagger assesses a site in Philadelphia as the most likely. This turns out to be a set-up; while Swagger is working with Johnson's agents to find the rumored assassin, the Ethiopian archbishop is instead shot while standing next to the president. Swagger is then shot twice by a city police officer, but manages to escape. The agents tell the police that Swagger is the shooter and stage a manhunt for the injured sniper. However, he meets a rookie FBI special agent, Nick Memphis, disarms him, and steals his car. After his escape, Swagger takes refuge with Sarah Fenn, widow of his late spotter and close friend, killed years before in a mission in Africa. He later convinces her to help him contact Memphis with information on the conspiracy. Memphis is blamed for Swagger's escape and is informed that he will face disciplinary review, but argues that, given Swagger's training and experience, it is surprising that the president survived and the archbishop standing several feet away was killed. He independently learns that Swagger may have been framed for the assassination and is further made suspicious when he learns that the officer who shot Swagger was himself shot dead just hours later in a \\"mugging\\". When the agents realize their secret is compromised, they kidnap Memphis and attempt to stage his suicide. Swagger tails them and kills the captors. The two then join forces and visit a firearms expert who provides information on the FBI's ballistics report and a short list of people capable of taking a shot from a distance of one mile or more.

What they could see was its lying in its cave, sleeping and eating the meat provided by the zoo keepers. At first, people thought that the jaguar felt too lonely, so they found a female tiger to accompany it. However, it did not make too much sense. The jaguar just sometimes went out of its cave with its \\"girlfriend\\" for a while before it came back to its house again' It is normal for the jaguar to be lazy here.

A man is kneeling in sand. a man","completion":"There could be various scenarios that could naturally follow a man kneeling in sand. I'll describe a few possibilities, but note that the context and events preceding the scene could significantly influence the outcome. 1. Beach Wedding Proposal: The man could be at a beach, proposing to his partner. He has chosen this romantic setting for its serene beauty, and in one hand holds a ring that represents a lifetime of commitment and shared experiences. After a moment of anticipation, his partner says \\"yes\\" to the proposal, and amidst tears of joy and relief, they embrace each other passionately. Friends and family, who had been hiding in the background, join them to celebrate and shower them with blessings. 2. Grieving a Loss: The man could be visiting the beach as a place of solace and reflection. Perhaps he is mourning the loss of a loved one, whose ashes have been scattered across the sand. The man grievingly reaches for the sand, allowing it to slip through his fingers while remembering the fond memories he had with the departed. As a means of remembering the person, he writes their name on the sand and places flowers around it, finding comfort in the beautiful, transient nature of the tribute. 3. Building a Sandcastle: The setting could be a beach where the man decides to engage in the nostalgic activity of building sandcastles. With precise movements and artistic focus, he starts to gather wet sand, molding it into the foundation of a majestic structure. As the sandcastle gains form and complexity, passersby admire his craftsmanship, some even stopping to take pictures. His concentration and determination are enchanting, bringing joy and delight to those who get to witness such creative expression. 4. Meditation and Contemplation: The man could be practicing mindfulness and meditation on a quiet beach. The sound of the waves crashing on the shore provides a calming backdrop to this retreat from his daily pressures. Time slows and loses meaning as his mind becomes still, his breathing steady and controlled. Sitting in the sand enables him to feel grounded and connected to nature, fostering a sense of inner peace and tranquility that carries throughout his day. 5. A Beach Photoshoot: A professional photographer may be capturing the man in this idyllic, sun-drenched scene. Kneeling in the sand, the man's pose provides the perfect focal point for a memorable image. Perhaps he is part of a group participating in a beach yoga session or participating in a compelling human interest story. Regardless, the exquisite beach setting, combined with the man's natural grace, serves as an enchanting backdrop for their collective storytelling. To summarize, there are numerous scenarios that could naturally follow a depiction of a man kneeling in the sand, such as a proposal, grieving a loss, building a sandcastle, meditating, or engaging in a professional photoshoot. The precise details and direction of the narrative would depend on the context and the dreams, emotions, and intentions of the characters involved, producing a unique and evocative scene in each case."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The passionate vegetarian calls on people to give up meat once a week. The campaign argues that this will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 843,000 have signed up - including Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey. Article:","completion":"Title: Sir Paul McCartney's Meat-Free Monday Rap: A Passionate Plea for the Environment Legendary musician, Sir Paul McCartney, has never been shy about expressing his views on pressing global issues; and his latest venture – rapping for a cause – proved to be no exception. The iconic Beatles singer has turned his hand to rapping in a new YouTube video aimed at promoting the Meat-Free Monday campaign, a petition urging individuals to reduce their meat consumption to help combat climate change. While McCartney's surname has for decades been synonymous with the Beatles and groundbreaking music, this newly-formed foray into rap has instead garnered attention for its unintended comic relief, as viewers witness the 79-year old donning an unconvincing accent and employing amusing hand gestures throughout the performance. The clip has swiftly taken on the unenviable label of 'Dad-rap,' prompting a mixture of laughter and cringing from a broad audience on social media platforms. However, irrespective of the seemingly awkward delivery, the sincerity of McCartney's message cannot be overlooked. The passionate vegetarian has long been a staunch advocate for animal rights and environmental causes, and this novel rap is merely his latest attempt to enlighten the public to the myriad benefits of reducing meat consumption. Through McCartney's idiosyncratic lyrics and performance, he implores his audience to \\"give up meat once a week\\" in the hope that this lifestyle change will have a profound impact on our planet's fragile state. The Meat-Free Monday campaign, founded by McCartney along with his children, Mary and Stella, in 2009, underscores the importance of adopting an environmentally conscious lifestyle by positing that the simple act of going meat-free just once a week can substantially decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Raising animals for food production is known to be a significant contributor to global warming, with the livestock sector responsible for roughly 14.5% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. The McCartney's argument aligns with the mounting evidence that advocates for a global shift towards plant-based diets as a means to combat climate change. The campaign has amassed considerable support from celebrities and the general public alike, with roughly 843,000 signatures to date. The ever-growing list of endorsers includes notable names such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey. Their collective commitment to embrace a meat-free lifestyle every Monday not only raises awareness of the environmental benefits, but also underscores the potential health advantages associated with a diet lower in animal-based products. To conclude, Sir Paul McCartney's unique approach to promoting the Meat-Free Monday campaign through his rap video, as cringeworthy as it might be, has effectively sparked plenty of conversation and intrigue surrounding the cause. By addressing the environmental issues plaguing our planet, McCartney inspires a legion of admirers – including A-list supporters – to make a small, yet significant change in their dietary habits. Ultimately, the ripple effect of this impassioned plea may have a lasting impact on steering humanity towards a more sustainable and compassionate future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of fewer people can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of water pollution and its consequences on natural water sources such as rivers and lakes. Direct effects: 1. Reduced human population could lead to a decrease in industrial activities, resulting in lower levels of pollutants being released into water sources. This could potentially improve water quality. 2. Fewer people can also translate into less domestic waste production, which includes the dumping of untreated sewage or solid waste in water sources. As a consequence, this may improve the water quality in rivers and lakes. Indirect effects: 1. With fewer people, there might be a shift in land use, such as reduced urbanization and agricultural activities, which can lead to a decrease in runoff pollutants entering water sources and ultimately improving water quality. 2. A lower population may also lead to greater awareness and implementation of sustainable practices, such as wastewater treatment and recycling, improving water quality and reducing negative impacts on aquatic life. However, the improvement in water quality and the health of plants and animals is not guaranteed, as it greatly depends on the implementation of environmental conservation measures and proper waste management. If these practices are neglected, even with fewer people, the pollution of water sources may continue, hindering the recovery of aquatic ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible answers: shoe shop next, help next, sing a song next A:","completion":"Based on the context provided, it seems that Lee has successfully cleaned their shoes and has made a positive impression on the others, who are now asking for help in getting their own shoes clean. It is evident that Lee has demonstrated some skill or technique in cleaning shoes that the others find impressive. Taking into consideration the given options - opening a shoe shop, helping the others, or singing a song - the most logical choice for what Lee might want to do next would be to help the others clean their shoes. By doing this, Lee would be extending a gesture of goodwill and camaraderie, which in turn would likely strengthen their relationships with the others. The option to open a shoe shop may not be relevant or practical in this immediate context, as it would likely require a significant amount of time, planning, and resources that might not be readily available or related to the current situation. Furthermore, it is unclear whether others would be interested in making purchases from a shoe shop based solely on the observation that Lee can clean their own shoes well. As for singing a song, while it might serve as an entertaining or lighthearted way to pass the time or celebrate Lee's success in cleaning their shoes, it does not directly address the issue at hand or meet the needs of the others who are seeking help with their shoes. Both opening a shoe shop and singing a song could potentially be seen as off-topic or even dismissive responses to the requests for help, which could inadvertently lead to feelings of annoyance or disappointment. In conclusion, given the available options, it would be most beneficial and appropriate for Lee to offer their help to the others in need of assistance with cleaning their shoes. This response would demonstrate a willingness to share their knowledge and skills, foster positive relationships with the others, and ultimately contribute to a more collaborative and supportive environment."},{"prompt":"Q:Given the below context: The Peterloo Massacre took place at St Peter's Field, Manchester, England, on 16 August 1819, when cavalry charged into a crowd of 60,000–80,000 who had gathered to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated by the introduction of the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the relative lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to be addressed by the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt. Shortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry to arrest Hunt and several others on the hustings with him. The Yeomanry charged into the crowd, knocking down a woman and killing a child, and finally apprehending Hunt. The 15th Hussars were then summoned by the magistrate, Mr Hulton, to disperse the crowd. They charged with sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 18 people were killed and 400–700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in an ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier. Historian Robert Poole has called the Peterloo Massacre one of the defining moments of its age. In its own time, the London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government to crack down on reform, with the passing of what became known as the Six Acts. It also led directly to the foundation of the Manchester Guardian, but had little other effect on the pace of reform.

(B). yes.","completion":"(A). No. Although the two sentences seem similar at first glance, they convey slightly different information due to the terms used. The main difference between the two sentences lies in the choice of words: \\"human record\\" and \\"human file\\". In Sentence 1, the term \\"human record\\" suggests a broader, more comprehensive collection of information about human societies, histories, and cultures. This record includes all available data related to human lives, behaviors, and interactions, which can be found in various sources such as documents, artifacts, or oral histories. By testing \\"ethnographic universals\\" against the human record, Sentence 1 implies that these supposed universal features of human cultures should be scrutinized using the vast body of information that encompasses human experiences across different societies and historical periods. On the other hand, Sentence 2 uses the term \\"human file\\", which might imply a more specific and limited set of documents, records, or data points about a particular human society or subject. The human file is a subset within the broader human record. The focus on the human file might suggest a narrower range of evidence used to test the validity of ethnographic universals. In conclusion, while both sentences emphasize the importance of testing ethnographic universals against some kind of human data, Sentence 1 discusses this process in the context of the broader, comprehensive human record, whereas Sentence 2 refers to a potentially more specific and limited range of data, the human file.

Write an article with the title: \\"Christmas carnage in Nigeria; 5 churches bombed\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Christmas Carnage in Nigeria; 5 Churches Bombed Introduction: Tragedy struck on Christmas day in Nigeria, as multiple explosions rocked five churches, turning what should have been a day of celebration and reverence into one of horror and mourning. In a series of coordinated attacks, the bombings resulted in numerous casualties, with innocent worshippers and bystanders becoming victims of senseless violence. 1. The incidents The attacks began early on Christmas morning as people gathered to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ in churches across Nigeria. The first bombing took place in the town of Madalla near the country's capital, Abuja, while subsequent attacks occurred in Jos, Gadaka, and Damaturu. As of now, it is believed that radical Islamist extremists are behind these wicked acts of terrorism, although no group has yet claimed responsibility. 2. The casualties The bombings have left countless families mourning the loss of their loved ones on a day that's typically filled with warmth, joy, and a sense of community. At least 37 people have been reported dead, with over 50 injured in the devastating blasts. The death toll is expected to rise as more bodies are recovered from the rubble. 3. Purpose of the attacks It is believed that the attacks were carefully planned and executed to target Christian worshippers during the Christmas celebrations. By bombing churches on Christmas day, the attackers aimed to exploit religious differences and instigate further unrest among Nigeria's diverse population. This is not the first time Nigeria has experienced religious tension; an escalation of violence could deepen social divides and usher in more suffering for civilians already grappling with ongoing threats to their safety. 4. The government's response In the wake of the bombings, Nigeria's government has issued statements condemning the attacks and promising to apprehend those responsible. However, these efforts may be hindered by the country's limited resources and ongoing security issues. In the past, the Nigerian government has struggled to contain insurgency within its borders, and the recent attacks have brought the nation's vulnerability into sharp focus. 5. The impact on Nigerian society The Christmas carnage has sent shockwaves through Nigerian society, not only for the innocent lives lost but also for the ongoing religious tension that plagues the country. As Nigeria struggles to recover from this horrific incident, the country's unity faces a formidable challenge. It is essential that leaders of all faiths work together to promote peace, understanding, and reconciliation in the wake of this tragedy. Conclusion: The loss of lives on Christmas day due to the coordinated bombings of five churches in Nigeria is a heart-wrenching reminder of the ongoing struggle for peace and unity in the country.

The bedroom door opened and a light went on, signaling an end to nap time.The toddle , sleepy-eyed, clambered to a swinging stand in his crib.He smiled, reached out to his father, and uttered what is fast becoming the cry of his generation: \\"iPhone!\\" Just as adults have a hard time putting down their iPhones, so the device is now the Toy of Choice for many 1-, 2- and 3-year-olds.The phenomenon is attracting the attention and concern of some childhood development specialists. Natasha Sykes, a mother of two in Atlanta, remembers the first time her daughter, Kelsey, now 3 but then barely 2 years old, held her husband's iPhone.\\"She pressed the button and it lit up.I just remember her eyes.It was like 'Whoa!' \\"The parents were charmed by their daughter's fascination.But then, said Ms.Sykes (herself a Black Berry user), \\"She got serious about the phone.\\" Kelsey would ask for it.Then she'd cry for it.\\"It was like she'd always want the phone,\\" Ms.Sykes said. Apple, the iPhone's designer and manufacturer, has built its success on machines so user-friendly that even technologically blinded adults can figure out how to work them, so it makes sense that sophisticated children would follow.Tap a picture on the screen and something happens.What could be more fun? The sleepy-eyed toddler who called for the iPhone is one of hundreds of iPhone-loving toddlers whose parents are often proud of their offspring's ability to slide fat fingers across the gadget's screen and pull up photographs of their choice. Many iPhone apps on the market are aimed directly at preschoolers, many of them labeled \\"educational,\\" such as Toddler Teasers: Shapes, which asks the child to tap a circle or square or triangle; and Pocket Zoo, which streams live video of animals at zoos around the world. Along with fears about dropping and damage, however, many parents sharing iPhones with their young ones feel guilty.They wonder whether it is indeed an educational tool, or a passive amusement like television.The American Academy of Pediatrics is continually reassessing its guidelines to address new forms of \\"screen time.\\" Dr.Gwenn Schurgin O'Keeffe, a member of the academy's council, said, \\"We always try to throw in the latest technology, but the cellphone industry is becoming so complex that we always come back to the table and wonder- Should we have a specific guideline for _ \\" Tovah P. Klein, the director of a research center for Toddler Development worries that fixation on the iPhone screen every time a child is out with parents will limit the child's ability to experience the wider world. As with TV in earlier generations, the world is increasingly divided into those parents who do allow iPhone use and those who don't. A recent post on UrbanBaby.com, asked if anyone had found that their child was more interested in playing with their iPhone than with real toys. The Don't mothers said on the Website: \\"We don't let our toddler touch our iPhones ... it takes away from creative play.\\" \\"Please ... just say no. It is not too hard to distract a toddler with, say ... a book.\\" Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, a psychology professor who specializes in early language development, sides with the Don'ts. Research shows that children learn best through activities that help them adapt to the particular situation at hand and interacting with a screen doesn't qualify, she said. Still, Dr. Hirsh-Pasek, struck on a recent visit to New York City by how many parents were handing over their iPhones to their little children in the subway, said she understands the impulse . \\"This is a magical phone,\\" she said. \\"I must admit I'm addicted to this phone.\\" 1. what signals end of nap? 2. who did he reach out for? 3. who are apps aiming for? 4. who is Natasha's daughter? 5. how old? 6. what about then? 7. what is the name of the doctor mentioned? 8. she's a member of? 9. what was the recent post on? 10. is there a particular phone mentione?","completion":"1.

Given these facts, urine is a product of what organ of the body that is excreted by the urinary system among the following options: - bowel - epidermal - bladder - alveoli - lungs - urine - mammals - NaCl The answer is:","completion":"The bladder. To provide a detailed explanation, it is essential to understand the process of urine formation and the role each organ plays in the urinary system. The urinary system is responsible for filtering waste products and excess substances from the bloodstream, regulating electrolytes and fluid balance, and producing and excreting urine. The primary organs involved in this process are the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Among the given options, the bladder is the correct answer as it is a part of the urinary system and stores urine before it is excreted from the body. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how urine is produced and excreted by the urinary system: 1. Kidneys: The kidneys are the primary organs responsible for filtering waste products, excess water, and electrolytes from the blood to form urine. This process occurs in the nephrons, the functional units of the kidneys, where blood is filtered through a structure called the glomerulus, and the filtrate (containing water, ions, and waste products) enters the renal tubules. 2. Renal Tubules: As the filtrate passes through the renal tubules, essential substances like glucose, amino acids, and some ions are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. Additionally, the tubules secrete waste products and excess ions into the filtrate, further concentrating it. The remaining fluid, now called urine, is collected in the renal pelvis. 3. Ureters: The urine is then transported from the kidneys to the bladder via the ureters, which are muscular tubes that extend from the renal pelvis to the base of the bladder. The ureters use peristalsis, rhythmic contractions of their smooth muscle walls, to move the urine along. 4. Bladder: The bladder is a muscular, balloon-shaped organ that stores urine until it is ready to be excreted. As it fills with urine, the bladder expands, and the internal pressure increases. When it reaches a certain capacity, the nervous system triggers the urge to urinate. 5. Urethra: Finally, urine is expelled from the body through the urethra during the process of urination (micturition). The urethral sphincter, a ring of muscles located at the junction of the bladder and urethra, controls this process. When the sphincter relaxes, urine flows through the urethra and out of the body. In summary, the bladder is the organ among the given options that is involved in the excretion of urine by the urinary system. It stores the liquid waste produced by the kidneys before it is eliminated from the body through the urethra."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a single liter of it can explode with enough force to level a fifteen-story building. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them.

After halftime, he started to fall apart. McCoy only rushed for 8 carries and 11 yards in the 2nd half, and after the game, he was not on the field to interact with his former teammates and did not shake hands with coach Kelly, which McCoy said he wouldn't do prior to Week 14. The game started off well for Philly, besides a first down rush by McCoy, the Buffalo offense was forced to punt after 5 plays, and on the ensuing drive, Darren Sproles rushed for 15 yards to put his team on the 1 yard line, then ran it in for a TD on the next play. The Bills answered with a Tyrod Taylor pass ro Sammy Watkins, a catch and run that went 47 yards for a TD. After several more drives, the Eagles strike again in the second quarter, with first rounder Nelson Agholor getting his first career touchdown on a 53-yard catch and run. The Bills could only muster a Dan Carpenter field goal, which was countered by a Caleb Sturgis field goal with 5 seconds left in the half.

These serve the same purpose in parking lots they serve on city streets, allowing the right-of-way to a vehicle driving in a certain lane or direction, and should be obeyed. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/63/Use-Parking-Lot-Etiquette-Step-8Bullet4.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Parking-Lot-Etiquette-Step-8Bullet4.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/6/63/Use-Parking-Lot-Etiquette-Step-8Bullet4.jpg/aid370867-v4-728px-Use-Parking-Lot-Etiquette-Step-8Bullet4.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} Disabled and elderly spaces. Disabled parking spaces are generally clearly marked with signs and special striping, and are wider than regular spaces to accommodate wheelchairs. They are located near disabled ramps, usually very close to the entrance of the shop. If you do not require the use of these spaces, and do not have a permit, park somewhere else as parking there would be an inconvenience to them, and it is illegal in many places. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7c/Use-Parking-Lot-Etiquette-Step-8Bullet3.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Parking-Lot-Etiquette-Step-8Bullet3.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/7/7c/Use-Parking-Lot-Etiquette-Step-8Bullet3.jpg/aid370867-v4-728px-Use-Parking-Lot-Etiquette-Step-8Bullet3.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} Pedestrian crosswalks. These are common near the main entrances and exits of most large businesses, for the safety of pedestrians returning to their cars. They are usually marked with diagonal white or yellow stripes, and often also are marked with a pedestrian crossing or stop sign. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/60/Use-Parking-Lot-Etiquette-Step-8Bullet5.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Parking-Lot-Etiquette-Step-8Bullet5.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/6/60/Use-Parking-Lot-Etiquette-Step-8Bullet5.jpg/aid370867-v4-728px-Use-Parking-Lot-Etiquette-Step-8Bullet5.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} Indicators/Turn signals.

Pay attention to speed limits and road markings to keep everyone safe. Look for one-way signs, stop and yield signs, and follow them. Be respectful and don't park in spaces for disabled or elderly people unless you have a permit. Watch for crosswalks and use your turn signals to tell others where you're going. Following these rules makes parking lots safe and enjoyable for everyone!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Choose the next sentence for this paragraph. A leading Italian soccer coach has called for stronger action against racism after a top-level match between AC Milan and Roma was suspended Sunday due to abusive chants by supporters. Milan striker Mario Balotelli was targeted by visiting fans throughout the match, and referee Gianluca Rocchi called the game to a halt in the second half to warn the crowd via the public address system. After several minutes' delay, the match continued and ended in a 0-0 draw. Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri later said the official's decision was not strong enough. \\"In my opinion, there's only one solution to racism in stadium and that's suspend the match,\\" Allegri said on Milan's website. \\" OPTIONS: - AC Milan made a mistake but it's in the past now,\\" Allegri told reporters. - Allegri made a mistake but it's in the past now,\\" Allegri told reporters. - Gianluca Rocchi made a mistake but it's in the past now,\\" Allegri told reporters. - Italian made a mistake but it's in the past now,\\" Allegri told reporters. - Mario Balotelli made a mistake but it's in the past now,\\" Allegri told reporters. - Massimiliano Allegri made a mistake but it's in the past now,\\" Allegri told reporters. - Milan made a mistake but it's in the past now,\\" Allegri told reporters. - Roma made a mistake but it's in the past now,\\" Allegri told reporters. - San Siro made a mistake but it's in the past now,\\" Allegri told reporters. - Sulley Muntari made a mistake but it's in the past now,\\" Allegri told reporters.","completion":"\\"In my opinion, there's only one solution to racism in stadium and that's suspend the match,\\" Allegri said on Milan's website. Gianluca Rocchi made a mistake but it's in the past now,\\" Allegri told reporters. In the given paragraph, Allegri criticized the referee for not taking strong enough action against racism. Among the options, the best choice to continue the paragraph is the quote where Allegri mentions that the referee, Gianluca Rocchi, made a mistake. It involves an issue raised in the earlier paragraph and is consistent with Allegri's call for stronger action. The other options are incorrect because they either involve different individuals or are unrelated to the main issue discussed in the paragraph (racism and the match suspension decision)."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Paragraph: As for engravings, Durer's work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise. The portraits include Cardinal-Elector Albert of Mainz; Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony; the humanist scholar Willibald Pirckheimer; Philipp Melanchthon, and Erasmus of Rotterdam. For those of the Cardinal, Melanchthon, and Durer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, Durer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach. Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, Durer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend Willibald Pirckheimer, whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images. He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. Durer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. \\"The Four Books on Measurement\\" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on mathematics in German, as well as being cited later by Galileo and Kepler. The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527. \\"The Four Books on Human Proportion\\" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.
