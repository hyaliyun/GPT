A). USA B). Mexico C). not enough information D). Italy Q: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has been accused by Brendan Hughes of ordering the killing of Jean McConville in 1972 in a tape released after his death. He then endured a three-hour ordeal at the hands of the Belfast IRA's youth wing as a warning to stay silent. Upon further investigation into the tape, serious questions were raised regarding Adams's alleged involvement in the murder and disappearance of Jean McConville. It was found that the Belfast IRA's youth wing had subjected Adams to threats and intimidation in an attempt to ensure his compliance and secrecy regarding the McConville case. As a result, the allegations against Gerry Adams sparked massive controversy and drew intense scrutiny from both the public and law enforcement. Many called for a comprehensive investigation into Adams's potential involvement in the disappearance and murder of the mother of ten children. A detailed inquiry was launched by the authorities, examining the claims made by the former Belfast IRA commander, Brendan Hughes. The inquiry sought to uncover further evidence linking Adams to the crime and verify the authenticity of the tape. Various eyewitness testimonies, forensic evidence, and testimonies from Jean McConville's surviving family members were analyzed in the process. Following thorough investigation, the findings were presented to a jury, made up of impartial members who carefully considered the presented evidence. The jury heard the testimonials and examined the gathered evidence before deliberating on the case. When the verdict was finally reached, it was announced that Gerry Adams had been found not guilty of ordering the murder and secret burial of Jean McConville due to insufficient evidence. The jury highlighted the lack of concrete evidence tying Adams directly to the case, rendering the allegations against him inconclusive. The verdict ultimately exonerated Gerry Adams from the grave accusation and confirmed that there had been no sufficient evidence to establish his involvement. Although the jury's decision put an end to the legal proceedings involving Adams and the McConville case, it further fueled the public debate surrounding the role of the former Sinn Fein president in the armed conflict between the British state and the IRA. Many continued to argue that Adams's past actions and affiliations cast a dark shadow over his later political career, resulting in unresolved questions and lasting tensions between Unionists and Nationalists in Northern Ireland. The case also highlighted the dire consequences of unresolved issues related to the Northern Irish conflict, emphasizing the necessity for a comprehensive resolution and accountability for the sake of the victims, their families, and society's ability to heal and move forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. and the situation: There are two cities, Chien and Marisol, in France that are leaders in the amount of wine they export to the rest of the world. Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation. Answer the following question: Does Marisol have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Chien? Answer:","completion":"Marisol has a lower chance of acid rain than Chien. This is because Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity, while Chien uses coal. When coal is burned for generating electricity, it releases air pollution containing sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are the main contributors to acid rain. On the other hand, nuclear power plants do not release these pollutants while generating electricity. Thus, Marisol's reliance on nuclear energy significantly reduces the likelihood of acid rain compared to Chien, which relies on burning coal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Mandarin Chinese is a tonal language, which means that different tones can change the meaning of a word, even if the pronunciation and spelling are otherwise the same. It is essential to learn the different tones if you wish to speak Mandarin Chinese correctly. Mandarin Chinese has four main tones, as follows: The first tone is a high, flat tone. Your voice stays flat, with no rise or dip in the way it sounds. Using the word \\"ma\\" as an example, the first tone is indicated using the symbol above the letter a: \\"mā\\". The second tone is a rising tone. Your voice rises from a low to middle pitch, as if you were asking someone to repeat something by saying \\"huh?\\" or \\"what?\\" The second tone is indicated using the symbol \\"má\\". The third tone is a dipping tone.The pitch goes from middle to low to high, like when you say the letter \\"B\\". When two third tone syllables are near each other, the second one retains its third tone sound while the first takes the sound of the second tone. The third tone is indicated using the symbol \\"mǎ\\". The fourth tone is a lowering tone. The pitch goes rapidly from high to low, as if giving a command e.g. stop! Or as if you're reading a book and have come across something new and interesting and are saying \\"huh\\". The fourth tone is indicated using the symbol \\"mà\\". Easy enough? If not, don't fret. It's definitely recommended to hear the tones demonstrated by a native speaker, since it's hard to get an idea of what they sound like purely through text. No matter what language you're learning, the more words you have at your disposal, the sooner you will become fluent. Therefore, the next thing to do is to memorize some useful Chinese vocabulary. Some good vocabulary lists to start with includes: times of day (morning: zǎo shàng, afternoon: xià wǔ, evening: wǎn shàng) body parts (head: tóu, feet: jiǎo, hands: shǒu) food (beef: niú ròu, chicken: jī, egg: jī dàn, noodles: miàn tiáo) along with colors, days, months, transport words, weather, etc. When you hear a word in English, think about how you would say it in Mandarin. If you don't know what it is, jot it down and look it up later. It's handy to keep a little notebook on you for this purpose. Attach little Chinese labels (with the character, the pinyin and the pronunciation) to items around your house, such as the mirror, the coffee table and the sugar bowl. You'll see the words so often that you'll learn them without realizing it! Although having a wide vocabulary is good, remember that in Mandarin, accuracy is more important. It's no good learning a word if you can't pronounce it properly, using the correct tone, as different pronunciations could have entirely different meanings. For example, using the wrong tone (using mā instead of má) could be the difference between saying \\"I want cake\\" and \\"I want coke\\" - two completely different meanings. Luckily, the Mandarin numerical system is fairly straightforward and logical, and once you have learned the first ten numbers you will be able to count to 99. Below you will find the numbers one to ten, written in simplified Chinese characters, followed by the Hanyu pinyin translation and the correct pronunciation. Make sure to practice saying each number using the correct tone. One: written as (一) or yī, pronounced [eee] Two: written as (二) or èr, pronounced [err] Three: written as (三) or sān, pronounced [saan] Four: written as (四) or sì, pronounced [ssuh] Five: written as (五) or wǔ, pronounced [woo] Six: written as (六) or liù, pronounced [lee-yoe] Seven: written as (七) or qī, pronounced [chi] Eight: written as (八) or bā, pronounced [baa] Nine: written as (九) or jiǔ, pronounced [jee-yo] Ten: written as (十) or shí, pronounced [sh] Once you have mastered numbers one to ten, you can continue counting in double digits by saying the number in the tens' position, then the word 十, followed by the number in the one's position. For example: The number 48 is written as sì shí bā (四十八), literally meaning \\"four tens plus eight\\". The number 30 is written as sān shí (三十), literally meaning \\"three tens\\". The number 19 is written as yī shí jiǔ (一十九), literally meaning \\"one ten plus nine\\" (however in most Mandarin dialects the initial yī is omitted from numbers in the teens, as it is deemed unnecessary). The word for hundred in Mandarin is (百) or baǐ, so 100 is written as yì baǐ, 200 is written as èr baǐ, 300 is written as sān baǐ, etc. Once you have a basic grasp of vocabulary and pronunciation, you can move on to learning basic conversational phrases which are used in everyday Chinese speech. Hello- 你好- nǐhǎo, pronounced [nee how] What is your surname (family name)? (formal )- 您贵姓? - nín guì xìng, pronounced [neen gway shing] or 你姓什么？- nǐ xìng shén me (inf.), pronounced [nee shing shurn muh] What's your name?- 你叫什么名字? - nǐ jiào shén me míng zì, pronounced [nee jee-ou shurn muh ming zi] Yes- 是 - shì, pronounced [sh] No- 不是 - bú shì, pronounced [boo sh] Thank you- 谢谢 - xiè xiè, pronounced [shie shie] You're welcome- 不用谢 - bú yòng xiè, pronounced [boo yong shee-e] Excuse me- 对不起 - duì bu qǐ, pronounced [dway boo chee] I don't understand- 我不懂 - wǒ bù dǒng, pronounced [wuo boo downg] Goodbye- 再见 - zài jiàn, pronounced [zay jee-en]","completion":"This article explains the importance of learning the four tones in Mandarin Chinese, provides examples of vocabulary words and pronunciation tips, and presents essential conversational phrases for beginners."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So let's see: Can the man be sitting up near the roof and eating a sandwich at the bottom of a pool at the same time? Doesn't make much sense, right? So the multi-select problem asks us what we can say about this whole situation. Our choices are yes, it's not possible to tell, or no.

Unfortunately, that message has not gotten through to the average American, who would rather try switching to \\"light\\" beer and low-calorie bread than increase physical efforts. The Centers for Disease Control, for example, found that fewer than one-fourth of overweight adults who were trying to lose weight said they were combining exercise with their diet. In rejecting exercise, some people may be discouraged too much by caloric-expenditure charts; for example, one would have to quickly walk hard three miles just to work off the 275 calories in one delicious Danish pastry . Even exercise professionals accept half a point here. \\"Exercise by itself is a very tough way to lose weight,\\" says York Onnen, program director of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. Still, exercise's supporting role in weight reduction is vital. A study at the Boston University Medical Center of overweight police officers and other public employees confirmed that those who dieted without exercise regained almost all their old weight, while those who worked exercise into their daily routine maintained their new weight. If you have been sedentary and decide to start walking one mile a day, the added exercise could burn an extra 100 calories daily. In a year's time, assuming no increase in food intake, you could lose ten pounds. By increasing the distance of your walks gradually and making other dietary adjustments, you may lose even more weight. Question: What was confirmed by the Boston University Medical Center's study?

Watson says, \\"Seven per cent\\", Holmes says he knows Watson disapproves and has been covertly diluting the solution.Holmes, in a bad mood, complains that Watson's case histories, published in The Strand Magazine, exaggerate and embellish and are more lurid than reality. For example, he is barely six foot one, and Watson wrote that he is six foot four. Watson replies \\"Poetic license, Holmes!\\".Still in a foul mood, Holmes yells at landlady Mrs. Hudson (Irene Handl) for dusting stuff on his desk. Later he has the rooms thick with smoke from using a machine to artificially smoke various cigarettes, as part of his research on cigarette ashes.Watson suggests that he might consider investigating why six acrobatic midgets disappeared from their circus act, as a recent newspaper reports, but he is rebuffed. The next suggestion is that they go to a performance of a Russian ballet, since someone anonymously has sent them two expensive tickets.At the end of the ballet, the impresario (Clive Revill) invites Holmes, and reluctantly, Watson, to a staff party.

Visiting New York City interested Dennis but not Samuel because","completion":"Samuel had always been more captivated by the prospect of exploring smaller, culturally-rich towns and engaging in outdoor activities, while Dennis saw the bustling cityscape, diverse culinary delights, and renowned art scene of New York City as the ultimate travel destination that would cater to his taste for urban adventures, electrifying nightlife, and unique experiences that only the Big Apple could offer. Samuel, on the other hand, found the overwhelming crowds and fast-paced lifestyle in New York City to be too chaotic and straining on his senses, which made him long for a more serene, authentic, and immersive vacation just as much as Dennis anticipated the thrill of immersing himself in the vibrant life of the metropolis and its people. Samuel preferred to wander through cobblestone streets, hike lush trails, or bike along scenic routes, basking in the natural beauty and history of a destination and connecting with locals in a more intimate, leisurely atmosphere that would allow him to appreciate the essence of a place on a profound level. In contrast, Dennis thrived in the pulsating energy of the concrete jungle, eager to catch the latest Broadway shows, delve into world-class museums, and navigate his way through the intricate subway system, all while acquainting himself with the myriad languages, cultures, and traditions that intertwined in this global hub, making for an experience that was both exhilarating and unforgettable. As a result, planning vacations together often presented a conundrum for Dennis and Samuel, as they had to strike a delicate balance between their divergent interests and find a way to compromise without sacrificing their individual preferences. Their conversations invariably revolved around choosing destinations that somehow merged the cosmopolitan allure of New York City with the quaint charm and natural appeal of smaller communities, all in a bid to ensure that both friends had an equally enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Sometimes they could manage this feat with a little ingenuity and creativity, such as by tackling the cities early in their trip and then retreating to more peaceful havens in an effort to recover their equilibrium – but even then, they knew that their outlooks on the ideal vacation would always be fundamentally different. Despite their contrasting tastes, Dennis and Samuel maintained a deep bond forged through years of shared memories, laughter, and mutual respect for each other's perspectives. In the end, their affection for one another surpassed their individual predilections, enabling them to forge unforgettable experiences and continue enriching their friendship even as they recognized the inherent differences in their mindset toward travel and exploration. Hence, as they planned another journey, they embraced the challenge of combining their interests, appreciating that the process of negotiation and compromise ultimately reflected the beauty of their enduring friendship – a connection that was stronger than any landmark, destination, or travel experience could ever be."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - glass - shoulder - body - guillotine - bottle The answer is:","completion":"bottle When picking up drinks, holding them by the neck is most suitable for bottles. This is because the neck of a bottle provides a narrow and firm grip, allowing you to securely hold the beverage while minimizing the risk of slipping or dropping it. The other options provided in the list do not accurately address the question: 1. Glass: Refers to the material used to make some bottles and cups, but does not denote a specific design feature that would require holding by the neck. In fact, holding a glass beverage container by the neck could make it unstable and lead to spills or accidents. 2. Shoulder: This term does not relate to the design or structure of drink containers. In a human context, the shoulder is a part of the anatomy that connects the arm to the torso on either side of the body, and is not a useful reference for picking up drinks. 3. Body: While body is a term often used to describe the main, cylindrical portion of a bottle, holding a beverage container by the body may create a less stable grip, as compared to holding it by the neck. Moreover, holding a cold bottle by the body could result in condensation making the grip slippery. 4. Guillotine: This term describes a historical device used for executions, particularly in France during the French Revolution, and has no relevance to holding drinks or their containers. As such, it is not a suitable answer to the question. In conclusion, when picking up drinks, the most suitable option to hold them by the neck is a bottle. Bottle necks offer a secure grip, reducing the risk of accidents or spills and providing a more stable and comfortable way to carry a beverage container."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Have you ever looked toward the sky on a fall day and witnessed a group of migrating birds? If so, you probably noted the V-shaped formation of the birds or the birds flying in a ball-like formation. Why do birds fly this way? Many theories have been developed to explain the formation patterns of different types of birds. One theory is that birds fly in certain formations to take advantage of the laws of nature. The birds know that flying in a V-shaped pattern will save energy. Like the lead cyclist in a race who decreases wind force for the cyclists who follow, the lead bird cuts wind force for the birds that follow. This decrease in wind force means that the birds use up to 70 percent less energy during their flight. When the lead bird becomes tired, a more rested bird takes over that position. But saving energy is important for more than one reason. Sometimes food is short during migration flights. Keeping energy enables the birds to fly longer distances between meals. When food is sighted, the birds guide one another in a different way. When a bird identifies a familiar feeding area, it might turn around in order to signal the group to change direction. Then, this bird becomes the new leader. It helps guarantee that other birds will know exactly where it is going. Then the whole group makes a change in direction, gently streaming from the sky down to the ground. This formation is like an arrow pointing to the location of food. Scientists have also studied the birds that sometimes fly in a ball-like formation. Researchers believe that the birds come together if a predator is spotted. The predator may then become impatient waiting for a single bird to fly away from the group. The birds will often dip and dive as a group, frustrating even the most persistent enemy. Scientists report that this is a very effective method of defense against an attack. The birds care for their fellow fliers through teamwork. As transportation expert Henry Ford once said, \\"If everyone is moving forward together, then...","completion":"What is one of the main reasons why birds fly in a V-shaped formation during migration?

Write a title for this article: More than most technologies I can think of, the E Ink screens used in monochrome e-readers such as Barnes & Noble’s Nook Simple Touch and Amazon.com’s Kindle Touch present a stark set of tradeoffs. If you don’t mind the lack of color, their virtues are considerable: they don’t get bleached out in bright sun and allow for an e-reader to go for weeks between charges. But the same E Ink displays that are wonderfully legible in bright light are impossible to read in a dark room. And if the lighting is so-so — like it is on, say, an airplane — E Ink displays are readable, but murky and not very appealing. In either of these cases, you’re far better of with a color LCD such as the ones on B&N’s Nook Tablet and Nook Color, Amazon’s Kindle Fire and the iPad. But now bookselling behemoth Barnes & Noble has a fix. It’s called the Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight, and it’s an E Ink Nook with a 6″ screen that lights up on demand. I got a hands-on sneak peek today and was generally impressed. Illuminated E Ink isn’t a new idea: Sony released one of its Readers with a lit screen back in 2009. But in that version, the lighting hurt the clarity of the screen. The company dropped the feature in later models. Judging from my demo of the Nook with GlowLight, Barnes & Noble has figured out how to make the idea make sense. This Simple Touch is essentially the same as its appealing predecessor — which remains available — except that when you press and hold the e-reader’s “N” button, LEDs along the edge of the display turn on, blanketing the screen in light. The illumination isn’t perfectly even — I could make out discrete beams emanating from the LEDs along the top edge — but it’s bright enough to make the display perfectly legible in very dark environments, without lighting up the entire room in the way that backlit LCD displays tend to do. (That’s an important point if you’re reading in bed and someone else is trying to sleep.) In a room in which the lighting is merely mediocre rather than almost non-existent, GlowLight still makes a difference — it gets rid of the grayishness of standard E Ink. I’d certainly prefer it, although it does make it more obvious that you’re looking at an electronic display. (You can adjust the brightness to your liking — and with any luck, the Nook kiosks in Barnes & Noble stores will set things up so you can judge the screen with your own eyeballs.) The lighting option would be useful even if it was a ravenous battery hog, but according to B&N’s claims, it appears to be reasonably efficient. The company says that the Simple Touch with GlowLight will go for two months between charges if you don’t use the light at all; if you use it for a half-hour a day, you’ll still get a month on a charge. Presumably, that translates into about fifteen hours of continuous use with the light on. (It shuts off automatically after five minutes of no usage, so you won’t kill the battery if you fall asleep with the light on.) Barnes & Noble says that the Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight will be available in early May at its own stores, Best Buy, Target, Walmart and other retailers; it’ll sell for 139. The non-lit Simple Touch will stay around at 99. Amazon, meanwhile, has a non-touch Kindle at 99 (or 79 with “special offer” ads), the Kindle Touch at 139 (or 99 with special offers) and the Kindle Touch with 3G at 189 (or 149 with special offers). Sony’s Reader is 129. And I’m not even going to mention other contenders such as Kobo. (Whoops, I just did!) Whew. That’s a lot of choices. At 139, the Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight competes most directly with Amazon’s no-special-offers Kindle Touch. And the lit screen is a pretty compelling selling point — at least as long as you haven’t already sunk much money into a collection of Kindle books, since they can’t be read on the Nook. Me, I do most of my e-reading on my iPad; it may be much bigger, heavier, and pricier than any of the E Ink readers, but I almost always have it with me anyhow. Still, there seems to be a healthy market for more traditional e-readers. I’m pleased to see that they’re continuing to evolve, and I’m curious to see how long this Nook’s GlowLight screen remains a unique point in its favor. MORE: back in February, B&N knocked the starting price of its Nook Tablet down to 199.

About 2,000 kilometers, or 30%,of the ancient fortification built in the Ming Dynasty has disappeared due to natural and human damage, according to the Beijing Times. And the situation could worsen, experts are warning as not enough is being done to preserve what remains. \\"It's a great pity to witness the Great Wall in such terrible situation ,\\" Mei Jingtian, a volunteer who has worked for three decades to safeguard the structure and has founded the Great Wall Protection Association, tells CNN. About 8,000 kilometers of the structure dates from the Ming period between the 14th and 17th centuries and is considered by some to be the original Great Wall.Of this, 2,000 kilometers is made up of naturally occurring earthworks - and so only 6,000 kilometers of actual Ming dynasty wall was ever built. Stretches built in other eras make up a total length estimated up to 21,000 kilometers. Many visitors to china associate the Great Wall with a widely restored stretch of Ming era wall at Badaling near Beijing, but this is far from typical of most of the structure.

Here are possible answers to this question: - vaporate - cool off - form crystals - melt - keep things cold I believe the correct choice is \\"melt\\", here's why: A:","completion":"If ice is not ice anymore, it means it has undergone a physical change and transformed into a different state of matter. In this case, the correct answer is “melt.” Melting is a process that results in a substance changing from a solid state to a liquid state, usually due to an increase in temperature. When ice (solid water) absorbs heat, it causes its molecules to move faster and break the bonds between them, resulting in the solid ice turning into liquid water. Let's briefly discuss the other options to clarify why they are not the correct choice: 1. \\"Vaporate\\" – This term is often confused with \\"evaporate,\\" which is the process where a substance changes from a liquid to a gas or vapor. However, this is not the correct answer because it does not involve ice changing states directly. 2. \\"Cool off\\" – Cooling off refers to lowering the temperature of a substance. It does not cause a change in the state from ice to something else. 3. \\"Form crystals\\" – Ice is already in a crystalline form, as its molecules are arranged in a lattice-like structure. Forming crystals would not change the ice into a different state. 4. \\"Keep things cold\\" – Keeping things cold is a function or utility of ice and not a change in its state. It does not explain what happens to the ice when it is no longer ice. In summary, when ice is not ice anymore, it has most likely melted and turned into liquid water, which is a direct result of an increase in temperature causing a change in the physical state from solid to liquid."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What does Remy need to do before this?\\", is \\"live in a city\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"Yes, \\"live in a city\\" can be considered a valid answer to the question, \\"What does Remy need to do before this?\\" since Remy was walking in the city and found money by the sector. Living in a city would make it more plausible that Remy was strolling around an urban area and would come across such a situation. However, the answer can be elaborated further by considering other factors that could have led Remy to that particular moment: 1. Not only living in a city but also being familiar with the city's layout, attractions, and commercial districts would make it more likely for Remy to walk around exploring the city. 2. Remy would need to possess the habit of taking walks and exploring the city on foot. Regular walking can help Remy build familiarity with his surroundings, and increase the chance of finding interesting or unexpected things like money by the sector. 3. Choosing the right time of day to walk can also be relevant to Remy's discovery. For instance, if it is more likely to find money by the sector during a busy rush hour or late at night when people may drop things unintentionally, timing his walks accordingly could improve Remy's chances of finding the money. 4. Remy might need to prepare himself for the walk by wearing comfortable and appropriate clothing and footwear, ensuring he is well-rested, and having a plan or route for his walk, so he does not get lost or overwhelmed during his exploration. 5. Remy would also need to be observant and pay attention to his surroundings while walking. Being aware of details like objects on the ground, people's behaviors, or signs relevant to the sector where the money was found can increase the likelihood of discovering the money. 6. Finally, it would be helpful for Remy to be knowledgeable about the laws and rules concerning found money in the city. Knowing the appropriate procedures to follow, such as reporting the money to the authorities or attempting to locate the owner, would ensure that Remy acts responsibly and legally after finding the money. In summary, while \\"live in a city\\" is a valid answer to the question, other factors like familiarizing oneself with the city, the habit of walking around, timing of the walk, proper preparation, being observant and knowledgeable about laws and regulations also contribute to the likelihood of Remy finding money by the sector."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Though getting pierced can be an exciting milestone, the most critical aspect of the experience is the aftercare. Proper aftercare ensures optimal healing, minimizes the risk of infection, and enhances the longevity and appeal of the piercing. In this article, we will discuss three powerful methods to soothe and heal piercings: chamomile tea compresses, cold foods and drinks, and the appropriate guidelines for using ice. Chamomile Tea Compresses Chamomile tea is a natural and potent remedy that has been used for thousands of years to soothe and heal various ailments. When it comes to piercings, chamomile tea compresses work wonders. Not only do they help reduce swelling and redness, but they also aid in the healing process due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. To make a chamomile tea compress, follow these steps: 1. Brew a cup of strong chamomile tea using a tea bag or loose-leaf tea. 2. Allow the tea to cool down until it's still warm but not too hot. 3. Soak a clean cloth (preferably cotton) or a sterile gauze pad in the chamomile tea. 4. Gently press the soaked cloth or pad against the pierced area for about 10-15 minutes, as often as needed or recommended by your piercer. 5. Rinse the area with clean water and pat dry using a fresh, clean cloth or paper towel. Cold Foods and Drinks for Lip Piercings Lip and oral piercings, including labret, Monroe, and snakebite piercings, can be particularly sensitive and prone to swelling. A simple yet effective remedy is to consume cold foods and drinks. This technique works as a natural ice pack, providing relief from the inside and reducing swelling, soreness, and inflammation. Some recommended cold foods and drinks include ice chips, popsicles, frozen yogurt, chilled fruit, iced beverages, and smoothies. It's essential to maintain oral hygiene by rinsing your mouth with a non-alcoholic mouthwash after consuming food or drink, as well as gently brushing your teeth to reduce the chances of infection. Avoid Icing Non-Oral Piercings While using ice has numerous benefits, this method should be approached with caution for non-oral piercings. Icing non-oral piercings can lead to tissue damage and a delay in the healing process. When the piercing is in an area with reduced blood flow, applying ice directly to the wound can cause the tissues to become excessively cold, making them prone to frostbite and irreversible damage. However, if your piercer approves and the ice is only applied for short periods (no more than 10-15 minutes), it may be helpful in soothing the discomfort and reducing inflammation. If you do decide to use ice, always wrap it in a clean cloth or a ziplock bag to create a barrier between your skin and the ice to avoid any skin damage. Conclusion Proper aftercare is crucial for ensuring the long-term success of your piercing. When done correctly, techniques like chamomile tea compresses and cold food and drinks can provide significant relief and expedite the healing process while minimizing adverse side effects. However, always consult with your piercing professional before trying any new aftercare techniques, especially when it comes to the use of ice on non-oral piercings. By prioritizing healing and safety through these natural remedies, you'll be on the path to enjoying your beautiful, adorned body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Dame Helen Lydia Mirren, (nee Mironoff; born 26 July 1945) is an English actor. Mirren began her acting career with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1967, and is one of the few performers who have achieved the Triple Crown of Acting. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 2007 for her performance as Queen Elizabeth II in The Queen and received the Olivier Award for Best Actress and Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for the same role in The Audience. Mirren's other Academy Award nominations include The Madness of King George (1994), Gosford Park (2001) and The Last Station (2009). Mirren's first film of the 2000s was Joel Hershman's Greenfingers (2000), a comedy based on the true story about the award-winning prisoners of HMP Leyhill, a minimum-security prison. Mirren portrayed a devoted plantswoman in the film, who coaches a team of prison gardeners, led by Clive Owen, to victory at a prestigious flower show. The project garnered largely lukewarm reviews from critics, who felt that it added \\"nothing new to this already saturated genre\\" of British feel-good films. The same year, she began work on the mystery film The Pledge, actor Sean Penn's second directorial effort, in which she played a child psychologist. A critical success, the ensemble film tanked at the box office. Also the year, she filmed the American-Icelandic satirical drama No Such Thing opposite Sarah Polley. Directed by Hal Hartley, Mirren portrayed a soulless television producer in the film, who strives for sensationalistic stories. It was largely panned by critics. Her biggest critical and commercial success, released in 2001, became Robert Altman's all-star ensemble mystery film Gosford Park. An homage to writer Agatha Christie's whodunit style, the story follows a party of wealthy Britons and an American, and their servants, who gather for a shooting weekend at an English country house, resulting in an unexpected murder. Widely acclaimed by critics, it received multiple awards and nominations, including a second Academy Award nomination and first Screen Actors Guild Award win for Mirren's portrayal of the sternly devoted head servant Mrs. Wilson. Mirren's last film that year was Fred Schepisi's dramedy film Last Orders opposite Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins. In 2003, Mirren starred in Nigel Cole's comedy Calendar Girls, inspired by the true story of a group of Yorkshire women who produced a nude calendar to raise money for Leukaemia Research under the auspices of the Women's Institutes. Mirren was initially resistant to join the project, at first dismissing it as another middling British picture, but rethought her decision upon learning of the casting of co-star Julie Walters. The film garnered generally positive reactions by film critics, and grossed 96,000,000 worldwide. In addition, the picture earned Satellite, Golden Globe, and European Film Award nominations for Mirren. Her other film that year was the Showtime television film The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone opposite Olivier Martinez, and Anne Bancroft, based on the 1950 novel of the same title by Tennessee Williams.","completion":"This text is about Dame Helen Lydia Mirren, an English actor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the full names of the people that Carl tracks down for saving his life? , can you please find it? In Santa Monica, California, a pair of Mormon missionaries—by-the-book Elder Farrell, and his soon-to-leave companion, Elder Lozano (Ignacio Serricchio)—proselytize until they are caught between a gang drive-by shooting targeting nearby thugs. The shootout kills one thug and wounds another, Carl, whom Elder Lozano saves. After being released from the hospital, Carl tracks down the two missionaries, thanking Lozano for saving his life, who gives Carl a Book of Mormon. Later, the missionaries notice an unconscious street preacher lying behind a Dumpster. Despite Farrell's hesitation, the missionaries bring the man—later identified as Louis (Jo-sei Ikeda)—to rest in their apartment. Meanwhile, Carl, who has been reading the Bible and Book of Mormon, is eager to be baptized and begins taking lessons from the missionaries. While they do so, the missionaries ask their next-door neighbor, Holly, to check on the homeless preacher in their home. Upon their return, they have dinner with Holly and Louis and continue to do so for a few days. In this time, the missionaries learn that Louis once was a preacher who lost his congregation due to alcoholism and that Holly—a struggling actress—acted in a few adult movies, her parents back home discovering and cutting off contact with her as a result. Elder Farrell promises that God will never stop loving her regardless of her mistakes. At a local ward luau, another missionary interviews Carl for baptism, teaching him the story of Ammon, a missionary who teaches a group of people to give up their weapons and bury them deep in the ground, vowing never to use them again.

Before starting the experiment, Jacob is told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces. Jacob now has to decide how to use this information to guide him as he develops the experimental procedures for these two liquids. Which liquid will have lower viscosity? Answer:","completion":"Liquid B will have lower viscosity. Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow or its internal friction. It depends on the strength of the intermolecular forces between the fluid's molecules. Stronger intermolecular forces lead to greater resistance to flow, resulting in higher viscosity, while weaker intermolecular forces lead to less resistance to flow, resulting in lower viscosity. In Jacob's experiment, liquid A has strong intermolecular forces, which means the molecules are more firmly attracted to one another. This would cause liquid A to have a higher viscosity as the molecules resist flowing past one another. On the other hand, liquid B has weak intermolecular forces, which means the molecules do not hold together as tightly. This results in the molecules flowing more easily past each other, making liquid B have a lower viscosity. In summary, liquid B will have a lower viscosity due to its weaker intermolecular forces, allowing the molecules to flow more easily and with less resistance compared to liquid A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Turkey is a nation of farmers, they use conventional agricultural methods to produce food, including lots of fertilizers. Greece's economy is mostly based on tourism. But I can use this background: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. What is an answer for this question: Which country causes the entry into the sea of more potentially hazardous particles?","completion":"Based on the given background information, it can be inferred that Turkey, with its agriculture-based economy and extensive use of fertilizers, would likely contribute more to the entry of potentially hazardous particles into the sea as compared to Greece, whose economy is primarily driven by tourism. Agricultural activities, such as the application of chemical fertilizers and animal waste, can lead to the release of excess nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, into rivers that eventually flow into the sea. These excess nutrients contribute to a process called eutrophication, which in turn can cause the growth of algal blooms and the depletion of oxygen in the water, resulting in a \\"dead zone\\" where marine life can't survive. On the other hand, Greece's tourism-based economy might cause some marine pollution in the form of litter, specifically from tourist activities along the coastlines and beaches. Although this is an issue that should not be overlooked, the overall impact of tourism-related pollution on the marine environment is comparatively less than that caused by the agricultural activities of Turkey. Hence, in this particular scenario, it is more likely that Turkey contributes to a higher entry of potentially hazardous particles into the sea than Greece does. However, it is essential to acknowledge that both countries may have other pollution sources and that constant efforts should be made to minimize pollution and its effects on the marine environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was one of the founders of the Creation Research Society and the Institute for Creation Research . He is considered by many to be \`\` the father of modern creation science . '' He wrote numerous creationist and devotional books , and made regular television and radio appearances . As Morris believed in the inerrancy of the Bible , he opposed the billions - of - years time scales of evolution , the age of the Earth , and the age of the Universe that he saw as being contrary to it . Morris ' influential approach , while adopted widely by the modern creationist movement , continues to be rejected by the mainstream scientific community , as well as old Earth creationists and theistic evolutionists . - Linguistics is the scientific study of language, and involves an analysis of language form, language meaning, and language in context. The earliest activities in the documentation and description of language have been attributed to the 4th century BCE Indian grammarian Pini who wrote a formal description of the Sanskrit language in his \\"\\". - Dallas is a major city in the state of Texas and is the largest urban center of the fourth most populous metropolitan area in the United States. The city proper ranks ninth in the U.S. and third in Texas after Houston and San Antonio. The city's prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city is in Dallas County, of which it is the county seat; however, sections of the city are located in Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties. According to the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 1,197,816. The United States Census Bureau's estimate for the city's population increased to 1,300,092 as of July 1, 2015. - Evolutionary biology is the subfield of biology that studies the evolutionary processes that produced the diversity of life on Earth, starting from a single origin of life. These processes include natural selection, common descent, and speciation. - The Creation Research Society (CRS) is a Christian research group that engages in creation science. The organization has produced various publications, including a journal and a creation-based biology textbook. During the first few years of its existence, different beliefs about Creationism and disagreement over its statement of beliefs resulted in various members of the board and voting members being forced out of the organization. - Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, identification and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis. - The Institute for Creation Research (ICR) is a Creationist apologetics institute in Dallas, Texas that specializes in media promotion of pseudoscientific creation science and interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative as a historical event. The ICR adopts the Bible as an inerrant and literal documentary of scientific and historical fact as well as religious and moral truths, and espouses a Young Earth creationist worldview. It rejects evolutionary biology, which it views as a corrupting moral and social influence and threat to religious belief. The ICR was formed by Henry M. Morris in 1972 following an organizational split with the Creation Science Research Center (CSRC). - Creationism is the religious belief that the universe and life originated \\"from specific acts of divine creation,\\" as opposed to the scientific conclusion that they came about through natural processes. The first use of the term \\"creationist\\" to describe a proponent of creationism is found in an 1856 letter of Charles Darwin describing those who objected on religious grounds to the emerging science of evolution. - Creation science or scientific creationism is a branch of creationism that claims to provide scientific support for the Genesis creation narrative in the Book of Genesis and disprove or reexplain the scientific facts, theories and scientific paradigms about geology, cosmology, biological evolution, archeology, history, and linguistics. - Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. Evolutionary processes give rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organisation, including the levels of species, individual organisms, and molecules. - The Book of Genesis (from the Latin Vulgate, in turn borrowed or transliterated from Greek , meaning \\"origin\\" \\"Brš\\", \\"In [the] beginning\\") is the first book of the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) and the Christian Old Testament. - Geology (from the Ancient Greek , \\"g\\", i.e. \\"earth\\" and -o, \\"-logia\\", i.e. \\"study of, discourse\\") is an earth science comprising the study of solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change. Geology can also refer generally to the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet (such as the geology of the Moon or Mars). - The Genesis creation narrative is the creation myth of both Judaism and Christianity. It is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the first two chapters of the Book of Genesis. In the first Elohim, the Hebrew generic plural word for God, creates the heavens and the earth in six days, starting with light on the first day and ending with mankind on the sixth, then rests on, blesses and sanctifies the seventh. In the second story, God, now referred to by the personal name Yahweh, creates Adam, the first man, from dust and places him in the Garden of Eden, where he is given dominion over the animals. Eve, the first woman, is created from Adam's rib as a companion. - Cosmology (from the Greek , \\"kosmos\\" \\"world\\" and -, \\"-logia\\" \\"study of\\") is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.

Clint studied mantle melting, and his pal Uri decided to study other mantle related phenomena. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which researcher read less about adding water to the mantle? Hint: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.","completion":"Based on the information provided, Clint, who studied mantle melting, would have read more about adding water to the mantle. This is because mantle melting can come about through three ways, including adding water to the mantle (as mentioned in hint 3), which lowers the melting point. The addition of water leads to the formation of volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries along with the temperature increase of the subducting plate as it sinks into the hot mantle.

Premise: \\"The oldest and most authentic Yemenite restaurant in town, serving excellent mellawachs (pancakes).\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The best place to eat superb pancakes is at the oldest Yemenite restaurant.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, it can be concluded that the oldest and most authentic Yemenite restaurant in town serves excellent mellawachs (pancakes). However, claiming that it is the best place to eat superb pancakes warrants further examination. First, let's understand the premise in detail: 1. The Yemenite restaurant is the oldest in town: This means it has been in existence for a considerable period, which may hint at consistent quality, customer satisfaction, and a strong understanding of traditional Yemenite cuisine. This factor can contribute positively to the quality of pancakes served. 2. The restaurant is described as authentic: Authenticity suggests that the restaurant may adhere to traditional Yemenite cooking methods and ingredients, leading to a genuine and unique taste. This is an important aspect when considering the quality of pancakes since authentic Yemenite pancakes may be perceived as superior to hybrid or convenient adaptations of the dish. 3. The pancake, or mellawach, is described as excellent: In light of the premise, we can deduce that the mellawachs served at this particular restaurant are not only considered authentic Yemenite cuisine but also of high quality. Nevertheless, to affirm the hypothesis that \\"The best place to eat superb pancakes is at the oldest Yemenite restaurant,\\" several factors must be explored further: 1. Type of pancakes: The hypothesis refers to \\"pancakes\\" in general, encompassing a wide variety of types and styles of pancakes, such as American, French, and other nationalities' variations. However, Yemenite mellawachs represent a distinct type of pancake. Therefore, the hypothesis may not hold true for those seeking non-Yemenite pancake experiences. 2. Subjective tastes: Personal preferences and tastes can significantly determine the perception of \\"the best place to eat superb pancakes.\\" What one individual finds superb, another might not. Preferences can stem from factors like texture, flavor, and presentation, as well as dietary restrictions or cultural backgrounds. 3. Competition and local alternatives: The premise tells us that this restaurant is the oldest and most authentic Yemenite restaurant in town. It does not provide information on how many other Yemenite restaurants or pancake-serving establishments are within the vicinity. The quality and authenticity of these other establishments could be comparable or even superior to the mentioned Yemenite restaurant, depending on various factors such as ingredients, skilled chefs, and unique cooking methods. In conclusion, based on the premise, we can determine that the oldest and most authentic Yemenite restaurant in town serves excellent mellawachs. However, establishing the hypothesis \\"The best place to eat superb pancakes is at the oldest Yemenite restaurant\\" as true would require a more comprehensive analysis of personal tastes, different pancake variations, and competition from other establishments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Plans for a complete ban on catching wild salmon using coastal nets have been announced by the Scottish government.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Scottish Government Announces Complete Ban on Coastal Netting of Wild Salmon Introduction: The Scottish government has recently announced a comprehensive ban on the controversial practice of catching wild salmon using coastal nets. This policy comes as a response to concerns over the substantial decline in wild salmon populations and the potential long-term impact on ecosystems in the region. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind this decision and its possible effects on the fishing industry and the environment. Reason for the ban: The primary reason behind this ban is the dwindling numbers of wild salmon in Scottish waters. According to various studies, the wild salmon population has seen a significant decline in recent years, with numbers dropping by as much as 50% in some areas. This rapid decline has raised alarm among environmentalists and conservationists who believe that the overfishing and catching methods employed by the coastal netting industry contribute to the problem. Impact on the fishing industry: The ban on coastal netting is expected to have a substantial impact on the salmon fishing industry. Many fishermen rely on this method to catch wild salmon, which is an essential source of income for them and their families. However, the government has acknowledged the potential hardships that fishermen might face due to the ban and have promised to develop a compensation plan for those affected. Environmental benefits: Banning coastal netting will not only help in conserving the wild salmon population but will also have a positive impact on the overall ecosystem. As wild salmon are an essential part of the food chain, their diminished numbers affect other marine species and can potentially lead to the collapse of the entire aquatic system. By enforcing the ban, the Scottish government aims to improve the overall health of the marine environment and restore balance to the ecosystem. Potential challenges: While the ban serves as a positive step towards the conservation of wild salmon and the protection of vulnerable ecosystems, some challenges need to be addressed. It is crucial to monitor and enforce the ban effectively, as illegal fishing activities can still pose a threat to wild salmon populations. Moreover, the fishing industry must adapt to alternative methods that are more sustainable and less harmful to the environment. Conclusion: The decision of the Scottish government to ban coastal netting in an effort to conserve wild salmon populations is a commendable move. While there will be potential challenges and adjustments for the fishing industry, the long-term environmental benefits outweigh these initial difficulties. By taking this step, Scotland demonstrates a commitment to protecting its natural resources, preserving the marine environment, and ensuring a sustainable future for its fishing communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sentence: \\"David broke the window with a hammer.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"A linguist would most likely rate the sentence \\"David broke the window with a hammer.\\" to be acceptable linguistically. Let's delve into the various factors that contribute to this assessment, including syntax, semantics, and context. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence following the specific rules of a given language. The sentence \\"David broke the window with a hammer.\\" adheres to the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order that is commonly used in English. The subject is \\"David,\\" the verb/action is \\"broke,\\" and the object is \\"the window.\\" Additionally, the sentence includes a prepositional phrase \\"with a hammer\\" that gives more information about how the action was performed. This structure conforms to the syntactic rules of the English language, making the sentence acceptable. 2. Semantics: Semantics relates to the meaning of words and sentences in a language. In the given sentence, each word has a clear meaning and contributes to the overall message. \\"David\\" is a name that represents a person, \\"broke\\" conveys a sense of damage, \\"the window\\" refers to a specific object being affected, and \\"with a hammer\\" provides information about the tool used to perform the action. Together, these words create a coherent sentence that effectively communicates a comprehensible idea. 3. Context: A linguist would also evaluate the sentence based on its potential context. In this case, the sentence could easily fit into a narrative about an event that occurred, a description of a scene, or other related contexts. It provides a clear and concise piece of information that helps the reader understand an action that took place involving David and the window. Since the sentence is versatile and can easily be understood in various situational contexts, it is considered acceptable linguistically. 4. Morphology: Morphology pertains to the smallest units of meaning in a language, called morphemes. In \\"David broke the window with a hammer.\\", words form different morphemes: \\"David\\" is a single morpheme, \\"broke\\" is the past form of the verb \\"break\\" created by adding the morpheme \\"-d,\\" and \\"hammer\\" can be further divided into the base morpheme \\"hamm-\\" (tool part) and the \\"-er\\" morpheme indicating the one who uses a tool. The sentence adheres to morphological rules, as its components are combined correctly. 5. Multifaceted examination: A linguist doesn't solely focus on one aspect of language but rather examines its different components. The sentence \\"David broke the window with a hammer.\\" satisfies not only the syntactic and semantic perspectives, but it also maintains conciseness and clarity. Moreover, it respects the phonological (sound patterns) and pragmatic (appropriate use) rules of the English language. In conclusion, as the sentence maintains the syntactic, semantic, contextual, morphological, and multifaceted examination requirements, a linguist would indeed consider \\"David broke the window with a hammer.\\" an acceptable sentence linguistically."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Short movie review: the excruciating end Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"From the given information, it can be concluded that the critic had a negative perception of the movie. The title \\"The Excruciating End\\" suggests that the movie's end was extremely painful or uncomfortable to watch, indicating dissatisfaction. The word 'excruciating' itself has strong negative connotations and triggers a sense of displeasure or aversion. However, to give a complete analysis, it is essential to understand the critic's full opinion, including their thoughts on the plot, characters, and overall movie experience. A more thorough analysis of the critic's viewpoint might include evaluating their comments on the movie's storyline, pacing, character development, and production qualities such as cinematography, sound design, and acting performances. If the critic's issues are primarily focused on the ending, then it is possible that they found aspects of the movie enjoyable or engaging. However, an unsatisfactory or poorly executed conclusion can significantly impact a critic's overall rating, leaving them with a lasting impression of disappointment. For instance, the critic may have appreciated the movie's stunning visuals or engrossing performances from the lead actors but found the narrative resolution to be unsatisfying, rushed, or nonsensical. This could result in a negative review despite the positive aspects of the film. On the other hand, if the critic's assessment thoroughly critiques other aspects of the movie – such as a weak script, flat characters, or poor pacing – the title's emphasis on \\"The Excruciating End\\" would indicate that the movie's conclusion was an additional significant issue, reinforcing their adverse view of the film. In conclusion, the critic's title choice suggests that they had a negative opinion of the movie, mainly due to its ending. However, it is crucial to examine the full review to understand the extent of their dissatisfaction and the specific aspects of the movie that contributed to their negative impression. By doing so, we can more accurately evaluate the critic's perspective and determine whether it aligns with broader audience opinions or diverges from the general consensus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Magma rises from deep in the earth - The magma goes into volcanos - The volcanos pressure the magma upwards - The pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano - The lava cools - The lava forms new rock - New magma is pressured to the surface of the volcano - The volcano bursts through the rock the formed after the last eruption. Question: suppose freezing rain cools down the air happens, how will it affect lava stays at a lower temperature. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The process of a volcano going through an eruption cycle involves multiple stages: magma rising from deep within the earth goes into volcanoes, the immense pressure from the volcano forces the magma upwards, piercing through the surface and entering the atmosphere as lava. Subsequently, the lava cools and solidifies, forming new rock. A new batch of magma then rises, applying pressure to the surface of the volcano, and eventually bursting through the rock formed after the last eruption cycle. The question asks about the impact of an introduction of freezing rain, which would effectively lower the air temperature in the region, on the cooling process of the lava and how it would affect ensuing volcanic cycles. The answer to that is complex, as various factors are at play here. Predicting exactly what might happen can be challenging, but some educated speculations can be provided. The cooling of lava into rock is partially influenced by the rate at which heat can be removed from the lava flow. This is largely a function of the lava's surface area exposed to the cooling environment and the temperature differential between the molten rock and the surrounding air. If freezing rain were to occur, causing a drop in atmospheric temperature, this could theoretically cool the lava faster. The precipitation coming into contact with the lava would likely evaporate on contact and carry away additional heat, increasing the rate at which the lava loses its thermal energy. As a result, we would expect that, all else being equal, the lava would solidify more quickly. In terms of the second effect mentioned – new magma rising and putting pressure on the volcano’s surface – the impact of faster cooling above-ground lava is twofold and slightly contradictory. On one hand, if the lava hardens more quickly due to the cooling effect of the freezing rain, this could create a thicker and stronger layer of new rock on the surface in less time. This could potentially cause a greater resistance to the pressure from the new magma, delaying or even mitigating the subsequent eruption. In this sense, freezing rain could have a considerable \\"more effect\\" on the second phase mentioned. On the other hand, the speed of lava hardening does not necessarily affect the generation and movement of magma deep below the surface. These processes are driven by geological forces far beneath where surface temperatures can reach. Even if the lava at the surface cools faster, it may not significantly affect these deeper processes. Therefore, it could also be argued that freezing rain might cause \\"no effect\\" on the magma pressure build-up phase. In conclusion, while freezing rain and lower temperatures may increase the rate at which lava cools and hardens into new rock, its potential effect on the second phase of the volcanic cycle is ambiguous due to a plethora of factors, with some hinting at a greater effect and others suggesting no effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Recognize the severity of a collapsed vein. Ask a medical professional about supplements that may help. Anticipate medication or surgery. Article:","completion":"Title: Understanding Collapsed Veins: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatments Introduction Collapsed veins are a serious medical condition that can result in various health complications. It's important to recognize the severity of a collapsed vein and seek professional medical advice for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. This article will help you better understand the causes, symptoms, and treatment options for collapsed veins. Causes of Collapsed Veins Collapsed veins occur when the walls of a vein become weak and collapse under pressure. This can be caused by various factors such as: 1. Chronic use of intravenous (IV) drugs: Repeatedly injecting substances into the veins can damage and weaken the vein walls, leading to their collapse. 2. Trauma or injury: Accidents or surgical procedures that damage the veins can lead to their collapse. 3. Blood clot formation: Blood clots that block the flow of blood through a vein can cause the vein to collapse. 4. Infections: Infections in the bloodstream can weaken or inflame the vein walls, causing them to collapse. 5. Aging: As one ages, the strength and elasticity of the vein walls tend to decrease, increasing the chances of a collapse. Symptoms of Collapsed Veins Some common symptoms associated with collapsed veins are: 1. Pain and swelling in the affected area 2. Darkening of the skin (discoloration or bruising) 3. Difficulty drawing blood or inserting an IV 4. A lump or bulge along the vein 5. Warmth or tenderness around the affected vein When you recognize any of these symptoms, it is important to consult a medical professional to avoid further complications and receive appropriate treatment. Treatment and Prevention Collapsed veins may sometimes heal on their own, but in severe cases, medical intervention is necessary. Once you consult a medical professional, they may suggest various treatments, such as: 1. Supplements: Your doctor may recommend specific supplements that may help strengthen the veins and alleviate symptoms. 2. Medication: Medications may be prescribed to alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, or manage any underlying issues causing the collapse, such as blood clots or infections. 3. Surgery: In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to repair the damaged veins or remove any obstructions caused by blood clots. 4. Lifestyle changes: Adopting a healthy lifestyle, avoiding IV drug use, and exercising regularly can help prevent future problems with collapsed veins. Conclusion It is essential to recognize the severity of a collapsed vein and consult a medical professional immediately upon noticing symptoms. Early intervention and treatment can prevent further complications and help you maintain good vascular health. If you are concerned about your vein health, speak with your healthcare provider to discuss your options and the most suitable course of treatment for your individual case."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 1: What are some ways to lose weight fast? Question 2: What is the best way to be in a calorie deficit and lose weight successfully? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Although the core principle behind losing weight fast and being in a calorie deficit to lose weight successfully is the same, namely consuming fewer calories than you burn, the specific methods and approaches to achieve these goals could be different. Here is a detailed answer for both questions: Question 1: What are some ways to lose weight fast? 1. Intermittent fasting: Intermittent fasting entails alternating between periods of fasting and eating. Common patterns include the 16/8 method (eating within an 8-hour window and fasting for 16 hours) and the 5:2 method (consuming only 500-600 calories on two non-consecutive days per week). 2. High-intensity interval training (HIIT): HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief rest periods. This type of training is efficient, burns calories rapidly, and boosts metabolism even after the workout is over. 3. Reduce carbohydrate intake: Lowering your carb intake can induce ketosis, leading your body to burn fat as a primary fuel source. This can result in rapid weight loss, albeit some of it being water weight. 4. Increase protein consumption: Eating more protein can help you feel full longer, increase your metabolic rate, and reduce caloric intake. 5. Drink more water: Drinking water before meals can reduce appetite and help with portion control. Staying well-hydrated also supports metabolic processes in the body. 6. Eliminate added sugars and processed foods: Cutting out high-calorie, low-nutrient foods can help you reduce your overall caloric intake. 7. Get enough sleep: Poor sleep has been linked to weight gain and obesity. Ensure you get 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to support healthier weight loss. 8. Manage stress: High stress levels can contribute to weight gain due to increased cortisol production. Incorporate stress management techniques like meditation, deep breathing, and exercise to maintain a healthy weight. Question 2: What is the best way to be in a calorie deficit and lose weight successfully? 1. Calculate your calorie needs: Determine your daily caloric needs based on age, sex, height, weight, and activity level. This will help you establish the amount of calories you need to maintain your current weight. To create a calorie deficit, consume 500-1000 calories less than your maintenance level. 2. Consume nutrient-dense foods: Opt for whole, unprocessed foods that are high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, while low in calories. These include vegetables, lean protein sources, whole grains, and healthy fats. 3. Monitor portion sizes: Avoid overeating by using smaller plates, weighing your food, or utilizing portion control tools. 4. Regular exercise: Engage in both aerobic and resistance training for balanced weight loss and muscle strength. Aim to exercise at least 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75-150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, plus resistance training on at least two days per week. 5. Allow for flexibility: Understand that weight loss is a gradual process and slip-ups will occur. Embrace flexibility and don't be too hard on yourself. This helps to maintain motivation and encourages long-term adherence to healthier habits. 6. Set realistic goals: Aim to lose 1-2 pounds per week, which is considered safe and sustainable weight loss. 7. Get support: Share your goal with friends, family, or an online support group. Having a support network can help keep you motivated and accountable. While both questions involve weight loss through calorie reduction, the approaches can be different. Losing weight fast might include more aggressive measures, while adopting a calorie deficit is typically associated with a more gradual, sustainable process. It is essential to consult a medical professional or registered dietitian before beginning any weight loss plan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Hugo Christiaan Hamaker ( 23 March 1905 , Broek op Langedijk , North Holland -- 7 September 1993 , Eindhoven ) was a Dutch scientist , who was responsible for the Hamaker theory which explains the van der Waals forces between objects larger than molecules . His 1937 paper was heavily cited . He completed his doctorate at the Universiteit Utrecht in 1934 . His dissertation was labelled : Reflectivity and Emissivity of Tungsten ; with a Description of a New Method to Determine the Total Reflectivity of Any Surface in a Simple and Accurate Way . His adviser was Leonard Ornstein . From 1934 to 1967 he was employed in the Physical Laboratory of Philips in Eindhoven , and from 1960 to 1972 he was Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology . - After the explanation of van der Waals forces by Fritz London several scientists soon realised that his definition could be extended from the interaction of two molecules with induced dipoles to macro-scale objects by summing all of the forces between the molecules in each of the bodies involved. The theory is named after H. C. Hamaker who derived the interaction between two spheres, a sphere and a wall, and presented a general discussion in a heavily cited 1937 paper. - A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term \\"molecule\\" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - The Dommel is a stream in Belgium and the Netherlands, left tributary of the Dieze. It rises in north-eastern Belgium near Peer and flows into the southern part of the Netherlands. The Dommel takes in water from the Keersop, Tongelreep, Run, Gender and Kleine Dommel streams and merges at 's-Hertogenbosch with the Aa stream to form river Dieze, which subsequently flows towards the Meuse. The main cities and towns along the Dommel's course are Peer, Neerpelt, Valkenswaard, Dommelen, Eindhoven, Son en Breugel, Sint-Oedenrode, Boxtel, Sint-Michielsgestel and 's-Hertogenbosch. The most original part and natural state of the Dommel can be found between Eindhoven and Boxtel. Here the Dommel has still its original winds and meanders and forms a cultural-historical and valuable landscape area called the Dommelbeemden. - Fritz Wolfgang London (March 7, 1900 March 30, 1954) was a Jewish-German physicist and professor at Duke University. His fundamental contributions to the theories of chemical bonding and of intermolecular forces (London dispersion forces) are today considered classic and are discussed in standard textbooks of physical chemistry. With his brother Heinz London, he made a significant contribution to understanding electromagnetic properties of superconductors with the London equations and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on five separate occasions. - Friesland (official) or Frisia is a province in the northwest of the Netherlands. It is situated west of Groningen, northwest of Drenthe and Overijssel, north of Flevoland, northeast of North Holland, and south of the North Sea. In 2010, the province had a population of 646,000 and a total area of . - Broek op Langedijk (West Frisian: \\"Broek op Lengedìk\\") is a town in the Netherlands, located in the municipality of Langedijk in the province of North Holland. - North Holland (, West Frisian: \\"Noard-Holland\\") is a province in the northwest of the Netherlands. It is situated on the North Sea, north of South Holland and Utrecht, and west of Friesland and Flevoland. As of 2015, it has a population of 2,762,163 and a total area of . - In physical chemistry, the van der Waals forces (or van der Waals interaction), named after Dutch scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals, are the residual attractive or repulsive forces between molecules or atomic groups that do not arise from covalent bonds, nor ionic bonds. It can be shown that van der Waals forces are of the same origin as the Casimir effect, arising from quantum interactions with the zero-point field. The resulting van der Waals forces can be attractive or repulsive. - Eindhoven is a municipality and a city in the south of the Netherlands, originally at the confluence of the Dommel and Gender streams. The Gender was dammed short of the city centre in the 1950s and the Dommel still runs through the city. The city has a population of 223,220 in January 2015, making it the fifth-largest municipality of the Netherlands and the largest in the province of North Brabant. - Noord Brabant, also unofficially called Brabant, is a province in the south of the Netherlands. It borders the provinces of South Holland and Gelderland to the north, Limburg to the east, Zeeland to the west, and the Belgian provinces of Antwerp and Limburg to the south. The northern border follows the Meuse (Maas) river westward to its mouth in the Hollands Diep strait, part of the RhineMeuseScheldt delta. History. The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands. Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794. - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\".

Indigenous peoples of Mexico (Spanish: pueblos indigenas de Mexico), Native Mexicans (Spanish: nativos mexicanos), or Mexican Native Americans (Spanish: nativo america mexicanos), are those who are part of communities that trace their roots back to populations and communities that existed in what is now Mexico prior to the arrival of Europeans. According to the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (Comision Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indigenas, or CDI in Spanish) and the INEGI (official census institute), in 2015, 25,694,928 people in Mexico self-identify as being indigenous of many different ethnic groups, which constitute 21.5% of Mexico's population. According to the National Commission for the Development of the Indigenous Peoples (CDI), there were 25,694,928 indigenous people reported in Mexico in 2015, which constitutes 21.5% of the population of Mexico. This is a significant increase from the 2010 census, in which indigenous Mexicans accounted for 14.9% of the population, and numbered 15,700,000 Most indigenous communities have a degree of financial, political autonomy under the legislation of \\"usos y costumbres\\", which allows them to regulate internal issues under customary law. The indigenous population of Mexico has in recent decades increased both in absolute numbers as-well as a percentage of the population. This is largely due to increased self-identification as indigenous, as-well as indigenous women having higher birth rates as compared to the Mexican average. Indigenous peoples are more likely to live in more rural areas, than the Mexican average, but many do reside in urban or suburban areas, particularly, in the central states of Mexico, Puebla, Tlaxcala, the Federal District and the Yucatan Peninsula. According to the CDI, the states with the greatest percentage of indigenous population are: Yucatan, with 65.40%, Quintana Roo with 44.44% and Campeche with 44.54% of the population being indigenous, most of them Maya; Oaxaca with 65.73% of the population, the most numerous groups being the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples; Chiapas has 36.15%, the majority being Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya; Hidalgo with 36.21%, the majority being Otomi; Puebla with 35.28%, and Guerrero with 33.92%, mostly Nahua people and the states of San Luis Potosi and Veracruz both home to a population of 19% indigenous people, mostly from the Totonac, Nahua and Teenek (Huastec) groups.

Answer:","completion":"The emotions of an individual can greatly vary depending on various factors, including their relationship to the subject and the circumstances surrounding the situation. However, since the context isn't fully explained, I'll consider a few possible scenarios. 1. If Aubrey and Robin are inanimate objects or collectables (like dolls, toys, etc.), Aubrey might not have any specific feeling unless these items held sentimental value. If they did, Aubrey might feel a degree of sadness or regret after selling Robin. 2. If Robin is a pet and Aubrey is a person, Aubrey might feel guilty or sad, especially knowing she sold Robin to a 'mean old man'. This situation could lead Aubrey to worry about Robin's welfare. 3. If Robin is a character in a digital medium (like a video game character), Aubrey might feel a sense of accomplishment or profit, especially if the sale was beneficial. However, knowing the buyer's 'mean' personality might create feelings of regret or worry. In all scenarios, any feelings Aubrey might have would be dependent on their personality, their attachment to Robin, and their sensitivity to the perceived personality of the buyer. If Aubrey is typically empathetic and caring, knowing the buyer is 'mean' might create stronger negative emotions than if Aubrey is generally unemotional or motivated primarily by profit."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: A group of islands, such as the Galapagos are generally called a? Context: Scientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to laws of nature, but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague \\"law of development\\" of Vestiges had not found scientific favour. Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection.

According to Harrison, they had always agreed that if one of them was not in the band, the others would never replace them and, \\"... go out as the Beatles\\", and that the \\"only other person that could be in it was John.\\" McCartney then asked Ono if she had any unreleased recordings by Lennon, so she sent him cassette tapes of four songs. \\"Free as a Bird\\" was recorded by Lennon in 1977, in his and Ono's Dakota building apartment in New York City, but was not complete. Lennon introduced the song on the cassette by imitating a New York accent and saying, \\"Free--as a boid\\" (bird). The other songs were \\"Grow Old With Me\\", \\"Real Love\\", and \\"Now and Then\\". Ono says that it was Harrison and former Beatles road manager Neil Aspinall who initially asked her about the concept of adding vocals and instrumentation to Lennon's demo tapes. Ono stated: \\"People have said it was all agreed when Paul came over to New York to induct John into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but it was all settled before then. I just used that occasion to hand over the tapes personally to Paul.\\" McCartney went to Ono's home after the induction ceremony at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to listen to, and receive, the Lennon demo tapes; he recalls the meeting with Ono: She was there with Sean ... and she played us a couple of tracks. There were two newies on mono cassettes which he did at home ... [s]o I checked it out with Sean, because I didn't want him to have a problem with it. He said, \\"Well, it'll be weird hearing a dead guy on lead vocal. But give it a try.\\" I said to them both, \\"If it doesn't work out, you can veto it.\\" When I told George and Ringo I'd agreed to that they were going, \\"What? What if we love it?\\" It didn't come to that, luckily. I said to Yoko, \\"Don't impose too many conditions on us, it's really difficult to do this, spiritually. We don't know, we may hate each other after two hours in the studio and just walk out. So don't put any conditions, it's tough enough.\\" During an interview for the Anthology project, McCartney revealed that he was surprised to learn that Lennon's demos of \\"Grow Old With Me\\" and \\"Real Love\\" had already been released and were well known by Lennon fans. Starr admitted that when he first listened to the recording he found it very emotional.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Process: - Wind and water erode rocks - The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks - Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice - Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times - The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time - The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment - The sediment becomes sedimentary rock as it is pushed together by the heavy weight - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the climate changes happens, how will it affect MORE sedimentary rock forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this context, suggests that climate change could have a potential impact on the process of sedimentary rock formation. Climate change may affect the process both directly and indirectly through various mechanisms, ultimately influencing the amount and characteristics of sedimentary rocks. 1. Direct effects on erosion: Climate change can significantly alter patterns of precipitation, temperature, and storm frequency. Increased precipitation, for example, can lead to enhanced erosion rates, resulting in more sediment being detached from rocks and transported to new locations. Warmer temperatures can also cause permafrost to melt, releasing large amounts of previously trapped sediments. Additionally, more intense and frequent storms can increase erosion caused by wind and water, further contributing to sediment transport. 2. Indirect effects on erosion: Climate change can also indirectly affect erosion and sediment transport through its impact on vegetation. Warmer temperatures may lead to the migration or extinction of certain plant species which have the potential to destabilize landscapes. This destabilization could ultimately result in increased erosion rates. 3. Sediment transport and deposition: Climate change can also influence sediment transport rates and deposition. As precipitation patterns shift, so too does the movement of water carrying sediment. This shift in water availability can change the locations and rates of sediment deposition. For instance, decreased river flow may result in less sediment being carried and deposited downstream, while increased river flow could lead to greater sediment deposition in existing areas. Furthermore, rising sea levels caused by global warming may create new areas for sedimentary rock formation. 4. Rate of compaction and lithification: The rate at which sediment becomes sedimentary rock may also be affected by climate change. In colder climates, compaction of sediment may occur at a slower rate due to extended periods of freezing conditions. However, as temperatures rise, this process could be accelerated, allowing for faster sediment compaction and lithification, ultimately leading to the formation of sedimentary rocks. 5. Changes in sediment composition: Climate change can also impact the composition of sediments and, consequently, the types of sedimentary rocks that form. Increased weathering and erosion will lead to an increased input of weathered material into the sedimentary system. Because minerals with certain properties may be more susceptible to weathering, this could cause changes in sediment mineralogy and impact the chemical composition of sedimentary rocks over time. In conclusion, climate change has the potential to significantly impact the formation of sedimentary rocks, both directly and indirectly. This can result in changes to erosion rates, sediment transport and deposition, lithification, and the chemical composition of sediments. Understanding these implications is essential for the comprehensive study of Earth's past and present processes and predicting future geological transformations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Question: Many random citizens would use an entrance hall to enter this sort of building. What is it? Choices: - school - public building - large building - auditorum - convention center The rationale to choose \\"public building\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"The answer \\"public building\\" is the most appropriate choice among the options provided because it best suits the description given in the question. An entrance hall typically refers to a larger, open space where people can enter and exit a building, and it often serves as a welcoming and transitional area for visitors. While all the other options (school, large building, auditorium, and convention center) may have entrance halls, they are more specific types of buildings and do not encapsulate the wide range of possibilities that the term \\"public building\\" encompasses. The rationale for choosing \\"public building\\" is based on the following points: 1. Inclusiveness: Public buildings can include a variety of structures such as schools, government offices, libraries, museums, and other spaces that are accessible to the general public. By choosing \\"public building,\\" we acknowledge that an entrance hall could be a part of multiple types of buildings that are open and accessible to random citizens. 2. Accessibility: Public buildings are typically designed to allow easy access for all members of the community, and an entrance hall can often be a prominent feature to facilitate this access. The statement \\"Many random citizens would use an entrance hall to enter this sort of building\\" implies that the building should accommodate a diverse group of people, which is the primary purpose of a public building. 3. Cultural and social significance: Public buildings hold significant importance in communities as they offer services and spaces where individuals can come together, learn, and access resources. An entrance hall in a public building sets the tone for the building's purpose and creates an inviting atmosphere for the random citizens that visit. In summary, the answer \\"public building\\" is the best choice considering the question's context and the wide range of structures it can refer to. This choice effectively captures the essence of a space that is accessible, welcoming, and frequently visited by random citizens."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Scott Pruitt Declares War on Wind and Solar Energy While Fossil Fuels Get Billions in Subsidies Scott Pruitt speaking at the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor Maryland on February 25 2017. Photo Credit: Gage Skidmore/Flickr Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt recently proposed eliminating federal tax credits for wind and solar power arguing that they should âstand on their own and compete against coal and natural gas and other sourcesâ as opposed to âbeing propped up by tax incentives and other types of credits....â Stand on their own? Pruitt surely must be aware that fossil fuels have been feasting at the government trough for at least 100 years. Renewables by comparison have received support only since the mid-1990s and until recently have had to subsist on scraps. Perhaps a review of the facts can set Administrator Pruitt straight. Thereâs a strong case to be made that Congress should terminate subsidies for fossil fuels and extend them for renewables not the other way around. A new study by Oil Change International brings us up-to-date. Published earlier this month it found that federal subsidies in 2015 and 2016 averaged 10.9 billion a year for the oil and gas industry and 3.8 billion for the coal industry. By contrast the wind industryâs so-called production tax credit renewed by Congress in December 2015 amounted to 3.3 billion last year according to a Congress Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate. Unlike the fossil fuel industryâs permanent subsidies Congress has allowed the wind tax credit to expire six times in the last 20 years and it is now set to decline incrementally until ending in 2020. Similarly Congress fixed the solar industryâs investment tax credit at 30 percent of a projectâs cost through 2019 but reduced it to 10 percent for commercial projects and zeroed it out for residences by the end of 2021. The JCT estimates that the solar credit amounted to a 2.4-billion tax break last year. Totaling it up fossil fuels â at 14.7 billion â still received two-and-a-half times more in federal support than solar and wind in 2016.","completion":"The task asks you to verify if the given sentiment towards an entity in the document is correct or not.

Write highlights for this article: Wayne Rooney's 74th minute free-kick ensured England beat Estonia 1-0 to top Group E. Here, Sportsmail gives you a round-up of the other Euro 2016 qualifying matches from around Europe. Alexandru Epureanu's header earned Moldova a surprise 1-1 draw with Russia in Moscow, paving the way for Austria to take the top spot in their European Championship qualifying group. Russia struggled to break down a dogged Moldovan defence until the 73rd minute, when Artyom Dzyuba earned and converted a penalty following a foul by Victor Golovatenco. Moldova responded within seconds of the restart as Epureanu headed home from Alexander Dedov's corner. Russia suffered a disappointing 1-1 draw with Moldova, with Austria moving above them in the group. Rubin Okotie scored the only goal of the game as Austria beat Montenegro 1-0 in Vienna. Estonia 0-1 England. Austria 1- Montenegro. Russia 1-1 Moldova. Ukraine 1-0 Macedonia. Belarus 1-3 Slovakia. Lithuania 0-2 Slovenia. Luxembourg 0-4 Spain. Sweden 2-0 Lichtenstein. Midfielder Serhiy Sydorchuk scored on his full international debut to help Ukraine edge Macedonia 1-0 in their Euro 2016 Group C qualifier. Sydorchuk, on target as a substitute in the 2-0 win away to neighbours Belarus on Thursday, finished off a swift counter-attack in added time at the end of the first half. The speedy Evgeny Konoplyanka created the goal with a cross to the far post with Sydorchuk arriving to fire in from close range. In Vienna, the Pakistan-born, half-Nigerian Rubin Okotie's 24th-minute goal won the game for Austria against a flat Montenegro side. Montenegro went into the qualifying group with hopes of reaching Euro 2016, but had already been struggling after an opening win over Moldova was followed with a goalless draw against Liechtenstein last week. Ukraine's players head back to their own half after celebrating Serhiy Sydorchuk's goal. Diego Costa fluffed his lines in the first half, but the Chelsea forward did eventually get on the scoresheet. Diego Costa ended his long international scoring drought with the third goal in an uninspiring 4-0 win for Spain away to minnows Luxembourg in Euro 2016 qualifying Group C on Sunday. Brazil-born Costa had failed to find the net for his adopted country in six previous appearances but broke a duck lasting more than 500 minutes when he netted from close range in the 69th minute in a rain-lashed Luxembourg City. David Silva opened the scoring in the 27th minute with a fine long-range strike and set up Paco Alcacer to make it 2-0 three minutes before half time. Substitute Juan Bernat added the fourth two minute from the end. Without captain Zlatan Ibrahimovic for a second straight game, Sweden struggled to convert their chances but still beat Liechtenstein 2-0 in their Group G Euro 2016 qualifier at the Friends Arena on Sunday. Jimmy Durmaz pokes the ball past Lichtenstein goalkeeper Daniel Kaufmann to put Sweden 2-0 up. Slovenia's players celebrate after scoring; Lithuania,though, remain second in the group. Erkan Zengin broke the deadlock after 34 minutes with his second goal in three qualifying games, his thumping shot taking a deflection off a defender and looping over the goalkeeper into the net. Jimmy Durmaz doubled Sweden's advantage in the first minute of the second half, stabbing the ball home from close range after Bicer horribly sliced a left-footed clearance into his path. Slovakia followed up their impressive victory over Spain with a 3-1 win over Belarus. Napoli midfielder Marik Hamsik scored a brace for the visitors, while Stanislav Sestak added a third. Timofei Kalachev scored the hosts' only goal. Milivoje Novakovic scored the winning goal on Thursday for Slovenia, and the veteran forward continued his impressive form by grabbing a brace to help the visitors beat Lithuania 2-0. The win draws Slovenia level on points with Lithuania as they climb up to second in Group E. Napoli midfielder Marik Hamsik celebrates after scoring Slovakia's opening goal against Belarus. Highlights:","completion":"- Wayne Rooney's 74th-minute free-kick led England to a 1-0 victory over Estonia, topping Group E in the Euro 2016 qualifiers. - Moldova managed a surprise 1-1 draw with Russia, thanks to Alexandru Epureanu's header.

Is the review positive or negative? A:","completion":"The review provided appears to be primarily negative. The reviewer acknowledges a few positive aspects of Alicia Keys' work, such as her being pretty and having a pretty voice, as well as her talent in playing multiple instruments. However, the majority of the commentary highlights the shortcomings of the album. Firstly, the reviewer seems unimpressed by the label of \\"neo classic soul\\" and appears to find the songwriting lacking. The reviewer suggests that the album could have been improved with the input of more experienced songwriters and instrumentalists, implying that the current state of the music is subpar. Secondly, though the reviewer states not being a fan of \\"Falling,\\" they do mention enjoying \\"Butterflies.\\" However, this single positive note does not seem to outweigh the overall disappointment expressed in the other aspects of the review. Lastly, the reviewer criticizes the originality of the album, feeling that sampling a classical piece and adding beats does not make it original or creative. The comparison to India Irie or Jill Scott's little sister indicates that the reviewer sees Alicia Keys' work as an imitation or lesser version of other artists in the genre. In summary, the review leans more towards being negative due to the several criticisms about songwriting, originality, and the need for more experienced input. Although there are a few compliments mentioned, they are not strong enough to counterbalance the overall negativity of the review."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Edward Nicholas Anderson (November 11, 1900 - April 24, 1974) was an American football player and coach of football and basketball. He served as the head football coach at Columbia College in Dubuque, Iowa, now known as Loras College (1922-1924), DePaul University (1925-1931), the College of the Holy Cross (1933-1938, 1950-1964), and the University of Iowa (1939-1942, 1946-1949), compiling a career college football record of 201-128-15. Anderson was also the head basketball coach at DePaul from 1925 to 1929, tallying a mark of 25-21. Anderson played professional football in the National Football League (NFL) for the Rochester Jeffersons in 1922 and the Chicago Cardinals from 1922 to 1925. Context: By the time Anderson had returned from the service, Iowa football was again in the cellar of the Big Ten. Before the 1946 season, Anderson was hospitalized for 19 days with a parasite infection. He returned to lead Iowa to four wins in their first five games, which was as many wins as Iowa had during his three-year absence. Still, Iowa slumped to a 5-4 final record, leading two former players to write a scathing editorial about Anderson. The editorial asked, \\"How long will Dr. Anderson ride on the laurels that Nile Kinnick won for him?\\" In 1947, a 2-2-1 start was followed by three straight losses. One day before Iowa's final game at Minnesota, Anderson submitted his resignation at Iowa, citing \\"considerable loose talk\\" among Iowa fans as one reason. The Hawkeye football team responded with a powerful effort against Minnesota, defeating the Gophers, 13-7. Fans begged Anderson to reconsider, and the Iowa athletic board denied his resignation, promising him a larger coaching staff and other football improvement s. Anderson decided to stay, saying, \\"I'm glad we got things straightened out.\\" Anderson used his larger coaching staff to hire Leonard Raffensperger as the head of the freshman team. After two more average seasons in 1948 and 1949, Anderson was approached again by Holy Cross, which now had a coaching vacancy. Ohio State made a rare concession and offered their football coach faculty tenure, so Anderson made the same request to Iowa athletic director Paul Brechler. Brechler could not promise Anderson anything, so Anderson resigned and took the head coaching position at Holy Cross. He had a 35-33-2 record in eight years at Iowa.

Let me share my dismay with the visit to (insert business name) so that you may find a better place to spend your hard-earned money and precious time. Let me start by addressing the ambiance or rather how it lacks anything remotely inviting. Upon entering, I was greeted by dull, lifeless walls, aged and unkempt furniture that produced an uneasy creak with every use, and glaring fluorescent lighting that only worsened the environment. The decor seemed to be competing in a battle of mediocrity, and this unsettling atmosphere did not change during my entire time there. As I held out hope that perhaps the service could compensate for the disappointing environment, I was met with unenthusiastic and unprofessional staff members who seemed not just uninterested but completely oblivious to customers' needs. I couldn't help but wonder if our invisible cloaks had somehow been activated as we were left unattended for an agonizingly long time in the waiting area. Once finally ushered to our table, hidden frustrations were beginning to mount – and yet, could it get worse? Regrettably. My friends and I placed our orders and thus began our seemingly endless wait for the food, our only solace being the sweet illusion that a delightful meal could somewhat save this disastrous experience. Our illusion was shattered by the mediocre cuisine that was presented almost an eternity later. Not only did the presentation resemble a battlefield of poorly assembled ingredients, but the taste also left a lot to be desired. The lack of freshness was evident, questioning the integrity of the kitchen. I have tasted bland dishes in my life, but their flavorless concoctions took the prize. Moreover, the inaccuracy in some of the orders added insult to injury, and even polite requests for corrections were met with more lackluster enthusiasm from the staff. No amount of optimism could salvage the experience after the culinary fiasco, and to add a cherry on top, the excessive and unjustifiable bill served as the ultimate gut-punch. There was barely an attempt to interact, address concerns, or even just smile from the staff throughout our ordeal. After this unforgettable and disappointing encounter, determined by the lifeless atmosphere, barely-present service, and tasteless cuisine, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend (insert business name) to others. There are plenty of other alternatives to explore, where you can indulge yourself in extraordinary culinary adventures, without feeling like dementors have sucked all the joy out of your day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What does the chief of Tahiti convince the HMS Bounty's captain to do? from the following article ? One night in Portsmouth, England in 1787, a press gang breaks into a local tavern and presses all of the men drinking there into naval service. One of the men inquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him that it is HMS Bounty. Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is William Bligh and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The Bounty leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. Fletcher Christian, the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian. During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of Tahiti, where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take to the West Indies, as intended, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island, living with the island chief, Hitihiti, and his daughter, Tehani, and compiling an English dictionary of the Tahitian language. Hitihiti persuades Bligh to allow Christian a day pass on the island. Bligh agrees but quickly repeals the pass out of spite. Christian disregards the order and spends his one-day off the ship romancing a Tahitian girl, Maimiti. Christian promises her he will be back someday.

Generally, you can use short journal articles or webpages for a shorter paper. For a longer paper, you'll likely need to look at books and longer scholarly articles. While the requirements differ based on your assignment and the topic you're researching, you may find these guidelines helpful: 1- to 2-page paper: 2 to 3 webpages or short journal articles 3- to 5-page paper: 4 to 8 journal or scholarly articles, webpages, or books 5- to 10-page paper: 6 to 15 journal or scholarly articles, webpages, or books 10- to 15-page paper: 12 to 20 journal or scholarly articles, webpages, or books The success of your research depends on searching the right keywords, especially in its initial stages. Brainstorm a list of keywords, including synonyms.

Take advantage of academic databases available online through your school in addition to the internet. The letters stand for Currency, Reliability, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose/Point of view. This method provides you an easy way to quickly and uniformly evaluate the quality of potential sources you find by asking specific questions about the source: Currency: How recent is the information? When was the source last updated? Reliability: Are there references for facts and data? Is the content mostly opinion? Authority: Who is the creator of the content? Who is the publisher? Are they biased in any way? Does the creator have academic credentials in the field? Accuracy: Has the content been peer-reviewed or edited by a third party? Is information supported by evidence? Can you easily verify facts in another source? Purpose/Point of view: Is the content intended to teach you something or to sell you something? Is the information presented biased? When you find a good source for your topic, chances are that source cites other valuable sources that you can look up. The biggest benefit of this is that you don't have to do as much work evaluating the quality of these sources – the author of the source that cited them has already done that for you. If an author mentions a particular source more than once, you definitely want to read that material. The reference list typically contains enough information for you to find the source on your own. If you find that you can't access the source, for example, because it's behind a paywall, talk to your school or a public librarian about it. They may be able to get you access.

Include the page numbers (if applicable) that you would use in your citation. If you copy something directly from the source, put quote marks around those words and write the page number (if applicable) where that quote appears.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Cake (stylized CAKE) is an American alternative rock band from Sacramento, California, consisting of singer John McCrea, trumpeter Vince DiFiore, guitarist Xan McCurdy, bassist Daniel McCallum and drummer Todd Roper. The band has been noted for McCrea's sarcastic lyrics and monotone vocals, and their wide-ranging musical influences, including country music, Mariachi, rock, funk, Iranian folk music and hip hop. Cake was formed in 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, Greg Brown (guitar), Frank French (drums) and Shon Meckfessel (bass), who soon left and was replaced by Gabe Nelson. Following the self-release of its debut album, Motorcade of Generosity, the band was signed to Capricorn Records in 1995 and released its first single, \\"Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle\\", which hit number 35 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani. Cake's fifth album, Pressure Chief, was recorded in June 2004 in a converted house in Sacramento; the album was again released on Columbia Records. Before its official release date on October 5, the band played at the Austin City Limits Music Festival and KBCO's World Class Rockfest. The album was also preceded by its first single, \\"No Phone\\", which hit number 13 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart; the song covered the ubiquitous and privacy-invading use of cell phones, and was described by Jeremy Mahadevan of the New Straits Times as \\"a traditionally minimalist Cake anthem, with a killer melody and, unique to this album, fairly extensive use of synths\\". A second single, \\"Wheels\\", was also released but failed to chart. Pressure Chief itself hit number 17 on the Billboard top 200, spending 7 weeks in the charts, and received mixed reviews from critics. Although it was acknowledged as a continuation of their old work, albeit with an increased use of synthesisers, Sam Spies of the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that \\"the experiments in style that made Cake fun to listen to have all but disappeared from 'Pressure Chief' ... What's left is mostly uninspired, so-called alternative rock\\", and Graeme Hammond of the Sunday Herald Sun wrote that \\"the melodies are listless, the album bereft of anything with the verve of Short Skirt/Long Jacket or Comfort Eagle\\". Other critics were more generous; Doug Elfman of the Las Vegas Review-Journal called it \\"another great and bizarre, twangy album of alternative-singer-songwriting stories about cars and horrible relationships\\", while a reviewer in the New Straits Times noted its \\"smart, subtly dissident, and always catchy pop\\". Following Pressure Chief's release, the band toured North America, playing in cities including Albany, New York, and Montreal. A second tour, in 2005, saw the band headline the 20-city Virgin College Mega Tour, playing alongside Gomez; while the Tour was in California, the band announced that it had been dropped from Columbia Records. This was followed by a tour of Europe, as well as concerts in Australia and Jakarta, along with a 2006 repeat of the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, featuring Cake, Tegan and Sara and Gogol Bordello. Cake later formed its own label, Upbeat Records, which allowed the band to release the compilation album B-Sides and Rarities on August 14, 2007. This was followed by a series of concerts, including at the IndigO2 in London, and a performance in Anchorage, Alaska. Reviews of B-Sides and Rarities were generally good; Devin Grant of The Post and Courier wrote that \\"For an album full of odds and ends, this Cake release is every bit as good, and every bit as fun, as the band's previous studio releases\\", while Catherine P. Lewis of The Washington Post noted that, although several live tracks reduced the album's strength, \\"there are still enough charming nuggets to make this album less disposable than the typical rarities compilation\\".

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the producer who provided the studio where the band that rehearsed in a deconsecrated church recorded their first single? from the following article ? In January 1980, Michael Stipe met Peter Buck in Wuxtry Records, the Athens record store where Buck worked. The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and the Velvet Underground. Stipe said, \\"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \\"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting The Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers. After considering Twisted Kites, Cans of Piss, and Negro Eyes, the band settled on \\"R.E.M.\\" (which is an acronym for rapid eye movement, the dream stage of sleep), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.The band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt, and lived on a food allowance of 2 each per day.During April 1981, R.E.M. recorded its first single, \\"Radio Free Europe\\", at producer Mitch Easter's Drive-In...

Pedro Hernandez, from New Jersey, appeared in court today, where his lawyer asked that he be released from jail immediately due to the slow-moving case and lack of evidence against his client. But the prosecution asked that this request be denied, reminding the court: 'Let's remember he killed a six-year-old child.'

Hernandez has entered a not guilty plea in the case. Etan vanished on May 25, 1979. The anniversary was later named National Missing Children's Day in his memory. He became one of the first vanished children pictured on a milk carton. Hernandez was arrested last May after. police got a tip that he'd told people years before that he had killed a. child in New York City.

Washington (CNN) -- Human rights groups met a somewhat skeptical Supreme Court on Tuesday as they presented arguments on whether foreign victims of torture and other crimes against humanity can sue corporations and other organizations in U.S. federal courts. The cases argued could have enormous global impact from a moral, political, and financial perspective. At issue is the scope of two federal laws that are increasingly being used in an effort to hold businesses accountable for human rights atrocities committed overseas. Two separate civil cases before the high court involve Nigerian political activists claiming foreign oil companies were complicit in violent abuse at the hands of the country's military; and an American family alleging their father was tortured and killed while in the custody of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation Organization. \\"The principle that here would apply is Pirates Inc.

Get any needed sheets, blankets, and medical documents on top of the wound, including medical licenses and hospital records. For cpr and first aid, place such documents into a freezer bag or waterproof container..","completion":"First, let me outline the steps to dress a chest wound, and then I will discuss the available options you mentioned. 1. Assess the situation: Ensure your own safety and that of the patient. Make sure there are no hazards in the area that could cause further injury. 2. Call emergency services: As you mentioned, calling for professional help is crucial. If you can, provide them with details about the nature of the injury, the patient's condition, and your location. 3. Expose the wound: Remove any clothing around the chest wound to get a clear view of the injury. Be gentle as you do this and make sure not to cause any further damage. 4. Seal the wound: Use a sterile occlusive dressing or any available clean, non-porous material to cover the chest wound. This helps prevent air from entering the wound, which can worsen the injury. 5. Secure the dressing: Tape the dressing in place, leaving one corner slightly untaped to allow air to escape if necessary. This is known as a three-sided seal. 6. Monitor the patient: Keep the patient comfortable and still, if possible, elevate the head to ease breathing. Continuously check for any changes in the patient's condition, such as difficulty breathing or a weak, rapid pulse. 7. Provide additional care as needed: If the patient loses consciousness or stops breathing, begin CPR. Now, let's discuss the options you provided: a) Providing antibiotics and fluids can be helpful, but these are treatments that should be administered by medical professionals once they arrive on the scene. Your priority is to control immediate bleeding and dress the wound. b) Calling emergency services is indeed a crucial step. The sooner you do this, the better the chances of survival for the patient. c) Once again, calling 911 and getting professional help as quickly as possible is essential. Keeping the patient still, sealing, and stopping the bleeding are top priorities. d) While it's important to have relevant documents available for emergency personnel, your priority should be addressing the chest wound. Be prepared to provide any pertinent medical information when asked, but make sure you're attending to the wound first. Remember that dressing a chest wound is a first-aid measure that buys time until medical help arrives. While the above steps are important, nothing can replace professional care from medical personnel in such situations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was easier to calculate the taxes for the diner than for the store because the Pick your answer from: +store was a bigger business. +diner was a bigger business.","completion":"It was easier to calculate the taxes for the diner than for the store because the store was a bigger business. The store's expansive product line and higher volume of transactions, along with its more complex supply chain and extensive inventory, meant that the accounting and tracking of different tax liabilities became a more intricate and time-consuming process. On the other hand, the diner, being a smaller business, operated with a lesser number of taxable transactions, making the task of calculating taxes for the diner relatively more manageable. As a food establishment, the diner's tax-related concerns primarily revolved around sales tax and payroll taxes for employees. Moreover, the complexity of tax calculation for the store was compounded by the fact that it dealt with various types of goods. Each of these items may have been subjected to different tax rates and requirements depending on the specific nature of the product and the jurisdiction they fell under. This encompassed keeping track of tax-exempt items, handling rebates, and managing tax credit on certain purchases. In comparison, the diner's scope of taxable items was narrower and simple, generally limited to food and beverages served to customers. Though the diner would still need to account for different tax rates on items such as alcohol or other specific products, the overall process was less cumbersome when compared to the store's diverse inventory. Furthermore, the store's extensive supply chain and robust relationship with vendors presented additional layers of tax complexity. The store needed to correctly calculate tax implications during various stages of the supply chain: from purchase orders to warehouse storage, transportation, and finally, sales. Issues such as tax adjustments for damaged or returned goods would be more commonplace occurrences in such a setting, further complicating the tax calculation. In contrast, the diner predominantly worked with a smaller number of suppliers that provided ingredients and food-related supplies for the establishment. It had a limited number of direct tax liabilities related to its inventory and faced less complex challenges regarding tax adjustments or refunds on returned supplies, providing a more straightforward tax calculation process. In conclusion, it was easier to calculate taxes for the diner than for the store because the latter was a bigger business with a more complex operational structure and a wider scope of taxable goods. In a nutshell, the store had to navigate a more intricate tax landscape filled with unique challenges, requiring additional time and effort to ensure compliance and accuracy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Voting is underway in the southern U.S. state of Alabama in a tightly contested Senate election between Democrat Doug Jones and Republican Roy Moore, a campaign roiled by charges from women who accused Moore of sexual misconduct four decades ago when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Tuesday's special election was being watched nationally, both as an indicator of how midterm congressional elections might play out next November and also as a barometer of President Donald Trump's political clout. Trump endorsed Moore, who has denied the women's allegations, and called for the defeat of Jones, whom he said would be a political \\"puppet\\" of liberal Democratic lawmakers in Washington. The election winner will serve the last three years of the seat left vacant by Jeff Sessions when he joined Trump's Cabinet as attorney general, the country's top law enforcement position. If Moore wins, Republicans will retain their 52-48 majority in the Senate, but a Jones victory would pare the margin to 51-49, possibly further complicating Trump's efforts to pass his legislative agenda. Pre-election polls at various times have shown both Moore, 70, and Jones, 63, in the lead, but the history of elections in deeply conservative Alabama runs against Jones. No Democrat has won a Senate election in the state since Richard Shelby did in 1992, and two years later he switched parties to become a Republican. Still a senator, Shelby said Sunday that he voted absentee for \\"a distinguished Republican\\" as a write-in choice, but could not bring himself to vote for Moore after one woman, now in her 50s, said Moore abused her when she was 14. Moore, twice deposed as a state Supreme Court justice for failing to follow federal court rulings, has accused journalists, Democrats and establishment Republicans in Washington of trying to undermine his campaign. Some Republican lawmakers, a number of whom said Moore should drop out of the contest after the women's allegations surfaced, said they would try to expel him from the Senate if he won.

There was no press conference, there was no media tour, there was no elaborate social media activity. He posted one Facebook picture with the phrase, \\"Thank you, Steeler Nation.\\" The Steelers announced his departure on the team website. This is how Miller wanted it to be. The two-time Super Bowl champion and two-time Pro Bowler got what he needed out of his sport, and the time to leave was right. \\"It was totally my decision,\\" Miller says. \\"I always knew coming into this, I wanted to have a long career, but I also wanted to walk away with my health as much as I could. I feel like I'm doing that.\\" In an offseason featuring stars like Calvin Johnson and Marshawn Lynch retiring at an elite level at 30, Miller's retirement at 33 generated fewer headlines. Miller's 60 receptions and 535 yards in 2015 were near his career averages. He could have played more, but physically, he believed this was the right time to go out. Miller has kept mum on his thoughts on NFL safety. On a personal level, he is out of the game and on to other things. \\"I have no plans right now,\\" he says. I'm going to step away and enjoy some family time and let it sit. Maybe I'll figure something out in the next few years that feels right and I'll be off.\\" Miller says his teammates responded with the \\"normal stuff\\" congratulating him on retirement. Come fall, Miller will be watching them from his house, and his health risk, in such areas as concussions, will drastically shrink. \\"It's interesting, and I'm glad it's getting more news and more publicity because there's certainly ways I feel can make the game safer,\\" Miller says on the topic of CTE. \\"With knowledge of these symptoms and what guys are dealing with post-football, I think that's only going to be better to learn more about it and hopefully make changes for the better.\\" Miller has three sons, all 6 and younger. He will also be a fixture in the stands of whatever athletic endeavors his children pursue, football or no football. \\"They don't play right now,\\" he says. \\"They're young. I'll expose them to a number of sports and I feel like when they're at the appropriate age, and they want to play, we'll have the discussion then.\\" Miller admits even when he was a 22-year-old rookie, concussions were \\"not at all\\" on his mind. After 11 NFL seasons, the vibe changes. \\"You just have to be responsible with the way you do things in football,\\" he says. \\"It's a contact sport. I think the more educated you can be as a player and also, as coaches with little guys, is good. The coaches need to be educated and need to responsible and know the risks that come with the sport.\\" Miller spoke to ThePostGame from the American Express Hospitality tent at Oakmont Country Club, where he took in the final day of U.S. Open practice rounds in suburban Pittsburgh. The Steel City has been popping in June with the Penguins winning a Stanley Cup and the best golfers in the world descending upon Oakmont.

Usage: \\"The _________ in the museum was ancient.\\" and \\"The ________ in the airport was brand new.\\" These sentences are about two related objects (potentially artifacts or items), but the objects themselves (a museum artifact and an airport item) are different. Part #4: Contrast in sentences using trigger words. Usage: \\"The ________ in the room was very bright.\\" and \\"The _________ in the alley was really dark.\\" In these sentences, 'bright' and 'dark' act as contrasting trigger words, adding a contrasting element. Part #5: Answers should depend on the context present in twin sentences and not be associated with the trigger words. Usage: Based on context, the answer for \\"John put his pasta in the _______\\" could be 'bowl', and for \\"Joan put her keys in her _______\\" could be 'purse'. The context of the sentences, not the trigger words, indicate that the answers should be 'bowl' and 'purse', respectively. Part #6: Twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Usage: \\"Despite being quite weighty, the ________ was remarkably compact.\\" (9 words) \\"Although it was light, the ________ was disproportionately large.\\" (9 words) Both sentences have fewer than 30 but more than 15 words, so this criteria is met. Part #7: Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. Usage: \\"She took her ________ out from the drawer\\" and \\"He took his ________ out from the bag.\\" The sentences share much of the same phrasing and structure, overlapping in more than 70% of their words. Part #8: ObjectX and Y should have the same number. Usage: \\"The _______ in the box was fragile\\" and \\"The _______ on the shelf was sturdy\\" The objects referred to in both sentences are singular, complying with the rule. Part #9: The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Usage: \\"The ________ in the cupboard was dusty.\\" and \\"The ________ under the table was clean.\\" Both sentences use their respective objects only once, following this requirement. Part #10: You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Usage: Assuming the context word is \\"soda\\", \\"She poured the __________ into the glass.\\" and \\"He poured the _________ into the cup.\\" In both sentences, the context word 'soda' can be inserted into the blanks, making correct and contextually appropriate sentences. This meets the criteria of using the context word in the twin sentences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Now, I have a new situation: Marion county used coal and oil to produce electricity, while James county used nuclear energy for its electricity production. Both counties had a flourishing economy. Answer this question please: Which county used more nuclear fission to produce energy? Answer:","completion":"James county used more nuclear fission to produce energy. Step 1: Review both counties' energy production methods. The question tells us that Marion county used coal and oil for its energy production, while James county used nuclear energy. Step 2: Determine the method of energy production used in each county. Here we can see that Marion County produced its energy by burning coal and oil, both of which are fossil fuels, not radioactive elements needed for nuclear fission. On the other hand, James County produced energy using nuclear power, which does involve nuclear fission. Step 3: Determine which county used more nuclear fission. Given that nuclear fission is required for nuclear energy production, and given that only James County used nuclear energy, it stands to reason that James County used more nuclear fission in their energy production than Marion County. Therefore, James county used more nuclear fission to produce energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Next question: where do you find neurons in the brain?","completion":"To find neurons in the brain, we should understand what neurons are and in which regions of the brain they are located. We can follow these steps to achieve this: Step 1: Understand neurons Neurons, also known as nerve cells, are the fundamental units of the nervous system. They are specialized cells responsible for transmitting information through electrical and chemical signals. Step 2: Identify the major regions of the brain The brain consists of several major regions, including: - Cerebrum - Cerebellum - Brainstem Step 3: Examine the cerebrum The cerebrum constitutes the largest part of the brain. It has left and right hemispheres, and it is further divided into four lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. Each of these regions contains billions of neurons that are responsible for different functions such as sensory perception, motor functions, and cognitive tasks. Step 4: Investigate the cerebellum The cerebellum is situated below the cerebrum and is responsible for coordinating voluntary movements, maintaining posture, and balance. It also contains millions of neurons that are organized into distinct layers. Step 5: Explore the brainstem The brainstem is the lower part of the brain that connects to the spinal cord. It controls essential functions like heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. It also houses numerous neurons, especially in the reticular formation, which is involved in arousal, attention, and sleep. By understanding these regions and the functions they perform in the brain, we can conclude that neurons are found throughout the brain. They exist in the cerebrum, cerebell-display:inline;um, and brainstem, and are responsible for various functions like sensory perception, motor control, and essential life functions."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who is attacked by angry landowners?

After convincing a few landowners to sell their properties, his progress is halted by a series of unexplained accidents and threats. Tension escalates when some landowners, led by the stern and enigmatic Thomas Blackwood, display unyielding resistance to Jack's propositions. They are not ready to let go of the land their generations cultivated. Jack is oblivious to Green Valley's dark history, which dates back to a century of betrayal, exploitation, and vengeance. The crippling drought pushed landowners into debt, leading them to form a secret pact to preserve the agriculture of their town. Unbeknownst to Jack, he is considered an intruder and even his potential allies start turning against him. One night, his car is sabotaged, and Jack is attacked by angry landowners who threaten him to leave Green Valley immediately. Stubborn, Jack decides not to succumb to their sinister warnings and presses on with his mission. The hostilities intensify, turning deadly, with dogs poisoned and property destroyed. Jack's life is at stake, and he must navigate the complex relationships and deep-rooted suspicion among the landowners while uncovering the hidden secrets buried in the shadows of the valley. As Jack digs deep into the dirt of Green Valley's past, he discovers that Thomas Blackwood's great-grandfather promised prosperity to the town by constructing a dam that would provide water to its inhabitants. The dam was never built despite the money that was collected from the townspeople, causing the drought and sealing Green Valley’s fate. The landowners feel that they were cheated, and they can never trust an outsider like Jack again. Desperate for a solution, Jack presents a proposal to the landowners to build the dam and renew the vitality of their town. Hesitant, they consider his plan, but only under one condition: Jack must uncover and return the stolen money to its rightful owners. With no choice but to oblige, Jack embarks on a mission to unravel the truth behind the dam and expose the real enemy hiding among them. As tensions mount and old wounds resurface, the town’s future hangs in the balance. Can Jack win the trust of the landowners and save Green Valley before it's too late, or will the shadows of the valley swallow them all?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.

Holder Jr., who served as attorney general under President Obama, to investigate those claims. He is joined by the media mogul Arianna Huffington, a member of Uber’s board of directors, and Tammy Albarran, a partner at Mr. Holder’s law firm, Covington and Burling. Last week, the Uber investors Mitch Kapor and Freada Kapor Klein wrote in an open letter to the company that they were frustrated with how Uber had handled its culture issues and that they had “hit a dead end in trying to influence the company quietly from the inside.” The issue involving Mr. Singhal dates to 2015, when he was still at Google. The search giant deemed an employee’s claim of sexual harassment against Mr. Singhal “credible” in an internal investigation, according to two people familiar with the matter who declined to be identified because they were not allowed to speak on the matter.

View all New York Times newsletters. Mr. Singhal’s resignation from Uber was first reported by the technology news website Recode. Google was prepared to dismiss Mr. Singhal because of the claim, Recode said, but ultimately he resigned on his own in February 2016. In his goodbye note to the company, there was no mention of a sexual harassment claim against him, or any other signs of problems. In fact, the company held a goodbye party for Mr. Singhal, according to two people who attended the party, one a current Google employee and another a former employee. At the time, Mr. Singhal said he wanted to devote time to philanthropy; he joined Uber less than a year later. “Harassment is unacceptable in any setting,” Mr. Singhal said in a statement Monday. “I certainly want everyone to know that I do not condone and have not committed such behavior. In my 20-year career, I’ve never been accused of anything like this before, and the decision to leave Google was my own.” Uber and Google declined to comment on Mr. Singhal. Mr. Singhal was hired to oversee Uber’s mapping division as well as a unit that runs the dispatching, marketing and pricing of Uber cars. He reported directly to Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, and advised Anthony Levandowski, who runs the company’s self-driving automobile efforts. Mr. Singhal’s dismissal is another example of both the talent pipeline and the competition between Google and Uber. Last week, Waymo, the self-driving car company spun off from Google, filed a lawsuit against Uber accusing it of colluding with Mr. Levandowski, a former Google employee, to steal its autonomous vehicle technology. Uber called the suit “baseless.” Uber, now privately valued at nearly 70 billion, has raised a dizzying amount of money from venture capitalists around Silicon Valley. One of its early investors was GV, the venture capital arm of Google’s parent company, Alphabet. In August, David Drummond, a longtime Alphabet executive who was instrumental in GV’s 250 million investment in Uber in 2013, stepped down from Uber’s board of directors as it became increasingly clear the two companies were on a collision course. Mr. Singhal, hired by Google in 2000, was that company’s 176th employee, and he rewrote many of the original search algorithms created by the company’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Mr. Singhal is credited as one of the engineers who built the smarter and faster search engine that gave Google what has proved to be an insurmountable advantage in web search. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Upon joining Uber, Mr. Singhal wrote on his blog that he felt like Uber was a “geek’s candy store” because it was trying to solve “one of the most challenging computer science problems I’ve encountered in my thirty-year career.” ||||| Amit Singhal has left his job at Uber as its SVP of engineering because he did not disclose to the car-hailing company that he left Google a year earlier after top executives there informed him of an allegation of sexual harassment from an employee that an internal investigation had found “credible.�? Singhal was asked to resign by Uber CEO Travis Kalanick this morning. Uber execs found out about the situation after Recode informed them of the chain of events between Singhal and the search giant this week. Sources at Uber said that the company did extensive background checks of Singhal and that it did not uncover any hint of the circumstances of his departure from Google. Singhal disputed the allegation to Google execs at the time. In a statement to me, Singhal denied the allegation again, although he did acknowledge the dispute with Google. “Harassment is unacceptable in any setting. I certainly want everyone to know that I do not condone and have not committed such behavior,�? he wrote to me in an email. “In my 20-year career, I’ve never been accused of anything like this before and the decision to leave Google was my own.�? This revelation comes at a dicey time for Uber, as it has been under scrutiny of late, due to an explosive blog post by a former female engineer who alleged numerous incidents of sexism, sexual harassment and also painted a picture of a very dysfunctional HR department and management structure. To be clear, Singhal’s dispute with Google has nothing to do with that situation or the recent lawsuit that Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has waged against Uber’s Otto division. But having Singhal at the head of an organization under siege over sexual harassment issues when he was not candid with Uber over his departure from Google was considered untenable. Indeed. According to multiple sources and internal notes read to me, after discussing the claims of an alleged encounter between Singhal and a female employee first with former Google HR head Laszlo Bock and also Google CEO Sundar Pichai in late 2015, he denied those claims at the time. He also apparently stated a number of times that there were two sides to every story. But, after the Christmas holidays, he then decided to resign himself after a 15-year career there. Sources said that Google was prepared to fire Singhal over the allegations after looking into the incident, but that it did not have to do so after he resigned. Sources said the female employee who filed the formal complaint against Singhal did not work for him directly, but worked closely with the search team. She also did not want to go public with the charges, which is apparently why Google decided to allow Singhal to leave quietly. He was also a well-regarded executive there, who was well liked by many I have spoken to at Google. He rose to a top job as SVP of search and has had a distinguished career as a technologist in Silicon Valley. (You can hear an interview I did with him onstage at the Code Mobile conference in late 2015 here.) But his sudden departure from Google in early 2016 came soon after he had reorganized his huge and critical division, a move that definitely set off alarm bells with me and many others both inside and outside of Google. You could not tell that there were any problems, though, from the outward behavior of both sides. When Singhal left, said sources, Google settled major outstanding grants he had, and his own goodbye letter read more like a retirement missive. More to the point, it gave no hint of acrimony between himself and his longtime employer. “As I entered the fifteenth year of working at Google, I've been asking myself the question, ‘What would you want to do for the next fifteen?’ The answer has overwhelmingly been: Give back to others. It has always been a priority for me to give back to people who are less fortunate, and make time for my family amidst competing work constraints — but on both fronts, I simply want to give and do more,�? he wrote. “Now is a good time to make this important life change.�? But within a year, rather than do good, Singhal had gotten a top job at Uber. Google declined to comment on the circumstances of Singhal’s departure. Uber also declined to comment beyond its confirmation of Singhal’s departure and about the details of his hiring. ||||| FILE- In this May 15, 2013, file photo, Amit Singhal, senior vice president and software engineer at Google Inc., speaks at Google I/O 2013 in San Francisco.

Singhal, a top engineering executive at Uber,... (Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) — A top engineering executive at Uber, Amit Singhal, is out five weeks after his hire was announced. According to a report in the tech blog Recode, Singhal failed to disclose that he'd left his previous job at Google because of a sexual harassment allegation. Singhal denied the allegation and said he left Google a year ago for his own reasons. The dustup is just the latest sign of turmoil at Uber, which last week found itself in an unrelated sexual harassment firestorm . That stemmed from a detailed essay published by a former female Uber engineer, who charged that her prospects at the company evaporated after she complained about sexual advances from her boss. In the post about her year at Uber , Susan Fowler said the company's human resources department ignored her complaints because her boss was a high performer. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has called for an independent investigation of those issues, and the company has hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to help. In a statement emailed to The Associated Press, Singhal said: \\"Harassment is unacceptable in any setting.

The procurement and fabrication timelines may depend on the availability of materials, the complexity of the components, and the efficiency of the supply chain. 4. Installation: The installation stage involves integrating the SCR system into the existing infrastructure. This may require deconstruction and modifications of existing infrastructure, transport and placement of the equipment, and appropriate wiring, piping, and ductwork. The time taken for the installation stage depends on factors such as site accessibility, equipment size, and the level of coordination between various teams working on the project. 5. Startup and commissioning: During this stage, the SCR system is tested and started up for the first time. This may involve calibrating equipment, conducting performance tests, training personnel, and fine-tuning the processes. The time required for startup and commissioning may vary based on the readiness of the infrastructure, the skill level of the operating staff, and the complexity of the SCR system. 6. External factors: Regulatory compliance, permitting, approval processes, and weather conditions can also impact the overall timeframe of the project. Considering all these factors, it is essential to recognize that the estimate of 21 months of total effort for one SCR system may not always remain constant and could vary based on specific circumstances for each project. However, the given statement does provide a general understanding of the time required to successfully plan, engineer, install, and start up an SCR system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sun is shining brightly overhead, and the soft hum of insects fills the air. It is a warm day, and the men are starting to feel the effects of the heat. Around mid-morning, they decide to take a break and rest for a moment under the shade of a large apple tree. As they sit down, the most logical next event would be for the two men to start a conversation with each other. They might discuss the progress they have made so far in the orchard, commenting on the quality and quantity of the fruits they have picked. They might also discuss any challenges they've faced during the job, such as reaching for fruits high up in the trees or navigating through the rows of trees without getting stuck. After discussing work-related topics, the conversation could shift to more personal matters. They might share stories about their lives, families, and experiences that have shaped them into the people they are today. They would talk about their hopes, fears, and dreams for the future.

A. ask questions B. lie C. search for D. find facts E. wonder The best answer is Answer:","completion":"D. find facts The detective's main objective is to discover the truth about a particular situation, which often involves solving a crime or investigating a suspicious circumstance. In order to do this, the detective must conduct a thorough investigation, during which they will search for and analyze relevant information in order to uncover the facts that will construct the bigger picture. Throughout the investigation, the detective will most likely come across a myriad of lies and half-truths, which are deliberately or unintentionally intended to mislead them in their pursuit of the truth. Sifting through these lies and deceptions is an essential part of a detective's job, as it allows them to narrow down the relevant information and pinpoint the accurate facts on which they can base their conclusions. Option A, \\"ask questions,\\" is an important part of the investigative process. However, the act of questioning people alone does not ensure the uncovering of the truth. In addition, asking questions is just one of the methods a detective uses to gather information, not the end goal. Option B, \\"lie,\\" is not a viable answer, as the detective's goal is to discover the truth, not to perpetuate or create falsehoods themselves.

Please answer the following question: - Owls hunt around their hunting territory away from where they roost during the day - They sit still on a perch, like a stump of branch, and wait for prey - They use their highly sensitive hearing to locate prey that cannot be seen - They use their very keen vision to see prey in the dark - They fly silently, without flapping their wings, in order to surprise the prey - The owl silently glides or drops on its prey, grabbing it with its talons and beak What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process for an owl after successfully hunting and capturing its prey involves consuming and digesting the meal. This is a vital aspect of the owl's predatory behavior as it ensures the owl obtains the necessary nutrients and energy required for survival and maintaining daily activities. Once an owl has captured its prey in its sharp, powerful talons and secured it with its strong beak, it will usually return to a safe and secure location, such as a perch or its nest, to consume the meal. In some instances, especially when dealing with smaller prey, the owl will swallow the prey whole, headfirst. This method allows for easier passage through the owl's digestive system and prevents any limbs or appendages from getting caught while swallowing. As owls lack teeth, they rely on their specialized digestive system to break down their food. After swallowing the prey whole, it enters the owl's stomach, which is divided into two chambers: the proventriculus and the gizzard. The proventriculus secretes enzymes to break down the softer parts of the prey, including its organs, muscles, and other soft tissues. The gizzard, which contains small pieces of grit and stones, grinds up the harder parts of the prey, such as bones, feathers, and fur. These hard, indigestible parts are then compressed into a pellet within the gizzard. Once the digestion process is complete and the nutrients have been absorbed, the owl will regurgitate the pellet containing the indigestible remains of its meal. This process generally occurs several hours after consuming the prey, and the regurgitated pellet provides a clear indication of the owl's diet as well as the overall health of the species in its ecosystem. In summary, the last step of the process for an owl after hunting and capturing its prey is to consume and digest the meal in order to extract essential nutrients for energy and survival. This is achieved through the owl's specialized digestive system, which enables it to break down various types of prey even without the presence of teeth. The process is completed by the regurgitation of indigestible remains in the form of a pellet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Barack Hussein Obama II ( ( listen); born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. The first African American to assume the presidency, he was previously the junior United States Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008. Before that, he served in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 until 2004. Obama was born in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii, two years after the territory was admitted to the Union as the 50th state. Context: From age six to ten, Obama attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki Public School) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother. As a result of those four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child. During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \\"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works\\". In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School-- a private college preparatory school-- with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \\"Barry\\". Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii. Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer. Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \\"The opportunity that Hawaii offered - to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect - became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\\" Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \\"push questions of who I was out of my mind\\". Obama was also a member of the \\"choom gang\\", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana. After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985. Question: Did he do anything political while in school? Answer:","completion":"Yes, when Barack Obama was in school, he did some political things. When he was at Occidental College in Los Angeles, he made a speech in 1981 asking the college to not support South Africa because of their unfair treatment of black people, called apartheid. This was his first public speech and showed his interest in politics and helping people. Later, he studied political science at Columbia University in New York City, which helped him learn more about politics and how to make a difference in the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When he keels over from a heart attack, now itâs up to a grad student, Allison (Kari WÃ¼hrer, reprising her role), to keep it from the forces of darkness. Cut to the streets of Bucharest. A young girl named Maria loses her ball into the busy street. Suddenly, Lucifer (reprised by John Light) appears to her and tells her she should go get it.

You shouldn’t get good at something for the sole purpose of impressing people, but it can be a good addition to making you well-rounded as a person. You may not have a lot of opportunities to show the talent you have, but if something like a talent show does come up, have the confidence to go for it. It’s also a good option to invite the classmate to participate in the activity with you so you can show them the skills you have. If you want to be noticed, go out of your way to try things that everyone else seems to be afraid of doing. A great way to do this is to volunteer in class when the other students are sitting back not wanting to be picked. Your classmate will see that you are confident and will be impressed by your initiative. School can often be a time of stress, tension, and drama in aspects of school work, fighting among students, and times of performance like giving a speech. When the others around you are giving in to all the pressure, you can maintain a balanced composure and stay cool. Be someone who can handle whatever situations come your way. Your classmate will be impressed and will look to you as someone to rely on when things get rough. A great way to stay composed in any situation is to take deep breaths and focus your attention on your breathing. When you start to feel stressed, your body's natural response is to speed up your breathing, but this often makes it harder to stay calm. Take breaths more slowly than you normally would. It can also help you stay calm to pause for 5-10 seconds before responding or reacting. Losing your cool tends to happen in an instant, but if you practice waiting for a little while before doing anything, you will have time to think first. It’s fairly common among students, and even adults, to want to talk a lot about themselves and tell all about their lives. You can make an impression on someone by showing true interest in what they like and think about. Go out of your way to notice some of their interests and then learn about those for yourself. Your classmate will be impressed that you cared to let them share with you and that you took an interest in them. If you take the time to get into the interest they told you about, you can go back to the person and tell them about your experience. If they mention a band, go listen to their albums and tell them what you liked about it. Or watch the person’s favorite movie and go repeat a line from it to him or her. With so many people bragging about themselves and wanting everyone to notice them, you can stand out by giving a compliment. If your classmate wears an outfit you like, tell them how great they look. If they do well on a project or big assignment, congratulate them. If you know they played well in a sport over the weekend, tell them nice job. You can do this consistently over time, but not so often that it becomes obvious you are doing it.

The president-elect, Dwight D. Eisenhower, took a trip to Korea on November 29, 1952, in order to learn how the Korean War might be brought to an end. This visit was a significant event that aided in the understanding of the situation in Korea and explored ways to potentially end the ongoing conflict. During this time, the United Nations accepted India's proposed armistice for the Korean War, which led to the cessation of hostilities between the warring parties, including the KPA (Korean People's Army), the PVA (People's Volunteer Army), and the UN Command. The battle line at the time of the ceasefire was roughly along the 38th parallel, a latitudinal circle that served as a dividing line between North and South Korea. In the aftermath of the ceasefire agreement, the belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a designated buffer zone between North and South Korea intended to prevent further military confrontations. The DMZ, which has been in place since 1953, has been patrolled by representatives from the KPA, ROKA (Republic of Korea Army), United States, and Joint UN Command to maintain peace and security in the region. In summary, the key event that first occurred in the article during the 52nd year of the 20th century was the election of President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the United States. His visit to Korea in 1952 demonstrated his commitment to ending the Korean War, and subsequently, the acceptance of India's proposed armistice led to the ceasefire and the establishment of the Korean Demilitarized Zone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When she finally found them, their foremost emotion would likely be relief and happiness to see their child safe and sound. It is worth mentioning that while other options, such as being angry or confused, might have been possible emotions experienced by the parents, the most likely response would be happiness, as their primary concern would be for their child's well-being.

The Bengals dominated the first half time of possession by more than a 2-1 margin. The Bengals took the opening possession of the game and marched down the field, with quarterback AJ McCarron, playing in place of the injured Andy Dalton, throwing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver A. J. Green in the corner of the end zone. The Bengals later added to their lead in the second quarter, with wide receiver Mohamed Sanu rushing for a 6-yard touchdown, in a \\"wildcat\\" formation. The Bengals were threatening to add to their lead just before the two-minute warning, but placekicker Mike Nugent missed wide right on a 45-yard field goal attempt. The Broncos then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus just before halftime. The Broncos took the initial possession of the second half, and pulled to within 14-10, with quarterback Brock Osweiler connecting with wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders on an 8-yard touchdown pass, which was the only scoring play of the third quarter. After having trouble stopping the Bengals' offense in the first half, the Broncos' defense forced the Bengals to punt on their first four possessions of the second half. The Broncos grabbed a 17-14 lead early in the fourth quarter, with running back C. J. Anderson scampering down the sideline for a 39-yard touchdown. A 52-yard field goal by Nugent helped the Bengals tie the game at 17-17 with 6:51 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Broncos had reached the Bengals' 27-yard line on the next possession, and were attempting a game-winning drive, but Bengals' defensive end Michael Johnson forced a fumble off Anderson, which was recovered by safety Reggie Nelson. However, the Broncos' defense forced a Bengals' punt, and the Broncos' offense began their next drive at their own 20-yard line with 1:40 remaining. However, McManus badly missed wide left on a potential game-winning 45-yard field goal attempt as time expired, sending the game to overtime. The Broncos won the overtime coin toss, and took a 20-17 lead on their initial possession, with a 37-yard field goal by McManus. The drive was aided by a 15-yard personal foul penalty on Bengals' linebacker Vontaze Burfict for a late hit out-of-bounds. The Bengals started their first offensive possession of overtime at their own 33-yard line, and on their first play, McCarron attempted a pass that was incomplete, as his arm was hit by Broncos' linebacker Von Miller. Broncos' head coach Gary Kubiak called a timeout, thinking the play should have been ruled as a game-ending fumble, however, the initial ruling was upheld by instant replay. On the very next play, McCarron fumbled the snap, which was recovered by Broncos' linebacker DeMarcus Ware to end the game and send the Broncos to the postseason for the fifth consecutive season. This was the third game of the season that the Broncos won after trailing 14-0 &#8212; the other two were Week 2 at the Kansas City Chiefs and Week 12 vs. the New England Patriots.

Next question: in what case did the us supreme court hand down its first opinion on august the 3rd 1791?","completion":"The case you are referring to is West v. Barnes, 2 U.S. 401 (1791). This was the first case in which the U.S. Supreme Court handed down an opinion, and it was indeed on August 3, 1791. West v. Barnes is a relatively minor case in the grand scheme of American constitutional law, but its significance lies in its status as the first Supreme Court decision. The case itself dealt with a relatively mundane issue in procedure, specifically concerning the method of issuing a writ of error, a legal device which allows a higher court to review the decision of a lower court. The dispute initiated when West, a Rhode Island citizen, filed a lawsuit against Barnes and another defendant (also from Rhode Island) in a circuit court. The suit was about a financial dispute over a series of promissory notes. The circuit court ruled in favor of Barnes, and West sought to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, aiming to secure a reversal. However, West had obtained a writ of error from a clerk in Rhode Island, rather than from a clerk of the Supreme Court located in the nation’s then-capital, Philadelphia. Herein lies the crux of the issue that made it to the Supreme Court. The Judiciary Act of 1789, a landmark law which set up the Federal court system, specified that the writs of error had to \\"be made returnable to the Supreme Court at the seat of government,\\" i.e., in Philadelphia. Barnes's lawyers argued that by the Judiciary Act's terms, the writ of error was invalid because it had been issued in Rhode Island, not in Philadelphia. The Supreme Court agreed with Barnes and affirmed the circuit court decision in favor of Barnes. The court held that the legal error in the proceedings was fatal to West's attempt to have the Supreme Court review the circuit court's decisions. The court argued that the rules were the rules, and they should be strictly adhered to, no matter how minor they might seem. Apart from confirming the procedural rule, the case also demonstrated the court's early insistence on adhering to the precise language of the statutes, a concept known as legal formalism, and its reluctance to bend the rules \\"in the interests of justice,\\" a concept known as legal realism. West v. Barnes may not be a well-known Supreme Court case, but as the first case to be decided by the Supreme Court, it laid the groundwork for the thousands of opinions that would follow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: English is the native or official language of one-fifth of the land area of the world. It is spoken in North America, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. In South Africa and India it is one of the official languages. More people study English than any other language. In many countries, the textbooks in universities are in English. Many university classes are taught in English even though the native language is not English. English is the language of international communication. It is the language of international business, research, and science. More than three-fourths of the world's mail is written in English. More than half of the scientific research journals are in English. Most other languages have borrowed many English words. Why did English become the international language? In the middle of the nineteenth century, French was the international language. The Britain became very powerful in the world. England started colonies in North America and India in the seventeenth century. By 1900 England also had colonies in other parts of Asia, Africa and the South Pacific. The people in the colonies had to use English. Slowly it became more important than French internationally. After the Second World War, the United States became very powerful, and even more people began to learn English. Is English a good international language? It has more words than any other language. The grammar is simpler than in other major languages. However, English spelling is difficult. Foreigners all have trouble spelling English. So do native speakers! Since 1880, people have invented over fifty artificial (not natural) languages. No one speaks them as a native language. However, none of them has ever become popular.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What part of the church did Nikolova consider unsuitable for the baptism? ? The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Measuring 5 m × 9.50 m (16.4 ft × 31.2 ft), the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m (9.8 ft). Its two turrets have a diameter of 3.20 m (10.5 ft); each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: There are many possible goals you could set, but the type of goal refers to how you'll measure your progress and success. The two main types are process goals and outcome goals. Process goals focus on the work that you'll do within a given time period. An example of a process goal would be to complete and submit all of your assignments on time this week. Outcome goals focus on the results of your work. An example of an outcome goal would be to earn a grade of at least 90% on your next test. Having a goal may not be enough to keep you motivated. If that's the case, it may be important to remind yourself of why that goal is meaningful to you, and why you hope to achieve it. Reflecting on the outcome of that goal - both the positive results if you succeed and the negative results if you don't - may help you stay more focused and driven over time. Do you need to do well in a class to pass? Are you trying to improve your grades overall? Perhaps you want to do well in a class so that you can eventually seek employment in a related field.

Are these two questions asking the same thing? Pick your answer from: (1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"First, I will answer each question separately. QUESTION 1: To find the radius of the incircle of a triangle, we can use the formula: radius = area / semiperimeter First, we need to find the area and the semiperimeter of the triangle. The semiperimeter of the triangle can be found using the formula: semiperimeter = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2 semiperimeter = (18 + 24 + 30) / 2 semiperimeter = 72 / 2 semiperimeter = 36 Next, we can use the Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle: area = sqrt(semiperimeter * (semiperimeter - side1) * (semiperimeter - side2) * (semiperimeter - side3)) area = sqrt(36 * (36 - 18) * (36 - 24) * (36 - 30)) area = sqrt(36 * 18 * 12 * 6) area = sqrt(52488) area ≈ 229.13 cm^2 Now I can find the radius using the formula: radius = area / semiperimeter radius = 229.13 / 36 radius ≈ 6.365 cm The radius of the incircle of the triangle is approximately 6.365 cm. QUESTION 2: To find the area of a triangle with side lengths 3, 2, and 1 cm, first, we need to check if this triangle can exist. In order for a triangle to exist, the sum of the lengths of its two smaller sides must be greater than the length of the largest side. For this triangle, 1 + 2 = 3, which is not greater than the length of the largest side. Therefore, this triangle cannot exist, and we cannot find its area. ANSWER SELECTION: These two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question asks for the radius of the incircle of a triangle with given side lengths, while the second question asks for the area of a triangle with given side lengths.

Plans for a museum at nearby Cribbs Causeway stalled after a bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund was turned down. Filton Airfield, which is owned by BAE Systems, is due to close in 2012. BBC Radio Bristol's political reporter Robin Markwell said the new centre would be on land just off a new link road between Filton and Cribbs Causeway - bordering the northern edge of the airfield - which opened in 2010. He said the plan included a science and technology centre which would train engineers from local universities. Plans for funding it have not yet been announced. It would also require planning permission from South Gloucestershire Council. Concorde 216, or Alpha Foxtrot, was the last of the fleet to fly when Concorde was withdrawn from service by British Airways in 2003.

Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct.

His mother, Erma Gene (nee Christian), was a social worker, administrator, and educator. His father, Levardis Robert Martyn Burton, was a photographer for the U.S. Army Signal Corps at the time he was stationed at Landstuhl. Burton and his two sisters were raised by his mother in Sacramento, California. Context: Burton was the host and executive producer of Reading Rainbow starting in 1983 for PBS. The series ran for 23 seasons, making it one of the longest-running children's programs on the network. The series garnered over 200 broadcast awards over its run, including a Peabody Award and 26 Emmy Awards, 11 of which were in the Outstanding Children's Series category. Burton himself won 12 Emmy awards as host and producer of the show. After Reading Rainbow went off the air in 2006, Burton and his business partner, Mark Wolfe, acquired the global rights to the brand and formed RRKIDZ, a new media company for children. Reading Rainbow was reimagined as an all new application for the iPad in 2012, and was an immediate success, becoming the number-one educational application within 36 hours. At RRKIDZ, Burton serves as co-founder and curator-in-chief, ensuring that the projects produced under the banner meet the high expectations and trust of the Reading Rainbow brand. On May 28, 2014, Burton and numerous coworkers from other past works started a Kickstarter campaign project to bring back Reading Rainbow. To keep with the changing formats to which young children are exposed, his efforts are being directed at making this new program web-based, following the success of the tablet application he helped create in recent years. His desire is to have the new Reading Rainbow be integrated into the classrooms of elementary schools across the country, and for schools in need to have free access. The Kickstarter campaign has since raised over 5 million, reaching triple its goal in only three days. Question: What is the goal of the campaign? Answer:","completion":"The goal of the campaign is to bring back the Reading Rainbow program in a new, web-based format.

Prepare the nasal syringe immediately after giving several rescue breaths (if necessary). Pry or pull off the yellow caps. There are usually two – one at each end of the syringe. A syringe is not a needle, it's a plastic device that holds the needle – or in this case, what the Narcan screws onto. You can find Narcan through the getnaloxonenow.org website.

Researchers say long working hours could be condemning thousands of employees to heart attacks and strokes. The warning follows analysis of 12 studies dating back as far as 1958, involving a total of 22,000 people from around the world. Time for a holiday: Research shows that employees who frequently put in overtime significantly increase their risk of heart attacks and strokes. The analysis, by scientists at the. Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, found that those whose working. days that were longer than the traditional eight hours had a 40 to 80. per cent greater chance of heart disease. The size of the increase varied depending on how each study was carried out. The effects were more pronounced when. participants were asked how long they worked for – but when researchers. closely monitored working hours, the increased risk of heart disease was. closer to 40 per cent. Lead researcher Dr Marianna Virtanen. said the effects could be due to 'prolonged exposure to stress'. Other. triggers could be poor eating habits and lack of exercise due to. restricted leisure time. In 2009, the same team discovered. that long working hours increased the risk of dementia later in life. The effect was similar in magnitude to that of smoking. Calm down: Prolonged exposure to psychological stress, which can occur at work, may be one reason for the link between longer hours and heart disease. Middle-aged workers putting in 55. hours or more a week had poorer brain function than those clocking up no. more than 40 hours, with lower scores on tests to measure intelligence,. short-term memory and word recall. Britons work some of the longest hours. in Europe, with full-time employees averaging 42.7 a week. Those in. Germany typically work for 42, while Danes do 39.1. It estimated that more than five million people a year in Britain work unpaid extra hours to hang on to their jobs. But the long-term toll on workers’ health could be devastating, the new research suggests. In a report on the findings Dr Virtanen said: ‘There are several potential mechanisms that may underlie the association between long working hours and heart disease. In addition to prolonged exposure to psychological stress she said other triggers could be raised levels of the stress hormone cortisol, poor eating habits and lack of physical activity due to restricted leisure time.

Over the years 29 residence halls have been built to accommodate students and each has been constructed with its own chapel. Many academic building were added together with a system of libraries, the most prominent of which is the Theodore Hesburgh Library, built in 1963 and today containing almost 4 million books. Since 2004, several buildings have been added, including the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, the Guglielmino Complex, and the Jordan Hall of Science. Additionally, a new residence for men, Duncan Hall, was begun on March 8, 2007, and began accepting residents for the Fall 2008 semester. Ryan Hall was completed and began housing undergraduate women in the fall of 2009. A new engineering building, Stinson-Remick Hall, a new combination Center for Social Concerns/Institute for Church Life building, Geddes Hall, and a law school addition have recently been completed as well. Additionally the new hockey arena opened in the fall of 2011. The Stayer Center for Executive Education, which houses the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education Department opened in March 2013 just South of the Mendoza College of Business building. Because of its long athletic tradition, the university features also many building dedicated to sport. The most famous is Notre Dame Stadium, home of the Fighting Irish football team; it has been renovated several times and today it can hold more than 80 thousand people. Prominent venues include also the Edmund P. Joyce Center, with indoor basketball and volleyball courts, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a two-rink facility dedicated to hockey.

Does \\"However, in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability, and hunting for 'population control' has no effect on the annual population of species.[citation needed]\\" correctly answer the question of What happens if a population exceeds the carrying capacity of their habitat?","completion":"The given statement, \\"However, in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination of habitat and food availability, and hunting for 'population control' has no effect on the annual population of species.[citation needed]\\" only partially answers the question of what happens if a population exceeds the carrying capacity of their habitat. While it does mention important factors – habitat and food availability – that determine the carrying capacity, it does not fully explain the consequences of exceeding carrying capacity, nor does it explain how population control measures such as hunting fit into the discussion. Carrying capacity is a concept used in population ecology to describe the maximum population size that an environment can sustainably support without resource depletion and long-term damage to the ecosystem. When a population exceeds its carrying capacity, various consequences arise, including: 1. Competition for resources: As a population grows beyond its carrying capacity, the demand for resources, such as food, water, and shelter, increases. This leads to competition among individuals, resulting in some being unable to obtain the resources they need to survive, ultimately leading to a decline in population size. 2. Uncontrolled population fluctuations: When a population exceeds its carrying capacity, it can cause sharp fluctuations in population numbers as the population grows rapidly and then suddenly crashes when resources are depleted. This can lead to destabilization of the ecosystem and make it difficult for the species to recover. 3. Decline in overall health: Overcrowding and increased competition for resources can contribute to malnutrition, disease, and stress among the population, leading to a decrease in overall health and potentially resulting in increased mortality. 4. Ecosystem degradation: A population that surpasses its carrying capacity can cause damage to the environment, such as overgrazing, nutrient depletion in soil, and habitat destruction. These changes can have long-term effects on the health and stability of the ecosystem, impacting not only the species in question but also other species that rely on the same resources and habitat. Regarding the role of hunting in population control, this statement suggests that hunting may not always affect the annual population of a species. However, this can vary significantly depending on the specific species and ecosystem in question. In some cases, carefully regulated hunting can contribute to a more balanced and healthier ecosystem by preventing overpopulation and reducing competition for resources. In other cases, hunting may not significantly impact the overall population size if reproduction rates or other factors balance out the population numbers over time. In conclusion, the given statement partially answers the question but could be expanded to better address the consequences of exceeding carrying capacity and discuss the potential role of measures such as hunting in managing population size. A more thorough understanding of the outcomes of exceeding carrying capacity is essential for making informed decisions regarding conservation, resource management, and population control strategies."},{"prompt":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Max Renn (James Woods) is the president of CIVIC-TV (Channel 83, Cable 12), a Toronto UHF television station specializing in sensationalistic programming.

One morning, he is summoned to the clandestine office of Harlan (Peter Dvorsky), who operates CIVIC-TV's unauthorized satellite dish which can intercept broadcasts from as far away as Asia.

Max dates Nicki, who is sexually aroused when he shows her an episode of Videodrome and coaxes him into having sex with her while they watch it. Max goes once again to Harlan's office, where Harlan tells him that the signal delay which caused it to appear to be coming from Malaysia was a ploy by the broadcaster and that Videodrome is being broadcast out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Build a movie plot around this: who vanished on October 31,1978 after being shot six times and falling from a second story balcony? Michael Myers A:","completion":"Title: The Eternal Nightmare Genre: Horror, Mystery, Thriller Plot: The small town of Haddonfield, Illinois, has always been haunted by the eerie events that occurred on October 31, 1978. The infamous serial murderer, Michael Myers, was shot six times by psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis and fell from a second story balcony, after which he simply vanished without a trace. In present day, Haddonfield has largely forgotten about Michael Myers, choosing instead to focus on the revival of their community and try to leave the past where it's meant to be - in the past. However, in the weeks leading up to another fateful Halloween night, strange occurrences begin to plague the town and cause unrest among its residents. The story follows Emma, a local investigative journalist who grew up hearing the terrifying stories of Michael Myers, which ultimately inspired her to dig even deeper into the gruesome mysteries that seem to live deep within the roots of Haddonfield. As Emma starts revealing long-held secrets and unanswered questions, she stumbles upon the hidden truth - the real identity of the person who pulled the trigger on Michael Myers that fateful night and the implication this shocking discovery has on the town's supposed safety. The town's dark history comes to light as Emma uncovers information about a secret operation led by the now-retired Dr. Sam Loomis, who had discovered a way to suppress Michael's supernatural ability to resist death in order to protect the world from his terror. Unbeknownst to the town, this intervention left him in a dormant state, hidden away in a secret facility for decades. Emma's discoveries inadvertently awaken Michael Myers from his slumber, reigniting the cycle of terror he had once haunted Haddonfield with. With Michael now stronger and more unstoppable than ever, Emma must join forces with a new generation of brave and determined individuals, including the town's brave sheriff, a dedicated forensic analyst, and the only surviving member of Dr. Loomis' original team, Rick. The group embarks on a harrowing mission to prevent Michael from leaving a trail of death in his wake; however, as Halloween night casts a dark spell over Haddonfield, they quickly realize that the shadow of Michael Myers is almost inescapable. Realizing that they need to outsmart and trap Michael, Emma discovers an ancient ritual connected to the origins of Michael's dark presence and existence. With time running out and lives on the line, the group must band together to execute a risky plan - performing the ritual to strip Michael of his immortality. The climax of the film culminates in a labyrinth-like haunted house attraction set by the townspeople as a distraction and a trap. Michael, engaged in a non-stop chase, relentlessly pursues Emma and her team. As the clock strikes midnight, the ancient ritual succeeds in making Michael Myers mortal again, allowing the team to confront and finally put an end to the terror of Michael Myers as the haunted house collapses around them. The movie closes with the town of Haddonfield coming to terms with the true dark secrets it has been hiding. The residents, now free from the nightmarish curse of The Eternal Nightmare, work together to rebuild their community and heal the wounds from decades of fear and pain. The legend of Michael Myers may never be forgotten, but Haddonfield rises stronger and more united with the hope of never having to experience such terror again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems , which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits , who had both supported Galileo up until this point.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"I: Galileo Galilei's Personality Galileo Galilei was a multifaceted personality with several traits that helped shape his life and scientific career. Here is a detailed analysis of his personality: 1. Intellectual Curiosity: One of the foremost aspects of Galileo's personality was his unyielding intellectual curiosity. Throughout his life, he displayed an eagerness to question conventional ideas and challenge existing scientific beliefs. 2. Perseverance: Galileo demonstrated immense perseverance in his scientific pursuits, even when faced with adversity, as evidenced by his continued work on his theories despite facing opposition from religious authorities. 3. Creativity and Innovation: Galileo was a visionary who broke new ground in various fields of science and technology.

In the premise, it is described as a \\"(25 staff day) check,\\" while in the hypothesis, it is referred to as a \\"cheap look.\\" Therefore, the low-cost nature of the examination is consistent between the two statements. 2. The focus on productivity data and trends is present in both the premise and hypothesis. The premise specifically mentions productivity data and trends from other SSA regions, while the hypothesis more generally refers to productivity data and other trends. 3. The identification of similarities or links is present in both statements. In the premise, it is stated that similarities were noted during the check, while the hypothesis directly mentions that links were found. Based on the consistency between the elements of the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that the premise provides evidence to support the hypothesis. The inexpensive nature of the investigation, the focus on productivity data and trends, and the identification of similarities all align and confirm the hypothesis that \\"Links were found in a cheap look at productivity data and other trends.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Our problem is: -98 * f + 2365 = 84 * f + 33 * f First, we'll add the 'f' terms on the right side of the equation: 84 * f + 33 * f = (84 + 33) * f = 117 * f Now, the problem looks like this: -98 * f + 2365 = 117 * f Next, we'll move the -98 * f term from the left side to the right side by adding 98 * f to both sides. This will give us: 2365 = 117 * f + 98 * f Now, let's combine the 'f' terms on the right side: 2365 = (117 + 98) * f = 215 * f To find the value of 'f', we'll now divide both sides by 215: f = 2365 ÷ 215 When you do the division, you get: f = 11 So, the answer is f = 11!

It was produced by Owen Morris and the group's guitarist Noel Gallagher. The structure and arrangement style of the album were a significant departure from the group's previous record \\"Definitely Maybe\\". Gallagher's compositions were more focused in balladry and placed more emphasis on huge choruses, with the string arrangements and more varied instrumentation on the record contrasting with the rawness of the group's debut album. \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\" was the group's first album with drummer Alan White, who replaced Tony McCarroll. - \\"Some Might Say\\" is a song by the English rock band Oasis. It was released as the first single on 24 April 1995 from their second studio album, \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\" (1995). The song was written by the band's lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. \\"Some Might Say\\" provided Oasis with their first number one in the UK Singles Chart. - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs. - The UK Singles Chart (currently entitled Official Singles Chart) is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC), on behalf of the British record industry, listing the top-selling singles in the United Kingdom, based upon physical sales, paid-for downloads and streaming. To be eligible for the chart, a single is currently defined by the Official Charts Company (OCC) as either a 'single bundle' having no more than four tracks and not lasting longer than 25 minutes or one digital audio track not longer than 15 minutes with a minimum sale price of 40 pence. The rules have changed many times as technology has developed, the most notable being the inclusion of digital downloads in 2005 and streaming in 2014. - Noel Thomas David Gallagher (born 29 May 1967) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and guitarist.

I read this background article the other day: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. I am facing a new situation today: Jimothy and Dwight are two brothers living in the same house. Jimothy is a freshman in high school and Dwight is a junior in high school. Their mother takes them to see a doctor and to have their testosterone tested.

Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Will Dwight finish his growth spurt before or after Jimothy?","completion":"To answer the question, let's go step by step considering the information provided both in the background article and the new situation. 1. The adolescent growth spurt is controlled by testosterone in boys. 2. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. 3. In the average male, growth in height can be about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year at its peak rate. 4. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. 5. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Now, let's look at the information about Jimothy and Dwight: - Dwight is older (a junior in high school). - Jimothy is younger (a freshman in high school). - Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy due to their age difference. Given the information above, it's reasonable to conclude that Dwight has already started his growth spurt and is at a more advanced stage of growth compared to Jimothy, who is still in the early stages of puberty. The increase in testosterone indicates that Dwight's growth has been progressing for some time now. Therefore, Dwight is likely to finish his growth spurt before Jimothy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

To provide a more comprehensive answer to the question, additional information and historical context are needed. During the 1920s and 1930s, the United States saw a shift in public transportation preferences as automobiles, buses, and trucks became more accessible and affordable. This change, coupled with the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of motorized vehicles, led to a decline in streetcar use. In New Haven, as in many other cities, the rise of motor buses contributed to the decline and eventual phasing out of trolley service. Buses proved to be more versatile, requiring less infrastructure investment, and could easily be rerouted to accommodate changing transportation needs. Additionally, buses could cover a broader geographic area, making them an attractive alternative to the fixed routes of streetcars. So, the mode of public transportation that phased out the trolley service in New Haven during the 1920s and 1930s was motor buses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At a 90s party, guests might show up dressed like oncefamous celebrities. At a sports party, guests might wear their favorite team's uniforms.

Passage:Though his parents were from Cortland, New York, Dio was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where his family resided for his father's service in the U.S. Army during World War II; they soon returned to Cortland. Dio's music career began there in 1957 as part of the Vegas Kings (later Ronnie and the Rumblers). In 1967, he formed the rock band Elf, which became a regular opening act for Deep Purple. In 1975, Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore founded the band Rainbow and hired Dio to be his lead singer where the band released three studio albums. Dio quickly emerged as one of heavy rock's pre-eminent vocalists. In 1979, Dio joined Black Sabbath as lead singer. He appeared on three studio albums with the band which met with success: Heaven & Hell (1980) and Mob Rules (1981) and Dehumanizer (1992). In 1982, he left the band to pursue a solo career with two albums certified platinum by RIAA. In 2006, he founded the band Heaven & Hell with ex-bandmate Tony Iommi.

I hit marijuana 2 times can I pass a drug test next week? How many days after consuming marijuana can you pass a urine drug test? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"1. I hit marijuana 2 times can I pass a drug test next week? To answer this question, I will analyze the factors that determine the detection time of marijuana in urine and assess the likelihood of passing a drug test in a week. Step 1: Determine the THC detection time. The detection time for THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) in urine depends on several factors, such as frequency of use, body fat percentage, metabolism, and overall health. For infrequent users, marijuana can typically be detected in urine for up to 3-4 days after consumption. For regular users, detection time can range from 5-30 days, depending on individual factors. Step 2: Assess the likelihood of passing a drug test. Since the user claims to have hit marijuana only 2 times, I would consider this infrequent use. Given that a week has passed since consumption, there is a good chance the user will pass a urine drug test next week. However, results can vary, and I cannot guarantee a negative result. 2. How many days after consuming marijuana can you pass a urine drug test? This question seeks information on the general detection time of marijuana in urine, rather than focusing on a specific individual case like Question 1. Step 1: Provide general THC detection time. As mentioned earlier, the detection time for THC in urine depends on several factors. For infrequent users, marijuana is detectable for 3-4 days after consumption, while for regular users, the detection time can range from 5-30 days. 3. Would you say that these questions are the same? The two questions are related, but they are not the same. The first question seeks information on a specific situation (passed a drug test after hitting marijuana 2 times with 1 week before testing), while the second question asks for general information on how long marijuana can be detected in a urine drug test."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Stoddard tells us how when he came to the town as young newly-graduated attorney at law he was bullied by a local tough outlaw named Liberty Valence (Lee Marvin), a gunman employed by the local cattle cartel directed to keep the town in line so that the barons could monopolize the local resources to insure their beef industry.He first meets Valance when the stagecoach he is travelling in is ambushed by the outlaw and his companions.Stoddard tries to stop him from robbing a woman but he is knocked out.When Valance discovers he is a law graduate,he whips him several times,before he and his friends wander off into the night.Early the next morning,Doniphon and his friend Pompey (Woody Strode) take the unconscious Stoddard into Shinbone to rest up at Hallie's place where she runs a steakhouse.Bumbling and cowardly marshal,Link Appleyard (Andy Devine) arrives and is horrified to find out that they want him to capture Valance.He tries his best to come up with excuses about how the jurisdiction prevents him from doing anything about it,which is what the residents have come to expect from him.On one boisterous night,newspaper publisher Dutton Peabody leaves his office and runs into Appleyard who is petrified because he knows Valance is in town.Peabody goes to the restaurant for dinner,where Stoddard is helping out in the kitchen as a way of earning his keep.While he's washing the dishes,he's reading up on a law book about the marshal's jurisdiction and how he can get Valance.He finds some useful information and...

UPDATED:. 18:32 EST, 14 August 2013. The amount of rubbish each of us recycled went down last year for the first time in three decades. The setback follows three years in which the growth in household rubbish recycling had slowed to a crawl. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs revealed that in the past year the amount of recycled material produced by the average individual in England actually fell, from 186kg (410lb) per person to 185kg (407.8lb). After three years in which the growth in household rubbish recycling had slowed to a crawl, the amount of rubbish each of us recycled went down last year for the first time in three decades. No similar fall has been recorded since the early 1980s. The amount recycled by each individual more than doubled between 2004 – when fortnightly bin collections were introduced – and 2011. The department admitted earlier this year that published recycling figures are already ‘overestimates’ as a high proportion of material is too contaminated to be used. Instead the rejected rubbish is sent to landfill or incinerators. Between 2004 and 2010 recycling rates in England more than doubled, from 17.8 per cent of all the household waste collected to 39.7 per cent. The improvement from 2010 to 2012 was much slower, raising the recycling rate to 43 per cent. Much of this improvement has been caused by the reduction in the amount of rubbish left out, a result of council restrictions on collections. Defra admitted earlier this year that published recycling figures were 'overestimates' as a high proportion of material is too contaminated to be used. The amount of household waste collected in England, including recycling material, has fallen from 25.7million tons in 2005 to 22.9million last year. Total weight of recycling material collected from homes went up by just 1.25 per cent in the 12 months to March 2012, from 9.7 million tonnes to 9.8 million tonnes. The recycling figures worked out according to how much recycling is produced by each individual take into account the effect on rubbish collections of the country’s fast-rising population. Numbers of people in the country have been going up by around 400,000 a year since 2005. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article can be summarized as follows: 1. For the first time in three decades, the amount of rubbish each individual in England recycled declined last year. It fell from 186kg (410lb) per person to 185kg (407.8lb). This follows a slowdown in the growth of household rubbish recycling over the previous three years. 2. No similar drop in recycled material produced by each individual has been recorded since the early 1980s. 3. Recycling rates in England rose significantly between 2004 and 2010, more than doubling from 17.8% to 39.7% of all household waste collected. However, between 2010 and 2012, the growth slowed down considerably to reach 43%. 4. The Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra) admitted that the published recycling figures are likely overestimated, as a high proportion of material is too contaminated to be used. Instead, the rejected rubbish is sent to landfill or incinerators. 5. The decline in household waste collection, including recycling material, has been attributed to local council restrictions on rubbish collections. Household waste collected across England fell from 25.7 million tons in 2005 to 22.9 million tons in 2012. 6. Total weight of recycling material collected from homes increased by only 1.25% from 9.7 million tonnes to 9.8 million tonnes from year ending March 2011 to March 2012. 7.

Which canal joins Loch Ness to the Moray Firth What is the answer?","completion":"The Caledonian Canal joins Loch Ness to the Moray Firth. The Caledonian Canal is a historic waterway that stretches across approximately 60 miles (97 kilometers) in the Scottish Highlands. It was designed by the distinguished Scottish engineer Thomas Telford and completed in 1822. The primary purpose of the canal was to create a navigable route for maritime vessels in order to avoid the treacherous waters around the north coast of Scotland. The Caledonian Canal connects the North Sea at the Moray Firth with the Atlantic Ocean at the southwestern end near Fort William. The canal includes a series of connecting natural freshwater lakes, known as lochs, with Loch Ness being one of them. Apart from Loch Ness, the canal also utilizes Loch Lochy, Loch Oich, and Loch Dochfour. Loch Ness, known for its mythical monster \\"Nessie,\\" is the second largest Scottish loch by surface area and the largest by volume, making it an important part of the Caledonian Canal system. The section of the Caledonian Canal that connects Loch Ness to the Moray Firth starts at the northeastern end of Loch Ness, specifically at Loch Dochfour, which is connected to the Loch Ness. The canal then extends further towards the northeast until it reaches the town of Inverness. From there, it opens up into the Moray Firth. The Caledonian Canal is a combination of both man-made canals and natural lochs. Out of the 60-mile-long canal, only about 22 miles (35 kilometers) are man-made, with the rest being the Scottish lochs. The canal is a remarkable engineering achievement with a total of 29 locks, 10 swing bridges, and 4 aqueducts along its length. Today, the Caledonian Canal is mainly used for recreational purposes, such as boating, fishing, and tourism, attracting visitors from around the world who come to explore its picturesque and serene waters, as well as the surrounding picturesque countryside. The canal holds significant historical, cultural, and economic value, making it an essential attraction in the Scottish Highlands."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer: A:","completion":"The tone of this product review is mixed, leaning towards negative. The reviewer states that the movie is \\"definitely not Arnie's best\\" and points out some elements they found corny, lacking beautiful women, and preferring a scene from another movie (Commando). However, the reviewer also mentions positive aspects such as enjoying a specific scene of Arnie driving and shooting while listening to a Rolling Stones song, and that they think he played his character reasonably well. Overall, the review highlights more negative aspects than positive ones, but it is not completely negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He says that \\"muscle contraction occurs when muscle fibers get shorter\\" and \\"muscles are bundles of fibers that can contract\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What contracts as it gets shorter?\\" is \\"muscle fibers\\" or \\"muscles.\\" The hint that the teacher provided states that muscle contraction occurs when muscle fibers get shorter and that muscles are bundles of fibers that can contract. This information confirms that muscle fibers are the specific answer to the question, and since muscles are essentially bundles of fibers that all function in a similar manner, both answers are acceptable. Muscle fibers are the individual thread-like structures that form the basic unit of muscles, and they are activated during muscle contraction. When these fibers contract, they cause the muscle as a whole to contract by pulling the ends of the muscle closer together. This process of muscle contraction is essential for various bodily movements, from simple tasks like blinking to more complex actions like running or lifting heavy objects. In conclusion, based on the hints provided by the teacher and the understanding of muscle anatomy and function, the best answer to the question \\"What contracts as it gets shorter?\\" would be \\"muscle fibers\\" or \\"muscles.\\" Both terms describe components necessary for producing the contraction and resulting in the shortening of the muscular structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 49ers' cornerback played like a past-his-prime player in Philadelphia last season, and defensive coordinator Vic Fangio questioned whether Asomugha had \\"gas left in his tank\\" early in training camp. Asomugha, 32, has since done more than just putter along in the preseason. In three exhibition games, Asomugha has allowed one catch for 5 yards in 39 snaps in pass coverage, according to Pro Football Focus. Quarterbacks have tossed four passes in his direction and have a 39.6 passer rating when targeting him. As a result, Old Man Asomugha will have a new title when the 49ers open the regular season against Green Bay on Sept. 8: No. 3 cornerback. Fangio said Asomugha has overtaken Tramaine Brock for that role, which had been filled by Chris Culliver before he sustained a season-ending ACL tear in training camp. Asomugha jumped ahead while Brock was dealing with an injury the past few weeks. Asomugha, who wore a noncontact jersey in practice Tuesday, is himself at less than full strength. Still, Fangio said he has won the No. 3 spot. \\"He's done well in his reps that he's had in the game and in practice,\\" Fangio said. \\"Particularly the last two or three weeks, he's played much better.\\" Asomugha isn't a starter, but he'll be a major contributor. Last season, Culliver played 64 percent of the defensive snaps. This season, the No. 3 cornerback probably will log similar time as the 49ers face a schedule that includes nine games against quarterbacks who finished among the top 10 in passer rating last season. Fangio said he doesn't plan to monitor Asomugha's snaps because of his age. The 10-year veteran clearly has answered some of the questions Fangio had during training camp. \\"He's still playing at a good enough level to be a major part of our defense,\\" he said. If Asomugha falters, the 49ers could turn to Brock or, later in the season, Eric Wright, who reported to the team this week and will spend the first six weeks of the season on the non-football injury list. Wright, 28, is a six-year veteran who has made 81 starts since he was a second-round pick in 2007. He recently was viewed as a top-end cornerback - he signed a five-year, 37.5 million deal with Tampa Bay last year - but has since struggled on and off the field. He was signed Aug. 8 but was away from the team while addressing what general manager Trent Baalke termed a \\"personal matter.\\" The 49ers, of course, hope Asomugha recaptures his Pro Bowl form so they won't need to consider Plan B. Asomugha, who began the summer competing for a roster spot, said he's not surprised by his ascent. He knew he wasn't ready for the early-bird special just yet. \\"I've just been going out and just working each day,\\" he said. \\"I know my abilities, I know I can help the team. ... It's just letting everything unfold, playing as best as I could.\\" Backup bonanza: Fangio said the 49ers would rest a \\"good bit\\" of their defensive starters in Thursday's preseason finale at San Diego. He indicated rookie safety Eric Reid would be among those who wouldn't play, noting the first-round pick has played 116 snaps in the first three preseason games. On Sunday, Jim Harbaugh said quarterback Colin Kaepernick probably will play. In last year's preseason finale against the Chargers, the offensive linemen were the only members of the first-string offense to play one full drive.

E-mail: ebranch@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @Eric_Branch What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The San Francisco 49ers' cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha, despite concerns over his age and last season's performance with the Philadelphia Eagles, has proven to be a key player in the preseason games. He will be serving as the team's No. 3 cornerback for the opening of the regular season against Green Bay. Asomugha, 32, was initially questioned by Defensive Coordinator Vic Fangio about his abilities, however, he won the No. 3 spot by showing considerable improvement over the past few weeks. Asomugha is anticipated to be a significant contributor, as the No. 3 cornerback is expected to play a good portion of the defensive snaps. Despite Asomugha's considerable skill and contribution, the team also has backup options like Tramaine Brock and Eric Wright, in case Asomugha's performance falters. Asomugha confidently acknowledges his skills and commitment to the team, and seems to be more than ready for the regular season."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This begins with the grisly scene of a man shouting as he is dragged to the wheel to be broken. The scene ends with the gory aftermath: the bloodied body lying on the wheel. An artistic discussion occurs between Theophanes the Greek and Father Kirill. Theophanes asks him to become his assistant. Kirill says he will, if the master will come to the monastery and ask for him personally, in front of all the monks. To his bitter disappointment, he sends someone else, to ask for Andrei instead. Andrei agrees to go, but Danila refuses, when Andrei asks him to accompany him. Andrei is devastated. The next morning, he goes to Danilas cell and confesses, We have shared the same cell for years.

What is the answer: In 1867 Samuel B Fay of the United States was awarded the first patent for which piece of office equipment","completion":"In 1867, Samuel B. Fay of the United States was awarded the first patent for the paper clip, an essential piece of office equipment that has been widely used ever since. The patent, granted on April 23 of that year, was titled \\"Improvement in Paper-Files.\\" Samuel Fay's invention was primarily designed to hold tickets together, helping people keep track of their tickets and paperwork. The paper clip, as we know it today, is a small piece of plastic-coated or metal wire shaped into loops to hold together sheets of paper by friction and compression. This simple yet ingenious design has withstood the test of time, serving as a staple in offices, schools, and homes. It has become an indispensable and universally recognized tool. Fay's invention led to others developing and patenting various designs and improvements upon the humble paper clip throughout the years. One example would be the \\"Gem\\" paper clip, patented in Britain in the late 19th century. The Gem paper clip, characterized by its double-oval shape, is the most recognizable and most common form of paper clip today. While Samuel B. Fay is credited with the first patent for a paper clip, it is essential to note that paper fastening devices might have existed before his invention. However, without proper documentation or patent information, tracing the exact origins of these early devices remains a challenge. Over the years, paper clips have not only been used for their intended purpose but also as a versatile tool in various situations. During World War II, they were symbolically worn by Norwegians to signify unity and resistance against the Nazi occupation. This seemingly small and mundane object played a significant role in expressing support for freedom and human rights. Furthermore, paper clips have been used in life hacks and other creative solutions. These include unlocking doors, fixing broken zippers, cleaning small spaces, or even serving as makeshift bookmarks. The humble paper clip is not only a symbol of ingenuity in the office equipment world but also in practical everyday life. In conclusion, Samuel B. Fay was awarded the first patent for the paper clip in 1867. His simple yet innovative design was primarily intended to keep tickets together, but it quickly became an essential piece of office equipment that has continued to evolve over time. Even today, paper clips are still widely used across the globe, showcasing their timeless importance in the realm of organizing documents and even finding use in innovative and makeshift solutions to various problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David. Semira has Varga, her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity. With Selene in her power, Semira begins draining her blood, which she intends to drink to steal her power. Thomas and David attempt a rescue, but are attacked by Semira and Varga. Thomas is killed, but David and Selene escape. The pair takes refuge at the Nordic Coven, pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira. At Var Dohr, the Nordic Coven stronghold, Elder Vidar reveals that David is the son of High Elder Amelia, and thus the legitimate heir to the Eastern Coven. Meanwhile, Alexia has told Marius, who is secretly her lover, that Selene is going to the Nordic Coven. Marius and his Lycans attack that coven. Selene and David fight alongside the Nordic vampires, who are led by Vidar's daughter Lena. Selene engages Marius in single combat, but he is too powerful in werewolf form, and she is stabbed by Alexia. Marius demands to know Eve's location, but Selene insists she does not know; Alexia confirms this after tasting blood from her sword. Marius sounds the retreat.

An earthquake kills both men and devastates the city. In the aftermath, Jenny gives birth to a son, whom she names Dan. With financial help from crooked lawyer Steve Dutton, who himself came from the Tenderloin, she sets herself up in the vice trade, providing women on demand. Jenny has one loyal friend, the Chinese woman Amah, who helps take care of the baby. At a party in Steve's honor, he catches gambler Ed Harris (an uncredited J. Carrol Naish) cheating him in a back room. In the ensuing struggle, Steve kills him, with Jenny the only eyewitness. The pair are unable to dispose of the body before it is found and are questioned by the police. However, neither is charged. The scandal forces Jenny to temporarily give up her baby to a very respectable couple who owe Steve a favor to keep the child from being taken away from her. After three years, she tries to take her son back, but the boy clings to the only mother he can remember, so she leaves him where he is.

Metropolitan Police Department This screen grab from body camera footage released by Las Vegas police, Wednesday, May 2, 2018, shows the moment officers breached the Oct. 1 gunmanճ Mandalay Bay suite. Metropolitan Police Department In a 32nd-floor stairwell outside the gunman’s Mandalay Bay suite, a group of officers shoot silent glances at one another and cover their ears. “Breach, breach, breach,” one says before a loud explosion booms nearby. The group appears unfazed. It’s the night of Oct. 1, about an hour after Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest festival crowd, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more. These officers are about to enter the suite that served as Paddock’s vantage point, and the moment can be seen in police body camera footage released Wednesday after a lengthy court battle. The newly released videos, which amount to about two hours and 42 minutes of footage, grant the public its first peek into officers’ movements on the night of the tragedy. The Metropolitan Police Department is under court order to produce many more video records like it, as well as 911 calls from Oct. 1. As the footage continues, a fire alarm begins blaring — a result of the explosive charge that blew Paddock’s door. The officers do not react to it. Instead, together, they move slowly and quietly out of the stairwell. As one officer rounds the corner, he spots a rifle on the ground, just inside Paddock’s doorway — it’s one of 23 like it that police would soon find strewn about Paddock’s suite. “On the ground, with a bipod, to the right,” the officer says, describing the weapon. The first officer to enter the suite, Levi Hancock, did not activate his body camera, so the public will never see those first few seconds inside the room from which Paddock wreaked much of his havoc. Instead, the footage comes from two K-9 officers — Sgt. Joshua Bitsko and David Newton. Both entered Paddock’s rooms a short time after Hancock. Paddock’s body already had been found on the floor. Police did not say which videos belonged to which officer. Race to scene The videos, which were released in eight different segments — four for each officer — begin inside each officer’s respective squad car shortly after the tragedy began to unfold. In one clip, through an officer’s windshield, the golden glow of Mandalay Bay grows brighter and brighter as he races closer and closer to the scene. In the background, police radio traffic describes the mass shooting scene as it grows progressively more dire. Once inside the hotel, the officers walk the casino floor, guns drawn. They can be heard directing people to take cover and lock doors. “Keep looking at these people coming out,” one says to another officer. “Watch for weapons. Watch for weapons of the people coming out.” A short time later, the police in the casino link up in teams and begin their ascent on a guest elevator to the 28th floor. None of the footage released Wednesday shows any scenes from the festival venue. Tense confrontation As officers work to clear floors and evacuate guests, a brief confrontation is caught on video — with other officers. It happens as one team rounds into the hallway of the 29th floor and runs right into another group of people with guns drawn — a different team of Metro officers. “Metro police, Metro police, Metro police!” an officer from the first team shouts. “Police, police, police! Guns down, guns down!” “Friendly, friendly, friendly,” another officer says, indicating that the group they encountered was in fact made up of other officers. “OK, it’s friendly, friendly!” another shouts. “Friendly,” another clarifies. After the brief moment of tension, an officer from the first team instructs the other team to stay on the 29th floor and finish clearing rooms “so we’re not aiming guns at each other.” “Copy that!” another says. Then the first team heads to the 32nd floor. Shortly after the first breach, police regather in Paddock’s suite and prepare to set off a second explosion — this time on the connecting door between the already cleared suite and the second room Paddock rented. Just like the first time, a loud boom goes off. But this time, just after the blast, a SWAT officer fires what police previously described as a negligent, three-round burst from his rifle. It can be heard on the newly released video. “Where did that other shot come from?” an officer asks. “Was that us?” In a report issued in January, Las Vegas police identified a “SWAT officer O’Donnell” as the officer who fired the rounds. The last video concludes with officers beginning to sort through Paddock’s belongings, locating his wallet, his driver’s license and Marilou Danley’s casino players card. “We need to get Mesquite (police) over to his address,” one officer says. Paddock shared a home in Mesquite with Danley, his girlfriend. Police have said she had no involvement in the mass shooting. Court battle In the days after the tragedy, the Las Vegas Review-Journal and other media organizations requested all body camera footage and 911 calls from the mass shooting. The department denied the request, and a court battle ensued. A Clark County district judge ruled in February that the records should be released. He gave Metro 30 days to comply. But Metro contested, saying it would take much longer to produce the records and that it would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In March, the same judge gave Metro a total of six months to fulfill the request but ordered the department to immediately begin releasing the records on a “rolling basis.” The judge also ruled that the department could not charge journalists exorbitant fees to produce the records. Metro appealed to a different district judge and then to the Nevada Supreme Court. On Friday, a Supreme Court decision compelled Metro to begin releasing the footage and audio. By comparison, authorities in Florida released 911 calls from the Parkland high school shooting less than a month after the Feb. 14 tragedy. In January, the Review-Journal and other media organizations successfully sued for the release of search warrant and autopsy records from the Oct. 1 shooting.

Breach. Breach,\\" a voice said on a police radio. Then, a loud blast was heard. Las Vegas police on Wednesday released body camera footage from officers who entered Paddock's hotel suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino immediately after October's mass shooting. The footage showed the moments before officers swarmed the room, where Paddock's body was discovered. The video also shows police sweeping the premises. Paddock, 64, killed 58 people and injured almost 500 when he opened fire on 22,000 concertgoers. One video clip shows that police moved forward after the explosion and waited in a doorway as the hotel's alarm went off. \\"There's a 413 on the ground,\\" an officer said, giving the police code for a person with a gun. Officers approached Paddock's door, which was blocked by a room service cart. \\"Looks like it might be a camera of some sort,\\" one officer said. Officers noted there were also multiple cameras, according to the footage. More officers rushed past. \\"Hold on, hold on,\\" another officer said. As officers entered the suite, they noticed more cameras pointing down the hallway, and that the rooms were connected. Officers cleared the suite room by room, searching under the bed and in closets with dogs. 911 call audio will also be released. Sheriff Joe Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said video footage, 911 call audio and documents relating to the October 1 massacre would be released on a rolling basis starting with the body camera footage from two officers. \\"I don't know how this footage will be played in the media, but I want to warn you, if you are a survivor or a family who lost a loved one, you should know the video from this concert is disturbing and graphic,\\" he said.

Hide Caption 30 of 30 Lombardo said he expected the materials would be released weekly but would not say if the information would be posted on a website or emailed to media. Court ordered release of footage The Nevada Supreme Court ruled Friday that police had to release the bodycam footage and 911 call audio from the shooting. Police had appealed an earlier ruling that the material be released, following requests by media, including CNN. Lombardo denied that police were trying to be uncooperative. In a press briefing Tuesday, he cited cost, allocation of resources and potential further victimization of those affected by the shooting as reasons for delaying the release of footage, recordings and documents. For example, the department had to reassign detectives from their \\"primary responsibility\\" to go over the reports and footage before they were made public, and some personnel would have to endure reliving the shooting, he said. \\"I want the community to know the release of the videos, 911 and documents will have a significant impact on the victims of this tragedy. We believe the release of the graphic footage will further traumatize a wounded community,\\" he said. \\"And for that, we apologize.\\" Lombardo said no employees will be made available for interviews, but said a final comprehensive report on the shooting will come. Criticism of police Police were criticized about their response when a timeline suggested there had been a six-minute delay between Paddock shooting a security guard and the gunman opening fire on the crowds below his hotel suite. The timeline raised questions about why police didn't arrive on the scene sooner. \\"In the public space, the word 'incompetence' has been brought forward. And I am absolutely offended with that characterization,\\" Lombardo said on October 13 He said that during the six-minute gap, the security guard had been trying to access Paddock's room -- and that he had been shot around the same time the gunman started firing on concertgoers. \\"So there is no conspiracy between the FBI, between the (Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department) and MGM (the hotel owner). Nobody is attempting to hide anything in reference to this investigation,\\" Lombardo said at the time. \\"The dynamics and the size of this investigation requires us to go through voluminous amounts of information in order to draw an accurate picture.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short version of a longer piece of writing, like a story or article.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: In-line skating is a fun sport that everyone can enjoy. Follow these safety tips to keep skating safe and fun. Step 1: Gear up! Even before you put on your skates, put on all your safety gear . Step 2: Buckle up! Strap on your skates. Make sure they fit well and are snugly around your ankles. This helps your ankles stay strong and straight. Step 3: Fall down! You probably do not usually try to fall. But it is good to practice falling on skates. Fall forward onto your knee pads. Put out your hands and let your wrist guards hit the ground. See? Are you surprised that it doesn't hurt? Practice falling until it is easy to fall forward and get up again. If you are not afraid to fall, you will try new things. Knowing how to fall will help you be a better skater and find your balance. When you can stay balanced, you won't fall as much. Step 4: Stop! Make sure you can stop on your skates. The quickest and safest is probably the brake stop. The brake is usually on the back of the right skate. The brake stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Let your right skate roll a little forward. Bend your knees as if you are sitting down. Then press your right heel down hard. This will make your brake pad drag on the ground until you stop. The T stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Then turn your right foot out so the toes are pointing to your right. Drag your right skate. Let the wheels drag on the ground until you come to a stop. Another way to stop is to run or jump onto the grass. Step 5: Roll around! Find a flat, smooth place to practice. Do not skate in streets.

Q:GoDaddy has pulled the plug on another online peddler of violence. The popular internet registration service last week shut down altright.com, a website created by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer and popular with many in the so-called alt-right movement. The takedown is the latest example of how companies like GoDaddy are increasingly responding to growing public pressure to clamp down on violent sites in the wake of the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer. GoDaddy, which registers domains for more than 75 million websites around the world, said it generally does not delist sites that promote hate, racism and bigotry on the ground that such content is protected as free speech. But it said altright.com had \\"crossed the line and encouraged and promoted violence in a direct and threatening manner.\\" \\"In instances where a site goes beyond the mere exercise of these freedoms, however, and crosses over to promoting, encouraging or otherwise engaging in specific acts of violence against any person, we will take action,\\" GoDaddy said in a statement emailed to VOA. The company would not say whether it canceled altright.com's domain registration in response to pressure but it stressed that \\"we take all complaints about content on websites very seriously, and have a team dedicated to investigate each complaint.\\" The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a Washington-based civil rights organization, said it filed such a complaint with GoDaddy last month, citing several instances in which altright.com carried content that advocated violence. In one example, a January 26, 2018, article encouraged \\"use of live ammunition at the border, in order to create a substantial chance that they [immigrants crossing the border] lose their life in the process,\\" according to the organization's complaint.

Question: Who is playing against FA Cup winners Liverpool at Wembley? Movie title: The Damned United Movie plot: After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie (Colm Meaney), the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5â0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner (Stephen Graham) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them 3-1, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.[5] Taylor then suffers a heart attack, and Clough tries to...

Answer the above question based on the context below: By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.

Robert Lewis Bridges III, 24, has been in jail since February charged with four crimes in connection with a burglary. But he will face an additional two charges when he finally gets his day before a judge after attempting to grab the .40-caliber gun from a Deputy at the Hillsborough County Court, Florida. Dramatic CCTV footage taken from court cameras shows the moment Master Sgt Tracey Wallace managed to prevent Bridges from grabbing her weapon. Scroll down for video. Desperate lunch: Robert Lewis Bridges III is pictured leaping up from the bench at Hillsborough County Court, Florida, and making a grab for Sgt Tracey Wallace's gun. Audacious attempt: Handcuffed Bridges uses both hands to try and grab the .40-caliber gun from the Sergeant's belt. Defence: But the quick thinking officer is prepared for Bridges's attack and manages to slap his hand away from her holster. The footage shows Bridges and two other prisoners sat on a side bench waiting for their case to be heard by Circuit Judge Martha Cook, when Master Sgt Wallace walks across the courtroom in front of them. Despite being shackled and handcuffed, Bridges manages to leap up from the bench and attempts to grab the gun from Sgt Wallace's belt holster with both hands. But the quick thinking officer manages to evade Bridges lunge slapping his hand away from her belt. Two other officers then rush to her aid and pin Bridges down before he is led away to a holding room. Help: As the sergeant briefly tussles with Bridges, two other officers rush to her aid. Thwarted: Sgt Wallace looks on as her two colleagues restrain the man, pinning him down on the bench. Drama: Bridges is led away to a holding cell as fellow inmates and court officials look on.

Please answer the following question: Process: - You find an empty ice cube tray - You fill the tray with warm water - You carefully place the tray on an even surface in a freezer that is at least 32 degree Farhenheit, the freezing point of water - The water begins to get colder until it starts to freeze solid - The water expands as it freezes, one of the few liquids that has greater volume as a solid - Because you used warm water, the gasses in the water had evaporated out, so you will have nice clear ice cubes without cracks from the trapped gasses - suppose there has just been a heavy rainfall happens, how will it affect there will be less water put into the tray. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The heavy rainfall is indirectly impacting a step of the process. Here's why: A heavy rainfall is an environmental condition that is external to the basic outlined steps of making ice cubes, which include filling the tray with water, positioning it in a freezer, and allowing the water to freeze. The rainfall does not directly influence any of these steps, as they can proceed independently whether or not it rains. However, the question specifically inquires about a hypothetical scenario where there would be less water put into the tray due to the heavy rainfall. This introduces an indirect effect, as the amount of water available or used for the process might be influenced as a result. Perhaps in the context this question is proposed, heavy rainfall means that the water supply is being conserved or rationally used for more important needs or emergencies (like saving rainfall water for plants or emergency supplies). As a result, less water might be used to fill the ice tray. In this instance, the rainfall is influencing, even if indirectly, the input to the process — the amount of water. It's important to note that the actual freezing process or methodology of creating ice wouldn't inherently change with rainfall; rather, it introduces an external factor that might cause adjustment in how the process is performed, impacting the water amount to be frozen.

They have a beginning, a middle, and an end-- with ads thrown in every three or four minutes. The ads are unavoidable. They happen whether you want them or not. Every couple of minutes a billboard appears outside the bus window.\\"Buy Super Clean Toothpaste.\\"\\"Drink Good'n Wet Root Beer.\\"\\"Fill up with Pacific Gas.\\" Only if you sleep, which is equal to turning the television set off, are you spared the unending cry of \\"You Need It! Buy It Now!\\" The beginning of the ride is comfortable and somewhat exciting, even if you've traveled that way before. Usually some things have changed--new houses, new buildings, sometimes even a new road. The bus driver has a style of driving and it's fun to try to figure it out the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly daring, the ride can be as exciting as a suspense story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right or the left-hand lane?After a while, of course, the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride. Food always makes bus rides more interesting. But you've got to be careful of what kind of food you eat. Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops. The end of the ride is somewhat like the beginning. You know it will soon be over and there's a kind of expectation and excitement in that. The seat, of course, has become harder as the hours have passed. By now you've sat with your legs crossed, with your hands in your lap, with your hands on the arm rests--even with your hands crossed behind your head. The end comes just at the right time. There are just no more ways to sit.

Options: - plain - cold - dull - bad - wet The answer is \\"wet\\" because A:","completion":"After observing some beautiful clouds above you, there is a possibility that you may get \\"wet.\\" This is because clouds serve as indicators of atmospheric conditions that could result in various types of weather events. So, why is being wet a potential outcome after seeing clouds? Let's delve deeper into this phenomenon and the supporting factors. Clouds form when warm, moist air rises upward, cools, and condenses around tiny dust particles or other aerosols at a certain altitude. The type of cloud and the height at which it forms will depend on the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere. With over ten different cloud classifications, each represents different visual cues related to imminent weather events. Some of the beautiful clouds you may see above you indicate that rain or other precipitation events are in the forecasts, such as: 1. Cumulonimbus clouds: Towering and striking in appearance, these clouds indicate that thunderstorms may be on the horizon. As moisture-laden air is lifted by powerful updrafts, excessive condensation occurs, leading to heavy rain, hail, or even snow. 2. Nimbostratus clouds: Characterized by their low, dark, and featureless appearance, these clouds often signal that steady, extended periods of rain or snow are imminent. The sheet-like structure allows them to cover large areas, potentially leaving you wet with persistent precipitation. 3. Stratocumulus clouds: While these low, lumpy clouds do not necessarily produce heavy rainfall, they can still result in light to moderate rain or drizzle. 4. Altostratus clouds: These high-level, gray or bluish clouds often indicate that a warm front is approaching. As a result, there's a likelihood of light to moderate precipitation in the form of either rain or snow. Considering these cloud types, it's evident that after observing beautiful clouds, you may find yourself caught in a rainfall event that could leave you wet. However, not all clouds will lead to precipitation. For instance, cirrus and cumulus clouds typically pose little to no threat of rain. Nevertheless, it is crucial to always be prepared for any weather event, as changes in atmospheric conditions can sometimes occur rapidly and without warning. In conclusion, the answer \\"wet\\" implies that after seeing certain beautiful clouds above you, there is a possibility of experiencing rainfall or other wet weather conditions. This is because clouds often serve as indicators of weather events such as rain, snow, or even thunderstorms. Therefore, after witnessing beautiful clouds in the sky, it would be wise to prepare yourself for the chance of getting wet, depending on the type and appearance of the clouds."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

OPTIONS: [+] negative; [+] positive;","completion":"Given the content of the tweet, it can be a bit challenging to definitively pinpoint the sentiment as it depends largely on the context of the linked content. However, based on the text of the tweet itself, we can infer the sentiment of the user and their request for comments on the photo. Let's break down the tweet and analyze the crucial elements that may indicate sentiment: 1. \\"again again again\\": This repeated phrase might not directly indicate any sentiment, but it does show a sense of urgency or persistence from the user's side in seeking comments on the photo. It could be interpreted as positive in a sense that the user is excited about their photo and eager to receive comments, or it could be seen as mild frustration due to lack of engagement which might lead to a slightly negative sentiment. 2. \\"if you have flickr, please to comment on this one\\": This part of the tweet demonstrates politeness from the user (the use of \\"please\\" and the non-aggressive tone) and a genuine request for engagement. This could be taken as a neutral or mildly positive sentiment, since it's a friendly ask for users to participate in the conversation. 3. \\"this is a very personal photo\\": The fact that the user mentions that the photo is very personal could also add to the sentiment analysis. It means that the user is sharing something important and emotionally tied to themselves. When users share personal content, they may be seeking support, empathy, or validation, which could indicate a positive sentiment, as it shows vulnerability and openness from their side. However, it could also imply a mild negative sentiment, given that the context of sharing something personal might be stemming from a need for reassurance or a feeling of inadequacy. Considering all these aspects, it is evident that the sentiment of the tweet is not purely negative or purely positive. With that said, I would suggest that it's a mix of sentiments leaning towards positive and neutral: [+] positive;"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Information: - The Constitution for the Kingdom of the Netherlands is one of two fundamental documents governing the Kingdom of the Netherlands as well as the fundamental law of the European territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The present constitution is generally seen as directly derived from the one issued in 1815, constituting a constitutional monarchy. A revision in 1848 instituted a system of parliamentary democracy. In 1983, a major revision of the constitution was undertaken, almost fully rewriting the text and adding new civil rights. The text is very sober, devoid of legal or political doctrine. It includes a bill of rights. The constitution prohibits the judiciary to test laws and treaties against the constitution, as this is considered a prerogative of the legislature. There is no constitutional court in the Netherlands, except for the Constitutional Court of Sint Maarten which only governs the Sint Maarten legislator. The Kingdom of the Netherlands also includes Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten: there is an overarching instrument of the entire kingdom that has constitution characterisics: the Statute of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. - The Amsterdam metropolitan area is the city region around the city of Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands. It lies in the Noordvleugel (\\"North Wing\\") of the larger polycentric Randstad metropolitan area and encompasses the city of Amsterdam, the Dutch provinces of North Holland and Flevoland, as well as 36 further municipalities within these two provinces, with a total population of over 2.4 million inhabitants. - The Kingdom of the Netherlands , commonly known as the Netherlands, is a sovereign state and constitutional monarchy with territory in western Europe and in the Caribbean. - The Randstad is a megalopolis in the central-western Netherlands consisting primarily of the four largest Dutch cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht) and their surrounding areas.

However, it does not specifically address the question of the plane's ability to remain in the air or its duration of flight. To answer the question, we can provide more information about the Solar Impulse and its capabilities, specifically focusing on its ability to remain airborne. Solar Impulse is a solar-powered aircraft designed with the goal of achieving long-duration flights without the need for conventional fuel. It has two main versions: Solar Impulse 1 and Solar Impulse 2. Both aircraft utilize solar cells that cover their wings' surface, which charge batteries that, in turn, power the electric motors providing thrust. Solar Impulse 1 was mainly a proof-of-concept aircraft, and it had limited flight duration. It was able to remain in the air for up to 26 hours using only solar power. However, the more advanced Solar Impulse 2 was designed for longer-duration flights, and it has demonstrated the ability to stay airborne for several days. The most notable achievement of Solar Impulse 2, and a more direct answer to the question, is its round-the-world journey completed between 2015 and 2016. During this journey, the aircraft flew for over 500 hours and covered approximately 43,000 kilometers (26,718 miles), while achieving several long-duration flight segments. The longest segment was from Japan to Hawaii, lasting nearly 118 hours (approximately 5 days) and covering a distance of about 8,900 kilometers (5,529 miles). This flight showcased the aircraft's ability to remain in the air for extended periods using only solar power. In conclusion, the Solar Impulse 2, as a solar-powered plane, is capable of remaining in the air for several days, with its record being close to 5 days of continuous flight. However, the given sentence does not provide a valid answer to the question, as it does not discuss the aircraft's flight duration capabilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Connecting with Patients Dr. Paris often treats several generations of a family over many years. \\"He's seen us through two births, one operation, multiple earaches, a broken wrist and a recovery from a serious traffic crash,\\" says Jill Farrow, a 43-year-old lawyer whose first visit to Dr. Paris was as a teenager. During the birth of her younger son, Farrow began bleeding badly. Dr. Paris managed to solve the problem in a delicate procedure. \\"Twenty years ago, she probably would have died,\\" he says. Today, when he performs school sports physical examinations for the Farrow boys, 10 and 11, he is always reminded that lives are changed forever by doctors just doing their jobs. To be a mix of country doc and somewhat adventurer, the 55-year-old family physician moved to Hailey after completing his residency . He hoped to practice medicine there and ski at nearby Sun Valley. Unfortunately, the only job opening was for an emergency-room doctor in Missoula, Montana, 300 miles away. Dr. Paris took it. \\"I'd ski all day and then drive all night to be in Missoula for a 48-hour shift,\\" he recalls. \\"I'm lucky to be alive.\\" Knowing he couldn't keep up with his eight-hour commute , he began taking flying lessons. In 1981, Dr. Paris joined a small medical practice in Hailey, a former mining town with a population at the time of 2,109. As Hailey grew in the shadow of Sun Valley's booming popularity, Dr. Paris's own practice expanded to seven physicians, including his wife, Kathryn Woods, who is also a family doctor. They met in 1986 at a certification exam in Denver when, in a room full of men in stodgy suits, Woods arrived wearing a Lycra biking outfit and carrying the front wheel of her bicycle (which she couldn't lock up outside). Dr. Paris asked her out on the spot. In 1989, they married. Question: Dr. Paris often reminds himself that _ .

It means the UK will have 24 F35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft available on its two new aircraft carriers by 2023. Mr Osborne told the BBC it would put the UK second only to the US in carrier aircraft capability. \\"We are going to step up the aircraft carrier punch of the United Kingdom. We are going to make sure that when these aircraft carriers are available, they are going to have planes that can fly from them in force,\\" he said. \\"By 2023, we will be able to have these jets - some of the most powerful in the world - the F35, on the decks of these carriers and Britain, second only to the United States, will be able to project power abroad in order to defend ourselves at home.\\" The government had proposed to have only eight of the US-built fighters available for deployment to the new carriers HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales in that timeframe. The 18 others on order will be used in the training fleet or in maintenance, according to the Sunday Times. In Monday's defence review, David Cameron is also expected to commit the UK to purchasing 138 F35 jets overall and over a longer period of time. The prime minister will also announce the purchase of new reconnaissance planes - to replace the Nimrod spy planes scrapped in George Osborne's 2010 spending review, according to The Guardian. Mr Osborne pledged in his summer Budget to meet Nato's target of spending 2% of national income on defence every year, up to 2020.

Earth has mostly liquid water. But that's not the case with other celestial objects. Venus has some water, but it is in gaseous state. On the other hand, water in Jupiter's moon Europa is in frozen state. and a hint : Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100°C (212°F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism. El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers. Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex iconography. Some of these commentators, such as Antonio Palomino and Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, described his mature work as \\"contemptible\\", \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"worthy of scorn\\". The views of Palomino and Bermúdez were frequently repeated in Spanish historiography, adorned with terms such as \\"strange\\", \\"queer\\", \\"original\\", \\"eccentric\\" and \\"odd\\". The phrase \\"sunk in eccentricity\\", often encountered in such texts, in time developed into \\"madness\\".With the arrival of Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century, El Greco's works were examined anew. To French writer Théophile Gautier, El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme. Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero (the \\"gifted\\", the \\"misunderstood\\", the \\"mad\\"), and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco's later technique. French art critics Zacharie Astruc and Paul Lefort helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting. In the 1890s, Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor. However, in the popular English-speaking imagination he remained the man who \\"painted horrors in the Escorial\\" in the words of Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia in 1899.In 1908, Spanish art historian Manuel Bartolomé Cossío published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works; in this book El Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School.

At which Park did Yeats feel moved to write a poem about the wild swans????","completion":"William Butler Yeats, the renowned Irish poet, dramatist, and Nobel laureate, was moved to write his famous poem \\"The Wild Swans at Coole\\" at Coole Park in County Galway, Ireland. Coole Park, situated near the village of Gort, was the estate of Lady Augusta Gregory, Yeats's close friend, patron, and the co-founder of the Irish Literary Theatre. Over the years, Yeats spent many periods in Coole Park, drawing inspiration from its alluring beauty, the diverse wildlife, and the peaceful environment. In the autumn of 1916, the poet found himself observing a flock of swans on the pond at Coole Park. The stark contrast between the bird's grace and the turbulence surrounding Ireland's fight for independence at the time moved him deeply. Consequently, Yeats documented the swans' idyllic beauty and his reflections on the passage of time in \\"The Wild Swans at Coole,\\" which went on to become one of his most admired and celebrated poems. The poem is renowned for its powerful imagery of swans, symbolizing grace, beauty, and eternity. It consists of five stanzas with six lines each and showcases Yeats's struggle with the harsh reality of aging and the impermanence of life, juxtaposed against the seemingly immortal swans. The wild swans become a metaphor for the unchanging nature of beauty, and as Yeats laments his own aging, the poem becomes an eloquent rumination on human existence's ephemeral quality. The park's tranquil setting and the enchanting sight of the swans had a profound impact on Yeats, inspiring him to create one of his most poignant, enduring works that continue to captivate readers' hearts and minds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Human rights abuses ‘leave a third of Libyans with mental health problems’ “Widespread and gross” human rights violations in Libya, including disappearances, arrests, torture and deaths, have left nearly a third of the population suffering from mental health problems as violence and lawlessness continues, according to a new report. Research by Dignity – the Danish Institute against Torture – shared with the Guardian, paints a devastating picture of the human consequences of the regionalism, tribalism and factionalism that have wracked the north African country since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi three-and-a-half years ago. A fifth of households (20%) had a family member who had disappeared, 11% reported having a household member arrested and 5% reported that one had been killed, researchers found. Of those arrested, 46% reported beatings, 20% positional torture or suspensions and 16% suffocation. Between 3% and 5% reported having suffered sexual, thermal or electrical torture. “Our data supports the allegations that widespread … and gross human rights violations have taken place in Libya,” says the report, which seeks to assess Libya’s mental health needs and was co-authored with Benghazi University. The survey is based on 2,692 household interviews and was completed in October 2013. The situation may have got worse since then, it concludes. Data revealed that 29% of individuals reported anxiety and 30% depression. Stress levels showed a preoccupation with political instability (63.6%) followed by the collapse of the country (61.2%), insecurity about “life right now” (56.6%) and insecurity about the future (46.4%). Nearly 30% reported being exposed to violence during demonstrations. Despite the ongoing crisis, respondents have had almost no access to international humanitarian assistance. Only 2% reported that NGOs had helped them. Libyans have overwhelmingly resorted to local resources for social support: 72% used family networks, 48% friends, 43% doctors, 24% religious leaders and 18% traditional healers. “Libya has a practice of not seeking help for psychological problems, and the few trained psychologists and psychiatrists have very limited experience of treating trauma and consequences of torture and war,” the report said. “In addition, severe social stigma exists regarding those affected by mental illness. Psychiatric symptoms are attributed to the act of pagan symbols like the evil eye, magic or sorcery.” Ahlam Chemlali, one of the Dignity field workers, recalled how “videos of rape and torture were so widespread and popular that people would name characters from the videos, like the ‘butcher from Misrata’ or the ‘rapist from Brega’ as if they were actors playing in a horror snuff movie. Filmed torture seems to have been a consistent way of spreading or exposing fear.” Internal displacement was also a major concern: 18% of respondents reported being displaced during the conflict and 16% remained so at the time of the interview. An estimated 35,000 people from Tawergha, accused by militias from Misrata of fighting with the Gaddafi regime, remain displaced. The report recalls the exhilaration in Benghazi when the Libyan revolution began in February 2011 but concludes that both the short-term consequences of the internal conflict and the long-term legacy of 42 years of Gaddafi’s rule remain unaddressed. Lack of trust, out of an ingrained fear of regime agents and informers, remains a powerful barrier to building a functional state based on democratic institutions and the rule of law. “Nobody could be trusted so you kept silent,” Morten Koch Andersen, another of the report’s authors, told the Guardian. “This also impacted our work for torture survivors. It was extremely difficult to get people to talk together, not to mention to work and plan for the future. They did not trust each other – even professionals on the same side of the conflict.” Gaddafi’s overthrow by rebels supported by Nato, some Gulf states and Turkey, was seen by many as an early success story of the Arab spring, but it soured quickly in the absence of strong national institutions and the mushrooming of rival militias. Strikingly, however, the report notes, almost a third of respondents experienced an improvement in their life situation after the Gaddafi’’s removal, despite political instability and parliament’s failure to agree on leadership and legal foundations for the nation, including a constitution. “The dream of a united, peaceful and democratic Libya, which dominated people’s hopes and political discourse in the wake of the downfall of Gaddafi’s regime, have given way to a vocabulary and practice of violence, fragmentation, fear and hostility,” the report says. “The future of Libya is uncertain, but as the results of the study show, the effects and consequences of violent conflict [are] deep and will influence Libyan society in the years to come, regardless of political system and rule. “Any future government of Libya faces massive challenges in alleviating human suffering and improving mental health. However, as the internal conflict continues, more and more people are affected by human rights violations, aggravating mental health afflictions, straining the social fabric and the capacity of the Libyan state.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The report by Dignity – the Danish Institute against Torture – outlines the dire situation in Libya, where \\"widespread and gross\\" human rights violations, including disappearances, arrests, torture, and deaths, have left nearly a third of the population suffering from mental health problems. The study is based on 2,692 household interviews and reveals that 20% of households had a family member who had disappeared, 11% reported having a household member arrested, and 5% reported a household member being killed. Due to continuous political instability and violence, 29% of individuals reported anxiety, and 30% reported depression. With limited access to international humanitarian assistance, only around 2% reported that NGOs had helped them. Most Libyans resorted to local resources for support, with 72% using family networks and 43% turning to doctors. The report highlights the lack of mental health treatment options in Libya, with few trained psychologists and psychiatrists who have experience dealing with trauma and the consequences of torture and war. The report concludes that political instability, lack of trust, internal displacement, and the long-term impact of 42 years of Gaddafi's rule remain unaddressed, creating major challenges for any future Libyan government in addressing human suffering and improving mental health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: How can I declutter my home","completion":"Decluttering your home can be a challenging but rewarding experience, as it can both physically and mentally create more space and peace of mind. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to declutter your home effectively. 1. Make a plan: Before you start decluttering, make a plan of action. This should include deciding which rooms or areas of your home you want to declutter, setting a realistic timeframe to complete the task, and determining the order in which you'll declutter each space. 2. Gather supplies: Before you begin to declutter, gather some basic supplies, such as bags or boxes for items to donate, trash bags for items you'll discard, and cleaning supplies, like cloths and all-purpose cleaner. 3. Establish categories: As you declutter, it's helpful to organize items into specific categories. Typical categories may include keep, donate, sell, recycle, and trash. This will help you stay focused on your decluttering goals and prioritize your decisions. 4. Use the Four-Box Method: Place four boxes or bags in each room you're decluttering, labeled \\"Keep,\\" \\"Donate,\\" \\"Sell,\\" and \\"Trash.\\" As you go through the items in the room, place each item into one of these categories. This method ensures you're making a conscious decision about each item and prevents items from simply being moved from one cluttered area to another. 5. Start small: Begin decluttering in small, manageable areas rather than tackling entire rooms at once. This could be a single drawer, a closet, or a surface with a lot of clutter. This helps to prevent overwhelm and keeps you motivated as you see progress. 6. Set time limits: Work in short, focused bursts of time, usually around 30 minutes to an hour. This will allow you to maintain momentum and avoid burnout. After each session, take a short break and then continue if you still have energy. 7. Handle items once: As you work through each area, handle each item only once. Make the decision to keep, donate, sell, or discard the item immediately, rather than putting it in a 'maybe' pile that can lead to procrastination and more clutter. 8. Create designated spaces: As you declutter, create designated spaces for items that are being kept, where they can be easily accessed when needed. This might mean investing in storage solutions such as shelves, bins, or drawer organizers. 9. Be ruthless: It's important to be honest with yourself about whether you genuinely need or want an item. Consider how often the item is used, its sentimental value, and whether it serves a function in your life. If it's not being used and is just taking up space, it's probably time to let it go. 10. Involve the family: If you live with family members or roommates, involve them in the decluttering process. Encourage everyone to take responsibility for their possessions and collaborate on shared spaces. 11. Regularly maintain: Once your home is decluttered, develop habits to maintain your newly organized spaces. Implement daily and weekly routines to put items away, clean surfaces, and evaluate new items entering your home. 12. Dispose responsibly: As you're decluttering, make sure to responsibly dispose of items. Donate items that are in good condition to local charities, recycle items that can be recycled, and properly dispose of hazardous materials. By following these steps and maintaining your efforts, you'll create a more organized and peaceful living environment within your home."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The ‘Submarine Sports Car’, inspired by James Bond's famous sub-Lotus, is powered by an electric motor that allows it to reach a maximum speed of 75mph (121kph) below the waves. It claims to be the only vehicle that drives as well underwater as it does across land. Underwater love? The ‘Submarine Sports Car’ (pictured) is powered by an electric motor which allows it to reach a maximum speed of 75mph (121kph) underwater. It claims to be the only vehicle that drives below the waves as easily as it does across land. The design is inspired by the submarine Lotus Elan in 1977 film, The Spy Who Loved Me, which was more angular in shape. The new version of the submarine car is a convertible that floats when first driven into water. The two-seated vehicle then submerges with the pull of a lever, which sends it deeper underwater. 00-heaven? The design is inspired by the submarine Lotus in The Spy Who Loved Me and it floats when first driven into water. Joy ride: The car is fitted with propellers at the rear and two water jets mounted behind rotating louvers at the front of the vehicle which provide steering and lift. It has two built-in scuba tanks and diving regulators to allow two people to remain underwater for up to an hour. Last year, a submarine car driven by Roger Moore as James Bond in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me sold at auction for £880,800 (£550,000). While it sold under estimate, it can't be driven on the road, but can be used as a submarine. The Lotus was nicknamed 'Wet Nellie' during filming and was built by a former Navy SEAL at a cost of around 100,000 (£62,439) - the equivalent to 500,000 (£312,196) today. Although Roger Moore starred as Bond in the film, the submarine car was driven by retired Navy Seal Don Griffin during underwater filming. Another version of the famous sub-aquatic car is currently listed on Ebay for 1million (£624,393). The car, listed by classic car dealer Hot Rod City, has fins and retractable wheels but no engine. The car is fitted with propellers at the rear and two water jets mounted behind rotating vent-like louvers at the front of the vehicle, which provide steering and lift. It has two built-in scuba tanks and diving regulators to allow two people to remain underwater for up to an hour. The zero-emission vehicle has the same steel chassis used in the Lotus Elise. It has a 54kW 160NM electric motor inside, which is powered by six 48-volt Lithium-ion batteries. They last for 18 miles (29km) on land and provide power for three hours underwater after a four hour charge. The interior in the car is impervious to fresh or salt water and an on-board laser-guided sensor enables it to cruise along autonomously. Measuring 12ft 6inches (3.8metres) long and 6ft 4inches (1.9metres) wide, the car weighs 145 stone (921kg). It can be bought from online retailer Hammacher Schlemmer.

Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places. After Martin suggested rerecording \\"Please Please Me\\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \\"You've just made your first No.1.\\"In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing.

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon.

Article: Olaf Stapledon wrote a book called First and Last Men, in which he looked millions of years ahead. He told of different men and of strange civilizations, broken up by long 'dark ages' in between. In his view, what is called the present time is no more than a moment in human history and we are just the First Men. In 2,000 million years from now there will be the Eighteenth or Last Men. However, most of our ideas about the future are really very short-sighted. Perhaps we can see some possibilities for the next fifty years. But the next hundred? The next thousand? The next million? That's much more difficult. When men and women lived by hunting 50,000 years ago, how could they even begin to picture modern life? Yet to men of 50,000 years from now, we may seem as primitive in our ideas as the Stone-Age hunters do to us. Perhaps they will spend their days goallocking to make new spundles, or struggling with their ballalators through the cribe. These words, which I have just made up, have to stand for things and ideas that we simply can't think of. So why bother even to try imagining life far in the future? Here are two reasons. First, unless we remember how short our own lives are compared with the whole human history, we are likely to think our own interests are much more important than they really are. If we make the earth a poor place to live on, because we are careless or greedy or quarrelsome, our grandchildren will not bother to think of excuses for us. Second, by trying to escape from present interests and imagine life far in the future, we may arrive at quite fresh ideas that we can use ourselves. For example, if we imagine that in the future men may give up farming, we can think of trying it now. So set your imagination free when you think about the future.

Rhizaria is a large and diverse group of single-celled eukaryotic organisms that are commonly found in various aquatic and soil environments. They are part of the larger domain Eukarya and are characterized by their filamentous, hair-like pseudopodia, which the organisms use for locomotion and capturing prey. Protozoa is a term that refers to a diverse group of single-celled eukaryotic microorganisms, which display a wide range of morphological, physiological, and ecological traits. They are found in various environments, including water, soil, and sediments, and can be either free-living or parasitic. Protozoans are traditionally classified under the kingdom Protista, which comprises a wide array of unicellular eukaryotes that are not plants, animals, or fungi. Some of the major groups within Rhizaria include: 1. Radiolarians: marinel, planktonic protozoa characterized by intricate mineral skeletons, which are usually made of silica. 2. Foraminiferans or Forams: marine protozoa that have porous shells, called tests, typically made of calcium carbonate. 3. Cercozoans: a diverse group of organisms that include both free-living and parasitic species, commonly found in aquatic and soil environments. These Rhizaria species share certain features with other protozoan groups, such as being heterotrophic (ingesting bacteria, algae, and other small organisms for nourishment) and reproducing either asexually or sexually. In conclusion, many species in Rhizaria are among the organisms referred to as protozoa due to their single-celled eukaryotic nature, their diversity in morphology and ecology, and their placement within the same kingdom, Protista."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: The epoch of 1089 Tama, formerly known as\\"A919 HA; 1927 WB;\\" is 2005-11-26 and it has an apoapsis of 373513000.0 kilometres. What data can be extracted from this sentence?","completion":"This sentence provides various pieces of information about the celestial object called \\"1089 Tama.\\" Here is the data extracted from the sentence: 1. Name and former designations: The celestial object being discussed is named \\"1089 Tama.\\" It has previously been referred to as \\"A919 HA\\" and \\"1927 WB.\\" These former designations often represent codes used by astronomers to identify and keep track of celestial objects at different stages of their observation and study. 2. Epoch: The epoch mentioned in the sentence is 2005-11-26, which represents a specific point in time. In the context of celestial objects, an epoch is a reference date from which the positions and orbital elements of the object are measured. This data is crucial for calculating the position and trajectory of the object at any given instant in time. The epoch allows astronomers to compare historical data, make accurate predictions about future positions, and better understand the motion of celestial objects. 3. Apoapsis: The sentence states an apoapsis of 373,513,000.0 kilometers for the celestial object. The apoapsis is the point in an object's orbit around a central body (typically a planet, star, or other celestial body) where it is furthest from that body. In the case of 1089 Tama, this means that at its furthest point in its orbit, it is approximately 373,513,000 kilometers away from the central body it is orbiting. This information helps astronomers paint a more accurate picture of the object’s orbital trajectory and study its motion in relation to the central body. In summary, the sentence provides information about the celestial object 1089 Tama's name and former designations, its epoch (2005-11-26), and its apoapsis distance (373,513,000 kilometers). These data points are beneficial for astronomers to track the celestial object's movements, compare it with past and future observations, and understand its orbital properties."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The first was at Duke University Law School, Durham, North Carolina on March 27, 1999, and the second was at Stanford University, Stanford, California on April 10, 1999. Sentence 2 summarizes this information by stating that The Commission held \\"two separate hearings at different times and places but the same year.\\" So based on the information provided in sentence 1, it is reasonable to conclude that sentence 2 is true. Both sentences communicate the same idea that two hearings were held in different locations at different times within the same year.

Hetfield and Ulrich went through the tapes and selected the strongest riffs to assemble into songs. Instruments were recorded separately, with Hetfield playing only rhythm guitar. Rasmussen, with the support of drum roadie Flemming Larsen, taught the basics of timing and beat duration to Ulrich, who had a tendency to increase speed and had little knowledge of rhythm theory. Drums were recorded in an empty warehouse at the back of the studio, which was not soundproof, and caused reverberation. Although four tracks were already arranged, the band members were not used to creating songs in the studio, as they had not done so for Kill 'Em All. \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\", \\"Trapped Under Ice\\" and \\"Escape\\" were written from scratch in Copenhagen, and the band put finishing touches on \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\", \\"Ride the Lightning\\", \\"Creeping Death\\", and \\"The Call of Ktulu\\", which were already performed live. Lead guitarist Kirk Hammett took the album's name from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. The cover art, displaying an electric chair in the midst of lightning bolts, was conceived before recording began. Metallica initially had sound problems, because its gear was stolen three weeks before the band arrived in Copenhagen. The band members slept in the studio by day as they could not afford a hotel and recorded by night, because the studio was booked by other artists during the daytime. Because the group was looking for a major label deal, several A&R representatives from different labels visited the studio. At first, it seemed that Metallica was going to sign with Bronze Records, but the deal fell through, because Bronze executive Gerry Bron did not appreciate the work done at Sweet Silence Studios, and wanted the US edition to be remixed by engineer Eddie Kramer, and even considered re-recording the album in another studio. Metallica was put off by Bron's failure to share the band's artistic vision and decided to look for another label for the US release, in spite of the fact that Bronze had already advertised Metallica as one of their bands.Metallica had to record quickly because of European shows scheduled 29 days after it entered the studio. Recording finished on March 14, and Megaforce released the album on July 27. Although the original album budget was 20,000, the final expense was above 30,000. Metallica's European label Music for Nations paid the studio costs because Megaforce owner Jon Zazula could not afford them. Metallica was unhappy with the lack of promotion by Megaforce, and decided to part ways with Zazula. Major label Elektra Records employee Michael Alago noticed Metallica at The Stone gig in San Francisco, and invited Elektra's chairman and the head of promotion to see the August show in New York. The performance at Roseland Ballroom, with Anthrax and Metallica opening for Raven, pleased the Elektra staff, and the band was offered a contract the following morning. On September 12, Metallica signed with Elektra, who re-released the album on November 19. Cliff Burnstein and Peter Mensch of Q Prime were concurrently appointed as the band's new managers. Ride the Lightning was the last Metallica album to feature co-writing contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, who received credit on the title track and the instrumental \\"The Call of Ktulu\\". The album also represented the first time Hammett was given writing credits.

For most U.S. companies, ‘open enrollment’ season is starting, but a new report shows more than 50 percent of employees don’t know which insurance plan is right for them. This can cost up to 750 a year in wasted benefits. Audrey Boone Tillman, executive vice president of corporate services at Aflac, offered tips for how to get more from your health benefits and reduce money wasted. “Open enrollment is the time of year when employers present to employees their health benefits and offerings – products, packages, etc.,” Tillman said. “You make selections for (the) upcoming year that are the most part binding, so it should be taken very seriously.” Tillman said the most common mistakes people make during this time are not understanding what all the options are and not taking the time to figure out what you need or might need in the upcoming year. “You have to look at the facts, not make assumptions,” Tillman said. She added that another thing people need to consider more closely is whether or not to make a change in their coverage. According to an Aflac report, 98 percent of people stay with the same benefits every year. “People have changes in life – new family members or medical conditions – things that have to be taken into account,” Tillman said. “If you go with the same decisions as last year but have a new life circumstance, you may be setting yourself up for a situation where you don’t have coverage.” A major complaint among employees is that their employers don’t communicate about open enrollment – at all. Tillman recommended employers do more to educate their employees on their options. Tillman said effective ways of communication include posting information online, holding classes or bringing in health care vendors to discuss different packages. “I feel like it’s an investment in the employees to prove health care,” Tillman said. “To have them not understand is a waste of the investment.” For more information, visit www.aflac.com.

Murders are predicted using three mutated humans, called \\"Precogs\\", who \\"previsualize\\" crimes by receiving visions of the future. Would-be murderers are imprisoned in their own happy virtual reality. The Federal government is on the verge of adopting the controversial program. Since the disappearance of his son Sean, PreCrime Captain John Anderton has separated from his wife Lara and becomes a drug addict. While United States Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer is auditing the program, the Precogs generate a new prediction, saying Anderton will murder a man named Leo Crow in 36 hours. Anderton does not know Crow, but flees the area as Witwer begins a manhunt. Anderton seeks the advice of Dr. Iris Hineman, the creator of PreCrime technology. She reveals that sometimes, one of the Precogs, usually Agatha, has a different vision than the other two, a \\"minority report\\" of a possible alternate future; this has been kept a secret as it would damage the system's credibility. Anderton resolves to recover the minority report to prove his innocence. Anderton goes to a black market doctor for a risky eye transplant so as to avoid the city-wide optical recognition system. He returns to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha, shutting down the system, as the Precogs operate as a group mind. Anderton takes Agatha to a hacker to extract the minority report of Leo Crow, but none exists; instead, Agatha shows him an image of the murder of Ann Lively, a woman who was drowned by a hooded figure in 2049. Anderton and Agatha go to Crow's apartment as the 36-hour time nears, finding numerous photos of children, including Sean's.

They founded several of the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England, and their name is the root of the name \\"England\\". The name comes from the district of Angeln, an area located on the Baltic shore of what is now Schleswig-Holstein. - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth. - English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now a global \\"lingua franca\\". Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is most closely related to the Frisian languages, although its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages in the early medieval period, and later by Romance languages, particularly French. English is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. It is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand, and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa, and South Asia. It is the third most common native language in the world, after Mandarin and Spanish. It is the most widely learned second language and an official language of the United Nations, of the European Union, and of many other world and regional international organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch. - An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one . - Karl Julius Ploetz ( 8 July 1819 -- 6 February 1881 ) was a German author of scholarly works , most notably his Epitome of History published in the English language in 1883 . Ploetz was born in Berlin . He is credited with the idea of arranging historic data by dates , geographic location , and other factors . As later used in the English language , Encyclopedia of World History credited with being one of the most complete and comprehensive academic tools available before the electronic revolution . His work was a compilation of factual world events designed to help the students and the general reader . The first English translation was in the U.S. in 1883 by William H.

The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Baltic Sea ( ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain. It includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, and the Bay of Gdask. The sea stretches from 53°N to 66°N latitude and from 10°E to 30°E longitude. A mediterranean sea of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the Danish islands into the Kattegat by way of the straits of Øresund, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt. - Frisia or Friesland is a coastal region along the southeastern corner of the North Sea in what today is mostly a large part of the Netherlands, including modern Friesland, and smaller parts of Germany.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world.

The Frisian languages is the closest living language group to English languages, and are together grouped into the Anglo-Frisian languages. However, modern English and Frisian are not mutually intelligible, nor are Frisian languages intelligible among themselves, due to foreign influences. The three Frisian languages have been heavily influenced by and bear similarities to Dutch, Danish, and/or Low German, depending upon their location.

And dominating, too, in a 37-19 victory over Carolina on Sunday night. Roethlisberger threw two 7-yard touchdown passes to Antonio Brown, Le'Veon Bell ran for 147 yards and Pittsburgh outrushed the Panthers 264-42. Roethlisberger finished 22 of 30 for 196 yards, and Brown had 90 yards receiving on 10 catches to help the Steelers (2-1) snap Carolina's regular-season home winning streak at eight. LeGarrette Blount ran for 118 yards, marking the first time since 1986 the Steelers have had two 100-yard rushers in a game. \\"That's awesome,\\" Roethlisberger said. \\"I'm sure that Steeler fans back home are going crazy because we ran the ball for 100 and had two guys do it. That's just awesome. I think it shows what we can do if we put our minds to it.\\" The Steelers had gone eight quarters without a touchdown before Roethlisberger's two scoring strikes in the third. They were set up by Cam Newton's fumble and Bell's 81-yard run. *By clicking \\"SUBSCRIBE\\", you have read and agreed to the Fox Sports Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. The Steelers lost defensive starters Ike Taylor, Ryan Shazier and Jarvis Jones to injuries. Taylor has a broken right forearm, while the others will be reevaluated Monday. Newton finished 24 of 35 for 250 yards, but was a non-factor running the ball with 7 yards on two carries. He was only sacked three times, but faced heavy pressure from the Steelers most of the night -- sometimes even from a three-man rush. Newton, who broke his ribs in the preseason, took a forearm to the midsection from Shazier while running out of bounds and then was driven into the ground by Cameron Haywood when he came free on a stunt on back-to-back plays near the end of the first half. Later, Newton took a shot to the knees from Jason Worlids and came up limping. \\"We didn't do a good job running the ball,\\" Pro Bowl center Ryan Kalil said. \\"That hurt us. We've got to be more consistent protecting Cam. I don't think we did a good job of that and it showed. You can't have guys, especially those guys, hitting your quarterback and having free shots.

The Steelers led 9-3 at halftime behind Shaun Suisham's field goals of 42, 24, and 45 yards. Pittsburgh hadn't scored a touchdown since the second quarter of their season opener before Roethlisberger connected with Brown in the back corner of the end zone following a colossal error by the Panthers. The score came after Carolina's Wes Horton was called for encroachment on a fourth-and-4 field-goal attempt, giving the Steelers a first down. Brown scored on the next play. \\"I just think collectively we kind of beat ourselves,\\" Horton said. After Bell broke free up the middle for an 81-yard burst on Pittsburgh's next drive, Brown struck again getting free while running across the field at the goal line for another 7-yard score that put Pittsburgh up 23-6. Newton answered with a 37-yard TD pass to Greg Olsen, but the Steelers onslaught continued. Pittsburgh's Shamarko Thomas stripped Philly Brown on a punt return in the fourth quarter and Robert Golden came up with the loose ball in the end zone for a touchdown. Blount put the game away with an 8-yard touchdown run, running through Thomas DeCoud at the 4 and dragging him into the end zone in a moment that captured the Steelers' dominance. \\"We have two guys we feel good about,\\" coach Mike Tomlin said about his running backs. \\"Thankfully, we were in a situation where we were winning enough possession downs on defense that we could utilize their talents.

Williams' replacement, Jonathan Stewart, finished with 31 yards on five carries before leaving in the third quarter with a knee injury. Newton looked sharp on the opening drive completing his first four passes for 52 yards but the Steelers began handing out punishing body blows to the fourth-year quarterback in the second quarter.

Buena Vista Social Club is an ensemble of Cuban musicians established in 1996 to revive the music of pre-revolutionary Cuba. The project was organized by World Circuit executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder and directed by Juan de Marcos Gonzalez. They named the group after the homonymous members' club in the Buenavista quarter of Havana, a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as son, bolero and danzon, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, many of whom had been retired for years. Shortly after the Cuban Revolution of 1959, newly elected Cuban President Manuel Urrutia Lleo, a devout Christian, began a program of closing gambling outlets, nightclubs, and other establishments associated with Havana's hedonistic lifestyle. This had an immediate impact on the livelihoods of local entertainers. As the Cuban government rapidly shifted towards the left in an effort to build a \\"classless and colourblind society\\", it struggled to define policy toward forms of cultural expression in the black community; expressions which had implicitly emphasized cultural differences. Consequently, the cultural and social centers were abolished, including the Afro-Cuban mutual aid Sociedades de Color in 1962, to make way for racially integrated societies. Private festivities were limited to weekend parties and organizers' funds were confiscated. The measures meant the closure of the Buena Vista Social Club. Although the Cuban government continued to support traditional music after the revolution, certain favor was given to the politically charged nueva trova, and poetic singer-songwriters such as Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes. The emergence of pop music and salsa, a style derived from Cuban music but developed in the United States, meant that son music became even less common. Cuban music experienced quite a radical change in the 1960s, as National Geographic notes: Cuban dance music also witnessed dramatic change beginning in the late 1960s, as groups explored the fusion of Cuban son with American rock, jazz and funk styles. Groups such as Los Van Van and Irakere established modern forms of Cuban music, paving the way for new rhythms and dances to emerge as well as fresh concepts in instrumentation. ... Cuba's dance music had already inspired a change from the older son-style dances, as younger Cubans broke free of step-oriented dances... The occurrence of these closures and the change in traditions is the simplest explanation of why many musicians were out of work, and why their style of music had declined before the Buena Vista Social Club made it popular again. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was the program to close these establishments successful?","completion":"Yes, the program to close establishments like the Buena Vista Social Club was successful. After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, President Manuel Urrutia Lleo started closing gambling outlets, nightclubs, and other establishments, which affected the livelihoods of local entertainers. As a result, the cultural and social centers were abolished, and the Buena Vista Social Club was closed too. This led to a decline in the traditional Cuban music before the Buena Vista Social Club project made it popular again."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lori Hyde was hunting for a unique vacation experience when her curiosity was piqued by Pretty Joe Rock, a tiny speck of land in the waters off Marathon in the Florida Keys with just enough room for a two-bedroom home and a few clusters of mangroves. She and her husband spent a week on the petite island in February, relaxing and enjoying each other's company, with no one else around but the resident birds. \\"I was looking for a rental that would be private so that came up as I was searching around and we were like, well it can't get much more private than that,\\" said Hyde, 43, a stay-at-home mom who lives in Woodbridge, Virginia. \\"It's not an exclusive sort of thing. We're just ordinary people who just did something cool.\\" Indeed, the idea of renting a private island usually conjures up images of multimillionaires spending a fortune to jet off to a tropical paradise in the Caribbean or the South Pacific. If you have a lot of money to shell out, the possibilities are endless. But while a big budget will give you more options and luxurious accommodations, you don't have to be rich to rent your own island for a vacation. It can sometimes take as little as a few hundred dollars a week, a sense of adventure and the willingness to look at locations closer to home. The island mystique. Pretty Joe Rock, for example, can be yours for under 3,000 a week, which includes the use of a boat to get you to and from the island. Owner Bob Rainek said he gets a broad spectrum of renters, from blue collar to white collar; from families with kids to couples. \\"It's almost a universal thing that people have this romantic kind of feeling for islands,\\" Rainek said. \\"It's a mystique to be on your own private island, to have water 360 degrees [around you.] It's a primal type emotion, as I look at it.\\" Business has been brisk despite the economy, partly because people who might otherwise go to Mexico for a vacation have been scared off by that country's drug-related violence and are looking for something exotic closer to home, Rainek said. He was proud to tout the Florida Keys, which he called \\"America's Caribbean,\\" as an alternative. Some of the most popular places to rent islands may surprise you. They include the northern United States and Canada, said Chris Krolow, the CEO of Private Islands Inc., a company based in Toronto, Ontario, that has about 200 islands for rent all over the world in its database. Clients come from all walks of life, spending as little as 550 for a week on Republic Island in Michigan (which comes with a log cabin) or more than 66,000 for a week on The Rania Experience in the Maldives (which comes with three villas, a private chef, a yacht and other ultra-luxurious touches.) 'Robinson Crusoe' experience. For something in between, a budget of several thousand dollars a week is usually a good start. \\"We're even finding more and more people who are saving and planning a honeymoon on an island. It's a little bit more expensive than what they had originally planned but it seems to be a growing trend,\\" Krolow said. \\"It's probably the most romantic experience that you could ever imagine just being on this tiny island with the person that you just married.\\" You can choose a self-catering island, which gives you the use of a home but requires you to bring your own food and make your own meals (the less expensive option), or a full-service island that comes with a staff, according to Vladi Private Islands, a company based in Hamburg, Germany. Its database of about 150 islands for rent includes everything from Île de Chantemesle near Paris, France, to Forsyth Island, New Zealand. Some people seek the thrill of being dropped off in a remote place that's completely undeveloped. On \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" islands, you are left to your own devices, make your own meals, bring a tent or hammock and anything else you may need, the company said. Nova Scotia, Canada, is one part of the world that offers such opportunities, added Sabine Rollinger, a Vladi spokeswoman. Krolow recalled a CEO who last year spent 10 days on a deserted spot in the Marshall Islands bonding with his 13-year-old son. \\"It's pretty much the closest you'll get to being stranded on your own private island,\\" Krolow said. Spending a lot or a little. On the other end of the spectrum, there's Necker Island, Sir Richard Branson's 74-acre paradise in the British Virgin Islands complete with luxurious accommodations and a large staff. It's all yours for at least 53,000 a night for up to 28 guests, though you can rent individual rooms for a fraction of that price during a select few \\"Celebration Weeks.\\" YouTube: See what 53,000 a day gets you on Necker Island. It may sound like the ultimate getaway, but people who are looking for that private island feel might be a little disappointed by such a huge resort, Krolow said. And if the idea of having an island all too yourself is too expensive or intimidating, you can try one with a single lodge or hotel perched on top, like the quaint five-room bed-and-breakfast on East Brother Light Station near San Francisco, California. Starting at about 300 a night, it's an island stay that's both private and not too hard on the wallet. Whatever your budget, an island may be waiting.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the pottery type that succeeded the most popular pottery until the 7th century? In medieval Nubia, pottery and its decoration were appreciated as an art form. Until the 7th century, the most common pottery type found at Soba was the so-called \\"Red Ware\\". These wheel-made hemispherical bowls were made of red or orange slip and painted with separated motifs such as boxes with inner cross-hatchings, stylized floral motifs or crosses. The outlines of the motifs were drawn in black while the interiors were white. In their design, they are a direct continuation of Kushite styles, with possible influences from Aksumite Ethiopia. Due to their relative rarity, it has been suggested that they were imported, although they bear similarities to the pottery type, known as \\"Soba Ware\\", that succeeded them.\\"Soba Ware\\" was a type of wheel-made pottery with a distinctive decoration very different from that found in the rest of Nubia. The shape of the pottery was diverse, as was the repertoire of painted decoration. One of the most distinctive features was the use of faces as painted decoration. They were simplified, if not geometric, in form and with big round eyes. This style is foreign to Makuria and Egypt, but bears a resemblance to paintings and manuscripts from Ethiopia. It is possible the potters copied these motifs from local church murals. Also unique was the application of animal-shaped bosses (protomes).

Elvis arrives at the church of Pastor David Sandow (William Hurt). He watches his sermon from the back of the church and then follows him and his family, including his wife Twyla (Laura Harring), son Paul (Paul Dano) and daughter Malerie (Pell James), to their home. Pastor Sandow confronts Elvis, who shows him a snapshot of his mother Yolanda, with whom he had relations many years ago before becoming a Christian. Pastor Sandow becomes agitated and tells Elvis that he has a family now and is a popular member of the community. He tells Elvis to call him so they can talk, though later tells his family that the young man simply wanted to become a member of the church and to not associate with him. Elvis moves in to a local motel and gets a job as a pizza delivery man. Having met Pastor Sandow's teenage daughter Malerie earlier at the church, he soon begins to pick her up from school where they go on drives and take walks at a local park. They start a passionate affair and have sexual relations on a regular basis. Meanwhile, Pastor Sandow's son Paul leads a high school movement where he attempts to change the school's science curriculum from evolution to intelligent design, though his plans are rejected by the school board. Disappointed by this setback, Paul, who leads a Christian rock band at his father's church, performs an intimate song before the congregation about his frustrations, the song being a cover of Sparklehorse's \\"Sad and Beautiful World\\". Pastor Sandow severely chastises his son for such indulgence. One evening, Elvis sneaks into the Sandow's home to spend the night with Malerie. After they have sex, he leaves the house in the middle of night and is spotted by Paul. He follows Elvis back to his motel and interrogates him about his affair with his sister.

[+] no.","completion":"The premise and the hypothesis present a complex relationship that needs to be dissected to determine whether one entails the other or not. Premise: But how did Jon know him? This statement implies that Jon does know this man but raises the question of how Jon knows him. The premise establishes a connection between Jon and the man, although the nature of the relationship is uncertain. Consequently, it opens up the possibility of various explanations of how Jon came to know this man. Hypothesis: This man was unknown to all, including Jon. The hypothesis clearly states that the man is unknown to everyone, and Jon is specified as one of those individuals who do not know this man. It highlights a lack of any connection or relationship between Jon and the man. Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Entailment in logic means that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. In other words, it implies that the hypothesis is a necessary consequence of the premise. In this case, the premise (But how did Jon know him?) suggests that there is a connection between Jon and the man, while the hypothesis (This man was unknown to all, including Jon) directly contradicts this by asserting that Jon does not know the man. As such, the premise does not entail the hypothesis because the two statements are at odds with one another.

Pick your answer from: (A). no (B). yes","completion":"The two given questions ask to solve different integrals, and thus, the correct answer is (A). no, they are not the same. Now, let's solve each integral separately: 1. Integral of [math]frac{x}{log x}[/math]: Unfortunately, there is no elementary closed-form expression for [math]int{frac{x}{log x}dx}[/math]. That means you cannot find an expression using elementary functions such as exponentials, logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc., that exactly evaluates the integral. However, this integral can be represented using a special function called the Sophomore's Dream Function, which is defined as follows: [math]D_n(x) = int_{1}^{x}frac{t^n}{log t} dt[/math] In this case, for the integral of [math]frac{x}{log x}[/math], we have n = 1: [math]int{frac{x}{log x}dx} = D_1(x) + C[/math] Here, C is the integration constant. 2. Value of [math]int{frac{1}{log{x}}dx}[/math]: Similarly, the integral [math]int{frac{1}{log{x}}dx}[/math] does not have an elementary closed-form expression. This integral is related to another special function known as the Logarithmic Integral function, denoted as Li(x). The Logarithmic Integral function is defined as: [math]Li(x) = int_{0}^{x}frac{1}{log t} dt[/math] For the given integral, since the bounds are not specified, the indefinite integral is: [math]int{frac{1}{log x}dx} = Li(x) + C'[/math] Again, C' is the integration constant.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Why is Raghuram Rajan popular? Raghuram Rajan is popular for several reasons. Firstly, he is a renowned economist, who has established a strong reputation in the field. As an economist, he has worked extensively in various positions and capacities both in the Indian and the international circuit. His research topics cover banking, corporate finance, and economic development, to name a few. The prominence and depth of his work have garnered him numerous accolades and recognition from both academic and professional quarters. Secondly, Rajan is also popular due to his tenure as the 23rd Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from September 2013 to September 2016. During his tenure, he implemented various monetary and financial reforms that helped stabilize the Indian economy while addressing issues such as inflation, financial inclusion, and banking regulations. Some of his key policy initiatives include the implementation of inflation targeting as the primary monetary policy objective and the establishment of new banking licenses to include more players in the banking sector. Moreover, Rajan's popularity can be attributed to his accurate prediction of the 2008 financial crisis. In 2005, while presenting a paper at the annual gathering of economists and central bankers at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, he cautioned against potential risks that might arise due to the growing complexity of the global financial system and predicted a global financial crisis. His warning was initially dismissed by prominent economists, but the events that unfolded in 2008 proved his foresight correct. This earned him the reputation as a visionary in the field of economics. In addition to being an economist and central banker, Raghuram Rajan served as the Chief Economist and Director of Research at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 2003 to 2006, where he actively participated in policy work and provided valuable insights to address financial crises in developing economies. Finally, Rajan's popularity can also be attributed to his ability to seamlessly combine academic rigor with practical policymaking. He holds a Ph.D. from MIT and is a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. His ability to engage with complex theoretical ideas and translate them into effective policies has undoubtedly contributed to his widespread recognition and popularity. Question 2: Who is Raghuram Rajan? Raghuram Rajan is an Indian economist, and internationally acclaimed academic, who is currently the Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He was the 23rd Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, serving from September 2013 until September 2016. Before joining the RBI, Rajan served as the Chief Economist and Director of Research at the International Monetary Fund from 2003 to 2006. His academic credentials include a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, an MBA in finance from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and a Ph.D. in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Relevance of Questions 1 and 2: Questions 1 and 2 are related but not identical. Question 1 focuses on the reasons behind Raghuram Rajan's popularity, whereas Question 2 seeks to find out who Raghuram Rajan is and to obtain a brief overview of his professional and academic background. The two questions are interconnected, as understanding who Rajan is would provide a foundation for understanding the factors contributing to his popularity. However, the focus of each question is distinct, with the emphasis on the causes of his popularity in the first question and the details of his identity and background in the second."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What was the planned, first devised by Raivis Zeltits, to form a federation of Central and Eastern European countries after World War I?","completion":"The planned formulated by Raivis Zeltits, a Latvian historian and political activist, aimed to form a federation of Central and Eastern European countries after World War I. This initiative was called Intermarium, also known as Międzymorze, translating to \\"Between-Seas.\\" The Intermarium concept was initially introduced by political and military leader Józef Piłsudski, the first Marshal of Poland, who sought to revive the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, create a buffer between the newly restored Poland, and reduce the influence of competing powers in the region — specifically Germany and the Soviet Union. The Intermarium plan envisioned a geopolitical alliance consisting of several Central and Eastern European countries, including (but not limited to) Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Yugoslavia. This federation aimed to unite these nations under a single political, economic, and military alliance committed to each other's mutual defense and the maintenance of regional stability. The primary goals of the Intermarium plan were: 1. Security: To ensure the protection and sovereignty of Central and Eastern European countries from potential aggression or influence from larger powers, particularly Germany and the Soviet Union. 2. Economic Cooperation: To promote economic collaboration among the member nations, allowing for the exchange of resources, technology, and expertise while supporting collective growth and development. 3. Cultural Exchange: To strengthen regional ties by fostering cultural and educational exchanges within the federation, encouraging a sense of shared identity and common heritage. 4. Democratic Governance: To facilitate the consolidation of democratic institutions and values across the Intermarium region, effectively ensuring that the member states could rely on a stable political landscape. 5. Geopolitical Balance: To maintain a balance of power in Europe as a whole and counter the expansionist ambitions of any aggressive or imperialist actors. Despite the potential benefits of the Intermarium alliance, various challenges emerged that prevented its successful implementation. Some of these obstacles were: 1. Nationalism: Many countries in the region recently achieved independence after World War I, and their focus was primarily on establishing a national identity and sovereignty. The idea of combining into a larger federation was perceived by some as a threat to these nascent states' independence. 2. Territorial Disputes: Central and Eastern European countries held unresolved border disputes, which caused conflicts and mistrust among them, making it difficult for these nations to unite. 3. Political Rivalry: Piłsudski's death in 1935, and the subsequent shift in Poland’s political landscape, resulted in a weaker Polish state that was unable to lead the Intermarium initiative. 4. External Influence: Germany and the Soviet Union both saw the Intermarium plan as a potential threat to their influence and interests. As a result, they applied diplomatic pressure to discourage Central and Eastern European countries from joining the proposed federation. Ultimately, the Intermarium plan was never realized due to these challenges. Nevertheless, the idea persisted throughout the 20th century and influenced later regional cooperation initiatives, such as the Visegrád Group and the European Union's Eastern Partnership. Today, the concept of Intermarium continues to be discussed and debated as a historical precedent for present-day regional cooperation in Central and Eastern Europe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Should I validate this answer? Options are: (A). No (B). Yes The answer is:","completion":"(A). No The answer provided is outdated and does not offer a comprehensive view of the economic situation in the Netherlands. To validate the answer to the question about the economics of the Netherlands, a more updated and detailed answer is necessary. The Netherlands has a diverse, modern, mixed economy characterized by a high level of industrialization, advanced agriculture, and a strong services sector. It is considered one of the wealthiest countries in the world with a high standard of living, relatively low income inequality, and a strong social welfare system. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the Netherlands was 909.07 billion in 2020. The Dutch economy is highly dependent on international trade. Exports account for around 32% of their GDP, with major trade partners including Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. The Netherlands has a strong export-oriented agricultural and food sector, which is the second-largest in the world. The services sector is the largest contributor to the Dutch economy, accounting for around 70% of GDP. Key industries within this sector include professional services, IT, logistics, and tourism. The finance sector is also a significant contributor to the Dutch economy, with the presence of several major Dutch banks and international financial institutions in the country. The Netherlands is home to a well-developed industrial sector, particularly in chemicals, electronics, and machinery. The country is also a major player in the energy market due to the presence of Royal Dutch Shell, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies. The country is a member of the European Union (EU) and has adopted the euro as its currency. Fiscal policy in the Netherlands is generally conservative, and the government has implemented measures to address the challenges of an aging population and to ensure the long-term sustainability of public finances. The Dutch economy has been experiencing a recovery since the global financial crisis a decade ago. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the economy experienced continuous growth, with the unemployment rate dropping to around 3% in 2019. However, the pandemic had a significant negative impact on the economy in 2020, leading to contractions in GDP. In conclusion, to validate the answer, an updated and comprehensive description of the economics of the Netherlands is necessary, taking into account the country's diverse economy, international trade, sectors that contribute to the GDP, and the recent economic impacts due to the Covid-19 pandemic."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Homogenic is the third international solo album by Icelandic musician Björk, released in September 1997. Produced by Björk, Mark Bell, Guy Sigsworth, Howie B and Markus Dravs, it was released on One Little Indian Records. The music of \\"Homogenic\\" was a new style for Björk, focusing on similar-sounding music combining electronic beats and string instruments with songs in tribute to her native country Iceland. \\"Homogenic\\" was originally to be produced in her home in London, but was later recorded in Spain. \\"Homogenic\\" marked the first of several production collaborations between Björk and Mark Bell, whom Björk would cite as a major influence on her musical career. The album peaked at number twenty-eight on the \\"Billboard\\" 200, and at number four on the UK Albums Chart. - \`\` Alarm Call '' is a song by Björk released as the fourth single from her fourth studio album Homogenic , peaking at # 33 in the UK . The sped - up \`\` radio version '' of the song ( which was also featured in the video ) was used in the 1999 film The Mod Squad . - One Little Indian Records is a London-based independent record label that rose from the ashes of punk rock record company Spiderleg Records. It was set up in 1985 by members of various anarcho-punk bands, and managed by former Flux of Pink Indians bassist Derek Birkett. - Trip hop is a subgenre of electronic music that originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol. Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene, which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. It has been described as \\"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\\", and \\"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable\\". Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop. It also contains elements of R&B, dub and house, as well as other electronic music. Trip hop can be highly experimental. - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - Björk Guðmundsdóttir (born 21 November 1965), known as Björk, is an Icelandic singer, songwriter, producer, DJ, and actress. Over her four-decade career, she has developed an eclectic musical style that draws on a wide range of influences and genres spanning electronic, pop, experimental, classical, trip hop, IDM, and avant-garde styles. She initially became known as the lead singer of the alternative rock band The Sugarcubes, whose 1987 single \\"Birthday\\" was a hit on US and UK indie stations and a favorite among music critics. Björk embarked on a solo career in 1993, coming to prominence as a solo artist with albums such as \\"Debut\\" (1993), \\"Post\\" (1995), and \\"Homogenic\\" (1997), while collaborating with a range of artists and exploring a variety of multimedia projects. - The UK Albums Chart (currently called the Official Albums Chart) is a list of albums ranked by physical and digital sales and (from March 2015) audio streaming in the United Kingdom.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Hillary, Me and the Digital Divide On Dec. 23, 2009, Hillary Clinton, who was then secretary of state, sent an email on her private server to her aide Huma Abedin asking how to switch her home phone to fax mode. In the long chain that followed, Ms. Abedin explained, more than once: “Just pick up phone and hang it up. And leave it hung up.” The former first lady and current presidential candidate is also like a lot of other men and women who were adults when personal computers came into use, and who to this day cannot scan, iChat, use Spotify or hook up their Roku, and would prefer not to let the world — or their younger colleagues — in on their tech inadequacy. It’s the kind of admission of age-based incompetence best shared with only the closest advisers. Hillary has Huma. I have extension 2020. That’s the number reporters here at The New York Times call when they are having trouble with the paper’s secure server; technicians are available 24/7 to help people who can’t remember their password, don’t understand iCloud or don’t know how to get past the locked-key icon that blocks intruders from getting in. I know them by name, and they sigh when they hear mine. Unlike Bernie Sanders, the Trump campaign is not sick and tired of hearing about Mrs. Clinton’s emails. Yet oddly, in all the failings hurled at Mrs. Clinton at the Republican National Convention during the past week — venality, murder and reckless disregard for national security — there was no mention of her internet ignorance. Even Donald J. Trump’s 22-year-old daughter, Tiffany, didn’t try to court her millennial peers by painting her father’s opponent as a technoramus. Obviously, internet aversion was not the primary reason Mrs. Clinton had a private server installed in her house in Chappaqua, N.Y., rather than relying on the State Department system. Mrs. Clinton’s own emails made it clear she was far more obsessed with shielding herself from prying reporters and Republicans than enemy hackers. When a State Department deputy chief of staff for operations suggested in a 2010 email that she use the government system to avoid spam, she declined, writing, “I don’t want any risk of the personal being accessible.” But it could be that one of the personal secrets she was hiding was her discomfort with the digital revolution. On July 24, 2010, Mrs. Clinton had trouble using her iPad. “I don’t know if I have WIFI,” she wrote in an email to another close aide. “How do I find out?” On Oct. 7, 2012, Mrs. Clinton emailed that aide: “Do you know what channel on the TV in DC is the program listing? And, specifically, what channel number is Showtime?” She added, “Because I want to watch ‘Homeland.’” Mrs. Clinton is not known for excessive humility or self-deprecation, so there is something almost touching about what she wrote in the subject line of the Showtime email: “stupid question.” And there were signs Mrs. Clinton wanted to improve. She asked her former chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, to lend her a book called “Send: Why People Email So Badly and How to Do It Better.” Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, confirmed that on the road, Mrs. Clinton still uses a BlackBerry, even though the company announced this month that it was discontinuing the classic version with a physical keyboard and trackpad. “Sometimes it can be very tough to let go,” Ralph Pini, BlackBerry’s chief operating officer, wrote in a company blog post. Mr. Merrill did not allow that his boss might be technologically challenged. He noted that, among other things, she sometimes uses Spotify. Tech consultants are careful not to use the word “stupid” when instructing baby boomers. Some even avoid the word “easy.” Tariq Fayad, 27, a programmer and app designer in New York, said he no longer says a task is easy. “Because,” he explained, “sometimes it’s hard to teach.” He said he had learned to keep his instructions simple, especially with his parents. “I don’t tell my dad to swipe,” he said, “I say, ‘Put your finger on the screen and move it across really quickly.’” Mr. Fayad gives his relatives free lessons. On the other hand, he is still on the family phone plan in Texas. Once the server scandal erupted and investigations began, it was tricky for Mrs. Clinton’s aides to explain to outsiders what they were up against. Their private emails said it all. “I talked to Cheryl about this,” Lewis Lukens, a former high-level State Department official, wrote to a colleague who didn’t understand why the secretary of state didn’t check her emails on her office computer. “She says the problem is HRC does not know how to use a computer to do email, only BB.” There are plenty of people who remember hot pants and Nixon’s wage and price controls and who clung to their BlackBerries at any cost. Amanda Urban, the renowned literary agent, was so attached to hers that when her company, ICM Partners, stopped supporting the BlackBerry in 2014, she bought a 100 BlackBerry keyboard to fit on her iPhone. She then had to travel with two chargers and extra battery packs. “My entire handbag was given over to the care and maintenance of my BB,” Ms. Urban said. “Frankly, I was relieved when ICM confiscated it — which is what they did. It was a Monday-morning intervention — no other way to describe it.” Ms. Urban adjusted to the iPhone, but she still mourns her first device. “The BB was far superior to do email on, and that is what Hillary has to think, too.” For my personal devices, I rely on Kai Lui, a whiz technology consultant who makes house calls. I called Kai for this article and explained that I sympathized with Mrs. Clinton because when people say I am not tech-savvy, that hurts my feelings. He waited a beat and replied, “You’re tech-savvy enough, Alessandra.”","completion":"Hillary Clinton's email scandal has highlighted the issue of the digital divide between baby boomers and younger generations. While some may argue that technophobia may have played a role in Clinton's use of a private email server, others debate the intention was primarily to avoid transparency. Some tech consultants no longer use the word \\"easy\\" when teaching baby boomers how to use computers, as many still struggle with fundamental tasks such as email. This generational gap in technological know-how may lead to issues in efficient communication and the adaptation to new technology, so it is crucial businesses provide ongoing training and support in these areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who composed seven operas in three years at Brunswick? Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now. and a hint : At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. Please answer this question : Is the volcanic crust on Sarahn or Timon hotter? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information and understanding of geological processes, the volcanic crust on the planet Sarahn would be hotter than that on Timon. This conclusion can be drawn from the fact that Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift, with its continents breaking apart and moving. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. As the newly formed volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than older oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods, causing the sea level to rise. This phenomenon indicates that the tectonic activity and the production of volcanic crust on Sarahn would result in a hotter crust compared to Timon, which has been stable for quite a while with no continental movements.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Downloading full episodes of Mahabharat of Star Plus and all episodes of Gotham are two different tasks, but both involve the process of acquiring access to video content from specific television series. Though the television series are different, the general concept and methods of downloading episodes are similar. Let me provide you with detailed information on how to download episodes for both Mahabharat of Star Plus and Gotham. 1. Mahabharat of Star Plus: Mahabharat is a mythological Indian television series that aired on Star Plus from 2013 to 2014. To download full episodes of the Star Plus Mahabharat, follow the steps below: a) Streaming platforms: One of the easiest and legal ways to download the episodes is by subscribing to streaming platforms, like Hotstar, which have the series available for streaming. Hotstar is owned by Star Network, and you can either stream episodes directly from their website (www.hotstar.com) or download their app available on both Android and iOS platforms. b) Official DVD releases: Look for official DVD releases of Mahabharat television series. They often contain full episodes and may provide a legal and high-quality way to access the content. These can be found at most major online retailers, such as Amazon. c) Third-party websites: Numerous websites allow users to download or watch television content online. However, be cautious with these sites as they often contain malware, and downloading content from them may be illegal. 2. Downloading all episodes of Gotham: Gotham is an American crime-drama television series that aired from 2014 to 2019. To download all episodes of Gotham, follow these steps: a) Streaming platforms: You can access all episodes of Gotham legally through various streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, or Hulu, depending on your region. Subscribe to these platforms and utilize their download feature, which permits offline watching. b) Purchase or rent episodes: Various platforms, like Amazon Prime Video, Google Play, iTunes, and YouTube, offer the option to purchase or rent individual episodes or complete seasons of Gotham. After purchasing/renting the content, you can download and watch it offline. c) Third-party websites: Just as with Mahabharat, downloading content from third-party websites poses risks associated with illegal activities and potential malware. To answer the last part of your question, the two questions do not have the same meaning because they refer to different television series. However, the methods for downloading the episodes mentioned in both questions share similarities, as they involve accessing content from streaming platforms, purchasing or renting episodes, and the use of third-party websites. Always remember to consider legal methods when downloading any television content to avoid potential copyright issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Frédéric Chopin In September 1828 Chopin, while still a student, visited Berlin with a family friend, zoologist Feliks Jarocki, enjoying operas directed by Gaspare Spontini and attending concerts by Carl Friedrich Zelter, Felix Mendelssohn and other celebrities. On an 1829 return trip to Berlin, he was a guest of Prince Antoni Radziwiłł, governor of the Grand Duchy of Posen—himself an accomplished composer and aspiring cellist. For the prince and his pianist daughter Wanda, he composed his Introduction and Polonaise brillante in C major for cello and piano, Op. 3. Q: With whom did Chopin go to Berlin?","completion":"Frédéric Chopin visited Berlin in September 1828 with a family friend, zoologist Feliks Jarocki. During their stay, they enjoyed operas directed by Gaspare Spontini and attended concerts by notable musicians and composers such as Carl Friedrich Zelter and Felix Mendelssohn. This trip provided Chopin with the opportunity to immerse himself in the thriving musical culture of the city and expand his horizons as a composer. Chopin's second visit to Berlin in 1829 proved to be significant as well, as he was a guest of Prince Antoni Radziwiłł, who was the governor of the Grand Duchy of Posen. Prince Radziwiłł was not only an accomplished composer but also an aspiring cellist. During this visit, Chopin composed his Introduction and Polonaise brillante in C major for cello and piano, Op. 3, dedicated to the prince and his pianist daughter, Wanda. Chopin's experiences exploring the cultural richness of Berlin and interacting with prominent musicians, as well as the connections he made within the royalty and aristocracy of the time, undoubtedly played a role in shaping his career as a renowned composer and pianist. His unique talent for combining Polish folk elements with traditional classical music expanded his international reputation and solidified his legacy as one of the most influential Romantic composers in history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: A female and male bike riding on a sunny day. Hypothesis: People are bike riding. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, based on the premise provided, we can conclude the hypothesis that people are bike riding. The premise states that both a female and male are bike riding on a sunny day. This information directly supports the hypothesis that people are engaged in the activity of bike riding. Analyzing the premise further, we can deduce certain contextual details that can contribute to our understanding of the situation: 1. The activity takes place on a sunny day. This suggests that the participants are likely enjoying favorable weather conditions for outdoor activities. Good weather generally encourages people to participate in outdoor activities like biking, as it offers a pleasant environment and increased visibility. 2. There are two individuals involved: a female and a male. This could imply that the bike riding event might be a social or recreational activity shared between friends, family members, or a couple. Biking can be an enjoyable way to bond with others while partaking in physical exercise. 3. The mention of both a female and a male involved in the activity indicates a level of inclusivity and diversity in the bike riding event. It shows that people of different genders can partake in and enjoy this outdoor activity. 4. Bike riding, as an activity, is known to offer several health and environmental benefits. Engaging in regular physical activities like biking helps improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and overall well-being. Additionally, biking as a mode of transportation reduces traffic congestion and carbon emissions, promoting a cleaner and healthier environment. In conclusion, given the premise that a female and male are bike riding on a sunny day, we can confidently accept the hypothesis that people are bike riding. The situation appears to be a leisurely and social outdoor event, with the participants benefiting from both the positive aspects of engaging in physical activity and the enjoyable weather conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Um ihre Vorherrschaft zu wahren, haben sich arabische Regierungen auf mit Schwachstellen behaftete Gesetze verlassen und sich auf Wahlen gestützt, die weder starke Parlamente hervorbringen, noch echten Wandel. Translate this to English?","completion":"In order to maintain their dominance, Arab governments have relied on flawed laws and leaned on elections that neither produce strong parliaments nor bring about genuine change. To provide a more detailed explanation, it is evident that many Arab governments use certain strategies to preserve their power and control over their nations. One of these strategies involves creating and implementing laws that have inherent weaknesses. These flaws often serve the purpose of preventing the establishment of democratic processes and institutions that would otherwise threaten their rule. By manipulating existing legal frameworks, they make it difficult for citizens to push for transparency, accountability, and genuine political participation. Additionally, these governments often use elections as a tool to lend a pretense of democratic legitimacy to their rule. On the surface, these elections may seem to provide an opportunity for the people to exercise their right to vote and select their representatives. However, deeper scrutiny reveals that these elections are largely symbolic and do not lead to the formation of strong and effective parliaments. The scope of the elected body's power is often limited, and they rarely have the authority to hold the ruling government accountable or to initiate significant legislative changes. In essence, these flawed laws and controlled elections create an environment in which Arab governments can maintain their dominance without genuinely addressing the need for representative and democratic governance. Consequently, this approach hinders real political progress and leaves citizens with little influence over the decisions impacting their lives. As a result, people in these countries continue to face challenges related to economic disparity, corruption, and limited access to basic rights and freedoms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Adolf Hitler failed to pay as much attention to bombing the enemy as he did to protection from enemy bombing, although he had promoted the development of a bomber force in the 1930s and understood that it was possible to use bombers for major strategic purposes. He told the OKL in 1939 that ruthless employment of the Luftwaffe against the heart of the British will to resist could and would follow when the moment was right; however, he quickly developed a lively scepticism toward strategic bombing, confirmed by the results of the Blitz. He frequently complained of the Luftwaffe's inability to damage industries sufficiently, saying, \\"The munitions industry cannot be interfered with effectively by air raids ... usually the prescribed targets are not hit\\". Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why did Hitler feel the Luftwaffe was unsuccessful in bombing raids?","completion":"Hitler felt the Luftwaffe was unsuccessful in bombing raids for a few reasons. 1. Inaccurate targeting: Hitler believed that the prescribed targets were not being hit during the air raids. This could be due to limitations in technology and reconnaissance at the time, leading to insufficient intelligence on enemy positions and industries. Ineffectively targeting enemy infrastructure would make it difficult to achieve the desired strategic impact. 2. Limited damage to enemy industries: Hitler's scepticism toward strategic bombing was reinforced by the perceived lack of damage done to enemy industries. This could be due to numerous factors like bombing accuracy, the resilience of industrial targets, and enemy defense systems. Insufficient damage to crucial enemy industries meant that their war efforts would largely remain unaffected. 3. Adaptation of enemy defenses: As the war progressed, the enemy became better equipped to defend against air raids. This included improved air defenses, radar technology, and air raid shelters that minimized the damage caused by the Luftwaffe's bombings. 4. Lack of focus on strategic bombing: While Hitler initially recognized the potential of using bombers for strategic purposes, his priorities may have shifted during the course of the war, which could have affected the resources and attention given to strategic bombing efforts. Overall, the combined impact of these factors led Hitler to believe that the Luftwaffe was unsuccessful in their bombing raids."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Mike is studying for his zoology class. Today, he is studying about reptiles and amphibians. He found it easy to understand their differences by categorizing them. For that, he classified reptiles as class A and amphibians as class B. and a hint : Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

Summarize this article: When you begin having the conversation, phrasing is very important. It's easy to accidentally come off like you're blaming or judging the other person. Proper phrasing can help the conversation go smoother. Avoid statements that start with \\"you\\" as this comes off as you forcing external judgment on the situation. Instead, phrase everything in terms of \\"I\\" and tie it back in to how your feelings affect your ability to function in the relationship. For example, instead of saying \\"You don't let me spend weekends just with my friends,\\" say something like, \\"I like to sometimes just go out with friends Friday nights, and if I was able to do that more often I'd be happier when I came home to you.\\" Avoid harsh language in general. Words like \\"clingy\\" or \\"needy\\" can come off as judgmental. If you feel your boyfriend wants too much of your time, instead say something like, \\"I feel like it's hard to meet all your needs all the time, and I don't have energy for myself when we spend all our time together.\\" Be transparent. Talk about what you discovered while reflecting on the relationship and yourself during your talk. Saying you need space can potentially make your boyfriend feel very insecure, so focus on how the issue is about you and your needs and has nothing to do with how you feel about him. A relationship is a two way street. If your boyfriend has different ideas of what constitutes healthy space than you, the two of you need to address this together. You should listen to how he responds to what you're saying. Your boyfriend's needs and desires are as valuable as your own, so treat them as such. Remember this as you have the conversation. This is not an issue of one party being right and the other being wrong. It's an issue of differing personal boundaries. If you don't understand, ask for clarification. Something like, \\"Why do you feel that way?\\" can really help you better understand your partner's needs. At the end of the talk, reinforce your enthusiasm for the relationship so things do not end on a bad note. Say something like, \\"Even though I need alone time on occasion, I really do love spending time with you and want to be with you.\\" It's a good idea to, throughout the talk, throw in positive statements and sentiments. Like, if you discuss spending more nights at your own place, follow up with something like, \\"Even though I really do love waking up next to you in the morning.\\" This can help the conversation sting less for your boyfriend.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of effective communication and proper phrasing when discussing the need for space in a relationship. It highlights that avoiding blame and judgment is crucial, and suggests using \\"I\\" statements to express feelings rather than accusations. For example, instead of saying, \\"You don't let me spend weekends just with my friends,\\" one should say, \\"I like to sometimes just go out with friends Friday nights, and if I was able to do that more often, I'd be happier when I came home to you.\\" The use of harsh language should be avoided, as it may come across as judgmental. Being transparent and discussing one's reflections on the relationship and personal needs is essential. Since saying you need space can make the other person feel insecure, it's important to clarify that the issue is about one's needs and not a reflection of the feelings towards the partner. Good communication is vital, which includes active listening and respecting the partner's needs and desires as equally important. It is also crucial to acknowledge that there is no right or wrong in the situation, but rather differing personal boundaries that need to be addressed together. Seeking clarification by asking questions like, \\"Why do you feel that way?\\" can help better understand the partner's needs.

Incorporating positive statements and sentiments throughout the conversation can help soften the impact of the discussion and maintain a healthy, constructive dialogue between partners."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things. Some of these mentions refer to the same person, place, or thing. Your job is to write questions that evaluate one's understanding of such references. Good questions are expected to link pronouns (she, her, him, his, their, etc.) or other mentions to people, places, or things to which they may refer. Do not ask questions that can be answered correctly without understanding the paragraph or having multiple answers. Avoid questions that do not link phrases referring to the same entity. For each of your questions, the answer should be one or more phrases in the paragraph, and it should be unambiguous. Passage: Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, completed c. 1138, contains the first narrative account of Arthur's life. This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne. Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall, but he is mortally wounded. He hands the crown to his kinsman Constantine and is taken to the isle of Avalon to be healed of his wounds, never to be seen again.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Process: - Your thermostat senses that the room temperature has fallen below your thermostat setting - Your thermostat sends a signal to your heating system to provide heat for your home - When your oil burner is engaged, heating oil travels from the tank to the burner by way of a pump - Here the oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air - The fuel/air mixture is then injected into the burner where it is ignited in the combustion chamber - The warm air is disbursed through vents, hot water through baseboards, or by steam radiators - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less fine mist is mixed with air happens, how will it affect MORE heat for the house. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis of less fine mist being mixed with air can have a direct effect on the heating process for the house. When the oil mist is not properly atomized (i.e., it is not a fine mist), this can lead to several consequences that may impact the efficiency and overall performance of your heating system. 1. Incomplete combustion: When the oil particles are larger, they may not combust completely in the combustion chamber. Incomplete combustion means that not all of the stored energy in the oil is converted to heat, resulting in a less efficient heating process. This could lead to higher fuel consumption but less heat being produced by the system. 2. Soot buildup: Incomplete combustion also results in the production of soot and other unburned particles. These byproducts can accumulate on the heat exchanger surfaces, decreasing their efficiency to transfer heat to the air or water being circulated throughout your home. Soot can also adhere to the burner, causing an unbalanced flame and reducing the amount of heat produced. 3. Carbon monoxide production: When the fuel/air mixture is not adequately atomized, it can lead to the production of dangerous levels of carbon monoxide (CO), an odorless and colorless gas that can pose serious health risks if not properly ventilated. This not only affects the safety of your home but also leads to inefficiency within the heating system due to CO not being used as an energy source. 4. Strain on ignition system: If the oil is not adequately atomized, the ignition system may struggle to ignite the fuel consistently. This can lead to wear and tear on ignition components, reducing the lifespan of those components and potentially causing system failure. 5. Lower heat output: Finally, due to incomplete combustion, soot buildup, and a strained ignition system, the overall heat output of your heating system will likely be reduced. This means your home will take longer to reach the desired temperature, leading to increased fuel consumption and higher heating costs. To remedy this situation, steps can be taken to ensure that the oil is properly atomized and mixed with air. These steps may include maintaining the oil pump, cleaning or replacing clogged filters, and inspecting the nozzle for wear and proper operation. Regular maintenance of your heating system can help ensure that the fuel/air mixture is optimally atomized and that the system operates at peak efficiency, providing more heat for your home and reducing fuel consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The U.S. produces its energy using fossil fuels, while Germany uses nuclear power plants as their main energy source. The two countries impact the environment in different ways. Which country causes more acid rain? The answer is:","completion":"The United States causes more acid rain compared to Germany. Acid rain is primarily caused by the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere, which then react with water vapor to form sulfuric acid and nitric acid. These pollutants are mainly produced from the combustion of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. In the United States, the majority of electricity production comes from burning fossil fuels. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2020, approximately 60% of electricity generation in the U.S. came from fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, petroleum, and other gases). While there have been efforts made to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions in recent years, the U.S. still contributes significantly to acid rain. On the other hand, Germany relies more on nuclear power plants for its electricity generation. Nuclear power plants emit almost no sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides. Although the country does not rely entirely on nuclear power, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy reported that in 2019, nuclear power accounted for about 12% of Germany's total electricity production. The rest of the electricity production in Germany is split between renewables (46%) and fossil fuels (42%), making their contribution to acid rain lower than that of the United States. In conclusion, the energy production mix and the higher reliance on fossil fuels in the United States make it the country that causes more acid rain compared to Germany."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What sentence would provide a factual answer to this question: \\"Living things all require energy for what?\\"","completion":"Living things all require energy for carrying out essential biological processes, which encompass growth and development, metabolism, reproduction, response to stimuli, and maintenance of cellular and structural integrity. In order to survive and thrive, every living organism needs energy to fuel a diverse range of vital functions. The source of this energy varies among different life forms, with some deriving it directly from the sun through the process of photosynthesis, while others obtain energy by consuming other organisms. One of the key processes powered by this energy is growth and development, which includes cellular division, differentiation, and tissue formation. This process allows living organisms to increase in size, develop complex structures, and undertake various specialized roles within their respective ecosystems. Metabolism is another fundamental biological process that necessitates energy. This intricate chemical process involves the synthesis or breakdown of molecules, enabling the organism to generate energy, remove waste products, and produce essential biomolecules. These biochemical reactions collectively help in maintaining the entire organism's proper functioning. Reproduction is crucial for the continuation of a species, and energy is indispensable for this process. Organisms must use energy to create gametes, as well as to facilitate the complex procedures associated with mating, fertilization, and offspring development. Living organisms also utilize energy to respond to various internal and external stimuli, which is critical for survival. This responsiveness enables them to adapt to changes in their environment, avoid danger, find food, and interact with other organisms. For instance, the energy expended by plants to grow towards sunlight or the energy used by animals to seek shelter are examples of responses to environmental stimuli. Another essential aspect that requires energy is the maintenance of cellular and structural integrity within living organisms. This encompasses activities such as repairing damaged DNA, synthesis of proteins, cellular respiration, as well as maintaining crucial homeostatic processes like temperature regulation and pH balance. In conclusion, living things all require energy to carry out essential biological processes that ensure their survival, growth, and reproduction. This energy drives metabolism, responsiveness to stimuli, growth and development, and maintenance of cellular and structural integrity, thereby impacting every aspect of an organism's existence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel's body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, hermaphroditism, and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes an extra chapter of the Book of Revelation that describes a second war in heaven and prophecy that a \\"dark soul\\" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon. Unknown to Thomas, Gabriel arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death and keeps him in a state of limbo. Unhappily dominated by Gabriel, Jerry retrieves Uziel's belongings from the police station while Gabriel destroys Uziel's body in the morgue. After finding Hawthorne's obituary, Gabriel and Jerry head for Chimney Rock. Before Gabriel arrives, at the local reservation school Simon hides Hawthorne's soul in a little Native American girl, Mary, who immediately falls ill and is taken care of by her teacher, Katherine. After finding Uziel's burnt body, all evidence of its oddity now lost, Thomas hurries to Chimney Rock. When Gabriel realizes Hawthorne's soul is missing, he confronts Simon. Gabriel says Hawthorne's soul will tip the balance to whichever side possesses it.... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Prophecy,\\" Lucifer tells Gabriel that his war is based upon pride and jealousy. Gabriel's rebellion against God and the ensuing war in heaven stem from his resentment towards humans, whom he believes have taken the place of angels in God's esteem. Gabriel seeks to claim the \\"dark soul\\" of Colonel Arnold Hawthorne, believing that it will tip the balance in his favor and allow him to topple the current divine order and lead angel-kind back to their former prominence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For a place famous for it's steaks and ribs I was sorely disappointed. I was with a group of about 7 people. The Big Hamburger that was ordered medium by one person in my party came well done and dry as the desert. The initial helping of all you can eat beef ribs was pretty good...if a little too saucy...with the meat falling off the bone. but the additional helpings were AWFUL!!! TERRIBLY under cooked and had to order 2 additional helpings just to get 3 bites of edible meat...the second helping didn't even appear to have been cooked and I had to fight to get 3 bites off of EIGHT Ribs....Just Awful. The Outback, Texas Roadhouse and Saltgrass Steakhouse are less expensive and provide much better fare. The atmosphere is country western with a band that plays occasionally and virtually all the staff we dealt with were friendly and accommodating. If only the food was better I might have been abe to give this place 3 maybe even 4 stars, but it is a restaurant after all...so good food should be the focus What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mostly negative.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Nathan Charles Buckley (born 26 July 1972) is a former professional Australian rules football player, commentator and coach, best known for his time as captain of the Collingwood Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is currently the senior coach of the Collingwood Football Club. He is listed by journalist Mike Sheahan as one of the top 50 players of all time. Buckley won the inaugural Rising Star Award, in 1993, then went on to become one of the game's elite, captaining Collingwood between 1999 and 2007, winning the Norm Smith Medal for best player afield in the 2002 Grand Final despite playing in the losing team, only the third player in history to do so, the Brownlow Medal in 2003, winning Collingwood's Best and Fairest award, the Copeland Trophy, six times and named in the Collingwood Team of the Century. During his first season Buckley's arrangement with the Bears became common knowledge. At the end of the contract he attracted strong interest from all Melbourne-based clubs, chiefly Collingwood, Geelong and North Melbourne. However, it was Collingwood that successfully arranged a trade deal acceptable to all parties. Unbeknown to other AFL clubs and to the AFL itself, Collingwood and Brisbane had already agreed to make the trade happen. Collingwood selected ten players on its list who were \\"untouchable\\", and the Bears could take any two players outside this list, as well as the Collingwood Magpies' first round draft pick, in exchange for Buckley. The move saw Buckley move to Collingwood in exchange for Craig Starcevich, Troy Lehmann and the Magpies' first-round draft pick (no. 12, future double-premiership player Chris Scott). Buckley was adamant that the move was the right career direction, with the belief he had more chance of winning a premiership with Collingwood. Ironically, Brisbane would beat Collingwood in two consecutive AFL Grand Finals in 2002 and 2003. In his first season with Collingwood, the Magpies were eliminated by the West Coast Eagles by two points in Perth. From here, Buckley would be a consistent performer for Collingwood. As well as winning a Brownlow Medal in 2003, he finished in the top three twice before the turn of the century. He was also named Collingwood's Best and Fairest six times in 10 years (including one tied), as well as six consecutive years in the All-Australian Team from 1996 to 2002. In 1999, Buckley suffered a broken jaw playing against Carlton in Round 2. He returned in Round 8 to help Collingwood to their first win of the season and their first in 13 matches. Collingwood finished the season last, only the second time in their history (the other being in 1976). Buckley also competed in the last game at Collingwood's long-time home ground Victoria Park against one of their main rivals, the Brisbane Lions. Did he win any other accolades or have other accomplishments?","completion":"Yes, Nathan Buckley won other accolades and had many accomplishments in his career. Some of these include winning the inaugural Rising Star Award in 1993, being named Collingwood's Best and Fairest six times, and being a part of the All-Australian Team six times in a row from 1996 to 2002. He also became captain of the Collingwood Football Club between 1999 and 2007 and was listed as one of the top 50 players of all time by journalist Mike Sheahan."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Are you in a bad mood? Don't worry! According to a new Australian study, a bad mood can actually be good for you. The study showed that being sad could help people to judge others more correctly and was also good for the memory. The study was carried out by Professor Joseph Forgas at the University of New South Wales.\\"People in a bad mood paid more attention to the people and things around them than happy people .Happy people were more likely to believe anything they were told,\\"said Forgas For the study, Forgas and his team did a lot of experiments. During the experiments, they made the participants feel happy or sad by watching films and thinking about good or bad things of the past. In one of the experiments, happy and sad participants were asked to judge whether some wrong things were true or not. The results showed that people in a bad mood were less likely to believe that these things were true. People in a bad mood were also less likely to make mistakes when they were asked to remember the things that they saw. The study also showed that sad people were better at talking about their thoughts in written style. In fact, the study said that a slightly bad mood could help to make communication more successful.

A:","completion":"The last step of the process is the exhalation of carbon dioxide. When the bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs, it is transported to the alveoli, small air sacs within the lungs. Here, the carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli. During exhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, reducing the lung volume and increasing the air pressure inside the lungs. This forces the carbon dioxide-rich air out of the lungs and through the bronchial tubes, trachea, and finally out of the mouth and nose into the atmosphere. In this way, the respiratory system efficiently removes waste gases from the body and the cycle of inhalation and exhalation continues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While looking for rocks, the woman threw the jasper aside and collected the quartz because the","completion":"quartz held a certain significance in her research. As a geologist, Sarah was fascinated by the unique properties of quartz and its various uses in technology and energy production. She carefully examined the quartz in her hand, admiring its translucent, almost ethereal quality. The sunlight gleaming through the crystal seemed to infuse its surroundings with a vibrant energy. Step 1: Establish the setting and protagonist's field of interest In this step, I have continued the story by naming the protagonist Sarah and mentioning her profession as a geologist. This sets the stage for her interest in minerals, which justifies her actions of searching for rocks and selecting quartz over jasper. Step 2: Introduce the quartz as significant to research To emphasize the protagonist’s specific interest in quartz, the story explains that it holds significance due to its unique properties and various uses in technology and energy production. This context strengthens the narrative and justifies Sarah's decision to collect the quartz. Step 3: Describe the quartz and its energetic qualities Adding a detailed description of the quartz, including its translucent and ethereal quality, highlights the protagonist’s keen observation skills and appreciation for the mineral. The imagery of sunlight gleaming through the crystal adds a touch of magical realism to the story, while hinting at its potential energetic properties. Feeling satisfied with her find, Sarah continued to study the surrounding landscape, determined to gather more samples of quartz for her research. Her years of experience had taught her to recognize the geologic signs that indicated the presence of quartz veins beneath the earth's surface. With careful study, Sarah used her expertise and intuition to locate areas most likely to contain the valuable mineral. Step 4: Introduce the protagonist's goal and expertise The story now shows that Sarah has a clear purpose – to gather more quartz samples for her research. By stating that her years of experience have enabled her to recognize the geologic signs of quartz veins, the story conveys her level of expertise and dedication to her profession. As Sarah moved through the rocky terrain, she stumbled upon a particularly large quartz vein that appeared to be emitting a faint, unusual glow. Intrigued by this surprising discovery, she decided to investigate further. Little did she know, this particular quartz had secrets hidden within, and her research was about to take an extraordinary turn. Step 5: Introduce a new element of intrigue To keep the reader engaged, the story introduces an unexpected aspect to the quartz – a faint, unusual glow. This new element hints at the possibility of a hidden secret or mystery, which Sarah must now investigate. This unpredictable turn of events creates anticipation and encourages the reader to continue reading to uncover the secret of the glowing quartz."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To achieve this, add 52519879*p to both sides of the equation: -52519879*p + 52519879*p + 4453 = -52519806*p + 52519879*p On the left side, -52519879*p + 52519879*p equals 0, which simplifies the equation to: 4453 = -52519806*p + 52519879*p Step 2: Combine like terms involving p on the right side of the equation. Subtract 52519806*p from 52519879*p: 4453 = (-52519806*p + 52519879*p) 4453 = (52519879 - 52519806) * p 4453 = 73*p Step 3: Solve for p.

Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: STOCKHOLM - Mo Yan, the 2012 Nobel Prize winner for literature, said on Friday that diversity in global cultures makes human beings' cultural life interesting. Mo told a reception in the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm that it was a responsibility to protect the diversity in cultures while creating the diversity as well. He said that translation played a very important role in bridging different cultures, adding that without the translators who had translated his books he couldn't have won the Nobel Prize. \\"I think translation is much harder than writing itself,\\" said Mo Yan, explaining that it only took 43 days to write the work Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out, while it took Swedish sinologist Anna Gustafsson Chen six years to translate the work. Earlier in the day he visited a Swedish middle school, where about 20 Swedish students who were studying Chinese welcomed him by singing the theme song in the movie \\"Red Sorghum\\" which was based on his novel of the same name. \\"Unlike the rough and husky voice in the movie, the Swedish students presented the song with a gentle and soft voice, making it rather a romantic song,\\" Mo told the gathering at the Chinese Embassy. He said he hoped that there were going to be some outstanding translators among the students, adding that meeting them made him \\"extraordinarily happy.\\" He said language was going to be \\"the most reliable way\\" for interaction between peoples because one had to know the language of a nation to understand the people's inner world and spiritual life. Lan Lijun, Chinese Ambassador to Sweden, said that Chinese literature had stepped into the spotlight worldwide after Mo Yan had won the Nobel Prize, which would help contribute to the literature communication and dialogue between China and the rest of the world. People in Sweden and other parts of the world were all welcome to know more about Chinese culture, he added. There were about 130 people attending the reception, including Per Westerberg, speaker of the Swedish Parliament. Question: Mo Yan wrote all of the following novels except _ .

As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: You can't remember who sings a certain song from the 90s. You Google it. You're arguing with a friend about who played Mickey in The Goonies. You solve the problem by Googling it. You don't know the way to that new restaurant. You Google Maps it. We hold the answers to about all of life's questions in our hands today. But that means our brains are feeling free to take some rest. According to the Daily Mail, our growing reliance on the Internet for fact checking is making our memories worse. Scientists at Harvard University found people now regard Google and other search engines as an outside part of their own brains, rather than a tool. Writing in the Journal Scientific American, Harvard psychologists Daniel Wegner and Adrian Ward warn that people who believe their memorable facts that are saved online are much worse at remembering them. \\"The Internet is also unlike a human memory partner; it knows more and can produce the information more quickly, You can find almost all information today easily through a quick Internet search. It may be that the Internet is taking the place of people's memory.\\" In a series of tests, researchers found it was easy for people to remember information well if they believed it would be deleted. Those who thought it was stored on a computer were more forgetful, even if they were asked to keep the information in mind. Question: The writer wants to tell us _ .

Step 2: Identify key points from the article, such as: - Our increasing reliance on the Internet for fact-checking is affecting our memory - People now consider search engines like Google as part of their own brain - Scientists found that people who believe memorable facts are stored online have more difficulty remembering them - They also found that people remember information better if they think it will be deleted Step 3: Compare the key points with the given options. Option A: The article does not say not to use Google; it merely points out the effects of over-reliance on it for fact-checking. Option B: The article hints that the overuse of Google can be bad for our memory, but it's not the central message. Option C: While Google is mentioned as a good tool for checking facts, the main point is about its effect on memory when overused. Option D: This option aligns with the key points gathered from the article, which warn about the negative effects of depending too much on the Internet for checking facts. Conclusion: The best option that represents the writer's main message is D: not to depend on the Internet for checking facts too much."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: - caption is '' \` patrick leonard '' ' - birth date is march 14 1956 - birth place is crystal falls michigan , united states - occupation is songwriter , keyboardist , music producer Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.

We are solving the problem for \\"a.\\" Let's see what we got: -136 * a = 2685 * a + 1034 * a - 300690 First, we need to combine the \\"a\\" terms on the right side of the equation. So, we'll add 2685 * a and 1034 * a together: 2685 * a + 1034 * a = 3719 * a (because 2685 + 1034 = 3719) Now, our equation looks like this: -136 * a = 3719 * a - 300690 Next, we want to move the \\"a\\" terms to the same side of the equation. We can do this by adding 136 * a to both sides: -136 * a + 136 * a = 3719 * a + 136 * a - 300690 0 * a = 3855 * a - 300690 (because -136 a + 136 a = 0 and 3719 a + 136 a = 3855 a) Now, we don't need to worry about 0 * a because it's just 0. So, our equation is now: 0 = 3855 * a - 300690 To solve for \\"a,\\" we need to move the 300690 to the other side of the equation. We do this by adding 300690 to both sides: 300690 = 3855 * a Finally, we can find the value of \\"a\\" by dividing 300690 by 3855: a = 300690 / 3855 a ≈ 78 So, my little friend, \\"a\\" is equal to about 78!

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Advertisement is the difficult business of bringing information to great numbers of people.The purpose of an advertisement is to make people respond to make them react to an idea,such as helping prevent forest fires,or to make them want to buy a certain product or service.At the beginning of the 20th century,advertisement was described as\\"salesmanship in print\\".If this definition were expanded to include radio and television,it would still stand today.The most effective way to sell something is through person-to-person contact.But the cost of person-to-person selling is high because it takes a great deal of time,and it increases the cost of the product or service.Advertising distributes the selling message to many people at one time.The first printed advertisement in the English language appeared in 1278,more than a century before Shakespeare's first play was produced.This early advertisement was the work of William Caxton,England's first printer,who used it to advertise religious books from his own workshop Caxton posted small printed notices along London's main streets.Besides advertising his product,he identified his shop with a red-striped shield so that customers could find it easily. This same sort of simple informational advertising is still used.Examples are the roadside signs that tell travelers that they can buy fresh corn just down the road or that there is a restaurant in the next town. The Industrial Revolution,in the 18th and 19th centuries,brought a new kind of advertising.Large factories took the place of small workshops and goods were produced in large quantities. Manufacturers used the newly built railroads to distribute their products over wide areas.They had to find many thousands of customers in order to stay in business.They couldn't simply tell people where shoes or cloth or tea could be bought---they had to learn how to make people want to buy a specific product. Thus modern advertising was born. Advertising created new markets and helped to raise standards of living as people came to...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In baseball, a strikeout occurs when a pitcher throws three strikes to a batter during his time at bat. Twenty different pitchers have struck out at least 18 batters in a single nine-inning Major League Baseball (MLB) game as of 2016, the most recent being Max Scherzer of the Washington Nationals on May 11, 2016. Four players have accomplished the feat more than once in their career; no player has ever struck out more than 20 batters in a nine-inning game. (Tom Cheney struckout 21 in a 16-inning game.) Charlie Sweeney was the first player to strike out 18 batters in a single game, doing so for the Providence Grays against the Boston Beaneaters on June 7, 1884. In spite of this, Bob Feller is viewed as the first pitcher to accomplish the feat, since his then-record 18 strikeouts was the first to occur during the 20th century and the live-ball era. Choose your answer: Is the following statement correct based on the text has any pitcher ever struck out all 27 batters Available options: (A). no (B). yes","completion":"(A). no Based on the text, no pitcher has ever struck out all 27 batters in a nine-inning game. The highest number of strikeouts mentioned is 20 by a player in a nine-inning game. The text notes that Charlie Sweeney was the first player to strike out 18 batters in a single game in 1884 and that no player has ever struck out more than 20 batters in a nine-inning game. Tom Cheney did manage to strikeout 21, but that was in a 16-inning game, significantly longer than the standard nine innings. So, it can be inferred that all 27 batters have never been struck out by a single pitcher in a nine-inning game."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

When we say \\"syntactically acceptable,\\" we're talking about if the sentence is made the right way, like when we put together a puzzle, each piece has to be in the right place. In the sentence \\"Monica covered the baby with a blanket,\\" we have Monica, who is doing something (we call that the subject), then we have \\"covered,\\" which is what she is doing (the action or verb).

Semantics is like the story of a sentence. In this one, Monica is using a blanket to cover the baby. That makes sense because Monica is a person who can do things, a blanket is something you can cover with, and a baby is something you might cover with a blanket to keep them warm or cozy.

An engraving of the painting will appear on the new Â£10 note from 2017. The portrait was based on the only confirmed portrait of Austen made during her lifetime by her sister Cassandra.

Paraphrase: He graduated from the Military School in Sofia and in 1910 from the Military Academy of the General Staff of Nikolaevsk, St. Petersburg, Russia. Upon close examination of the two sentences, the following similarities and differences are observed: 1. Both sentences begin with \\"He graduated from the Military School in Sofia,\\" indicating that the subject completed their education at this institution. This part is identical in both sentences. 2. The original sentence states \\"and in 1910 from the Nikolaevsk General Staff Military Academy in St. Petersburg, Russia.\\" In the paraphrase, this information is slightly restructured as \\"and in 1910 from the Military Academy of the General Staff of Nikolaevsk, St. Petersburg, Russia.\\" The reordering of the words does not change the meaning; both versions convey that the subject graduated from an additional institution in 1910. 3. The paraphrase changes the position of the phrases \\"the General Staff\\" and \\"Nikolaevsk\\" - in the original, it is mentioned as \\"Nikolaevsk General Staff Military Academy,\\" while in the paraphrase it is \\"Military Academy of the General Staff of Nikolaevsk.\\" Although the phrasing is different, the meaning remains the same: the subject attended and graduated from a military academy named Nikolaevsk that is associated with the General Staff. 4.

In which part of the body is bile produced?","completion":"Bile is produced in the liver, which is a vital and complex organ located in the upper right-hand side of the abdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm. The liver plays a crucial role in various bodily functions, including metabolism, detoxification, and the storage of vital nutrients. One of its primary functions is the production and secretion of bile, a greenish-yellow fluid that aids in the digestion and absorption of lipids (fats) in the small intestine. Bile is composed of multiple substances: water, bile salts, cholesterol, phospholipids, bilirubin, and electrolytes. The most crucial components for digestion are the bile salts, which are derived from cholesterol and are responsible for emulsifying fats in the digestive system. Emulsification is a process that breaks down large fat globules into smaller ones, increasing the surface area on which digestive enzymes can act. This process enhances the ability of the body to digest and absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K. Once bile is produced in the liver, it is either stored in the gallbladder or transported through the hepatic ducts directly into the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. The gallbladder, a small, pear-shaped organ located beneath the liver, stores bile and releases it when the body senses the presence of dietary fat. Upon consuming a meal containing fats, the gallbladder contracts and releases bile into the cystic duct, which merges with the common bile duct. The common bile duct then delivers the bile into the duodenum. In the duodenum, bile salts interact with ingested fats to facilitate their breakdown and absorption into the bloodstream. Once the fats are digested and absorbed, the bile salts are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum, which is the last part of the small intestine, and are then transported back to the liver via the portal vein to be recycled. This process is called enterohepatic circulation. In summary, bile is produced in the liver and plays a crucial role in the digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Its production, storage, transportation, and recycling are essential for maintaining the body's overall digestive health and nutrient balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To elaborate on the process: 1. Human industry produces chemical compounds: Industrial activities, such as burning fossil fuels, mining, and manufacturing, generate and release various chemical compounds into the environment. 2. Chemical compounds rise into the air: Once released, these chemical compounds can travel upwards, becoming airborne and potentially spreading far from their original source. 3. Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds: As chemical compounds rise into the atmosphere, they can encounter clouds and combine with water, forming new compounds such as acid rain, for example. 4. The affected rain falls to the earth: The rain, now containing the chemical compounds, falls back to the earth's surface, subsequently impacting the environment. Final step: The affected rainwater leads to pollution, contaminating bodies of water, soil, and potentially harming ecosystems and human health. This contamination can result in negative consequences, such as damage to aquatic life, plant life, changes in soil composition, and deterioration of human-made structures.

Answer choices: - metabolic reaction - through the small intestines - Transfers energy - an area swollen with pus - To another location like underground - through the urinary system - through the anus - through the body The answer to this question is:","completion":"through the urinary system. The urinary system is the primary means by which urine leaves the body. This system is composed of various organs and structures that work together to filter waste products from the blood, maintain proper water-electrolyte balance, and ultimately expel urine from the body. First, the kidneys are responsible for filtering waste products and excess substances from the blood, forming urine in the process. They are bean-shaped organs located in the lower back, one on each side of the spinal column. The function of the kidneys is to maintain a proper balance of water, electrolytes, and other substances required to keep the body healthy. Inside each kidney are millions of nephrons, tiny structures that carry out the filtering process. These nephrons consist of a glomerulus, a ball of blood capillaries surrounded by a Bowman's capsule, and a network of tubules. The glomerulus filters water, electrolytes, and waste products from the blood into the Bowman's capsule. This fluid then enters the tubules, where reabsorption of water and other essential substances occurs. Eventually, the remaining waste products form the urine. Once urine is formed, it travels from the kidneys through two muscular tubes called ureters. These ureters extend from the kidneys to the bladder, which is a hollow, muscular organ located in the pelvis. The bladder stores the urine until it's time for the body to release it. As the bladder fills, its walls stretch, and nerve signals are sent to the brain indicating the need for urination. The act of urinating involves coordination between the muscles of the bladder and the urethral sphincters, which are circular muscles that help control the flow of urine. When it's time to urinate, the brain sends signals to the bladder muscles to contract while simultaneously relaxing the urethral sphincters. As a result, urine exits the bladder through the urethra and leaves the body. In summary, urine leaves the body through the urinary system, which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The primary responsibility of this system is filtering waste products from the blood, maintaining a proper balance of water and electrolytes, and ultimately expelling urine from the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation -18*t - 52 = -5*t for the variable t, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the variable, t, on one side of the equation. First, we need to eliminate the t term from one side of the equation. To do this, we will add 18*t to both sides to move the t's to the right side of the equation. -18*t - 52 + 18*t = -5*t + 18*t Now, we simplify the equation: -52 = 13*t Step 2: Solve for t. Now that we have the equation simplified and the terms containing the variable t on one side, we need to isolate variable t by dividing both sides of the equation by 13. -52 = 13*t Divide both sides by 13: -52 / 13 = 13*t / 13 We simplify the equation: -4 = t So, the solution for the equation -18*t -52 = -5*t is t = -4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Option A, the drawer, is a possible location, but it is less likely as drawers are typically used for storing flatware and utensils rather than dishware. Option C, the china cabinet, is not in line with common sense as china cabinets are usually reserved for special dishware and not practical, everyday items like a plastic saucer. Option D, the tea room, and option E, the tea cabinet, are both less likely choices as they primarily pertain to tea-related items and not general-use dishware like a plastic saucer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Just before sunrise, Baba's car peeled into the driveway. His door slammed shut and his running footsteps pounded the stairs. Then he appeared in the doorway and I saw something on his face. Something I didn't recognize right away because I'd never seen it before: fear. \\"Amir! Hassan!\\" He cried as he ran to us, opening his arms wide. \\"They blocked all the roads and the telephone didn't work.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Keep it close by your bed at night, and write down your dream immediately after waking, or the emotions and sensations you experience right when you wake up. This will train you to remember more of your dreams, which is important for lucid dreaming. Plus, there's not much point in controlling your dreams if you forget the experience before the morning. Alternatively, keep a recording device by your bed. You might remember more of your dreams if you stay still for a few minutes and concentrate on the memory before you start writing. Every few hours during the day, ask yourself \\"Am I dreaming?\\" and perform one of the following reality checks. With enough practice, you'll start following the habit in your dreams as well, cluing you into the fact that you're dreaming. Pinch your nose, close your mouth and test whether you can still breathe. Simply look at your hands and feet. These are often distorted in dreams when you inspect them closely. Read a page of text or the time on a clock, look away, then look back again. In dreams, the text or time will be blurry or nonsensical, or will be different each time you look. Attempt to push your index finger straight through the opposite palm. Really expect it to go through, asking yourself whether you're dreaming or not both before and after attempting. During a dream, your finger would pass straight through your opposite palm, and asking yourself the question twice will increase your chances of realizing this is not normal. Each night as you fall asleep, repeat to yourself \\"I will know I'm dreaming\\" or a similar phrase until you drift out of consciousness. This technique is known as Mnemonic Induction to Lucid Dreaming, or MILD. Mnemonic induction just means \\"using memory aids,\\" or in this case using a rote phrase to turn the awareness of your dreaming into an automatic habit. Some people like to combine this step with a reality check by staring at their hands for a few minutes before they go to sleep. Read through your journal regularly and look for recurring \\"dream signs.\\" These are recurring situations or events that you may notice in your dreams. Become familiar with these, and you may recognize them while you dream, and therefore notice that you're dreaming. You probably know some of these already. Common dream events include losing your teeth, being chased by something large, or going into public without clothes on. When you wake up and remember your dream, write it down in your dream journal, then close your eyes and focus on the dream. Imagine that you were in the dream, noticed a dream sign or reality check, and realized it was a dream. Hold on to this thought as you drift back to sleep, and you may enter a lucid dream. Note that most lucid dreams occur while the person is fully asleep, usually because they notice a bizarre event and realize they're in a dream. This is just an alternate trigger that starts off about 25% of lucid dreams. Go online and purchase a light-based, instead of a sound-based alarm, or even a specialized \\"DreamLight\\" designed to induce lucid dreaming. Set it for 4.5, 6, or 7 hours after you fall asleep, or set it to go off every hour if possible. While sound, touch, or other stimuli during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep can also make a dreamer aware of the fact they're dreaming, one study shows that light cues are most effective.

Chromosomes are in the center, or nucleus, of cells. An Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel first saw inherited patterns in pea plants. He experimented with pea plants in the 1860s. One of the things, or traits , Mendel studied was what makes some pea plants tall and some short. He said that the traits must come from units of heredity passed from the parent plants. These units were called genes. In the mid-1900s, scientists discovered that genes are made of DNA. In the 1970s, scientists learned how to change DNA with genetic engineering. Scientists also learned that problems with certain genes cause diseases. Muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, and hemophilia are some genetic diseases--diseases caused by problems in genes. Today, scientists are looking for ways to cure genetic diseases by _ genes through a process called gene therapy.

I had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not much great coming in). I'm not sure how this movie slipped past me -I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too. Still, it did. This movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don't have a large budget. It had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; just enough. The entire film is you (the viewer) trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns. I would have given this film 10/10, however some of the shots were pretty fake looking. I don't hold that against this film too much, but I don't think it deserves a perfect score. Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think she's pretty underrated as a serious talent. Nevermind her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her roles seriously and doesn't rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion. And she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed, as well. Jeremy Northam does really well, at first, as quite a geeky corporate rat, willing to run through any maze to prove himself. However, as he changes throughout the film, it's like night and day. I know some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law, or other hopefuls to become the next James Bond will hate me for this, but Northam would/could/should fit that bill. He's suave and cultured. He's got a great Bond posture and voice. I think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it, and rather down-to-Earth, as well. Great film and definitely this movie-buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish. - Prince Zeid bin Hussein , GCVO , GBE ( Arabic : ; February 28 , 1898 -- October 18 , 1970 ) was an Iraqi prince who was a member of the Hashemite dynasty and the head of the Royal House of Iraq from 1958 until his death . - The Yazidis (also Yezidis, \\"Êzidî\\") are an ethnically Kurdish religious community or an ethno-religious group indigenous to northern Mesopotamia (see also Ezidkhan) who are strictly endogamous. Their religion, \\"Yazidism\\" is linked to ancient Mesopotamian religions and combines aspects of Zoroastrianism, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Yazidis who marry non-Yazidis are automatically considered to be converted to the religion of their spouse and therefore are not permitted to call themselves Yazidis. They live primarily in the Nineveh Province of Iraq. Additional communities in Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Iran, and Syria have been in decline since the 1990s as a result of significant migration to Europe, especially to Germany. The Yazidis' cultural practices are observably Kurdish, and almost all speak Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish). The Soviet Union considered the Yazidis to be Kurds, as does Sharaf Khan Bidlisi's \\"Sheref-nameh\\" of 1597, which cites seven of the Kurdish tribes as being at least partly Yazidi, and Kurdish tribal confederations as containing substantial Yazidi sections. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.

An added benefit of exfoliation is it raises the hairs, making them easier to shave. Make sure nothing impedes the ensuing razor swipes. It sounds simpler than it really is. There are a few ways to maximize your shaving efforts towards perfect legs. Try to avoid shaving as soon as you jump in the shower. Let the heat and moisture from the hot water work on your pores, opening them up and making the hair softer. Nighttime shaving is best for smooth legs. There are a variety of reparative functions when you sleep, and shaving at night before bed may help the hairs recede some. Be sure to use shaving cream or other lather that is not soap to assist when shaving. Not only does it help the blade glide more smoothly over your legs, but it also serves as a handy guide of where you’ve already been. Use a good, fresh razor. Avoid the nicks and cuts, or worse, tugging of hair, by using a multi-blade razor that is replaced fairly regularly. Go with the grain, then against it. This makes the blade-strokes easier, the cuts simpler, and the likelihood of issues. Moisturizer forms a thin layer that helps do many things, including sealing in moisture. Using a leg cream just after a shower, when your legs are still damp, helps lock it in.

Although Watts's plans for the memorial had envisaged names inscribed on the wall, in the event the memorial was designed to hold panels of hand-painted and glazed ceramic tiles. Watts was an acquaintance of William De Morgan, at that time one of the world's leading tile designers, and consequently found them easier and cheaper to obtain than engraved stone. The four initial memorial tablets, installed for the unveiling, each consisted of two large custom-made tiles, with each tablet costing £3 5s (about £360 as of 2019) to produce. Only four tablets were installed by the time of the unveiling ceremony, and Watts already had concerns about the potential costs of installing the 120 tablets envisaged in the memorial's design.Costs were allayed by using standard 6-inch (15 cm) tiles for the next set of tablets, reducing the costs to a more manageable £2 per tablet. In 1902, nine further tablets were installed, intermittently spaced along the central of the five rows, including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had lobbied. The subjects of the 13 initial tiles had been personally selected by Watts, who had for many years maintained a list of newspaper reports of heroic actions potentially worthy of recognition. However, by this time he was in his eighties and in increasingly poor health, and in January 1904 the vicar and churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate formed the Humble Heroes Memorial Committee to oversee the completion of the project, agreeing to defer to Watts regarding additions to the memorial. Watts strenuously objected to the name, as \\"not being applicable to anything as splendid as heroic self-sacrifice\\", and the committee was renamed the \\"Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee\\".On 1 July 1904 George Frederic Watts died at New Little Holland House, aged 87. He was hailed \\"The last great Victorian\\", and a memorial service was held in St Paul's Cathedral, 300 yards (270 m) south of Postman's Park, on 7 July 1904.On 11 July 1904 Mary Watts wrote to the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial...

It is saved from dour didacticism by the power of the central child's performance. 2. Strong work from Mayance and Thomas keeps Sarah's Key from rusting amid the sometime soddenness of the script. 3. Sarah's Key is directed with some sensitivity but seldom catches fire, and Scott Thomas is left adrift in a part that doesn't quite match her abilities. 4. Wildly inconsistent. 5. Based on a novel by Tatiana de Rosney, the picture is superbly acted, especially by 10-year-old Melusine Mayance as Sarah, and tense and distressing in parts. 6.

So what we're going to do is divide both sides of the equation by -541. This way, once again, it's fair and the equation stays balanced. Once you do the division, you find that s is equal to -25. So there you go! The answer is -25. If you replace 's' with -25 in the initial equation, you'd find that the left side equals to the right side, which means -25 is indeed the correct answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the place that was closed in 1970? , can you please find it? Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What is the long term result of the armistice\\" is in \\"The war started badly for the US and UN. North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The long-term result of the armistice is that North and South Korea remain divided at the 38th parallel, with both countries still technically in a state of war since a peace treaty was never signed.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. You are given a new situation: Two different types of animals live in the same habitat but have vastly different behaviors. Animals A and B are both the same size which is relatively small. Animal A lives in small groups of 4 or 5. Animal B however lives in very large groups and when they move around they all move at the same time. Both groups are also hunted by the same predator. and a hint : Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding Please answer this question : Which group of animal is likely more fit, animal A of B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Animal B is likely more fit than Animal A. The reasoning behind this is as follows: 1. Animal A lives in smaller groups of 4 or 5, which might result in less shared vigilance against predators, thereby making them more vulnerable. They also have less time and energy for foraging as they need to be more vigilant. 2. Animal B lives in large groups, and they all move at the same time. This behavior can create a confusional effect on predators, which is known to be more effective when more individuals are present. This means that Animal B has a better chance of escaping or avoiding predators as a group. 3. The hint provided emphasizes the benefits of aggregation for protecting against predation, with meerkats as an example of shared vigilance and schools of sardines or flocks of starlings as examples of synchronous movement to confuse and avoid predators. Considering these factors, it can be concluded that Animal B is likely more fit, as their large group size and synchronous movement provide them with better protection against predators."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in this process of mushroom growth is the development or growth of the \\"basidiomycete\\", which is a type of fungus that eventually creates the basidia. Here is a detailed explanation of the complete cycle with the first step included: 1. Development or growth of the Basidiomycete: This is the initiating event of the mushroom lifecycle and the backbone of the process. The basidiomycete, a fungus, forms mycelium, an intricate network of fungal threads. These threads help to absorb nutrients and water under the soil, which are necessary for the growth of the fungus. Basidiomycetes can be found in various environments, including soil, plant debris, wood, and dung. 2. The basidia gives off spores: The basidiomycete produces a structure known as a basidiocarp - the aerial, sexually reproducing structure for the fungi. From this basidiocarp, basidia form on the gills of the mushroom. Each of these tiny, club-shaped basidia produce spores. 3. The spores germinate: After being dispersed, often by air currents, the spores land in a suitable environment where they undergo germination. This involves the spore absorbing water and developing a tubular growth called a hypha. 4. The spores create Hyphae: The hypha starts to grow and elongate, forming a mycelium. This mycelium is the vegetative part of the fungus and is crucial for growth and development. 5. Multiple Hyphae meet and converge: Interactions between different hyphae lead to their convergence. This phenomenon is essential in forming a more complex mycelial network. 6. They join with Mycelium: The converging hyphae join together to add to the mycelial network, helping to create a robust nutrient and water-absorbing structure that supports further growth. 7. A hyphal knot forms in the ground: A hyphal knot, essentially a condensed mass of hyphae, forms at the intersection of the mycelial network. This knot functions as the initiation site of mushroom formation. 8. A primordia shoots out of the ground: The hyphal knot gives rise to the mushroom primordium which starts growing towards the surface. This is the first visible sign of a mushroom, often looking like a tiny, pin-like structure that emerges from the soil. 9. A mushroom cap is formed: As the mushroom begins maturing, the cap of the mushroom begins to form. This cap, which will eventually house the basidia, first appears as a small dome on top of the stalk. This process repeats as the mature mushroom disperses its spores, creating a whole new generation of fungi. The entire lifecycle is controlled by environmental factors like temperature, light, humidity, and nutrient availability. It is fascinating to see how mushrooms, a seemingly simple organism, have such a complex mating and reproduction system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This article: Of Human Feelings received considerable acclaim from contemporary critics. Reviewing the album for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark recording from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmute conventional polyphony and may be the most challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and \\"let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center\\". Giddins also highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk\\", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displays expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record \\"a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness\\". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau called its \\"warm, listenable harmolodic funk\\" an artistic \\"breakthrough if not a miracle\\". He found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated, writing in The Village Voice, \\"the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian.\\"Purist critics in jazz complained about the music's incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar. In Stereo Review, Chris Albertson deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused. Dan Sullivan of the Los Angeles Times believed the album's supporters in \\"hip rock circles\\" had overlooked flaws, arguing that Tacuma and Coleman's playing sound like a unique \\"beacon of clarity\\" amid an incessant background. Leonard Feather wrote in the Toledo Blade that the music is stylistically ambiguous, potentially controversial, and difficult to assess but... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk?\\", what is it ?

Studies have shown that people who live in warm, sunny climates are no happier than those in chilly, wet climates, he says. So the British talking about the weather may be making us gloomier than the weather itself.

With songs such as \\"Maybellene\\" (1955), \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" (1956), \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" (1957) and \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" is a 1956 hit single by Chuck Berry, originally released on Chess Records, with \\"Drifting Heart\\" as the B-side. The lyrics of the song mention rock and roll and the desire for rhythm and blues to replace classical music. The title of the song is an imperative directed at the composer Ludwig van Beethoven to roll over in his grave in reaction to the new genre of music that Berry was promoting. The song has been covered by many other artists, including the Beatles and the Electric Light Orchestra. \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine ranked it number 97 on its list of the \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". - \`\` Around and Around '' is a 1958 rock song written and first recorded by Chuck Berry . It originally appeared under the name \`\` Around & Around '' as the B - side to the single \`\` Johnny B. Goode '' . - \\"Maybellene\\" is one of the first rock-and-roll songs. It was written and recorded in 1955 by Chuck Berry, and inspired/adapted from the Western Swing fiddle tune \\"Ida Red,\\" which was recorded in 1938 by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. Berry's song tells the story of a hot rod race and a broken romance. It was released in July 1955 as a single by Chess Records, of Chicago, Illinois. It was Berry's first single and his first hit. \\"Maybellene\\" is considered one of the pioneering rock-and-roll songs: \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine wrote, \\"Rock & roll guitar starts here.\\" The record is an early instance of the complete rock-and-roll package: youthful subject matter; a small, guitar-driven combo; clear diction; and an atmosphere of unrelenting excitement.

By the time the children reach high school, something remarkable has happened. A survey found that those who as four-year-olds had enough self-control to hold out generally grew up to be more popular, adventurous, confident and dependable. The children who gave in to temptation early were more likely to be lonely, easily frustrated and inflexible . Actually, the ability to delay reward is a sign of emotional intelligence which doesn't show up on an IQ test.

Created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko , the character is voiced by Dante Basco and is portrayed by Dev Patel in M. Night Shyamalan 's 2010 film The Last Airbender . Zuko is the Crown Prince of the Fire Nation and an incredibly powerful Firebender , meaning he has the elemental ability to create and control fire and to redirect lightning through martial arts . He is the eldest child of Fire Lord Ozai and Princess Ursa , the older brother of Princess Azula and older half - brother of Kiyi . Before the events of the series Zuko is exiled from the Fire Nation by his father and told he must capture the Avatar to restore his honor and right to the throne . Zuko is accompanied and advised in his search by his uncle , Iroh . Over time , Zuko sympathizes with oppressed peoples , and joins the Avatar to restore peace . Zuko has two well known great - grandfathers : on his father 's side , Fire Lord Sozin , who started the hundred - year - war , and on his mother 's side Avatar Roku , the Avatar preceding Aang . In \`\` The Deserter '' , Zuko 's name was listed on a Fire Nation wanted poster as \`\` '' ( z kòu ) . In \`\` Tales of Ba Sing Se '' , his name was written as \`\` '' ( s kè ) on his segment 's title card . - A monk (from , \\"monachos\\", \\"single, solitary\\" and Latin \\"monachus\\") is a person who practices religious asceticism, living either alone or with any number of other monks. A monk may be a person who decided to dedicate his life to serving all other living beings, or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live his life in prayer and contemplation. The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy. - In the show, Azula is the crown princess of the Fire Nation and a Firebending prodigy. Upon Fire Lord Ozai's orders, she begins a quest with her childhood friends and Ty Lee to retrieve her exiled brother Prince Zuko and their uncle Iroh, while also attempting to capture the Avatar, a transcendent being capable of manipulating all four elements (Earth, Water, Fire and Air). Azula is known to be cold, cruel, manipulative, and, as her brother Zuko says, 'always lies'. Throughout the series, she is shown to be capable of a much higher level of bending and yields blue flames, instead of red and orange, as well as having the rare firebending ability to generate pure whitish-blue lightning. - Aang is the last surviving Airbender, a monk of the Air Nomads' Southern Air Temple. He is an incarnation of the \\"Avatar\\", the spirit of light and peace manifested in human form. As the Avatar, Aang controls all four elements and is tasked with keeping the at peace. At 12 years old, Aang is the series' reluctant hero, spending a century in suspended animation before joining new friends and Sokka on a quest to master the elements and save their world from the imperialist Fire Nation. - Princess is a regal rank and the feminine equivalent of prince (from Latin \\"princeps\\", meaning principal citizen). Most often, the term has been used for the consort of a prince or for the daughters of a king or sovereign prince. What is the relationship between 'zuko' and 'king'? Answer:","completion":"Zuko, a fictional character from the animated television series Avatar: The Last Airbender, is the Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. His relationship with the term 'king' lies in his birthright and lineage within the Fire Nation's royal family. As the eldest son of Fire Lord Ozai and Princess Ursa, Zuko has a direct connection to the ruling family and is the successor to the throne. Initially, Zuko is exiled from the Fire Nation by his father and tasked with capturing the Avatar to restore his honor and reclaim his right to the throne. Throughout the series, Zuko's journey leads him to question the Fire Nation's actions and his own role in them. He eventually comes to sympathize with those oppressed by the Fire Nation and joins the Avatar to restore peace, ultimately becoming a more compassionate and just ruler. Although Zuko is not a king in the traditional sense, he is a prince who later ascends to the position of Fire Lord, a role akin to a king within the Fire Nation. This position holds significant authority and responsibility, as the Fire Lord rules over the Fire Nation and governs its people and military. In summary, Zuko is the Crown Prince of the Fire Nation, with his relationship to the term 'king' being synonymous with his position as the heir to the throne and later as the Fire Lord, which is equivalent to a king within the Fire Nation hierarchy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A NASA working group hosted a discussion this week to ask: Who owns the moon? The answer, of course, is no use. The Outer Space Treaty, the international signed by more than 100 countries, states that the moon and other celestial bodies are the province of all mankind. No doubt that would annoy all of the people throughout the ages, like monks from the Middle Ages, who have tried to claim the moon was theirs. But ownership is different from property rights. People who rent apartments, for example, don't own where they live, but they still hold rights. So with all of the upcoming missions to visit the moon and beyond, space industry thought leaders are seriously asking themselves how to deal with a potential land rush. \\" This is a very relevant discussion right now.

(Associated Press) A woman casts her vote for president during general elections in Mexico City, Sunday, July 1, 2018. Sunday’s elections for posts at every level of government are Mexico’s largest ever and have become a referendum on corruption, graft and other tricks used to divert taxpayer money to officials’ pockets... (Associated Press) MEXICO CITY (AP) — Leftist populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was on the brink of a historic presidential win Sunday night as an exit poll gave him an overwhelming lead and both of his chief rivals conceded defeat. Lopez Obrador, who has vowed to transform Mexico and oust the \\"mafia of power\\" that rules the country, had a 16 to 26 point lead over his nearest rival, conservative Ricardo Anaya, and a slightly larger edge over Jose Antonio Meade of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party, according to the survey by polling firm Consulta Mitofsky. \\"The tendency favors Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. ... I recognize his triumph,\\" Anaya said in a speech to supporters. Minutes earlier Meade had also conceded, saying that \\"for the good of Mexico, I wish him the greatest success.\\" Electoral officials had not released any vote returns. Lopez Obrador, better known as AMLO, has said he will rule Mexico for the poor and fight rampant corruption. \\"There is a lot of inequality, a lot of violence in this country,\\" said Lopez Obrador voter Hugo Carlos, 73. \\"This situation has to be changed.\\" Exit polls by Consulta Mitofsky also forecast clear gubernatorial wins for allies of Lopez Obrador's Morena party in four of eight state races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was predicted to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party. Lopez Obrador worries many who fear he could set the country back decades and lead to disaster with an interventionist economic policy. He has pledged to give scholarships or paid apprenticeships to youth, and increase support payments for the elderly. \\"I am concerned that some candidates are making proposals that are impossible, because they're very expensive to carry out,\\" said Juan Carlos Limas, 26, who lined up at a Mexico City precinct to vote for Ricardo Anaya, who is running second in polls for a right-left coalition. All the candidates are lambasting President Donald Trump's policies against migrants and Mexico, but voters were wondering who could best deal with Trump. Sunday's elections for posts at every level of government are Mexico's largest ever and have become a referendum on corruption, graft and other tricks used to divert taxpayer money to officials' pockets. Many saw this election as Lopez Obrador's best shot at the presidency after 12 years of near-permanent campaigning with his anti-establishment message falling on receptive ears amid widespread disillusionment with politicians. \\"The corrupt regime is coming to its end,\\" Lopez Obrador said at his final campaign event Wednesday. \\"We represent modernity forged from below.\\" Much of the popular ire has been aimed at unpopular President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, whose market-oriented economic reforms have yet to benefit many Mexicans, and Meade struggled during the campaign to escape popular rejection of the party. Anaya tried to harness the youth vote with an emphasis on technology and new ideas, but he divided his own conservative party to take its candidacy and it's unclear if his new allies in the leftist Democratic Revolution Party will actually turn out for someone from the other end of the ideological spectrum. Sunday was the first time that an independent candidate appears on the ballot. Jaime \\"El Bronco\\" Rodriguez fought for attention with a horse-mounted \\"everyman\\" campaign and by tossing out policy bombs like his proposal to cut off the hands of public officials caught stealing. Without the big party machinery it was an uphill battle. It is also the first time Mexicans living abroad can vote for down ballot races like senators. More than 181,000 received ballots and the 97,000 that the National Electoral Institute had gotten back by Friday morning were already double what they got in 2012. Casting his own vote, Pena Nieto promised to work with whoever wins on the transition. \\"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected,\\" Pena Nieto told reporters. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as \\"the legitimate president.\\" His allies warned even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business. Still, the voting was by and large peaceful, apart from the usual complaints about some volunteer-staffed polling places opening late. The head of the country's electoral institute, Lorenzo Cordova, said voting was proceeding \\"peacefully, without major incidents,\\" and that only four of the 156,807 polling places failed to open. On Saturday, the Democratic Revolution party said four of its members were killed in Mexico State, west of Mexico City, while trying to prevent hand-outs of goods by the ruling party to potential voters. The government of the northern state of Chihuahua reported that three people were arrested in the border city of Ciudad Juarez for allegedly trying to buy votes for an unnamed political party. And in Michoacan state, polling places in a few villages were cancelled after some inhabitants said they didn't want elections involving political parties, which they mistrust. Some ballots were stolen and burned in the town of Nahuatzen to prevent voting. In the northwestern border city of Tijuana, 29-year-old engineer Jorge Serrano Martinez said he voted for Lopez Obrador because he wanted \\"to give the opportunity to another political party to do different things.\\" \\"He is not linked to any act of corruption and he has a history as a social fighter,\\" Serrano said. \\"I think he is the least corrupt of all.\\" ___ Associated Press writers Maria Verza and Andrea Rodriguez in Mexico City and Nancy Moya in Tijuana contributed to this report.\\" ||||| Summary:","completion":"Leftist populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, often referred to as AMLO, has become Mexico's next president after winning the general elections held on July 1, 2018. His triumph marks a historic moment for Mexican politics as he promises a transformative leadership focusing on tackling corruption, addressing inequality, and supporting the poor. An exit poll placed him around 16 to 26 points ahead of his nearest rival, conservative Ricardo Anaya, with both Anaya and Jose Antonio Meade from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party conceding defeat. AMLO also pledged to offer scholarships or paid apprenticeships for young people, increase support payments for the elderly, and challenge President Donald Trump's policies against migrants and Mexico. The presidential win for AMLO and his Morena party indicates a significant change in the Mexican political landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Keep in mind that the following symptoms could also be symptoms of different medical conditions, so if you experience several of these symptoms, contact your doctor and set up some tests (these tests will be covered in the next section). 1. Chest pain or discomfort: This is a common symptom of heart cancer and can be felt as a sharp, stabbing pain, or as a dull ache or pressure in the chest area. 2. Shortness of breath: People with heart cancer might find it difficult to breathe, especially during physical exertion. 3. Swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet: This may be due to fluid buildup resulting from impaired heart function and poor blood circulation. 4. Fatigue: Feeling tired or fatigued, even while resting or not participating in rigorous activities, can be a sign of issues with your heart. 5. Irregular heartbeat: A change in your heartbeat pattern, such as rapid or irregular rhythms, might signify heart cancer. 6. Dizziness or lightheadedness: This could be a result of your body not receiving enough blood supply due to the cancer's interference with normal heart function. 7. Weight loss or loss of appetite: These symptoms might indicate that your body is not properly absorbing nutrients due to heart cancer. 8. Night sweats or fever: Unexplained fever and excessive sweating during the night can be an indication of an underlying cancer. Remember, experiencing one or more of these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have heart cancer, as they could also be related to other medical conditions. It is essential to contact your doctor and discuss your concerns. Your doctor will recommend appropriate tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to help diagnose potential heart-related issues or cancer accurately. Early detection of heart cancer is crucial for effective treatment, so staying vigilant, listening to your body, and seeking medical help promptly can greatly improve the chances of a positive outcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Start with the goal of the game and work backwards to figure out what players will need to do to get there. Ideally, the rules you create should be simple, logical, and consistent, so that the game plays out the same way every time (with different results, of course). In many classic board games, players roll dice and move their game piece a certain number of spaces depending on the number that comes up. More sophisticated games, like \\"Thunderstone\\" or \\"Settlers of Catan,\\" challenge players to build strong card decks or score points in order to win. For a game with a “paperboy” theme, players might roll to complete their newspaper route before the school bell rings while encountering obstacles like lawn sprinklers and unfriendly dogs on the gameboard. Keep them extremely basic at first. Little by little, you can make your rule system more intricate by adding secondary objectives, random events, or penalties for making poor decisions. Different types of games will work better with a different number of players. Most board games are designed for 2-4 players, but it may be possible for as many as 6 people to participate if the rules are simple and there are enough cards or pieces to go around. Keep in mind that the more people you have playing, the more difficult it will be to make the game mechanics work. A head-to-head strategy game could be played by as few as 2-3 people, whereas one that involves identifying a criminal from a lineup of suspects would benefit from having more players in order to make the gameplay more of a challenge. Your game might call for individual player pieces, cards, tokens, or any number of other components, depending on the theme and specific mechanics. The choice of what type of item will be used to perform the different actions is ultimately up to you. However, it will be best to go with accessories that are most practical for accomplishing the game’s goal. Stick to 1 or 2 components to keep the gameplay from getting convoluted. Players who are forced to juggle cards, coins, dice, and a pen-and-paper scorekeeping system will quickly find themselves overwhelmed. Now that you have an idea of how your game will play out, envision the exact form it will take. Designate your starting and ending points, draw out spaces, and mark where important pieces will be played. Be sure to label what each element is and describe how players will interact with them. When you’re finished, you’ll have a working blueprint for your game. The simplest game boards are there to direct the players’ movements. Others might serve as a platform for laying down cards and reading their outcomes, or provide clues for solving puzzles. Commit a crude version of your game board to paper as soon as an idea hits you. This will make it easier for you to work out any remaining kinks without losing the thread of the game.

Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his finest films in his historic career in this very tense, and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children. With an A-list cast headed by Philip Seymour Hoffman (an Oscar-worthy performance here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has captured not just elements of botched crime stories such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories such as Ordinary People. Many viewers might be confused and feel underwhelmed at the construction of the plot Lumet has gone with here. Instead of showing it in a linear manner, he has gone the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order. I personally found this to be very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next. The script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are totally engaging to watch and Lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually doesn't delve in.

They both had some aphid infestations, but Mary had more aphids on her farm, so she used every method and insecticide available to get rid of them, with limited success. Which farmer sprayed plants thoroughly with a strong water jet? Hint: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays.","completion":"Based on the given information, it is not explicitly mentioned which gardener, Pam or Mary, used the method of spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet. However, we can infer that Mary, who was struggling with a higher number of aphids on her farm and tried every method and insecticide, might have used the water jet technique as one of her multiple attempts to address the infestation.

Archaeologists have been able to prove that the religious resin was used by wealthy Romans, who settled in areas of the country, including London and York, more than 1,700 years ago. The sweet smelling substance, which was more valuable than gold for millennia, was found on skeletal remains and plaster body casings dating back to the 3rd and 4th centuries. Frankincense (pictured), one of the gifts carried by the Three Kings in the Christmas story, was used in elaborate burials in Roman Britain more than 1,700 years ago, according to new research. The discovery shows that even while the Roman Empire was in decline, the precious resin was being transported to its furthest northern outpost for use in funerals of high ranking individuals. Until now, evidence for the use of resins in ancient funerary rites has rarely come to light outside of Egypt. The discovery was made by carrying out molecular analysis of materials previously thought to be of little interest – debris inside burial containers and residues on bones - which looked like mere dust. Chemical analysis carried out on 49 burials in Dorset, Wiltshire, London and York revealed traces of the southern Arabian sap from the Boswellia sacra tree, on four of them. Another 10 contained evidence of other resins from the Mediterranean and northern Europe. It’s the first time archaeologists have been able to prove that Frankincense was used by Romans who settled in Britain. Traces of the resin were found inside the coffin of a wealthy Roman woman who was buried in the fourth century AD in London, or Londonium as it was known. Her silt-filled coffin is shown left and bust, right. Frankincense comes from the resinous sap from a unique family of Boswelia trees. Only one, Boswelia sacra, produces the highest grade of frankincense, also known as ‘true’ or ‘commercial’ incense. Careful incisions are made in the tree at key times of year, and the sap slowly pours out. Once the sap dries and hardens it is ready to be used. To release its scent the frankincense is either burned or smouldered over hot coals. Classical texts claim that the aromatic, antimicrobial substances were used as a practical measure to mask the smell of decay, or slow decomposition during the often lengthy funeral rites of the Roman elite. But it was Frankincense’s ritual importance that justified its transportation from one end of the Empire to the other. Seen both as gifts from the gods and to the gods, resins were thought to purify the dead and help them negotiate the final rite of passage to the afterlife. Rhea Brettell, a student at the University of Bradford, explained: ‘Archaeologists have relied on finding visible resin fragments to substantiate the descriptions of burial rites in classical texts, but these rarely survive. ‘Our alternative approach of analysing grave deposits to find the molecular signatures of the resins - which fortunately are very distinctive - has enabled us to carry out the first systematic study across a whole province.’ The resins were only recovered from burials of higher status individuals, identified from the type of container used, the clothing they were wearing, and items buried with them. Professor Carl Heron from the university said: ‘It is remarkable the first evidence for the use of frankincense in Britain should come from such seemingly unpromising samples, yet our analysis demonstrates that traces of these exotic resins can survive for over 1,700 years in what others would reject as dirt.’ Classical texts mention these aromatic, antimicrobial substances as being used as a practical measure to mask the smell of decay or slow decomposition during the often lengthy funeral rites of the Roman elite. The resin was also presented to the baby Jesus by the Magi (illustrated) One of the frankincense-impregnated coffins contained the remains of a noble woman, who was laid to rest with expensive jewellery. The rich young lady was buried in a sarcophagus in the fourth century and her remains were discovered near Spitalfields Market in the City of London in 1999. Dr Rebecca Redfern, of the Museum of London, which is home to the remains, said: ‘This eye-opening study has provided us with new and amazing insights into the funerary rituals of late Roman Britain. The research, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, mentions resins from three different plant families, including pistacia from the Mediterranean or the Levant, Pinaceae from northern Europe and Boswellia (frankincense) from southern Arabia and eastern Africa. The Romans, Greeks, Egyptians and Israelites all used frankincense as part of their religious ceremonies. It was extensively used in burial rituals as an embalming material, an offering to the departed, and a means to cover the odour of the dead body. The Roman emperor, Nero, burned an entire year’s harvest at the funeral of his favourite mistress and the resin of course featured in the Christmas Story, which is where many westerners recognise it from. Frankincense comes from the resinous sap from the Boswelia sacra tree (pictured) and the sap is extracted by making careful incisions in the tree's bark.

Archaeologists have discovered evidence of frankincense use in elaborate burials of Roman Britain's elite, marking the first time such evidence has been found outside of Egypt. 2. The resin was traced in skeletal remains and plaster body casings dated back to the 3rd and 4th centuries in key areas including London and York. 3. Molecular analysis of materials previously disregarded, such as debris inside burial containers and residues on bones, revealed the presence of the valuable resin. 4. Traces of frankincense, a resin from the Boswellia sacra tree, were found on four out of 49 analysed burials. 5. This discovery provides the first concrete evidence of frankincense use by Romans who settled in Britain, including a wealthy Roman woman who was buried with traces of the resin in her coffin. 6. The substance was used in funeral rites to mask the smell of decay and aid the dead in their journey to the afterlife. 7. The researchers suggest that the resin was transported to Roman Britain from as far away as southern Arabia and eastern Africa, emphasizing its high cultural and religious significance despite its high cost. 8. The presence of the resin was generally associated with higher status individuals, identified by their high-value burial items and containers. 9. This study has provided new insights into the funeral rituals of late Roman Britain, a topic that was previously underexplored. 10. Other types of resins from the Mediterranean, the Levant, and northern Europe were also identified in the burials, further demonstrating the breadth of Roman Britain's trade networks and cultural influences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Daniel Devlin lives in the same house as his children and sees them every day – yet he is unable to recognise them at all. Mr Devlin, 46, from Nunhead, London, is living with a bizarre condition called prosopagnosia, also known as face-blindness, meaning he struggles to recognise faces - even those of his own family. Mr Devlin, a painter, has been forced to memorise his family's voices and body language in order to know who they are. But reading voices and body language doesn't always work, and has even mistaken another boy for his son when picking his children up from school before. Scroll down for video. Daniel Devlin, 46, suffers from rare condition prosopagnosia, also known as face-blindness. He was born with the part of his brain responsible for facial recognition damaged. Despite living with his wife Katarina, daughter Klara, eight and son Emil, five, he struggles to recognise them. Mr Devlin once mistook another boy for his son Emil, five, (pictured) when he was picking his children up from school. Mr Devlin said: 'Humans have a special ability to recognise people by seeing their faces, I really don't have this ability. 'Maybe a good way to imagine what it's like to have prosopagnosia is to try and recognise people by what their hands look like. 'Every person has a different hand but if someone showed you a photo of someone's hands, you might struggle to recognise who the person is, even if that person turns out to be someone you know very well. 'I just thought that everyone was the same or maybe I just wasn't putting in as much effort as others to remember people. 'If I saw my wife Katarina somewhere unexpected and she pretended not to know me, then I'm not sure I would know it was her. 'It often leaves me in some awkward situations, especially when I don't recognise people that I should or think I know people that I don't. 'I have learnt to recognise people based on their body language and voices instead.' Mr Devlin struggles to recognise the faces of his wife Katarina, as well as his children Klara, eight, and Emil, five. Mrs Devlin said: 'When the children are in school uniform, they all look very similar to Daniel. 'He once mistook someone else for our son, which got a very disapproving look from the boy's mother. Prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterised by the inability to recognise people's faces. Also known as 'face-blindness', the severity of the condition depends on the degree of impairment a person suffers. Some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face, while others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces, and in more severe cases sufferers cannot distinguish a face as being different from an object. Some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces. The condition is not related to memory loss, impaired vision or learning disabilities. It is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus - a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory. Prosopagnosia can result from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some neurodegenerative diseases. In some cases the condition is congenital, and present at birth. It appears to run in families, which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion. Some degree of prosopagnosia is often found in children with autism and Asperger's Syndrome. Treatment of the condition focuses on helping sufferers develop compensatory strategies, including relying on voice recognition, clothing, or unique physical attributes. Source: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. 'If we've met someone before I will try and tell him who it is before we speak to them. 'It does cause some awkward situations but usually we just find it funny.' Experts said propagnosia is not linked to problems with vision, memory or intelligence. Instead, it is thought to be the result of impairment in the right 'fusiform gyrus' of the brain - a fold that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory. This could be as a result of a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some neurodegenerative diseases. Or, in cases such as Mr Devlin's - the condition is present at birth, and the pathways in the brain responsible for recognition never developed properly. Though he now knows he has had the had the condition all his life, Mr Devlin was only diagnosed in the last few years, through sheer chance. He said: 'I heard a programme about it on the radio and realised that's what I had. Test confirmed he was suffering from face-blindness. He said: 'I had to do tests where I was shown a number of faces, then I would be shown another set of faces, some that were shown before and some new ones. 'I would have to say which ones I had seen before. My score was well below that of people without the condition. 'We also had the same kind of test but instead of faces, we would have images of horses or houses and my scores would be in line with people without the condition.' It is thought the condition affects up to one in 50 people, the equivalent of about 1.5 million people in the UK. Some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face, but in more severe cases sufferers cannot distinguish a face as being different from an object. Some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces. Mr Devlin's face-blindness is not so severe, but he has failed to recognise celebrities in the past. He said: 'Growing up I loved films, but my favourite stars were always those that had distinctive voices or characters like James Cagney or Woody Allen. 'Katarina is Croatian and once we saw a very famous rock band there. I met the drummer and was convinced he was Katarina's neighbour. 'I don't think he was used to not being recognised and he was a bit annoyed.' Although there is no treatment for the condition, Mr Devlin has learnt coping strategies . He said: 'Most people know that I have it so it's not a problem. 'There are ways to cope. If I see someone who seems to know me then I ask them vague questions, like how are things, is work okay, until I can figure out who they are. 'I also always say \\"nice to see you\\" rather than \\"nice to meet you\\", just in case I have met them before.' Mr Devlin says if his wife Katarina pretended not to know him, he probably wouldn't recognise her. If someone they know approaches them, Mrs Devlin whispers their name into her husband's ear so he can greet them, even if he doesn't recognise them. There is a prosopagnosia research group at Birkbeck University, London, where Mr Devlin found out he suffered from the condition. Researcher Joanna Parketny, who has been working with Mr Devlin, said: 'Individuals affected by this condition have trouble in recognising not only famous but also personally known faces such as friends or even family. They also struggle to learn new faces, while having normal vision, intellect and memory, she added. She continued: 'The ability to successfully recognise faces is an incredibly important skill which allows us to navigate in the complex social environment.' Not being able to recognise faces can negatively affect people's well-being and lead to anxiety in social situations, she said. 'In extreme but rare cases it can lead to a person's withdrawal and alienation,' she said. 'The impact of prosopagnosia on an individual depends on the severity of the condition, their individual predisposition and personality. 'It's also dependent on the presence or absence of other conditions and lastly but very importantly the attitude and awareness of the people who make up our social environment.'

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who painted an enormous panoramic painting? ? The visual arts during the Song dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point.

It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match. A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it. The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor. There was no other hiding-place possible, except beneath the bed, and the ruthless hand of the inspector had torn off the white muslin bed hangings, revealing emptiness underneath. Rolfe went out into the hall again, and entered the room next the bedroom. This apartment was apparently used as a dining-room, for it contained a large table, a few chairs, a small sideboard, a spirit-stand, a case of books and ornaments, and two small oak presses.

Help as much as you can. Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Half a year before graduation from college, my son David began to seek a job. Due to the financial crisis, the competition was ever-fierce. My son targeted a company that was located in a coastal city. It was intended to employ only one person among more than twenty candidates, I said to David, \\"You should not harbor too much hope for fear that you would feel terribly disappointed when you fail.\\" He said to me, \\"I am not afraid of disappointment. As long as I try, there will always be hope!\\" Three young men could enter the final round, which would later decide one person to be employed. Everything seemed to go quite well and David entered the final round in a week. Unexpectedly, the interview was unbelievably simple, during which the interviewer only chatted with them for a while. The interview strategies my son prepared were not useful at all. The interviewer said the company would inform them of the result in 3 days. On the morning of the third day, David received the text from the company that he was not employed. David felt disappointed. In nightfall that day, David suddenly told me excitedly on phone that he had been employed. Greatly surprised, I asked him, \\"What's the whole matter?\\" David told me that he received another text saying that he was employed. David felt very confused about it. Later he found out the first text sent to him was also part of the test in the interview. Three men received the same text this morning and only David's reply was satisfying to the company. I asked my son, \\"How did all of you reply?\\" My son said, \\"One did not reply. The other said \\"goodbye\\" and I said \\"thank you\\".\\" Only then did I know that my son's \\"hope\\" came in that way. That is, when you feel disappointed, do not forget to say \\"Thank you\\" to the one who disappoints you. Actually, it is a piece of cake to say \\"Thank you\\". Saying \\"Thank you\\" shows respect for others' work and demonstrates your grand generosity. Therefore, while under the same condition, you will get the upper hand in terms of opportunities compared... Question: What can be inferred from the passage?

Select from the following. - Place a teabag in a mug, pour cold water into the mug, wait for 4-5 minutes. - Place a teabag in a mug, pour boiling water into the mug, wait for 4-5 minutes. Answer:","completion":"Place a teabag in a mug, pour boiling water into the mug, wait for 4-5 minutes. The correct way to steep tea involves using boiling water, not cold water. When you steep tea, you are essentially extracting the flavors, aroma, and nutrients from the tea leaves. Boiling water is essential for this process, as it helps release these elements and provides the right temperature for effective steeping. The other option, using cold water, is not the best way to steep tea, as it does not effectively extract the flavors and nutrients from the tea leaves. Cold water steeping would result in a weak and underwhelming cup of tea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.
