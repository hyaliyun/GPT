Pieter Willem Botha, DMS (Afrikaans pronunciation: ['pit@r 'v@l@m 'bU@ta]; 12 January 1916 - 31 October 2006), commonly known as \\"P. W.\\" and Die Groot Krokodil (Afrikaans for \\"The Big Crocodile\\"), was the leader of South Africa from 1978 to 1989, serving as the last Prime Minister from 1978 to 1984 and the first executive State President from 1984 to 1989. First elected to Parliament in 1948, Botha was an outspoken opponent of majority rule and international communism. However, his administration did make concessions towards political reform, whereas internal unrest saw widespread human rights abuses at the hands of the government. Botha resigned the leadership of the ruling National Party in February 1989 after suffering a stroke and six months later was coerced to leave the presidency as well. At age 30, Botha was elected head of the National Party Youth in 1946, and two years later won a race for the House of Assembly as representative of George in the southern Cape Province in the general election which saw the beginning of the National Party's 46-year tenure in power. In 1958 Botha was appointed Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs by Hendrik Verwoerd, and in 1961 advanced to Minister of Coloured Affairs. He was appointed Minister for Defence by Verwoerd's successor B.J. Vorster, upon Verwoerd's murder, in 1966. Under his 14 years as its leader, the South African Defence Force reached a zenith, at times consuming 20% of the national budget, compared to 1.3% in 1968, and was involved in the South African Border War. When Vorster resigned following allegations of his involvement in the Muldergate Scandal in 1978, Botha was elected as his successor by the National Party caucus, besting the electorate's favourite, 45-year-old Foreign Minister Pik Botha. In the final internal ballot, he beat Connie Mulder, the scandal's namesake, in a 78-72 vote. Botha was keen to promote constitutional reform, and hoped to implement a form of federal system in South Africa that would allow for greater \\"self-rule\\" for black homelands (or Bantustans), while still retaining the supremacy of a white central government, and foremost expand the rights of Coloureds (South Africans of mixed ancestry) and Asians in order to widen support for the government. Upon enacting the reforms, he remarked in the House of Assembly; \\"We must adapt or die.\\" On becoming head of the government, Botha retained the defence portfolio until October 1980, when he appointed chief of the South African Defence Force, General Magnus Malan, his successor. From his ascension to the cabinet, Botha pursued an ambitious military policy designed to increase South Africa's military capability. He sought to improve relations with the West - especially the United States - but with mixed results. He argued that the preservation of the apartheid government, though unpopular, was crucial to stemming the tide of African Communism, which had made in-roads into neighbouring Angola and Mozambique after these two former Portuguese colonies obtained independence. As Prime Minister and later State President, his greatest parliamentary opponents were Harry Schwarz and Helen Suzman of the Progressive Federal Party until 1987, when his former cabinet colleague Andries Treurnicht's new Conservative Party became the official opposition on a strictly anti-concessionist agenda. In 1977, as Minister of Defence he began a secret nuclear weapons program, which culminated in the production of six nuclear bombs destroyed only in the early 1990s. He remained steadfast in South Africa's administration of the neighbouring territory South-West Africa, particularly while there was a presence of Cuban troops in Angola to the north. Botha was responsible for introducing the notorious police counter-insurgency unit, Koevoet. He was also instrumental in building the South African Defence Force's strength. Adding momentum to establishing units such as 32 Battalion. South African intervention in support of the rebel UNITA (Dr. Jonas Savimbi, a personal friend) movement in the Angolan Civil War continued until the late 1980s, terminating with the Tripartite Accord. To maintain the nation's military strength, a very strict draft was implemented to enforce compulsory military service for white South African men.

Q: One time I was walking my puppy (profile pic) who was then around 5 months, with my mum and grandma. By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn‚Äôt like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to). Here I am nervously sweet talking to them, my voice trembling saying good boys. My grandma is her despair grabs the GS‚Äôs neck, and his hair bristled and growled for a second before turning back to our pup. At this point my baby girl is sitting down with her tail tucked close, ears flattened, and head down. I thought ‚ÄúDear Lord someone‚Äôs losing a limb today.‚Äù When suddenly this car comes pulling up and this man comes out with a leash, the owner. He practically had to wrestle the GS into the car. A woman in a pickup truck comes next trying to get the husky but he ran away again, but my mom didn‚Äôt care, she scooped up our pup and ran, the leash trailing behind her, and even my grandma who has troubles in her knees speed walked.

In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B. Would bowl A fruits be preserved longer or shorter than bowl B fruits? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glac√© fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the hint, bowl A contains glace fruits that have been through the process of preservation using sugar syrup, while bowl B contains non-glace fruits that haven't been through this process. Step 1: Analyze the preserving process of glace fruits The process of making glace fruit involves placing the fruit in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the fruit's moisture and preserves it. Step 2: Understand the preservation duration The preservation process of glace fruits allows them to retain their quality for a year, as sugar saturation prevents the growth of spoilage microorganisms by creating an unfavorable osmotic pressure. Step 3: Compare the preservation times Non-glace fruits in bowl B haven't been through the sugar preservation process, meaning they would likely spoil much faster due to the lack of protection against microorganisms. Conclusion: Bowl A fruits (glace fruits) would be preserved for a longer duration than the fruits in bowl B (non-glace fruits)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Trivia question: What make of car was Mike Hawthorn driving when he won the F1 World Drivers Championship in 1958 And the answer is?","completion":"Mike Hawthorn won the 1958 Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship driving a Ferrari. More specifically, he raced the Ferrari 246 F1 during that season, which was a milestone as he became the first British driver to win the championship title. The Ferrari 246 F1 was a significant car in the history of Formula 1 racing. It was powered by a 2.4-liter Dino V6 engine, which was named after Enzo Ferrari's son, Dino Ferrari. This engine was the first V6 to be used in a Formula 1 car and produced around 280 horsepower. The car featured a tubular spaceframe construction and was equipped with a transverse-5 speed gearbox. Weighing approximately 630 kg, it had a top speed of around 300 km/h (186 mph). The 1958 Formula 1 season was highly competitive and had a dramatic conclusion. Hawthorn's main rival, Stirling Moss, driving a Vanwall, was leading the championship standings for most of the season. However, Hawthorn managed to accumulate more points due to consistent podium finishes despite winning only a single race, the French Grand Prix, which was held at Reims. During the last race of the season, the Moroccan Grand Prix, Moss needed to win and set the fastest lap time to secure the championship, provided Hawthorn finished lower than second place. As fate would have it, Moss won the race and set the fastest lap, but Hawthorn finished second, securing enough points to win the championship. The season ended with Hawthorn having a total of 42 points, just one point ahead of Moss, making it one of the closest championship battles in Formula 1 history. Mike Hawthorn's triumph in 1958 Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship driving the Ferrari 246 F1 was not only a testament to the competitive spirit of the British driver but also a nod to the exceptional performance and engineering prowess of the Ferrari team. Tragically, Hawthorn announced his retirement from motor racing after winning the championship and, a few months later, perished in a road accident in England."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are a few factors to consider during the baking process to achieve this goal, such as the ingredients, cookie dough consistency, baking time, and the cooling process. In this scenario, the two options provided revolve around the cooling process. Both options involve letting the cookies rest on the sheet pan for 20-30 seconds before moving them. Here, we will explore the benefits of each choice and suggest some additional tips for ensuring your cookies do not crumble. Option I: Let your cookie rest on the sheet pan for 20-30 seconds before moving them to a cooling plate. Choosing to move your cookies to a cooling plate after allowing them to rest for a short period on the sheet pan can be beneficial. By leaving them on the sheet pan for a moment, the residual heat begins to escape, allowing the cookies to solidify slightly. This makes them less prone to breaking or crumbling when they are transferred to the cooling plate. Cooling plates also have flat surfaces, which helps to reduce the risk of your cookies deforming or breaking during the cooling process. Option II: Let your cookie rest on the sheet pan for 20-30 seconds before moving them to a cooling rack. Similar to Option I, this method also involves allowing the cookies to rest on the sheet pan for a short time before transferring them to a cooling rack. Using a cooling rack enables better air circulation around the cookies, allowing them to cool more quickly and evenly. This can help prevent the cookies from becoming soggy from condensation that forms when they are left on the warm sheet pan for too long. The brief resting period helps to firm up the cookies and reduce the risk of them breaking when they are moved. In conclusion, both options can help keep your cookies from crumbling, with the primary difference being the method of cooling‚Äîusing a cooling plate or a cooling rack. It mostly comes down to personal preference and availability of equipment. Here are some additional suggestions to help ensure your cookies are less likely to crumble: 1. Refrigerate or chill dough before baking: Chilling the dough will help the cookies retain their shape during baking and reduces the likelihood of them spreading too much and becoming too thin, which can make them more prone to crumbling. 2. Proper baking time: Overbaking cookies can make them too brittle and prone to breaking. Ensure you're using the correct baking time and temperature for the type of cookie you're making. 3. Use the correct ingredients: Ensure you're using the proper ratios of butter, sugar, flour, and other ingredients in your recipe. Using high-quality ingredients can also make a difference in your cookies' texture and crumbliness. 4. Allow cookies to cool completely: Regardless of your chosen cooling method (plate or rack), allow your cookies to cool completely before handling or stacking them. This helps to ensure the cookies reach their optimal texture and are less likely to crumble. Ultimately, choose the option that best suits your preferences, equipment, and baking style. By following the recommendations provided and incorporating the additional suggestions, you'll be well on your way to baking delicious, perfect cookies that won't crumble."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld a Texas law that counts everyone, not just eligible voters, in deciding... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî A unanimous Supreme Court ruled Monday that states can count everyone, not just eligible voters, in deciding how to draw electoral districts. The justices turned back a challenge from Texas voters that could have dramatically altered political district boundaries and disproportionately affected the nation's growing Latino population. The court ruled that Texas' challenged state Senate districting map, using total population, complied with the principle of \\"one person, one vote,\\" the requirement laid out by the Supreme Court in 1964 that political districts be roughly equal in population. The issue, though, was what population to consider: everyone or just eligible voters. The challengers said the districts had vastly different numbers when looking at eligible voters, in violation of the Constitution. \\"Jurisdictions, we hold, may design state and local legislative districts with equal total populations; they are not obliged to equalize voter populations,\\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, summarizing her opinion for the court. Ginsburg said that \\"history, our decisions and settled practice in all 50 states and countless local jurisdictions point in the same direction.\\" Two rural Texas voters challenged the use of total population data in drawing state Senate districts because they said it inflates the voting power of city dwellers at their expense. In Texas, and other states with large immigrant populations, urban districts include many more people who are too young, not citizens or otherwise ineligible to vote. Civil rights groups said forcing states to change their method of constructing districts would have damaged Latino political influence. The court stopped short of saying that states must use total population. And it also did not rule on whether states are free to use a different measure, as Texas asked. Ginsburg said the court was not resolving whether states may use voter population. Richard Hasen, an expert in election law at the University of California at Irvine law school, said, \\"A contrary ruling would have shifted power to Republican, rural districts, and away from Democratic urban areas.\\" Edward Blum, whose Project on Fair Representation backed the lawsuit, said he was disappointed in the outcome, but predicted that \\"the issue of voter equality in the United States is not going to go away.\\" Though the justices were unanimous in upholding Texas' use of total population, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito declined to join Ginsburg's opinion. Thomas said the Constitution gives the states the freedom to draw political lines based on different population counts. Referring to the 1964 case of Reynolds v. Sims, he said the high court \\"has never provided a sound basis for the one-person, one-vote principle.\\" Alito objected to Ginsburg's reliance on the Constitution's prescription for using the once-a-decade census to divvy up seats in the House of Representatives among the states. Alito said the history of congressional representation was the product of political compromise. \\"It is impossible to draw any clear constitutional command from this complex history,\\" he said. ||||| WASHINGTON ‚Äî The Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Monday that states may count all residents, whether or not they are eligible to vote, in drawing election districts. The decision was a major statement on the meaning of a fundamental principle of the American political system, that of ‚Äúone person one vote.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe hold, based on constitutional history, this court‚Äôs decisions and longstanding practice, that a state may draw its legislative districts based on total population,‚Äù Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. As a practical matter, the ruling mostly helped Democrats and upheld the status quo. But until this decision, the court had never resolved whether voting districts should contain roughly the same number of people or the same number of eligible voters. Counting all people amplifies the voting power of places that have large numbers of residents who cannot vote legally ‚Äî including immigrants who are here legally but are not citizens, illegal immigrants and children. Those places tend to be urban and to vote Democratic. Had the justices required that only eligible voters be counted, the ruling would have shifted political power from cities to rural areas, a move that would have benefited Republicans. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The US Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that states can count everyone, not just eligible voters, while deciding how to draw electoral districts. The court's ruling rejected a challenge from Texas voters that could have significantly altered political district boundaries and disproportionately impacted the nation's growing Latino population.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Meader was born in Waterville, Maine during one of the worst floods ever to hit New England: he often said he was born on \\"the night the West Bridge washed out\\". He was the only child of Charles Vaughn Meader, a millworker, and Mary Ellen Abbott. After his father broke his neck and drowned in a diving accident when Meader was only eighteen months old, his mother moved to Boston to work as a cocktail waitress, leaving Meader behind with relatives. A sometimes unruly and troubled child, Meader was sent to live with his mother in Boston at the age of five Context: In November 1963, Meader was busy recording a new comedy record, written by a different group of writers and not involving his Kennedy impersonation. On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, and Kennedy's death effectively ended Meader's career. Copies of The First Family were pulled from stores and a JFK-related Christmas single by Meader that had been released by MGM's Verve Records shortly before the assassination was quickly withdrawn. Appearances that were already booked were canceled, including one for the Grammy Awards ceremony. An episode of The Joey Bishop Show was also pulled, which Meader filmed one week before the assassination. The episode was never aired and was reportedly destroyed. Meader reportedly first learned of President Kennedy's assassination after hailing a taxicab in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The driver, recognizing his celebrity passenger, asked \\"Did you hear about Kennedy?\\" Meader thought the driver was telling a joke and responded \\"No, how does it go?\\" The driver then informed him of the sad news, and from the taxi's radio Meader heard the breaking news bulletins for the first time. According to several sources, standup comedian Lenny Bruce went on with his November 22 nightclub show as scheduled. Just hours after Kennedy's death, Bruce walked onstage, stood silently for several moments, then said sadly, \\"Boy, is Vaughn Meader fucked.\\" The joke proved true. Meader discovered that he was so completely typecast as a Kennedy impersonator that he could not find anyone willing to hire him for any of his other talents. His non-Kennedy album for Verve Records, Have Some Nuts!!!, came out to minimal attention in early 1964. A similar follow-up If The Shoe Fits... was released in late 1964, and included sketches on almost everything except the Kennedys, but sales were meager at best. Meader's income evaporated, new-found friends and associates stopped calling, and by 1965 Meader was virtually broke. Sinking into depression, he became addicted to alcohol and drugs, and was forced to take whatever work he could find. He reunited with Earle Doud in 1971 for an album called The Second Coming, a comedic look at what life would be like for Jesus if he had returned to earth around the time of Jesus Christ Superstar, but airplay and sales were virtually nonexistent. Question: What did he have to settle for?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Vaughn Meader had to settle for taking whatever work he could find because his career as a Kennedy impersonator ended after President Kennedy's assassination.

As domestic violence continues to rear its head in the realm of professional sports, the need for a proactive and effective system for addressing such incidents becomes increasingly apparent. The Sweden native's arrest adds fuel to the ongoing debate about the prevalence of domestic violence in professional sports, and the perceived lack of appropriate response and protocol from the leagues themselves. With this latest occurrence, many are calling for a comprehensive and transparent evaluation of the NBA's procedures for dealing with domestic violence infractions. The charges against the 25-year-old athlete, which include one count of domestic assault, one count of assault, and one count of malicious destruction of property, represent a serious violation of ethical standards. The repercussions of these charges on the player's career and reputation are yet to be seen, but the incident undeniably serves as a harsh reminder of the severity of domestic violence in today's society. In response to this most recent incident, Commissioner Silver's commitment to reassessing the league's domestic violence policies is now more important than ever. The NBA, as well as other professional sports organizations, must take proactive steps to engage with and evaluate their current policies in order to create a safer and more inclusive environment for all members of the sports community. In summary, the recent arrest of a 25-year-old NBA player from Sweden at the East Lansing Marriott has sparked renewed concern about domestic violence procedures within professional sports leagues. With the NBA Commissioner vowing to take a closer look at such procedures, the public eye eagerly awaits the results of these evaluations and the potential improvements they may bring. As social consciousness continues to progress, it is crucial that professional sports organizations also take the necessary steps to ensure a safe and responsible environment for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

Help as much as you can. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I was driving on Highway 35 on my way home from work. Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.

Plot title: On the Beach Movie plot: During 1964, in the months following World War III, the conflict has devastated the Northern Hemisphere, polluting the atmosphere with nuclear fallout, killing all life there. Air currents are slowly carrying the fallout south; the only areas still habitable are in the far reaches of the Southern Hemisphere. From Australia, survivors detect an incomprehensible Morse code signal coming from the West Coast of the United States. The last American nuclear submarine, USS Sawfish, under Royal Australian Navy command, is ordered to sail north to the United States to attempt to make contact with the sender of the Morse signal. The submarine is commanded by Captain Dwight Towers (Gregory Peck), who must leave his new friend, the alcoholic Moira Davidson (Ava Gardner). The Australian government arranges for its citizens to receive suicide pills or prepared injections so they may end things quickly before there is prolonged suffering from radiation sickness. An Australian naval officer, Peter Holmes (Anthony Perkins) and his wife, Mary, who is in denial about the impending disaster, have a baby daughter. Assigned to travel with the American sub for several weeks, Peter tries to explain to Mary how to euthanize their baby and then kill herself in case he is not yet home when the end comes; Mary reacts very emotionally at the prospect of killing her daughter and herself. One scientist's theory is that the radiation level near the Arctic Ocean could be lower than that found at the mid-Northern Hemisphere, which might indicate the radiation could disperse before reaching the Southern Hemisphere. The theory is to be explored along with the submarine's main mission. After sailing to Point Barrow, Alaska, they determine that radiation levels are, on the contrary, intensifying. The next day, the Sawfish arrives in the San Francisco Bay Area, just off San Francisco.

He went to the Whitney and spent the \\"empty\\" time looking at things in solitary happiness. For him it proved to be a shock nearly as great as falling in love to discover that he could enjoy himself so much alone. What had he been afraid of, I asked myself? That, suddenly alone, he would discover that he bored himself, or that there was, quite simply, no self there to meet? But having taken a decisive step, he is now on the edge of adventure; he is about to be launched into his own inner space to the astronaut. His every perception will come to him with a new freshness and, for a time, seem surprisingly original. For anyone who can see things for himself with a naked eye becomes, for a moment or two, something of a genius. With another human being present, vision becomes double vision, unavoidably. We are busy wondering, what does my companion see or think of this, and what do I think of it? The original impact gets lost. \\"Music I heard with you was more than music.\\" Exactly.

Human intercourse often demands that we soften the edge of perception, or withdraw at the very instant of personal truth for fear of hurting, or of being inappropriately present, which is to say naked, in a social situation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don‚Äôt need to search outside to understand the answer. You are given a new situation: Archimedes was a great scientist. He was also a great inventor of machines. He once said that if he could stand somewhere, he could move the earth with his machine. Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine. and a hint : Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force. Please answer this question : Whose device would have less distance for applied force, Archimedes or Ptolemy? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Archimedes' device would have less distance for the applied force. Since he constructed a great machine, it is likely designed to make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied. Following the hint given, if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Therefore, Archimedes' device would have less distance for the applied force compared to Ptolemy's device, which is not a machine and likely does not increase the force applied."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Obama Administration Could Cause the Next Big For-Profit College Collapse The Obama administration is at risk of repeating the mistakes that led to the expensive collapse of for-profit chain Corinthian Colleges Inc. In that case, the Department of Education failed to address years of allegations that the company‚Äôs schools swindled its students and warning signs that Corinthian was facing financial difficulty. When the department finally took action by delaying the delivery of federal student aid to the schools, officials were ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù by the cash crunch the delay caused. That set off a series of events that culminated in Corinthian filing for bankruptcy protection less than a year later. The increasing cost to taxpayers of Corinthian's collapse was at least 90 million as of March. Now the department's recent demand that cash-strapped ITT Educational Services Inc., owner of the eponymous career schools, stump up additional money to cover the cost of a potential collapse could unwittingly exacerbate ITT‚Äôs financial woes. ‚ÄúThe Education Department hasn‚Äôt been a good analyst of corporate balance sheets. I haven‚Äôt seen any evidence that anyone at [the department] reads the papers or engages in the most minimal due diligence,‚Äù said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges & Universities. On Monday, the department sent a letter to ITT‚Äôs chief executive, Kevin M. Modany, giving the company 45 days to increase its existing guaranty with the department from 79.7 million to 123.6 million. The jump is necessary to protect taxpayers, the department said, because ITT‚Äôs schools are at risk of losing accreditation amid an avalanche of government lawsuits and investigations into its practices. Without accreditation, schools can‚Äôt get a slice of the nearly 130 billion in loans and grants the federal government annually doles out to college students. About 80 percent of ITT‚Äôs cash revenue last year came from the Education Department. Its schools collectively enroll nearly 45,000 students who annually receive more than 600 million in federal student aid. But it‚Äôs not clear whether the department‚Äôs demand took into consideration the terms governing a 100 million loan ITT received in 2014 from private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP. Cerberus caps the amount of Education Department-related debt ITT can owe at 120 million. Monday‚Äôs demand risks placing the company in default on the loan, said Bradley Safalow, founder and chief executive of PAA Research. ITT disagrees, pointing to a separate clause in its agreement with Cerberus allowing the career-school chain to take on an additional 17.5 million in undefined debt. Two analysts who follow the company and a lawyer active in commercial finance matters said Cerberus could interpret that clause differently but nonetheless said they expected Cerberus and ITT to strike a deal to avert default. Peter Duda, a Cerberus spokesman at Weber Shandwick, said the private equity firm declined to comment. The Education Department made its demand after a review of the company‚Äôs finances and recent securities filings, concluding that the increase was ‚Äúin the interest of students and taxpayers,‚Äù Kelly Leon, an Education Department spokeswoman, said Monday. For the past year ITT has been providing the department with projections of its 13-week cash flows every two weeks. On Wednesday, Leon said the department was ‚Äúfurther researching‚Äù the apparent 120 million cap detailed in ITT‚Äôs loan agreement with Cerberus. She declined further comment. ITT has no shortage of woes. It‚Äôs battling a steep drop in enrollment, three separate government lawsuits alleging fraud filed by the federal consumer and securities regulators and the Massachusetts attorney general, and a dwindling cash pile. Its net income last year fell to 23.3 million, a 92 percent drop compared with 2011. The company reckons it has enough cash to finance itself and meet its obligations, but the Education Department‚Äôs recent surety demand could ‚Äúnegatively affect‚Äù its standing with the department, various state education and professional licensing boards, and its accreditor. The accreditor, the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges & Schools, told the company in April that its schools would have to prove by August why they deserve to maintain accreditation. It also has asked the career-school chain to prepare a plan for its students in the event that it fails. ITT executives have said that they‚Äôve done nothing wrong and that they do right by their students. ‚ÄúMany of ITT's critics are Washington insiders and the media and political allies who have an ideological bias against the for-profit higher education sector,‚Äù Modany said on April 29. Few schools in the U.S. saddle their students with more debt than ITT. Some 191,000 former ITT students cumulatively owed more than 4.6 billion on their federal loans as of 2014, according to a study based on federal data published last year by a Treasury Department economist and a former Treasury intern. Recent ITT students are struggling with their federal debt. About 51 percent of former ITT students whose loans came due in 2009 had defaulted in the following five years. The 2009 cohort also saw their cumulative balances rise 1 percent by 2014. By comparison, former New York University students whose federal loans came due in 2009 had paid down 34 percent of their debt after five years.

Article: Manners nowadays in big cities like London are particularly non-existent. It's nothing for a big, strong schoolboy to elbow an elderly woman aside in the dash for the last remaining seat on the tube or bus, much less stand up and offer his seat to her. This question of giving up seats in public transport is much argued by young men, who say that, since women have claimed equality, they no longer deserve to be treated with courtesy and that those who go out to work should take their turn in _ like anyone else. Women have never claimed to be physically as strong as men. Even if it's not agreed, however, that young men should stand up for older women, the fact remains that courtesy should be shown to the old, the sick and the burdened. Are we really so lost to all ideals of unselfishness that we can sit there indifferently reading the paper or a book, saying to ourselves \\" First come, first served\\", while a gray-haired woman, a mother with a young child or a cripple stands? Yet this is too often seen. Older people, tired and easy annoyed from a day's work, aren't angels, either--far from it. Many a brisk argument or an insulting quarrel breaks out as the weary queues push and shove each other to get on buses and tubes. One cannot commend this, of course, but one does feel there is just a little more excuse. If cities are to remain pleasant places to live in at all, however, it seems necessary, not only that communication in transport should be improved, but also that communication between human beings should be kept smooth and polite. Shop assistant won't bother to assist, taxi drivers growl at each other as they dash dangerously round corners, bus conductors pull the bell before their desperate passengers have had time to get on or off the bus, and so on.

Answer the following question: who is all time premier league goal scorer?","completion":"The all-time Premier League top goal scorer is Alan Shearer, a former English professional footballer who played as a striker. Born on August 13, 1970, in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, Shearer is widely regarded as one of the greatest strikers in the history of English football. Alan Shearer started his professional football career in 1988 with Southampton, where he scored 23 league goals in 118 appearances. In 1992, he moved to Blackburn Rovers and enjoyed a successful period with the club, where he scored 112 league goals in 138 appearances. During his time at Blackburn, he helped the team win the Premier League title in the 1994-1995 season. In 1996, Shearer joined his hometown club, Newcastle United, where he played until his retirement in 2006. He scored 148 league goals in 303 appearances for Newcastle United. Over the course of his Premier League career, Alan Shearer scored a record-breaking total of 260 goals in 441 appearances, making him the league's all-time top goal scorer. In addition to his goal-scoring prowess, Shearer earned numerous accolades, including three Premier League Golden Boot awards (1994, 1995, and 1996), two PFA Players' Player of the Year awards (1995 and 1997), and one Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year award (1994). Furthermore, Shearer held the record for the most Premier League hat-tricks (11) until it was broken by Sergio Ag√ºero in 2020. Shearer's impressive achievements extend to his international career as well. He earned 63 caps for the English national team and scored 30 goals. He represented England in the 1992 UEFA European Championship, the 1996 UEFA European Championship, and the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Since retiring from professional football, Alan Shearer has pursued a career in media as a football pundit and analyst.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller.

How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone‚Äôs ‚Äòcreativity‚Äô different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I‚Äôve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I‚Äôve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it‚Äôs an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‚Äòcreative‚Äô, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get‚Äôs tricky. It‚Äôs all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it‚Äôs easy to investigate it, but what if you don‚Äôt define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula.

Maybe for you creativity doesn‚Äôt have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I‚Äôm most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from?

Backers of Legal Aid services for the poor are pushing a measure that would increase court filing fees in Kentucky to raise money for the program, which faces steep funding cuts. The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to 10 from 5 and in circuit court to 20 from 10. Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is 50.50, and in circuit court 108. The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about 1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington. Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state. Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money. ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said. Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session. Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing. ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said. The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association. The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer. Legal Aid ''has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,'' Catron said. ''We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.'' Larry York, executive director of Appalachian Regional Defense Fund, which provides Legal Aid services in 37 Eastern Kentucky counties and is a KBA board member, said he hopes the measure is approved. ''It would really offset the current cuts,'' he said.

The IGFET is more commonly known as a metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor FET (MOSFET), reflecting its original construction from layers of metal (the gate), oxide (the insulation), and semiconductor. Unlike IGFETs, the JFET gate forms a p‚Äìn diode with the channel which lies between the source and drain. Functionally, this makes the n-channel JFET the solid-state equivalent of the vacuum tube triode which, similarly, forms a diode between its grid and cathode. Also, both devices operate in the depletion mode, they both have a high input impedance, and they both conduct current under the control of an input voltage. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): How many layers of metal are in the gate of an IGFET?","completion":"The number of layers of metal in the gate of an IGFET (Insulated Gate Field-Effect Transistor), specifically a MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor), varies depending on the specific fabrication process and technology used. In general, there is typically one primary metal layer in the gate of a basic MOSFET structure. This metal layer serves as the gate electrode, which is separated from the semiconductor substrate by a thin insulating oxide layer. However, modern MOSFET technologies have evolved, and advanced MOSFET devices may have more complex gate structures, potentially involving multiple metal layers or incorporating additional materials like polysilicon and high-k dielectrics. These advanced structures aim to improve device performance, reduce leakage current, and enhance the scalability of the device for smaller manufacturing nodes. In such cases, the total number of metal layers would depend on the specific design and fabrication process employed for the MOSFET. In summary, the simplest basic MOSFET structure typically has one metal layer in its gate, but more advanced MOSFET designs can have multiple metal layers or other conductive materials in the gate to optimize the device's performance under various technological and operating conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Less than a month after the character was killed off, spawning a viral, negative response from fans, he was resurrected Sunday night, thanks to a massaging of a time-space continuum. In the latest episode of the Fox animated comedy, baby Stewie Griffin used a Christmas wish to go back in time and save his four-legged friend. \\"I want my friend back,\\" he tearfully told a mall Santa. \\"My best friend, my dog, Brian; he's dead.

She has won four World Cup overall championships--one of only two female skiers to do so, along with Annemarie Moser-Proll--with three consecutive titles in 2008, 2009, and 2010, plus another in 2012. Vonn won the gold medal in downhill at the 2010 Winter Olympics, the first ever in the event for an American woman. She has also won a record 8 World Cup season titles in the downhill discipline (2008-2013, 2015, 2016), 5 titles in super-G (2009-2012, 2015), and 3 consecutive titles in the combined (2010-2012). In her Olympic debut at the 2002 Winter Olympics at age 17, Vonn raced in both slalom and combined in Salt Lake City, with her best result coming with sixth in combined. On March 4, 2003, she earned a silver medal in downhill in the Junior World Championship at Puy Saint-Vincent, France. Vonn credits a change in her attitude toward training to a bike ride with fellow ski racer Julia Mancuso and Mancuso's father Ciro when Vonn visited them at their home in Lake Tahoe, California. With little biking experience, she quickly found herself miles behind Julia and Ciro. Alone and embarrassed, she realized she needed drastic revision of her training regimen and her attitude toward training if she was going to be successful. On March 24, 2004, Vonn was the downhill silver medalist at the U.S. Alpine Championships at Mt. Alyeska Resort, Girdwood, Alaska. Earlier that year 2004, Vonn climbed onto the World Cup podium for the first time with a third-place finish in downhill in January 2004 at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Her maiden victory in that specialty came at Lake Louise, Alberta, in December 2004. She captured five more World Cup podiums over the next two months. In 2005, she competed in four races at her first World Championships held in Bormio, Italy, pulling in fourth-place finishes in both the downhill and the combined. She was ninth in super-G, but failed to finish the giant slalom. She cited the unexpected appearance of her father, with whom she has a strained relationship, for rattling her before the event. Why did she fail?","completion":"Lindsey Vonn failed to finish the giant slalom at the 2005 World Championships in Bormio, Italy, for a few reasons. Firstly, she cited the unexpected appearance of her father, with whom she had a strained relationship, as a significant factor that rattled her emotionally and mentally before the event. This sudden emotional distress likely affected her concentration, focus, and overall performance during the race. In addition to the emotional turmoil, the giant slalom is a technical event that requires precision, balance, and a strong ability to make quick, tight turns. Vonn, at that time, was mainly focused on and had achieved success in the speed events like downhill and super-G, where the turns are longer and not as tight. The transition to excel in a more technical event like the giant slalom could have been difficult for her, considering her specialization in speed events. Furthermore, the level of competition at World Championships is extremely high, with the best athletes from around the globe pushing themselves to their limits. Failure to finish a race can be attributed to various factors such as course conditions, equipment issues, or even a momentary lapse in judgment or focus during the race. In Vonn's case, the combination of the emotional strain caused by her father's appearance, her less-developed skills in the technical event, and the high level of competition may have contributed to her failure in the giant slalom at the 2005 World Championships."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: A number of theories have been proposed regarding Avicenna's madhab (school of thought within Islamic jurisprudence). Medieval historian ·∫íahƒ´r al-dƒ´n al-Bayhaqƒ´ (d. 1169) considered Avicenna to be a follower of the Brethren of Purity. On the other hand, Dimitri Gutas along with Aisha Khan and Jules J. Janssens demonstrated that Avicenna was a Sunni Hanafi. However, the 14th cenutry Shia faqih Nurullah Shushtari according to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, maintained that he was most likely a Twelver Shia. Conversely, Sharaf Khorasani, citing a rejection of an invitation of the Sunni Governor Sultan Mahmoud Ghazanavi by Avicenna to his court, believes that Avicenna was an Ismaili. Similar disagreements exist on the background of Avicenna's family, whereas some writers considered them Sunni, some more recent writers contested that they were Shia.

The song serves as the second promotional single and fourth track from the band's second studio album \\"Smoke + Mirrors\\". Along with the songs \\"Hopeless Opus\\" and \\"Gold\\" on \\"Smoke + Mirrors\\", the song touches upon lead-singer Dan Reynolds' depression struggles. The song has peaked at number 14 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot Rock Songs chart. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"\\"I'm So Sorry\\" presents a universally agreed upon picture of depression.\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot conclusively state that \\"I'm So Sorry\\" presents a universally agreed upon picture of depression. There are several reasons that contribute to this conclusion: 1. Personal experiences: It is essential to note that the song \\"I'm So Sorry\\" is an artistic expression of lead-singer Dan Reynolds' personal struggles with depression. Although his experience can be relatable to many people who suffer from depression, it does not encapsulate a universally agreed upon picture. Depression affects individuals differently, and the symptoms and emotions connected with the mental health condition can vary from person to person. 2. Artistic interpretation: Music, by nature, is a form of art that allows for creative freedom and individual interpretation. When listeners hear the song, they may assign their emotions and experiences to what they perceive as the primary message of the song. This subjective interpretation makes it difficult to claim that the song presents a universally agreed upon picture of depression. 3. Study limitations: To draw such a conclusion, it would require extensive research and analysis of the song's lyrics, themes, and impact on various listeners. The paragraph provided does not offer enough information or evidence for us to determine the song's portrayal of depression accurately and if it aligns with a universally agreed upon understanding of the condition. 4. Cultural context: A universally agreed upon picture of depression would require examining the cultural context within which the song was created and its reception by listeners from diverse cultural backgrounds. Depression may manifest and be perceived differently across cultures; hence, the song's message may not resonate with every listener in a uniform way. In summary, while the song \\"I'm So Sorry\\" does touch upon Dan Reynolds' personal battles with depression, we cannot conclude that it presents a universally agreed upon picture of depression based on the given information. To make such a claim, we would need to analyze the song's lyrics and themes more thoroughly, consider listeners' interpretations, and account for cultural context and variations in individual experiences of depression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Both sentences convey that someone confirmed Ms. Cohen Alon's attempt to sell a story. The key differences lie in the specific details provided in each sentence and the sentence structure.

In the first sentence, Mr. Levine is addressed as \\"Mr. Levine,\\" while in the second sentence, he is referred to as \\"Donald Levine\\" and identified as Ms. Cohen Alon's lawyer. 2. The confirmation of Ms. Cohen Alon attempting to sell a story is present in both sentences. The first sentence states it as \\"Mr. Levine confirmed that Ms. Cohen Alon had tried to sell the story,\\" while the second sentence conveys the same message with \\"Donald Levine, confirmed she tried to sell the story.\\" 3. A significant difference between the two sentences is the time frame. The first sentence mentions this event happening \\"during the World Cup,\\" while the second one states it occurred in \\"February.\\" This can cause confusion if the reader has to contextually link the two sentences to a specific time frame. 4. Lastly, the structure of the sentences varies. The first one uses a subject-verb-object structure and refers to the individuals with their last names. The second sentence is shorter and provides Mr. Levine's first and last name, his professional relationship to Ms. Cohen Alon, and uses a pronoun (\\"she\\") to refer to Ms. Cohen Alon. In conclusion, the two sentences are quite similar, as they primarily convey the same basic message of Ms. Cohen Alon attempting to sell a story and Mr. Levine (her lawyer) confirming her actions. The differences are mainly in the time frame and sentence structure, but they do not detract from the overall similarity in content.

He played the role of Imperial Japanese Army sergeant Mutsuhiro Watanabe, nicknamed \\"The Bird\\", in what was Angelina Jolie's second feature film as director. It was released in December 2014. Miyavi commented that as the movie was somewhat sensitive to the Japanese people, he had hesitated as to whether he should take this role. However, after meeting with Jolie, and given that the underlying theme of this story is forgiveness, he wholeheartedly decided to accept it. Miyavi was featured in the same month's edition of Vogue Italia.

Art of Noise (also The Art of Noise) were an English avant-garde synth-pop group formed in early 1983 by engineer/producer Gary Langan and programmer J. J. Jeczalik, along with arranger Anne Dudley, producer Trevor Horn and music journalist Paul Morley. The group had international Top 20 hits with \\"Kiss\\" and the instrumental \\"Peter Gunn\\", which won a 1986 Grammy Award. The group's mostly instrumental compositions were novel melodic sound collages based on digital sampler technology, which was new at the time. Inspired by turn-of-the-20th-century revolutions in music, the Art of Noise were initially packaged as a faceless anti- or non-group, blurring the distinction between the art and its creators. Although Dudley and Jeczalik had already dissolved the group, in 1990 they assisted in the promotion of the lightly remixed compilation The Ambient Collection, which the China label released to cash in on the burgeoning ambient house scene. Jeczalik approved the remixes that appeared on The FON Mixes the following year. The rest of the decade saw China Records releasing further Art of Noise compilations: The Drum and Bass Collection, Art Works, and reissues of Best of without the ZTT-era tracks. Some of these featured new remixes by other artists. According to an interview with J.J. Jeczalik reported in the ZTT fanzine Outside World in 1991, Jeczalik, Dudley and Langan were inspired by the commercial success of The FON Mixes and had discussed reuniting the group as a trio again. In preparation to record a new album, Jeczalik and Langan travelled to Cuba to gather new source material. However, no new recordings were produced with the new line-up, and the Art of Noise remained defunct. Dudley became well known for composing numerous film and television scores during the 1990s. The most famous of these is probably The Full Monty, which won an Academy Award for Original Music Score. She also collaborated with Killing Joke's Jaz Coleman on the 1990 album Songs from the Victorious City (inspired by a trip the two made to Egypt) and produced two tracks for the 1993 Deborah Harry album Debravation (\\"Strike Me Pink\\", which she also co-wrote and played keyboards on) and \\"Mood Ring\\"). She has scored orchestrations for dozens of pop releases over the years, and both scored and produced the album Voice for her neighbour Alison Moyet. Cathy Dennis added lyrics to one of Dudley's compositions and recorded it as \\"Too Many Walls\\", which became a US Top 10 hit in 1991. In 1995-1997, Jeczalik and In No Sense? Nonsense! coengineer Bob Kraushaar produced a number of instrumentals oriented toward dance clubs under the name Art of Silence, issuing an album titled artofsilence.co.uk. Jeczalik also embarked on a new career in trading in futures contracts. The Art of Noise also received a full writing credit for The Prodigy's \\"Firestarter\\", which samples the female \\"hey, hey\\" voice from \\"Close to the Edit\\". The Prodigy also contributed the remix \\"Instruments of Darkness (All of Us are One People)\\" to the 1991 compilation The FON Mixes. Also, an edited version of \\"Close to the Edit\\" is featured on the monthly educational Amiga game, Ready Robot Club.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"rust of iron in rocks is a direct result of \\" is \\"high speed fall from space\\", given that chemical weathering of iron in rock causes rust? pick from the following. * Yes; * No; A:","completion":"No, I don't think the right answer to the question \\"rust of iron in rocks is a direct result of\\" is \\"high speed fall from space,\\" given that chemical weathering of iron in rock causes rust. It is important to understand the underlying processes that lead to rust formation in the context of rocks. Chemical weathering is the process through which rocks are broken down or altered due to chemical reactions. The presence of iron in rocks is a common occurrence, and rust (iron oxide) forms when iron reacts with oxygen and water. This process can be further facilitated by the presence of acidic conditions or certain microbes that promote this oxidation reaction. High speed fall from space might imply that the presence of rust on a rock is due to meteorite impacts or the composition of the space object containing iron. Although meteorites contain iron and can show signs of rust due to weathering after landing on Earth, they are not the primary source of rust formation in rocks. Rust of iron in rocks is not a direct result of a high-speed fall from space but rather, a byproduct of the inherent chemical processes that occur due to various environmental and microbial factors. The primary factors leading to rust of iron in rocks include oxygen, water, and occasionally certain minerals or microorganisms that facilitate the oxidation process. These factors are widespread in Earth's environment and not solely tied to meteorite impacts or high-speed falls from space. Therefore, the correct answer to this question would be chemical weathering and not high speed fall from space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hypothesis: The people are all women. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis that all the people in costume gathered on the city street are women. The premise only provides us with the information that people in costume are gathered on a city street, but it does not mention any specific details about the gender, age, or any other characteristics of the individuals involved. To conclusively determine whether the hypothesis is valid, we would need additional information that specifically addresses the gender of the gathered individuals. We can consider various possibilities that may arise from the given premise, which makes room for a wider range of scenarios and interpretations. For example, these scenarios might involve: 1. A mix of people with different genders: The group of individuals dressed in costumes could be composed of men, women, and non-binary individuals. In this case, the hypothesis would be invalid as not everyone in the group is a woman. 2. Cultural or local events: The gathering could be due to a specific event, such as a festival, parade, or a themed party, that may or may not exclusively involve women. Knowing more about the occasion would be helpful in determining the accuracy of the hypothesis. 3. Performance or entertainment activity: The group could be performers of a public play, musical, or a dance act, which might involve both men and women. Analyzing the details of the performance or act would provide insight into the gender composition of the group. 4. Protests or political events: The individuals gathered might be taking part in a protest, demonstration, or political event that revolves around gender-specific issues. In this case, a thorough understanding of the event and its participants would be fundamental to validate the hypothesis. 5. Gender-exclusive events: If the event in question is specifically tailored to women, then the hypothesis might hold true. Examples of such events could be an all-women's costume contest, a women's rights march, or any occasion that aims to bring together women as the primary participants. In summary, the premise alone is not sufficient to definitively conclude the hypothesis stating that all the people in costumes gathered on a city street are women. To reach an accurate conclusion, we must obtain and analyze additional information, consider possible scenarios, and explore the context surrounding the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"No, the information you found on Google regarding Tycho Brahe's birthplace does not directly answer the question about where he was when he discovered Mars. Tycho Brahe was a Danish astronomer born in Scania in 1546, which was part of Denmark at the time and is now a part of modern-day Sweden. He is known for his precise and accurate astronomical and planetary observations, which provided the basis for the laws of planetary motion formulated by his assistant Johannes Kepler. Regarding the discovery of Mars, it is important to note that Mars had been known since ancient times, so Tycho Brahe did not technically \\"discover\\" the planet. However, he did make important observations about Mars that significantly improved the understanding of its motion and position in the sky. Tycho Brahe conducted most of his astronomical observations from two observatories - Uraniborg and Stjerneborg - on the island of Hven, now known as Ven, which is located in the √òresund strait between Denmark and Sweden. In 1576, King Frederick II of Denmark granted Tycho the island, where he built his observatories. It was likely at one of these observatories where Tycho Brahe made his important observations of Mars, particularly during the years 1582 to 1585. In summary, Tycho Brahe did not \\"discover\\" Mars as it was known since antiquity, but he made significant observations and collected data about the planet that improved the understanding of its motion.

Read this: The study of the Quran and the Hadith thrived in such a scholarly atmosphere. Philosophy, Fiqh and theology (kalaam) were further developed, most noticeably by Avicenna and his opponents. Al-Razi and Al-Farabi had provided methodology and knowledge in medicine and philosophy. Avicenna had access to the great libraries of Balkh, Khwarezm, Gorgan, Rey, Isfahan and Hamadan. Various texts (such as the 'Ahd with Bahmanyar) show that he debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time. Aruzi Samarqandi describes how before Avicenna left Khwarezm he had met Al-Biruni (a famous scientist and astronomer), Abu Nasr Iraqi (a renowned mathematician), Abu Sahl Masihi (a respected philosopher) and Abu al-Khayr Khammar (a great physician).

It's fun and very easy! Just follow these simple steps and you'll have a lovely frame to display your favorite drawing or picture. Ask your mom or dad to lend a helping hand and gather all the things you need. Let's start! Things You Will Need: - Short wooden boards (for the frame) - A wooden board with a flat surface (as a backing) - Wood glue - C-clamps - 1 inch nails (little pointy metal sticks) - A hammer (to tap the nails) Step-by-step Guide: 1. First things first! Let's start with the wood glue. This is like special glue to make the wood stick together. Choose one of the short boards and put some wood glue on it. This will be like adding butter but on the wood. 2. Now it is time to stick it! Take the wooden board with the flat surface (backing) and press the gluey side of the short board to the top edge of the backing. It's like giving a big hug to the backing! Be gentle, and try not to move it so it will not go out of place. 3. We want the wood to stay together nicely, so we'll use a tool called a C-clamp to hold them together. Put the C-clamp on the short glued board and the backing, squeezing them tightly. This will make sure that the gluey wood hugs the backing for a whole hour. It's like when you hug, but for much much longer! 4. After waiting for an hour, the glue will be all dried up and it's time to make it even stronger! This is where the 1 inch nails (the little pointy metal sticks) come into play. With the help of an adult, use a hammer to tap the nails into both ends of the short board. Remember to be extra careful with the hammer to avoid those tiny fingers! 5. Almost done! We need to add the rest of the short boards around to make the full frame. Just like before, apply wood glue, stick the short boards to the backing, clamp them with a C-clamp, and once the glue is dried, use the nails to secure them. Now you have all the sides like a picture frame! Wow! Look at what you've made, a beautiful wooden frame all by yourself! You should be very proud and show it off. Go ahead, put your favorite drawing or picture in it and hang it on the wall for everyone to see.

The reviewer clearly expresses dissatisfaction with the printing quality of the mathematics book that they purchased. The review highlights a significant issue with the loss of dots, such as periods, primes, decimals, and the dot on a semicolon, which are crucial elements in a mathematics book. The reviewer considers this issue as \\"utterly inexcusable\\" and holds the publisher responsible for not addressing this problem before distributing the book. Furthermore, the reviewer suggests that basic proofreading should have been carried out while converting the book from old technology to new, which would have caught and rectified the error. The fact that their professor mentions the hardback edition does not have the same problem implies that the reviewer's dissatisfaction is specifically with the paperback or another specific edition of the book. The reviewer's decision to return their copy to the bookstore for a refund indicates their discontent with the product. Additionally, the cautionary statement, \\"Be cautious when buying this book,\\" at the beginning of the review serves as a warning to potential buyers about the printing problem. In conclusion, the product review is unquestionably negative, as it points out significant flaws in the printing quality of the mathematics book and raises concerns about the publisher's attention to detail and quality assurance. The reviewer's recommendation for caution when purchasing the book and their choice to return the book for a refund further emphasize their dissatisfaction with the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During the Cenozoic era, specifically about 25 million years ago during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread. The grasslands provided a new niche for mammals, including many ungulates and glires, that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Traditionally, the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked.

Step 1: Identify the meaning of \\"pay\\" in each sentence. In the first sentence, \\"Pay a debt,\\" the word \\"pay\\" means to give money or something of value to someone in order to fulfill a financial obligation. In the second sentence, \\"He was allowed to go as soon as he paid,\\" the word \\"paid\\" (the past tense of \\"pay\\") implies giving money or something of value to someone to fulfill an obligation or exchange for goods or services. Step 2: Compare the meanings. Both sentences use \\"pay\\" in a similar way: giving money or something of value to fulfill an obligation or an exchange. The main difference is the context in which they are used. In the first sentence, it specifically refers to a debt, while the second sentence may refer to a variety of obligations or exchanges (such as a bill, fine, or fee). However, since the core meaning remains consistent across the sentences, we can conclude that the word \\"pay\\" is used in the same way in both sentences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: People are walking down the street to line up for a show. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the given premise of people walking down a street, we cannot conclusively determine whether the hypothesis that they are lining up for a show is true or not. This is because the premise is quite general and does not provide any specific information about the reasons or motivations behind the people's actions. In order to evaluate the legitimacy of the hypothesis, we would need more information and context. Numerous factors could potentially influence why people are walking down a street, and without additional details, we are unable to decisively support or refute the hypothesis. People might be walking down the street for various reasons, such as commuting, going to a store or restaurant, visiting friends or family, or even just out for a leisurely stroll. To adequately assess whether people are indeed walking down the street to line up for a show, several points of evidence or contextual factors could aid in developing a more concrete conclusion. These may include: 1. Time: Is the time of day consistent with a typical showtime, such as an evening performance, or an atypical time, like a matinee? If the time aligns with common entertainment hours, it could increase the likelihood of the hypothesis being accurate. 2. Location: Is the street near a theater, concert hall, or other venue that regularly hosts shows? The proximity to such establishments could provide evidence supporting the hypothesis, as people may be more inclined to walk down a street near a venue where shows are held. 3. Ticketing: Are people seen holding or purchasing tickets to a known or advertised show? If yes, this would significantly support the hypothesis, as the possession of tickets proves their intention to attend a show. 4. Crowding and Queue Formation: Are people gathering in an organized fashion, such as forming a queue, outside a specific location that is presumably a show venue? The presence of a structured line would lend credibility to the idea that people are lining up for a show. 5. Advertising and Promotion: Are there promotional materials, such as posters or banners, announcing a show or event in the vicinity? Visible marketing efforts might indicate that people are gathering for a show or performance. In summary, while the given premise of people walking down a street does not inherently prove the hypothesis that they are lining up for a show, further contextual information and evidence could either support or refute this proposed idea.

Next, cut the front of the card into puzzle shapes; draw the lines out first if you need to. Try to put them back together again when you are done. Cards with full images, such as a Christmas scene, work better than cards with a single image or word. Keep your puzzle inside an envelope or empty candy tin. Cut a card in half using the crease as a guide. Cut 25 sheets of paper down to the same size as the card. Sandwich the paper between the front and back covers of the card. Staple the card along the edge: once at each end and once in the middle. You can use printer paper, binder paper, or sketchbook paper. If you want a nicer finish, use cardstock or thin cardboard for the back of the notebook instead of the back of the card. For a nicer finish, wrap patterned washi tape over the top edge of the notebook to hide the staples. Cut the covers off of 4 vertically-oriented cards. Use an awl or a mini hole punch to poke a series of holes along each of the long edges. Thread a yarn needle with yarn or twine, then sew the long edges together with a blanket or whipstitch to make a block. Use the luminary with LED candles. Use cards that are from the same event or holiday. Don't mix and match cards, such as birthday and Christmas. Make sure that the cards are all the same size and height, otherwise, the luminary will turn out crooked. Take cards from an event, such as a wedding, and cut the covers off. Glue the cards together to create a rectangle or square. Use a craft blade to cut a hole from the middle a little smaller than a photograph. Choose a photo from the event, then glue it to the back of the frame, so that it shows through the hole. Overlap the cards to create a collaged effect. Choose a ceramic or cork tile, then trace it onto a card. Cut your tracing out, then glue it to the front of the tile with waterproof decoupage glue.

Now the mother-daughter team have collaborated for the first time on a new series called \\"Dixie O'Day\\", written by Hughes and illustrated by Vulliamy, with the first book to be published in September 2013.

Use this fact to answer the question: moving an object from a cool place to a warm place causes the object 's temperature to increase When you put a cold sandwich in the microwave, it will pick from the following. (1). stay the same; (2). escalate in temperature; (3). decrease in temperature; (4). Die; The answer is:","completion":"(2). escalate in temperature When you put a cold sandwich in the microwave, its temperature will escalate or increase. This is because the microwave is specifically designed to heat food, and it has a much higher temperature than your cold sandwich. The microwave generates microwave radiation that heats the water molecules in the food, causing them to rotate and generate thermal energy that evenly cooks and warms your sandwich. As you have mentioned, moving an object from a cool place (cold sandwich) to a warm place (microwave) causes the object's temperature to increase. The heat from the warmer environment is transferred to the object, causing the object to warm up, which is the core principle of heat transfer. In this case, your cold sandwich is absorbing heat from the microwave, which is causing it to escalate in temperature. This is a demonstration of the principle of thermal equilibrium, in which heat flows from areas of higher temperature to areas of lower temperature until they eventually even out. To ensure the best possible heating results for your sandwich, you can follow these tips: 1. Use microwave-safe containers or plates. Avoid using metal containers or aluminum foil, as these can cause arcing and damage the microwave. Glass, ceramic, and microwave-safe plastics are suitable. 2. Arrange your sandwich evenly on the plate and avoid piling the ingredients too high, as this may result in uneven heating. 3. Experiment with your microwave's power settings and heating times to find the most effective combination for heating your sandwich. Start with shorter intervals, checking the sandwich's temperature, and working your way up to ensure even heating without drying it out. In conclusion, when you put a cold sandwich in the microwave, its temperature will escalate, or increase, due to the transfer of heat from the warm environment of the microwave to the cooler sandwich. This process ensures that your sandwich is heated evenly and reaches the desired temperature for consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What genre of music did Loudest Whisper debut on a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of 33 ‚ÅÑ rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification?","completion":"Loudest Whisper, an Irish folk rock band predominantly active in the 1970s, made their debut on a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of 33 1‚ÅÑ3 RPM, a 12 or 10-inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and the use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Their music falls under a unique blend of genres, most notably combining elements of folk, rock, and Celtic influences. Led by the creative genius of Brian O'Reilly, Loudest Whisper began their musical journey in the early 1970s. Their first album, titled \\"The Children of Lir,\\" debuted in 1974 and was primarily rooted in Irish folk music. The album was an ambitious rock opera based on the ancient Irish myth of the four children of Lir who were turned into swans by their stepmother. It masterfully combined elements of traditional Irish folk, Celtic music, and psychedelic progressive rock. The music was characterized by lilting melodies, impressive harmonies, and poetic lyrics that capture the imagination of the listener. Throughout their career, Loudest Whisper would go on to experiment with various other styles and influences, including blues-rock, jazz, and classical music. Their eclectic and innovative approach to music-making helped them remain relevant and garnered them a dedicated cult following. As for the format of their first vinyl release, 33 1‚ÅÑ3 RPM 12-inch records were the industry standard during this time and would have been the typical choice for such an album. The \\"microgroove\\" groove specification, which was developed in the late 1940s, allowed for greater fidelity and longer playing times. This technological advancement enabled artists like Loudest Whisper to create intricate, multi-layered compositions that could be enjoyed in a high-quality format.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that revealed locations that had similar sites to the one that academics wanted to include in a joint commission? ? During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katy≈Ñ Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katy≈Ñ. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.

Article: At the invitation of the United States government, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) sent a team of observers to monitor the presidential elections in 2004. It was the first time the OSCE had sent observers to a U.S. presidential election, although they had been invited in the past. In September 2004 the OSCE issued a report on U.S. electoral processes and the election final report. The report reads: \\"The November 2, 2004 elections in the United States mostly met the OSCE commitments included in the 1990 Copenhagen Document. They were conducted in an environment that reflects a long-standing democratic tradition, including institutions governed by the rule of law, free and generally professional media, and a civil society intensively engaged in the election process. There was exceptional public interest in the two leading presidential candidates and the issues raised by their respective campaigns, as well as in the election process itself.\\" Now answer this question: What were the findings of the OSCE team?","completion":"The findings of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) team that observed the 2004 U.S. presidential election were largely positive, as presented in their report issued in September 2004. The main conclusions drawn from their observation were as follows: 1. The elections mostly met the OSCE commitments: The 2004 U.S. presidential election was found to be mostly in accordance with the OSCE commitments outlined in the 1990 Copenhagen Document. This signifies that the election was considered to be free and fair, with processes aligned with international standards and democratic principles. 2. Long-standing democratic tradition: The OSCE team recognized that the elections took place in an environment reflecting the United States' well-established democratic tradition. This includes the existence of strong institutions governed by the rule of law, which helped ensure the credibility and legitimacy of the electoral process. 3. Free and professional media: The report highlighted the role of free and generally professional media during the election, ensuring a broader dissemination of information to the public. This contributed to maintaining transparency and openness throughout the process, allowing the electorate to make informed decisions. 4. Active civil society: The OSCE team also took note of the significant engagement of the civil society in the election process. This engagement is crucial for fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility among the citizens and for promoting an inclusive and participatory democratic process. 5. Exceptional public interest: There was remarkable public interest in the two leading presidential candidates, their campaigns, and the issues they raised. The report indicates that the election process itself was also a point of significant interest and attention among the general public, revealing a heightened level of political awareness and involvement. In summary, the OSCE team's findings on the 2004 U.S. presidential election indicate that it was conducted in a manner that adhered to the majority of the OSCE commitments and in an environment reflecting long-standing democratic traditions.

The reason for this is that the filters, also known as nephrons, within the kidneys clean and filter the blood by removing waste products and excess substances. When there is less blood flow to the kidneys, the filters have fewer waste products and substances to process. This perturbation would have a negative effect on the kidneys' ability to remove waste products effectively. Since there is less blood passing through the filters, the overall amount of waste captured is reduced.

However, in fiction, it‚Äôs all about the story, whereas in nonfiction, the story may be secondary to other essential information.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Ivor Parry Evans ( February 20 , 1923 , ( Aliquippa , Pennsylvania ) -- October 24 , 2009 ( Abilene , Texas ) was a United States Air Force officer and commander . - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services. Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947. It is the most recent branch of the U.S. military to be formed, and is the largest and one of the world's most technologically advanced air forces. The USAF articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Special Operations, Air Superiority, Global Integrated ISR, Space Superiority, Command and Control, Cyberspace Superiority, Personnel Recovery, Global Precision Attack, Building Partnerships, Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense.

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: To make a calzone taste better pick from the following. A). Brush it with milk before baking B). Brush it with soy sauce before baking","completion":"To make a calzone taste better, you might consider brushing it with milk before baking. While soy sauce can add an interesting flavor, it might not be what you are looking for when preparing a calzone. The following is a detailed breakdown of why option A (brushing it with milk) might be a better choice for enhancing the taste of your calzone. A) Brush it with milk before baking: 1. Browning and texture: Brushing your calzone with milk prior to baking can help achieve a golden-brown color and a crispy texture on the crust. The milk reacts with the sugars in the dough through the Maillard reaction, which results in a beautiful browning effect. This visual appeal adds to the overall enjoyment of the dish, and the improved texture makes it even more delightful to bite into. 2. Flavor: Milk has a subtle sweetness that can complement the savory flavors inside your calzone. It does not overwhelm the other ingredients but rather balances their flavors. Moreover, the fats in the milk can tenderize the crust, leading to a more pleasant mouth-feel. 3. Customizability: Milk is a neutral base that you can easily customize by mixing in other ingredients like melted butter, minced garlic, or herbs to create a flavored wash that resonates with the calzone's filling. This added layer of flavor complexity makes the calzone taste even better, appealing to all your taste buds. While brushing with soy sauce before baking (option B) could add a more exotic taste to your calzone, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks: 1. Overpowering flavor: Soy sauce has a strong umami and salty taste, which could potentially overpower the flavors of the other ingredients in your calzone. In addition, it is not a traditional ingredient in Italian cuisine, so incorporating it may deviate from the original essence of a calzone. 2. Salt content: One of the main concerns with using soy sauce is its high sodium content, which could make your calzone too salty, especially if you already have salty ingredients in the filling (like cheese or cured meats). A calzone brushed with soy sauce might not cater to everyone's taste, as it significantly deviates from the traditional calzone flavor profile. In conclusion, brushing your calzone with milk before baking is a better choice to enhance its taste, as it adds a subtle sweetness, helps to achieve a golden-brown crust, and allows for easy flavor customization. Although soy sauce might seem like an interesting alternative, it could overpower the dish and deviate from the classic calzone taste."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As George continues to struggle in school, he begins to unravel the intricate web of emotions behind his actions, leading to a heartwarming story of self-discovery, forgiveness, and finding love in unexpected places. Act One: George is an average high school student who has always managed to remain organized and diligent in his schoolwork. However, his life takes a dramatic turn when Sally, an introverted classmate with a crush on him, musters the courage to confess her feelings to him. Though she tries to be understanding, she is heartbroken when George decides not to pursue a romantic relationship with her. Embarrassed and feeling vulnerable, Sally distances herself from George. The fallout from this rejection has an unexpected impact on George. He finds himself unable to concentrate on his schoolwork, and for the first time, he begins to fall behind on his homework. As the weeks go by, his once immaculate grades start to suffer, and his teachers take notice of the sudden change. Act Two: Despite several attempts by his teachers and friends to help him get back on track, George continues to spiral downwards. He becomes lost in his thoughts, trying to understand why he rejected Sally and why he can no longer find the motivation to do his schoolwork. The once diligent student is now plagued by tardiness, incomplete assignments, and constant daydreaming. Eventually, George finds himself in the principal's office, where he is confronted with the harsh reality of his academic decline. The principal warns him that if he doesn't turn things around immediately, he risks being suspended or even expelled. This ultimatum leaves George desperate to figure out the root of his sudden lack of motivation. Still haunted by his rejection of Sally, George seeks guidance from his best friend, Maya, who helps him realize that he may have had deeper feelings for Sally than he initially thought. As they spend more time together, Maya provides her own secret feelings for George, causing him to question his emotions and actions even more. Act Three: With his newfound understanding of his emotional turmoil, George finds the courage to approach Sally and apologize for his past actions. He details how her rejection weighed heavily on his mind, causing him to lose focus on everything else in his life. Although he can't promise her an immediate romantic relationship, he admits that he now wants to get to know her better. Defensively at first, Sally questions George's intentions, but as they open up to each other, she starts to realize he is sincere. They agree to start afresh as friends and attempt to salvage any hope of a future relationship. In the meantime, George refocuses on his academics and begins to turn his grades around. With the support of Sally, Maya, and his teachers, he gradually regains the motivation and determination that had once defined him. As friendship and trust grow between George and Sally, they discover they have more in common than they initially thought. Eventually, as the school year comes to an end, George and Sally find themselves falling in love. Epilogue: Through self-discovery and the help of friends and teachers, George and Sally learn valuable lessons about vulnerability, understanding, and the importance of second chances. As they walk hand in hand toward their bright futures, they leave behind a legacy at their high school - one of love, resilience, and the power of forgiveness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: While Lennon and Starr remained consistently friendly during the years that followed the Beatles' break-up in 1970, his relationships with McCartney and Harrison varied. He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 Dark Horse tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership. Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music, he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate, but his bond with Ono prevented him. Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him. Lennon told Playboy, \\"I was hurt by it. By glaring omission ... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch ... he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. I'm not in the book.\\"Lennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of \\"How Do You Sleep?\\", Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of Saturday Night Live in which Lorne Michaels made a 3,000 offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show. The pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired. Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: \\"Throughout my career, I've selected to work with ... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono ... That ain't bad picking.\\"Along with his estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with... Answer:","completion":"McCartney.

It is not possible to tell if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence.

Celebrations: Corey Brown, 20, escaped being tagged so he can go out for his 21st birthday and over Christmas. A judge agreed not to fit a criminal with an electronic tag because of his 21st birthday plans ‚Äì and that only a ‚Äòtyrant‚Äô would impose such a punishment. Corey Brown had been ordered to do 150 hours of community service for his role in the theft of a pensioner‚Äôs car, but when he failed to turn up for the work sessions five times he was hauled back into court to be given a curfew and an electronic tag. But he was spared after complaining that the punishment would ruin his plans for a night out on his 21st birthday. Recorder David Hall told a stunned courtroom: ‚ÄòIt would be a tyrant who tagged someone on their 21st birthday and at Christmas.‚Äô Turning to Brown‚Äì who had sat smirking throughout the hearing at Warwick Crown Court ‚Äì Recorder Hall then said: ‚ÄòIf I give you seven more hours [of community service] to do, and you keep out of trouble, is that a fair deal?‚Äô Brown, from Bedworth, Warwickshire, simply nodded, and then walked free from court. Yesterday, victims‚Äô groups reacted furiously to the decision, saying it would ‚Äòundermine confidence in the criminal justice system‚Äô. In March, Brown was given a 36-week jail sentence, suspended for two years, and 150 hours‚Äô community service after he was caught with the keys of a Lexus that had been stolen from a 70-year-old woman. The ¬£30,000 car had been used in a series of raids on shops in the Coundon area of Coventry in November last year. When police raided Brown‚Äôs home, they discovered the keys hidden in his bedpost. Brown admitted handling stolen goods. Punishment: Corey Brown, 20, escaped with seven hours additional unpaid work after repeatedly missing probation sessions. But after failing to turn up for his. community service placements on five occasions, on Monday he was brought. back into court ‚Äì which could have seen him sent straight to prison to. carry out his original 36-week sentence. The court heard that Brown, who lives. with his grandmother, had also missed three sessions of a ‚ÄòThinking. Skills‚Äô programme that he had been ordered to complete. Despite this,. his lawyer asked the court to be lenient, because Brown was about to. celebrate his birthday. Annabel Hamilton, defending, told the. court: ‚ÄòHe is very reluctant to have a curfew because of his 21st. birthday and Christmas coming up.‚Äô To the astonishment of court staff,. Recorder Hall agreed to go easy on Brown, and told him he would not be. fitted with a tag ‚Äì which alerts police if offenders leave their homes. during curfew hours. And Brown ‚Äì who has already been to prison three times ‚Äì admitted that even he was surprised he had been let off. He said: ‚ÄòI was expecting to get a. tag for missing my probation dates. Technically, they should have. activated my prison sentence. But the judge told me I‚Äôd done well so. far. He said he didn‚Äôt see the point. ‚ÄòThanks to the judge, I can enjoy a few drinks for my birthday, instead of being stuck in with my gran or in prison.‚Äô When asked why he had not turned up. to do his community service, he replied: ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know; just didn‚Äôt. think about it. I didn‚Äôt care. ‚ÄòI suppose I did see the whole thing as a bit of a joke.‚Äô As he prepared to celebrate his 21st. birthday yesterday, Brown added: ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been to jail three times and I. haven‚Äôt learned a thing. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve already told the judge that. jail doesn‚Äôt work for me. What‚Äôs the point of sending me to prison now?‚Äô Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim Support, said: ‚ÄòTough community. sentences can work in stopping reoffending, but there need to be. consequences if offenders repeatedly break them. ‚ÄòIf that means disrupting a criminal‚Äôs enjoyment of the festive season, then so be it. ‚ÄòOtherwise decisions like these could undermine victims‚Äô confidence in the justice system.‚Äô A court insider said: ‚ÄòIt was obvious the judge was feeling warm-hearted in the run-up to Christmas. ‚ÄòBut it did leave the solicitors a little surprised, considering the defendant‚Äôs record.‚Äô Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Inside the Bay's 60-million bid to take on Amazon Hudson's Bay Company CEO Jerry Storch is beyond excited. Even though his chief of logistics is supposed to be leading the media tour of the retailer's new high-tech e-commerce warehouse, Storch can't resist adding his two cents at every turn. \\"It takes 15 minutes from the time we get an order till it can be out the door,\\" he proudly tells the visitors at the 750,000-square-foot facility in Toronto's east end. \\"That's astounding.\\" When the group reaches columns of three-storey-high shelving, an enthusiastic Storch describes the robotic system that zooms up and down, searching out merchandise and delivering it to the workers who will box it up. \\"When the robots are going down, they're recharging their own batteries, from the friction against the walls,\\" he says. The Bay has spent 60 million on this \\"Perfect Pick\\" system. Goods purchased on its website will be packed and shipped from here. Company officials say it's the most advanced technology of its kind in Canada. The Bay's new 'fulfilment centre' is the size of 15 football fields. (CBC) It's all part of Storch's grand ambition to make North America's oldest company the champion of retail's newest frontier ‚Äî e-commerce. \\"Nobody will beat us on the internet,\\" Storch declares. \\"Nobody.\\" But the reality is the Bay is getting soundly beaten on the internet. Walmart and Best Buy's Canadian sites get more monthly visits, according to web traffic analysis done by SimilarWeb. So does Canadian Tire's website, which doesn't even offer delivery. Customers can only reserve merchandise online and then have to visit a Canadian Tire store to pick it up. A worker unloads merchandise in the Bay's new e-commerce warehouse (CBC) But the king of Canadian e-commerce is American giant Amazon. Its Canadian site is No. 1, and its American site, Amazon.com, ranks higher than any other international retailer operating in Canada. \\"In a very short period of time, Amazon has been able to amass a simply astonishing level of market share,\\" says Ontario-based retail consultant Doug Stephens, author of the upcoming book Re-engineering Retail. \\"It's really leaving its competitors in its wake.\\" Stephens says Amazon is more than a retailer ‚Äî it's an innovation, data and technology company all rolled into one, which spends billions on research and development. He says no retailer in Canada even comes close in terms of energy and money poured into e-commerce. \\"For a long time, Canadian retailers just sort of shrugged their shoulders about e-commerce. They didn't think it was that big of a deal. Now all of the sudden, along comes Amazon and the tables have turned,\\" Stephens says. \\"I think they've recognized that e-commerce is the future and that someone else is capitalizing on that future, and it's not them.\\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signs a robot at Amazon's new warehouse west of Toronto, which it also calls a fulfilment centre. The Bay wants to challenge Amazon's e-commerce supremacy in Canada. (Nathan Denette/Canadian Press) Stephens says it would be a mistake to count out the Bay, partly because it has something Amazon doesn't: physical stores. \\"They have a distribution network that's already built, and these stores could be repurposed to become distribution hubs,\\" he says. \\"It's a huge advantage.\\" Online shoppers who want to return or exchange a product may prefer to visit a store instead of paying postage to make a return via mail, the way Amazon customers do on some purchases. Not surprisingly, the Bay's CEO also sees bricks and mortar locations as important because the retailer can offer its customers two different shopping experiences. \\"The stores are a huge competitive advantage and a lot of internet retailers are only starting to wake up to that now,\\" Storch says. \\"Our dressing rooms are our No. 1 competitive advantage in the world. The ability to go to the room and try it on and make sure you have the right size, it's huge. Returns on the internet are very high.\\" Amazon has been experimenting with pop-up stores, and is reportedly considering opening retail locations specializing in groceries, books and fashion. \\"Amazon is a great competitor,\\" Storch says. \\"But so are we.\\" The Bay is ready for e-commerce7:52 What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Hudson's Bay Company, the oldest company in North America, has invested 60m in a high-tech, 750,000 sq ft e-commerce warehouse in Toronto to take on e-commerce giant Amazon.

Soon after, relatives Ralph and Helen arrive with their children, hoping for a chance at the fortune. Thinking Walter is also after it, they threaten to take him to the Orphanage, making him run away. Walter makes his way to a gas station, and uses a phone booth to call the court reporting school which his mother told him she was attending only to learn she isn't there. The two uncles find him; Hub is glad to see him on his way, but Garth convinces Hub to bring him back home. Walter begins settling in, dealing with his uncles' odd habits, such as Hub's sleepwalking at night in which he relives old fights, as well as their daily routine of shooting at traveling salesmen for fun. Curious, Walter suggests they at least hear a pitch; they end up buying a clay pigeon launcher. Hub orders a lion from a circus animal dealer, intending to mount its head after killing it; however, they end up with an aging, tame lioness. Walter names her Jasmine, angering Hub. Later, Hub passes out loading 50-pound bags of Lion Chow, landing him in the hospital. He soon recovers and is hungry; the three then lunch at a road side store. Four Greasers enter, annoying Hub who easily beats them in a fight. In their absence, Ralph and Helen's sons accidentally release Jasmine from her crate just as Hub, Garth and Walter return.

A:","completion":"The original character of the terrifying clown Pennywise in the 1990 miniseries adaptation of Stephen King's \\"It\\" was portrayed by British actor Tim Curry. Tim Curry, born on April 19, 1946, in Grappenhall, Cheshire, England, is a renowned actor with a career spanning several decades and encompassing theatre, film, and television. Before taking on the iconic role of Pennywise the Dancing Clown, Curry gained recognition for his performance as Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the cult classic \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" (1975). Throughout the years, he has delivered memorable performances in various productions, such as \\"Annie\\" (1982), \\"Legend\\" (1985), \\"Clue\\" (1985), and \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" (1990), to name a few. In Stephen King's \\"It\\" miniseries, Curry's portrayal of Pennywise left a lasting impression on audiences, garnering him significant praise for his ability to depict the evil, supernatural being's sinister nature. The miniseries, directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, is based on King's 1986 novel and focuses on a group of friends known as the Losers Club, who reunite as adults to destroy the malevolent force that terrorized them during their childhood in the fictional town of Derry, Maine. Curry's interpretation of Pennywise is characterized by his distinctive physical appearance, unsettling laugh, and ability to take on different forms to prey on the fears of his victims. His performance marked a significant milestone in the horror genre and has been referenced in countless pop culture moments since the release of the miniseries. In the more recent adaptations of \\"It,\\" directed by Andy Muschietti and released as a two-part film series in 2017 and 2019, the role of Pennywise is played by Swedish actor Bill Skarsg√•rd. Bill's performance also received critical acclaim, and he too succeeded in making a distinct impact on the horror genre with his interpretation of the malicious clown. Despite the differences in their respective portrayals, both Tim Curry and Bill Skarsg√•rd managed to provide unforgettable visuals and deliver the terror that made Pennywise an iconic character in the world of horror fiction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: As we all know, children are our future, and it's up to us to arm them with the tools to succeed. Sadly, today's children are sometimes being armed with more dangerous tools like weapons, drugs and gangs in the USA. Once a relatively peaceful environment, many schoolyards of today are becoming unsafe for both students and teachers. Home schools are available to give you choices. Home schooling provides top-quality education, flexibility and freedom to create your own schedule. At Sunny Home School we believe the choice should be yours. Thanks to modern technology, home schooling information is becoming readily available across the nation. A recent study by the ITBS (Iowa Tests of Basic Skills) and TAP (Tests of Achievement and Proficiency) shows us that students of home schools do particularly well when compared with the nationwide average. In every subject at every grade level, students of home schooling scored obviously higher than those in public and private schools. If you're new to home schooling, you may be asking yourself, \\"Will home schools really work for my children?\\" Fact: A nationwide study using a random selection of 1,516 families found students of home schooling to be scoring, on average, at or above the 80thpercentile (80) in all areas, on standardized achievement test. (Note: The national average on standardized achievement test is the 50thpercentile.) Collectively, the staff at Sunny Home School brings 65 years of experience in home schooling curriculum. We've placed students in the top 2% of the nation in math and many are successfully moving on to college. One study found that of the home schooled students, 94% said home education prepared them to be independent persons. For more home schooling information, call us today toll free at (1800)542-8668.

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context. Since 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects‚Äô subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context. Reenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture. Starting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor‚Äôs path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor‚Äôs path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When does the visitor see Neolithic art? Options: A. after viewing the ocean B. before the museum opens C. before work from ancient Rome D. not enough information A:","completion":"C. before work from ancient Rome"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So, I'll use the formula to calculate the average of these two numbers as follows: Average = (43 + -57) / 2 Doing the addition first according to the BODMAS rule, that states that additions and subtractions should be done after divisions and multiplications, I get: Average = (-14) / 2 And, then if I do the division, I get: Average = -7 So, the output should be the list [-7] because the task requires the output to be a list of the averages of each two consecutive values.

Given the question: White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States‚Äô southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump‚Äôs efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump‚Äôs wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. ‚ÄúIt will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,‚Äù said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. ‚ÄúWe are anxious to have this support.‚Äù In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other ‚Äúsupport functions.‚Äù She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include ‚Äúas many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.‚Äù A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. ‚ÄúSuffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,‚Äù the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

But tens of thousands of Americans this year sought a very different kind of item on what is expected to be the biggest shopping weekend of 2015: guns. Federal Bureau of Investigation spokesman Stephen Fischer confirmed to Fortune that there were 185,345 background checks on November 27, easily beating the previous all time high of 177,170 on December 21, 2012, which was shortly after the Sandy Hook massacre in Connecticut. The FBI‚Äôs National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) data are widely considered to be the best proxy for gun sales. With last week‚Äôs big jump, four out of the 11 biggest days ever for background checks were on a Black Friday. On the same day last year, the FBI conducted 175,754 checks. Big retailers such as Cabela‚Äôs and Sportsman‚Äôs Warehouse were advertising deals for guns heading into Black Friday. ||||| CLOSE More Americans had their backgrounds checked purchasing guns on Black Friday than any day on record, according to data released by the FBI this week.

The National Instant Criminal Background Check System processed 185,345 requests on Nov. 27, one of the largest retail sales days in the country. \\"This was an approximate 5% increase over the 175,754 received on Black Friday 2014,\\" wrote Stephen Fischer, the FBI's chief of multimedia productions. \\"The previous high for receipts were the 177,170 received on 12/21/2012.\\" Previous spikes for background checks, conducted before a gun buyer can obtain a firearm, occurred after prominent mass shootings, like in December 2012 in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Other Black Friday shopping days in 2014, 2013 and 2012 occupied the FBI's \\"top 10\\" list of the most background checks processed in a 24-hour period. Since 1998, FBI data shows that the bureau has processed requests for more than 220 million firearm purchases. Licensed sellers deny sales to failed background checks based on a variety of factors including criminal backgrounds, domestic violence convictions or restraining orders. Friday's purchases came the same day as the mass shooting incident in Colorado Springs that killed three people and injured nine others. On Saturday, President Obama called for tighter controls of \\"weapons of war\\" in the wake of the Planned Parenthood shooting. \\"This is not normal,\\" Obama said. \\"We can't let it become normal.

Article: After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th‚Äì6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world. Now answer this question: What is a common Attic-based dialect?","completion":"A common Attic-based dialect refers to Koine Greek, a standardized and widely spoken form of the Greek language that emerged during the Hellenistic period. The term \\"Attic-based\\" indicates that this dialect was primarily rooted in the Attic Greek, the dialect spoken in the city of Athens and its surrounding region, Attica. The formation of Koine Greek as a common dialect was a direct result of the widespread expansion and cultural influence of the Greek world under the reign of Alexander the Great and his successors. As Greek culture, ideas, and language spread throughout newly established Hellenistic kingdoms in Asia, Africa, and Southwest Asia, there was a need for a shared language to facilitate communication between people originating from different Greek regions and cities. Koine Greek evolved from Attic Greek, incorporating elements from other Greek dialects as well, and became the lingua franca of the Hellenistic world. This enabled people from various Greek territories to interact, trade, and share ideas through a common language. The use of Koine Greek also allowed for the transmission of Greek literature, philosophy, and scientific knowledge to a wider audience, significantly shaping the cultural landscape of the Hellenistic period. Major Hellenistic cities and cultural centers such as Alexandria, Antioch, Pergamon, and Seleucia played a crucial role in spreading the use of Koine Greek throughout the various Hellenistic kingdoms, further solidifying its importance as a common Attic-based dialect during this era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The heads of government were the shoguns. Each was a member of the Ashikaga clan. - Biography. Yamana Szen was born to Yamana Tokihiro (13671435), head of the Yamana clan. Tokihiro was the \\"shugo\\" governor of Tajima, Bingo, Aki, and Iga provinces. Tokihiro, who was often in bad health, retired in 1433 and passed his numerous lands to Szen. Szen went on to defeat Akamatsu Mitsuhide (13731441) in the Kakitsu Incident, and became governor Harima Province the same year. - The in the history of Japan was a family who controlled the hereditary title of \\"shikken\\" (regent) of the Kamakura shogunate between 1203 and 1333. Despite the title, in practice the family wielded actual governmental power during this period compared to both the Kamakura shoguns, or the Imperial Court in Kyoto, whose authority was largely symbolic. The Hj are known for fostering Zen Buddhism and for leading the successful opposition to the Mongol invasions of Japan. Resentment at Hj rule eventually culminated in the overthrow of the clan and the establishment of the Ashikaga shogunate. - Moronao was an iconoclast with no intention of following tradition, particularly insofar as the Emperor was concerned. On the subject, he once said: What is the use of a King? Why should he live in a Palace? And why should we bow to him? If for some reason a King is needed, let us have one made of wood or metal, and let all the live Kings be banished. The Taiheiki, an epic dedicated to the events of this period, describes the K brothers as avid villains. Moronao in particular is accused of violence, greed and lewdness. Because of this reputation, in the \\"bunraku\\" and \\"kabuki\\" play \\"Kanadehon Chshingura\\", which depicts the vendetta of the 47 Ronin, his name is used to represent Kira Yoshinaka. - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia.

He had been shogun for only three years. Immediately, the \\"bakufu\\" elevated Yoshinari, the young shogun's even younger brother, to be the new shogun.

The first to hold this title was K no Moronao. - Name. In Japanese, the city has been called Ky, Miyako, or Ky no Miyako. In the 11th century, the city was renamed Kyoto (\\"capital city\\"), after the Chinese word for capital city, '. After the city of Edo was renamed Tokyo (meaning \\"Eastern Capital\\") in 1868, and the seat of the Emperor was transferred there, Kyoto was known for a short time as Saiky (meaning \\"Western Capital\\"). - Hosokawa Katsumoto ( , 1430 -- June 6 , 1473 ) was one of the Kanrei , the Deputies to the Shogun , during Japan 's Muromachi period . He is famous for his involvement in the creation of Ryan - ji , a temple famous for its rock garden , and for his involvement in the nin War , which sparked the 130 - year Sengoku period . His conflicts with his father - in - law , Yamana Szen , who resented the power Hosokawa had as Kanrei , were among those that ignited the nin War in 1467 . When the Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa had a son in 1464 , Yamana took this as an opportunity to oppose Hosokawa further , supporting the child as heir to the Shogunate . Hosokawa had always worked closely with the Shogun 's brother Ashikaga Yoshimi , and supported his claim to the shogunate . In 1467 , open war broke out in the capital of Kyoto , between Hosokawa and Yamana , who each commanded roughly 80,000 men . The Shogun declared that the first to make war in the capital would be branded a rebel , and so the two armies remained immobile for some time , but within a few months , the tensions had risen too far , and war simply could not be delayed any further . Hosokawa made the first obvious attack within the capital , attacking the mansion of a Yamana general by the name of Isshiki . Fighting erupted between the two camps , and over the course of the next few days , many were killed , and many buildings destroyed , either by the soldiers or by looters . Each army gradually carved out a section of the city that they held and defended against the other ; Hosokawa 's army came to be known as the Eastern Army , as Yamana 's so - called \`\` Western Army '' controlled western sections of Kyoto . But not all the fighting took place within the city ; Hosokawa sent men onto the main roads , and into Yamana 's home provinces , to prevent his reinforcements from reaching the main battles . Though Hosokawa attacked first , he convinced the Shogun to brand Yamana , not himself , with the stigma of being a rebel against the Shogunate . He even... - Life. Yoshimi was the abbot of a Jdo monastery when he was first approached in 1464 by Hosokawa Katsumoto, who wished to support a bid for Yoshimi to become shogun. He originally sought to stick to his religious life, and had no desires to become shogun. However, by 1464, he was convinced to join his brother, the shogun, and assist him, putting himself into a position to be the next in the line of succession. The birth of the Shogun's son placed Yoshimi in an awkward situation, making his succession no longer definite, but he remained as Yoshimasa's Deputy. - The was a Japanese samurai clan which was one of the most powerful of the Muromachi period (1336-1467); at its peak, members of the family held the position of Constable (\\"shugo\\") over eleven provinces. Originally from Kzuke Province, and later centered in Inaba province, the clan claimed descendance from the Seiwa Genji line, and from Minamoto no Yoshishige in particular. The clan took its name from the village of Yamana in present-day Gunma Prefecture. They were valued retainers under Minamoto no Yoritomo, and counted among his \\"gokenin\\". - The was a civil war that lasted from 1467 to 1477, during the Muromachi period in Japan. \\"nin\\" refers to the Japanese era during which the war was fought. A dispute between Hosokawa Katsumoto and Yamana Szen escalated into a nationwide war involving the Ashikaga shogunate and a number of \\"daimys\\" in many regions of Japan. - Events of the \\"nin\\" era. The \\"nin War\\": This conflict began as a controversy over who should follow Ashikaga Yoshimasa as shogun after his retirement whether it would be his brother (Yoshimi) or his son (Yoshihisa); but this succession dispute was merely a pretext for rival groups of \\"daimys\\" to fight in a struggle for military supremacy. In the end, there was no clearcut winner.

The Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and this day is now a public holiday called National Liberation Day. The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as \\"the Balkan Prussia\\". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918‚Äîtwo Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed.

This meaning of the word is ly new in English,but not as new as you might think.The earliest record found so far is from 1884 in the phrase\\"Dat's cool!\\" Kick the Bucket This means\\"to die\\".Many people consider the term to have come from a guilty man standing on an upturned bucket which was then kicked out from under his feet leaving him to hang,but there is no written evidence that this is the case.In fact,it is more likely from a different type of bucket entirely.In butchery ,when a pig was killed it would be hung from a pole.It is mostly likely that in his death throes ,the pig's feet would bang against the rail to which they were tied.Therefore,kicking the bucket was a term referring to the last actions of the pig before he finally died. Bob's Your Uncle Bob's your uncle generally means that something is simple or easy or a\\"job done\\".It is most likely that this phrase came about as a result of nepotism .In the late 1800s, Lord Salisbury(first name Robert)was prime-minister of Great Britain.After his third term he was _ by his nephew Arthur.Arthur had been made Chief Secretary of Ireland in 1886.

Sentence 2: Did they seriously think it would remain under wraps? This sentence is asking if \\"they\\" believed the situation would remain hidden or under wraps.

From the 3rd century BC onwards Prakrit and Pali literature in the north and the Sangam literature in southern India started to flourish. Wootz steel originated in south India in the 3rd century BC and was exported to foreign countries. Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties for the next 1,500 years, among which the Gupta Empire stands out. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the classical or \\"Golden Age of India\\". During this period, aspects of Indian civilization, administration, culture, and religion (Hinduism and Buddhism) spread to much of Asia, while kingdoms in southern India had maritime business links with the Roman Empire from around 77 CE.

The empire reached its peak under the rule of Ashoka the Great, who ruled from 268 to 232 BCE.

Randy thought the US should build a wall on the border but Craig disagreed.","completion":"Randy thought the US should build a wall on the border, but Craig disagreed, arguing that there were more effective, compassionate, and economical solutions to address the issues of immigration and security. Craig contended that investing in technology and improving the existing infrastructure at border checkpoints would result in better control and management of the flow of people and goods across the border. By implementing smart surveillance systems, biometric technologies, and employing more border patrol agents, security measures could be significantly enhanced without relying on a physical barrier. Moreover, Craig believed that working collaboratively with neighboring countries and addressing the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunities, would create lasting change. He proposed that the US should support and invest in programs that foster economic development, education, and stability in the countries where most immigrants originate, thereby reducing their need to leave their homes in search of a better life. In addition, Craig expressed concern about the potential damage to the environment and wildlife that a wall could cause in delicate border ecosystems, which include rivers, mountains, and deserts. These areas are home to numerous native plant and animal species that rely on habitat connectivity to survive, and a continuous wall could lead to habitat fragmentation and loss of biodiversity. Finally, Craig emphasized the importance of upholding human rights and dignity in border policy decisions. He argued that a wall could symbolize exclusion and discrimination, further dividing communities and sending a negative message to the rest of the world. Instead, he said that the US should focus on promoting understanding, tolerance, and cooperation, while working on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses issues such as family separation, pathways to citizenship, and a fair, transparent visa system. Throughout their conversation, Randy and Craig shared their differing perspectives and sought to find common ground in the complex, deeply-rooted issue of immigration and border security.

Help as much as you can. I read this background article the other day: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. I am facing a new situation today: Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor. As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques. The doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is more likely to have lowered oxygen supply to their heart muscles? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information from the background article and the new situation, Jake is more likely to have a lowered oxygen supply to his heart muscles. This is because Jake has a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall, which can lead to restricted or blocked blood flow, resulting in a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. Ryan, on the other hand, has no plaques present, indicating a lower risk of restricted blood flow and decreased oxygen supply to his heart muscles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: A partial truce brokered by the US and Russia in Syria came into effect at sunset on Monday, the beginning of the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha.","completion":"Title: Partial Truce Arrives in Syria for Eid al-Adha Celebration: A Peek into the US and Russia's Collaborative Efforts Introduction The US and Russia, two major players in the global political arena, have been working tirelessly to establish a truce in Syria as a way to ease the crippling effects of the ongoing war. On Monday, a partial truce brokered by these two powerful nations came into effect at sunset, coinciding with the beginning of the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha. In this article, we will examine the background of the Syrian conflict, analyze the efforts by the US and Russia for implementing a truce, and assess the potential outcomes of this significant development. Background of the Syrian Conflict The Syrian civil war began in 2011 as pro-democracy protests against President Bashar al-Assad's regime and has since escalated into a complex and multi-layered conflict. It has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions of Syrians, leading to one of the most devastating humanitarian crises of the modern era. The war has been further complicated by the involvement of numerous external forces, including the US-led coalition, which fights against the Islamic State (ISIS) and supports rebel forces, and the Russian Federation, which backs the Assad regime. Efforts for Establishing a Truce Despite the vast differences between the US and Russia's geopolitical interests in Syria, both countries have made concerted efforts to negotiate and implement a ceasefire in recent years. Their motivation for this collaboration, in part, stems from a desire to reduce the overall level of violence and alleviate the humanitarian crisis. Additionally, these efforts allow the two countries to exert their influence and maintain control over their respective interests in the Middle East, while providing a pathway for potential cooperation against more extreme militant groups, notably ISIS. The newly brokered partial truce between Russia and the US at the eve of Eid al-Adha signifies an important development in the ongoing efforts to bring about stability in Syria. The truce is expected to prepare ground for a broader and more robust ceasefire in the region that serves as a prelude for peace talks and eventual political settlement. Impact and Potential Outcomes While the partial truce is focused on saving innocent civilian lives and easing the suffering in the conflict-ridden region, many uncertainties remain about its long-term success. One of the major challenges to maintaining the truce is the propensity for breaches and violations from all sides involved. Additionally, the exclusion of certain extremist groups from the truce could further complicate the security situation in the region. The fragmented nature of the Syrian conflict has posed significant difficulties in organizing and implementing a coherent and comprehensive truce, hence the partial approach adopted in this instance. However, the truce's commencement on the eve of the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha presents a deeply symbolic moment. It provides a sense of optimism and a window of opportunity for reflecting on the importance of peace and the need for unity in pursuing an end to the devastating conflict. The peaceful celebration of Eid across the war-torn nation could potentially promote a greater sense of understanding among the warring factions and motivate them to work towards lasting peace. Conclusion The ongoing Syrian conflict and its repercussions on the global scene have weighed heavily on the conscience of the international community over the past decade. The partial truce brokered by the US and Russia in Syria, coinciding with the beginning of the religious festival of Eid al-Adha, showcases the persistent efforts by these major players in attempting to resolve the crisis. While the road to lasting peace in Syria remains fraught with challenges, this truce signifies a beacon of hope amidst an environment dominated by violence and despair."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL ‚Äî North Korea‚Äôs sudden threat to pull out of the upcoming summit with the U.S. raises new doubts of whether a denuclearization deal is possible. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to meet with U.S President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12 to work out an agreement to end the North‚Äôs nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. But on Wednesday North Korea‚Äôs Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan released a statement through the state-run KCNA news agency that criticized ‚Äúunbridled remarks‚Äù made specifically by the U.S. president‚Äôs National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding that Pyongyang completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, along with its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons stockpile, before receiving any compensation or concessions. He expressed ‚Äúindignation‚Äù at the U.S uncompromising position and said North Korea might pull out of the Trump-Kim summit, unless the Trump administration acts with ‚Äúsincerity‚Äù to improve relations through dialogue. ‚ÄúIf the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,‚Äù the statement said. The vice foreign minister also said it was ‚Äúabsolutely absurd‚Äù that Bolton would compare Libya‚Äôs experience dismantling its relatively rudimentary nuclear program as a model for dealing with the North‚Äôs more advanced and expansive capabilities. He also denounced the Trump administration for ‚Äúmiscalculating the magnanimity‚Äù of Kim Jong Un‚Äôs decision to suspend further nuclear and missile tests, and his willingness to engage in nuclear talks, as ‚Äúsigns of weakness,‚Äù that were the result of what the U.S. administration has dubbed its ‚Äúmaximum pressure‚Äù campaign that led international efforts to impose punishing sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade.

Options: - he was not caring either way - He probably completely disagreed - not enough information - he partly agreed === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"He probably completely disagreed. The vice minister's statement criticized the \\"unbridled remarks\\" made by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, who demanded that North Korea completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, ballistic missile program, and chemical weapons stockpile before receiving any compensation or concessions.

To do this, we need to get \\"z\\" all by itself. Since -9 is multiplied by \\"z,\\" we can do the opposite, which is dividing, to both sides of the equation.

About the song wrote Billboard : \`\` You know the beat , now you catch the groove . Billboard wrote about the song : \`\` You catch the beat , now know the groove . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"While these two sentences may appear similar at first glance, they differ in the order they present the ideas and imply somewhat different meanings. Let's break down each sentence to clarify their meanings: Sentence 1: \\"About the song, Billboard wrote: 'You know the beat, now you catch the groove.'\\" In this sentence, it is implied that the listener is already familiar with the beat of the song. The focus is now shifted to the groove of the music so that the listener can connect with it on another level and fully appreciate the song. The sentence tells the reader that the song has a recognizable beat, and the groove is something to now explore and connect with. The focus is on catching the groove after knowing the beat. Sentence 2: \\"Billboard wrote about the song: 'You catch the beat, now know the groove.'\\" In this sentence, the process starts with catching the beat of the song. It implies that the listener first connects with the beat before moving on to \\"know the groove.\\" The sentence indicates a progression - from catching the beat, which might suggest an initial attraction, to knowing the groove, more deeply understanding and appreciating the song's rhythm and feel. The focus is on knowing the groove as a result of catching the beat. So, while both sentences involve the beat and the groove, the order in which they are presented differs, leading to slightly different meanings. The first sentence starts with the assumption that the listener knows the beat and then proceeds to catch the groove, while the second sentence starts with the listener catching the beat and then moves on to knowing the groove."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","completion":"To predict the sentiment of the tweet \\"is going to watch dexter without marquita,\\" we need to analyze the context and the words used in the tweet. Dexter is a popular TV series, and the user has mentioned they are going to watch it; this can be a neutral statement. However, the inclusion of \\"without marquita\\" can indicate a different emotion. In order to make a more accurate prediction, we need to examine the possible emotions that the user could be expressing with this tweet: 1. Excitement: The user might be excited to watch Dexter and simply wants to share this information with their followers. In this case, the reference to Marquita could be incidental and might not carry a strong emotional connotation. 2. Loneliness or Disappointment: The user may want to watch Dexter with Marquita, but for whatever reason, they cannot. Thus, they could be expressing sadness, disappointment, or loneliness that they have to watch their favorite show alone. 3. Indifference: The mention of Marquita might not carry any particular emotion. The user could be stating the fact that they will be watching the series without her, without necessarily expressing any sentiment. 4. Relief or Satisfaction: The user may prefer watching Dexter without Marquita, which could indicate relief or satisfaction in being able to watch the show on their own terms. Considering these possible scenarios, the sentiment is not clearly positive or negative. It can be interpreted as neutral with a hint of potential emotional context that depends on the relationship between the user and Marquita. To provide a more accurate prediction of the sentiment, we need additional context or tweets from the user to understand the relationship with Marquita. However, based on this one tweet alone, the sentiment can be seen as mainly neutral with an element of uncertainty due to the mention of Marquita."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Susan Mary Alsop - a Two-Continent Hostess - NYTimes.com Jacqueline Kennedy and President Kennedy arriving at the home of Joseph Alsop in 1961. IN January 1961, President John F. Kennedy dropped by Joseph Alsop‚Äôs house on Dumbarton Avenue in Washington after the inaugural balls to unwind with a band of revelers over Champagne and turtle soup. Kennedy was always welcome at the Georgetown home of the outspoken, hawkish Alsop and his elegant wife, Susan Mary; but a year and a half later, the president nearly spoiled one of their dinners by talking at such length in the garden with the guest of honor, Charles E. Bohlen (whom he had just appointed ambassador to France), that the lamb got cold. The Washington Post‚Äôs Katharine and Don Graham, the philosopher Isaiah Berlin and other guests waited hungrily for the president and ambassador to come to table. ‚ÄúSomething is going on,‚Äù Susan Mary told her husband later that night. ‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù he responded, skeptically. That ‚Äúsomething‚Äù turned out to be the Cuban missile crisis. ‚ÄúAmerican Lady,‚Äù a new biography of Susan Mary Alsop by Caroline de Margerie, a French judge and former diplomat, reveals the influence and insight of the American hostess, who lived so elegantly in the public eye, and so passionately when no one was watching. Unlike her husband, Mrs. Alsop was not a syndicated columnist read by hundreds of thousands. But her gatherings drew people from both sides of the political aisles, creating lasting bonds. If she were alive today, she would be giving a celebratory dinner that President and Michelle Obama ‚Äî and perhaps even Mitt and Ann Romney ‚Äî would be delighted to attend, and where politesse would trump politics. Until she died in 2004, the tradition of giving parties to forge social and political alliances thrived in Washington, perpetuated by savvy, charming hostesses who delighted in making introductions and in smoothing discord between powerful men and women ‚Äî magnifying their own reputations in the process. Mrs. Alsop was predeceased by Katharine Graham, another partygiver of wit and panache; and before that, by Pamela Harriman (whom she loathed, according to her biographer) and long before that, Perle Mesta. But the saloniste chain has been broken lately; it awaits a new doyenne to reattach the link and keep it growing. For those not quite sure who Susan Mary Alsop was, here‚Äôs a refresher. Slender, lovely, dark-haired, ladylike and intense, she was born Susan Mary Jay in 1918, descended from John Jay, a founding father and the country‚Äôs first chief justice. As a Jay, she had enough family money to live comfortably but not enough to be rich (in her own opinion at least, according to Ms. de Margerie). In October 1939, when she was 20, she married a man named Bill Patten, and in 1945, wangled him a job at the American Embassy in Paris, where she gave frolicsome dinners for European, British and American social and diplomatic luminaries that had a serious underlying intent: to strengthen European-American ties. ‚ÄúShe really set herself this purpose quite seriously,‚Äù Ms. de Margerie said last week by phone from Paris, on the eve of her American book tour. ‚ÄúShe wanted to help Americans understand the French, and vice versa. She thought of herself as a go-between helping two countries she loved, France and America.‚Äù Ms. de Margerie‚Äôs mother in-law, H√©l√®ne de Margerie, who attended many of Susan Mary‚Äôs Georgetown soirees when her husband, Emmanuel de Margerie, was France‚Äôs ambassador to the United States in the ‚Äô80s, told her that ‚Äúgoing to Susan Mary‚Äôs in some ways was like going to an exam: you had to have your French-and-American facts at your fingertips, because you would be examined closely.‚Äù Had Susan Mary been born later, Ms. de Margerie suggested, ‚ÄúShe would have been either a journalist, a profession she would have very much liked to embrace, or a diplomat, which was in the family tradition. Yet in her own way, which was restricted by her class and her times, she managed to be both things. She exerted a kind of behind-the-scenes diplomacy, both in Paris, where she spent 15 years of her life ‚Äî probably the happiest years ‚Äî and in Washington.‚Äù What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Susan Mary Alsop was an important and elegant American hostess who lived in Washington and Paris.

This statement tells us that the collection of sculptures showcased presents a comprehensive representation of every aspect of Francisco Salzillo's work. It implies that these sculptures demonstrate the range of themes, styles, and techniques that Salzillo employed throughout his career. Hypothesis: The sculptures by Francisco Salzillo all depict cows. This statement suggests that all of Salzillo's sculptures solely represent cows. This is a very specific, narrow focus for an artist, and it claims that his entire body of work is restricted to this single subject.

This, in turn, casts doubt on the hypothesis that all his sculptures depict cows. If we evaluate the given information, we can determine that the two statements contradict each other.

Indicate your choice as \`a\` for Yes or \`b\` for No. Question: When was the man whose name is used as the unit of radio wave frequency born? Passage:A modulated radio wave, carrying an information signal, occupies a range of frequencies. See diagram. The information (modulation) in a radio signal is usually concentrated in narrow frequency bands called sidebands (SB) just above and below the carrier frequency. The width in hertz of the frequency range that the radio signal occupies, the highest frequency minus the lowest frequency, is called its bandwidth (BW). A given amount of bandwidth can carry the same amount of information (data rate in bits per second) regardless of where in the radio frequency spectrum it is located, so bandwidth is a measure of information-carrying capacity. The bandwidth required by a radio transmission depends on the data rate of the information (modulation signal) being sent, and the spectral efficiency of the modulation method used; how much data it can transmit in each kilohertz of bandwidth. Different types of information signals carried by radio have different data rates. For example, a television (video) signal has a greater data rate than an audio signal.

Here is a question about this article: But von Neumann, who had participated at the Congress, confirmed his fame as an instantaneous thinker, and in less than a month was able to communicate to G√∂del himself an interesting consequence of his theorem: namely that the usual axiomatic systems are unable to demonstrate their own consistency. However, G√∂del had already discovered this consequence, now known as his second incompleteness theorem and sent von Neumann a preprint of his article containing both incompleteness theorems. Von Neumann acknowledged G√∂del's priority in his next letter. He never thought much of \\"the American system of claiming personal priority for everything.\\" What is the answer to this question: What was the consequence of the theory of incompleteness?","completion":"The consequence of Kurt G√∂del's incompleteness theorems, specifically the second one mentioned in the article, had profound implications for mathematics, logic, and our understanding of the limits of formal axiomatic systems. The first incompleteness theorem states that for any consistent formal axiomatic system that is powerful enough to encapsulate the basic arithmetic of natural numbers, there will always be statements that are true within the system but cannot be proven or disproven using the system's own rules and axioms. In other words, there will always be some undecidable propositions within the system. The second incompleteness theorem, which is the focus of the article and the consequence being discussed, establishes that a consistent formal axiomatic system can never prove its own consistency. This means that we cannot fully trust the axiomatic foundations of our mathematical systems to ensure that they are free from contradictions, as they are unable to demonstrate their own coherence. These theorems challenged the foundational aims of mathematics, particularly the work of mathematicians such as David Hilbert, who aspired to formalize all of mathematics into a complete and consistent axiomatic system. G√∂del's theorems demonstrated that these aspirations were inherently unattainable, as any such system would always be incomplete or inconsistent. The consequence of the theory of incompleteness forced mathematicians and logicians to reconsider the role of formal systems and axioms in mathematics, and to recognize the inherent limits of provability and completeness within these structures. It emphasized the importance of consistency, as the undecidability and self-consistency results only apply to consistent systems. In summary, the consequence of the theory of incompleteness, particularly G√∂del's second incompleteness theorem, reveals the inherent limitations of formal axiomatic systems in demonstrating their own consistency and indicates that there will always be some degree of incompleteness within these systems. This revelation had a profound impact on the foundations of mathematics and logic and continues to inspire philosophical debates and ongoing research in these fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

All we know is that the user has rated it 5 stars because they think it's important. However, the lack of clear information about the specific app's characteristics makes it difficult to wholeheartedly recommend it. The fact that the user doesn't understand what the app does but deems it as important also adds ambiguity to the review. Furthermore, the user relationship to the app is unknown; they may be an expert in the field or a layman. Based on these considerations, my response to the question, \\"Would you recommend this app to a friend?\\" would be \\"Maybe.\\" This choice is justified by the uncertainty of the review's specifics, despite the high rating, which indicates that the app may have some value.

Yes, the sentence \\"Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism.\\" does answer the question \\"What does an archaism explain?\\" to a certain extent. However, it is important to provide a detailed explanation to fully understand the concept. An archaism refers to the use of an older or obsolete form of language, typically found in historical texts or older works of literature. It can apply to individual words, phrases, grammatical structures, or even pronunciation. The existence of archaisms can be the result of various factors, such as historical change, geographical separation, or social distinction. In the given sentence, the context suggests that there are two linguistic groups being compared, and it intends to provide an explanation for any lexical differences between them. It states that any lexical divergence found within or between these groups can be explained as an archaism. This means that the archaic forms or structures of language found within these groups account for the differences in their lexicon. By examining the archaisms within each group, it is possible to gain insight into the historical development of the languages and understand the origin of the divergences. This can, in turn, provide valuable information about the cultural, historical, or social contexts that influenced the languages' evolution. Additionally, understanding archaisms may help in linguistic reconstruction, which aids in the study of related languages and their ancestral forms. In conclusion, the sentence does provide an answer to the question \\"What does an archaism explain?\\", yet it is important to expand on the concept for a more complete understanding. Archaism explains the lexical divergences within or between linguistic groups, which can serve as evidence of linguistic change and help in understanding the historical, social, or cultural factors influencing language evolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Before we analyze the alternatives, let's break down what we know and what we don't know: What we know: 1. A lady is setting up multicolored balls. 2. These balls are being set up in some kind of contraption. What we don't know: 1. The type and purpose of the contraption. 2. The exact number of multicolored balls involved. 3. The context or environment in which she is setting up the balls and contraption. Given this information, let's explore some alternative scenarios that could explain the lady's actions: 1. Ball Sorter: The lady could be setting up a contraption designed to sort the multicolored balls based on their color, size, or other characteristics. Such contraptions can be utilized for various purposes like organizing balls for different games, educational activities, or art installations. 2. Child's Toy: The contraption could be a toy designed for children to interact with the multicolored balls, such as a ball popper machine that shoots the balls into the air or a maze-like structure directing the balls to travel through different paths. 3. Art Installation: The contraption could be part of a larger art project, where the lady is placing the multicolored balls in a specific arrangement to create a visual effect or interactive experience for the viewers. 4. Scientific Experiment: The lady might be conducting an experiment involving the balls and contraption. She could be researching the effects of various forces or techniques on the balls' behavior, such as studying their movement patterns or interactions with one another. 5. Game or Puzzle: The lady could be setting up a game or puzzle involving the multicolored balls, where participants must navigate or interact with the contraption to achieve a specific goal or solve a problem. Given these potential scenarios, we can conclude that although the idea of a lady building a ball pit is plausible, it is not the only possible interpretation of her actions. To arrive at a more accurate conclusion, we would need additional information or context to eliminate alternative explanations and affirm the true nature and purpose of the contraption and multicolored balls."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

A baby bird forms within the egg if it is fertilized: If the egg is fertilized, it means that it has all the genetic material needed to develop into a baby bird. 3. The baby bird begins pecking out of the egg: This is the hatching process when the baby bird breaks free from the eggshell and emerges. 4. The baby bird is unable to fly to get food: At this stage, the baby bird is not yet strong enough or adequately developed to fly and gather food on its own. 5. The mother bird must feed the baby bird food: The mother bird plays a crucial role at this stage, providing nourishment and care to the baby bird, ensuring it grows and develops properly. 6.

Colonel Matt Brennan (Humphrey Bogart), discharged from the military, runs a civilian flying school, where he is reunited with an old US Army Air Force buddy, Major Hinkle (James Brown). Brennan is offered a job at the Willis Aircraft Company as chief test pilot for an experimental high speed jet fighter known as the JA-3, designed by Carl Troxell (Richard Whorf). Troxell is also a link to Brennan's past, having known him in the war when Brennan was a bomber pilot. A flashback to B-17 missions over Germany reveal Brennan to be a top-notch pilot. Another connection to his past is his former flame, Jo Holloway (Eleanor Parker), now Willis' secretary. In order to prove the capabilities of the new JA-3, capable of speeds up to 1,400√Ç mph (2,300√Ç km/h), Brennan convinces Willis that a record-breaking flight from Nome, Alaska to Washington D.C., via the North Pole, will impress the government. At the same time, Troxell tries to develop a safer version of the revolutionary aircraft, the JA-4, equipped with an escape pod, but dies during a test flight.

They however devoloped completely different hobbies. Michael liked to go outside and play sports. Brandon on the other hand enjoyed reading and playing games on his computer. Eventually brandon ended up having to get glasses to correct his nearsitednes while Michael did not. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which of the brothers is nearsighted, Michael or Brandon? Answer:","completion":"Brandon is the brother who is nearsighted based on the information provided in the paragraph. While both Michael and Brandon grew up in the same house together, they developed completely different hobbies. Michael preferred spending his time outdoors and engaging in physical activities like playing sports, whereas Brandon enjoyed more indoor activities such as reading and playing games on his computer. It is important to note that the development of nearsightedness, or myopia, can be influenced by factors such as genetics, environmental elements, and lifestyle habits. While it's not possible to determine from the paragraph whether Brandon's nearsightedness is due to his hobbies alone, his preference for reading and computer gaming could have potentially contributed to his nearsightedness. Prolonged time spent focusing on close-up objects, like books or computer screens, may exacerbate the risk of developing nearsightedness in some individuals. Despite growing up in the same environment, Michael and Brandon's different hobbies and interests likely influenced their visual health in distinct ways. While genetics may also play a role in the development of nearsightedness, the information provided in the paragraph does not allow us to establish a genetic predisposition with certainty. Nonetheless, it does seem that Brandon's interests and activities, coupled with possible genetic factors, led to his need for glasses to correct his nearsightedness. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Brandon is the nearsighted brother, whereas Michael does not appear to have any visual impairments. This demonstrates the potential impact of different hobbies and lifestyle choices on one's visual health, even for siblings who grow up in the same household and may share genetic components."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What did Captain Walden encounter when sent to resuce the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk? Title: Courage Under Fire Movie plot: While serving in the Gulf War, Lieutenant Colonel Serling (Denzel Washington) accidentally destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing night-time battle, killing his friend Captain Boylar. The US Army covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job. Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) should be the first woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and on the next day, when further rescue arrived, Walden was reported dead. Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic (Matt Damon), praises Walden heavily. Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward and that Monfriez himself led the crew in combat, and that the fuel bladder technique was originated by him. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and rendered unconscious. Meanwhile, the crew of the Black Hawk claims that they heard firing from an M16, which Ilario and Monfriez deny. Under pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg (Michael Moriarty), to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn) to prevent another cover up. When Serling puts pressure on Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train. Serling tracks down Ilario using details about Ilario's preferred vacation spot. Ilario tells the true story, revealing that Monfriez wanted to flee while leaving Rady behind. As a result, Monfriez held Walden at... Answer:","completion":"Captain Karen Emma Walden encountered a T-54 tank when she was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: Seventeen-year for the following movie plot: he movie opens with the information that during the 1960s, even though British rock was at its peak, British radio refused to play rock music. This led to the creation of pirate radio stations, which kept their ships anchored off the coast and played rock music 24/7.A boat approaches the Pirate Radio ship and drops off Young Carl (Tom Sturridge), a young man who has been expelled from school for smoking marijuana. He has been sent to spend time with his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy), who owns the ship, allegedly to straighten him out. Quentin introduces Carl to the rest of the crew: The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an American DJ who is the star of the station; Simon, a slightly awkward guy who dreams of finding romance; John, who does news and weather; Dave, who is extremely popular with the ladies; Angus, whom no one really likes but who runs a \\"crazy\\" comedy show; and Felicity, a lesbian who cooks for the boys. Carl is to room with Thick Kevin, who is unbelievably stupid.Carl's first night on the boat is a raucous party and we see scenes of the DJs running their shows spliced with the British people who listen to them. Millions of Britons are tuning in to Pirate Radio, and this greatly disturbs Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh), who is put in charge of eliminating the problem of Pirate Radio. With the help of his new assistant, Twatt (Jack Davenport), they begin working to put Pirate Radio out of business.Twatt's first plan is to eliminate funding for Pirate Radio by making it illegal for British companies to advertise with them. Quentin breaks this news to the crew, explaining that in order to try to recoup their losses, he will be bringing in the famous DJ Gavin (Rhys Ifans). This disappoints the Count, who is used to being #1 on the station and is jealous of Gavin.During Carl's time on the boat he meets Mark, the late night DJ who never speaks and is referred to as \\"the sexiest man in the world.\\" While they are sitting on deck, they begin discussing their conjugal visits: since they never go...

The series is sanctioned by INDYCAR. - Memorial Day is a federal holiday in the United States for remembering the people who died while serving in the country's armed forces. The holiday, which is observed every year on the last Monday of May, originated as Decoration Day after the American Civil War in 1868, when the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union veterans founded in Decatur, Illinois, established it as a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the Union war dead with flowers. By the 20th century, competing Union and Confederate holiday traditions, celebrated on different days, had merged, and Memorial Day eventually extended to honor all Americans who died while in the military service. It marks the start of the unofficial summer vacation season, while Labor Day marks its end. - Michael \\"Mike\\" Lanigan is an entrepreneur and IndyCar Series team owner. - Buddy Rice (born January 31, 1976) is an American racecar driver.

In most English-speaking regions, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, \\"suburb\\" has become largely synonymous with what is called a \\"neighborhood\\" in other countries and the term extends to inner city areas. In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U.S. states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities. In others, such as Arabia, Canada, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county. - Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing is an auto racing team that currently races in the United SportsCar Championship and the IndyCar Series. Based in Hilliard, Ohio, it is co-owned by 1986 Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal, former television talk show host David Letterman, and businessman Mike Lanigan. - Robert \\"Bobby\\" Woodward Rahal (born January 10, 1953 in Medina, Ohio) is an American auto racing driver and team owner. As a driver, he won three championships and 24 races in the CART open-wheel series, including the 1986 Indianapolis 500. He also won the 2004 Indianapolis 500 as a team owner for the winning driver, Buddy Rice. - The Indianapolis 500 is an automobile race held annually at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, an enclave suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana. The event is held over Memorial Day (originally Decoration Day) weekend, which is typically the last weekend in May. It is contested as part of the Verizon IndyCar Series, the top level of American Championship Car racing, an open-wheel formula colloquially known as \\"Indy Car Racing\\".

Unable to reach terms with the New York Giants, Strong signed instead with the Staten Island Stapletons. He played for the Stapletons for four years from 1929 to 1932. While statistics are not available for the 1929 NFL season, Strong was regarded as one of the best backs in the NFL. He started all 10 games at halfback for the 1929 Stapletons. In his first NFL game, he threw a long forward pass to set up the Stapleton's first touchdown and scored all of the team's 12 points on two short touchdown runs. He also had a 70-yard run in a scoreless tie with the Orange Tornadoes on November 3, 1929. Two days later, Strong had a 50-yard touchdown run against the Providence Steam Roller. At the end of the 1929 season, Strong was selected by Collyer's Eye and the Green Bay Press-Gazette as a second-team All-Pro. In 1930, Strong appeared in all 12 games for the Stapletons and scored 53 points on two rushing touchdowns, five receiving touchdowns, one field goal, and eight extra points. His point total ranked third in the NFL in 1930, trailing only Jack McBride (56 points) and Verne Lewellen (54 points). On September 28, 1930, he caught two touchdown passes, threw a 40-yard pass that set up a third touchdown, and kicked three extra points in a 21-0 victory over the Frankford Yellow Jackets. In December 1930, he led the Stapletons to a 16-7 victory over the New York Giants for the pro football championship of New York City; Strong accounted for all 16 Stapleton points, running 98 yards for a touchdown, passing for a second touchdown, and kicking a field goal and an extra point. He was selected as a first-team player on the 1930 All-Pro Team by Collyer's Eye and the Green Bay Press-Gazette. In 1931, Strong appeared in all 11 games for the Stapletons and scored 53 points on six rushing touchdowns, one punt return for a touchdown, two field goals, and five extra points. His 53 points ranked fourth in the NFL, trailing only Johnny Blood (84 points), Ernie Nevers (66 points), and Dutch Clark (60 points). On November 22, 1931, Strong scored all 16 points in a 16-7 victory over Cleveland; he had two rushing touchdowns, including a 50-yard run and kicked a field goal and an extra point. At the end of the 1931 season, Strong was selected as an All-Pro for the second year in a row, receiving first-team honors from the United Press (UP) and Collyer's Eye. Strong's output dropped off in 1932 as he moved to the fullback position. He appeared in 11 games and ranked sixth in the NFL with 375 rushing yards, but scored only 15 points on two touchdowns and three extra points.

No tumors were detected ; rather , empty cavities and scar tissue were found in their place .","completion":"Yes, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, although they are structured differently and use somewhat different phrasing. Let's break down the meaning of each sentence to better understand their similarities. Sentence 1: \\"The researchers found only empty cavities and scar tissue where the tumors had been.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on what the researchers found in the location where tumors previously existed. The use of \\"only\\" emphasizes that instead of finding any tumors, the researchers discovered \\"empty cavities and scar tissue.\\" This implies that the tumors are no longer present, and what remains in their place is the aftermath of their removal or disappearance (i.e., the empty cavities and scar tissue). Sentence 2: \\"No tumors were detected; rather, empty cavities and scar tissue were found in their place.\\" This sentence is more explicit about the absence of tumors. The first phrase, \\"No tumors were detected,\\" clearly states that the researchers did not find any tumors. The second part of the sentence, following the semicolon, elaborates on this finding by using the word \\"rather\\" to indicate that instead of tumors, they found \\"empty cavities and scar tissue\\" in the location where tumors would be expected. This also implies that the tumors are no longer there and have been replaced by these empty cavities and scar tissue. Both sentences express the idea that the researchers were looking for tumors but discovered empty cavities and scar tissue instead.

Possible answers: happy, uncomfortable, bored The answer to this question is:","completion":"happy. Quinn would most likely feel happy after the night described in the given context. There are a few reasons for this conclusion. First, Quinn was surprised with a birthday cake. Receiving a birthday cake is a celebratory and joyful event for most people, especially when it comes as a surprise. A surprise usually means that someone close to Quinn took the time and effort to plan and execute it as a way to express their love, care, and affection towards her. In this scenario, the birthday cake communicates that Quinn is cherished and valued, which would certainly promote positive emotions in her. Second, \\"burning the candle at both ends\\" is an idiom that usually implies that someone is working hard or going to great lengths to enjoy themselves. In this context, it suggests that Quinn had a very lively, energetic, and intense night, which aligns with having an amazing experience. Although this phrase can occasionally have negative connotations, such as not giving oneself enough time to rest, the overall context implies that Quinn had a fantastic time. Finally, the statement \\"She had an amazing night\\" clearly conveys that Quinn had an outstanding time. The word \\"amazing\\" is a powerful, positive adjective that denotes a highly enjoyable and exceptional experience. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that Quinn had a night full of excitement and delightful memories. Taking all of these considerations into account, Quinn would most likely feel happy after the night‚Äôs events.

Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for L√§ther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. L√§ther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles‚Äîrock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast L√§ther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the L√§ther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975‚Äì77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and... Answer:","completion":"Herb"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation 0 = -16*t + 11*t - 36*t + 410 for t, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. The given equation has three terms with t: -16*t, 11*t, and -36*t. We will combine these terms to simplify the equation. -16*t + 11*t - 36*t = (-16 + 11 - 36) * t = (-5 - 36) * t = -41*t Now, the equation will be: 0 = -41*t + 410 Step 2: Isolate the variable t. To find the value of t, we need to isolate it. We'll do this by moving the -41*t term to the other side of the equation. To maintain the balance of the equation, we must perform the same operation on both sides. Thus, we will add 41*t to both sides: 0 + 41*t = -41*t + 41*t + 410 41*t = 410 Step 3: Solve for t. Now, to find the value of t, we will divide both sides of the equation by 41: 41*t / 41 = 410 / 41 t = 10 So the answer is t = 10."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

These genes produce a family of closely related, but distinct polypeptide isotypes that are distinguished principally by sequences within the approximately 15 carboxy-terminal amino acid residues. By immunizing rabbits with chemically synthesized peptides corresponding to these variable domain sequences, we have now prepared polyclonal antibodies specific for each of six distinct isotypes. Specificity of each antiserum has been demonstrated unambiguously by antibody binding to bacterially produced, cloned proteins representing each isotype and by the inhibition of such binding by preincubation of each antiserum only with the immunizing peptide and not with heterologous peptides. Protein blotting of known amounts of cloned, isotypically pure polypeptides has permitted accurate quantitative measurement of the amount of each beta-tubulin isotype present in the soluble and polymer forms in various cells, but has not revealed a bias for preferential assembly of any isotype. Localization of each isotype in three different cell types using indirect immunofluorescence has demonstrated that in vivo each class of microtubules distinguishable by light microscopy is assembled as copolymers of all isotypes expressed in a single cell..

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"Under the hypothetical scenario where the environment becomes warmer, the proposed perturbation will most likely result in less ice formation overall. Consequently, this change in ice formation would have a direct impact on the second effect mentioned, which is the pressure exerted on the walls of any containing medium, such as rocks, by expanding water when it freezes. As water freezes, it expands and occupies 10% more space, leading to an increase in pressure against the walls of its container or the rocks surrounding it. This pressure can be strong enough to force the rock's walls to move farther apart, causing the cracks to expand and deepen over time. This process plays a significant role in breaking apart rocks and the overall weathering and erosion process in the environment. With a warmer environment and less ice formation, the reduction in the expansion of water due to lower freezing rates would lead to a decrease in the pressure exerted on the rock walls. Consequently, there would be less force driving the walls of the cracks apart, leading to fewer instances of cracks expanding and deepening within the rocks. This would result in a reduced rate of rock breaking apart and a slower weathering and erosion process. It is important to note that while ice formation may decrease, other factors such as clay expansion when wet and the invasive action of plant roots like mosses and lichens on rocks will still contribute to rock breakage. However, these factors may not be as potent in causing rock degradation compared to the effects of ice formation and expansion. In summary, the warmer environment will lead to a decrease in the second effect mentioned, which is the pressure exerted on the walls of rocks due to water freezing, thereby resulting in a reduced rate of rock breakage and a slower weathering process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Available options: (I) negative; (II) positive; Short movie review: to mediocrity Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"To determine whether the critic was thinking positively or negatively of the movie, let's first analyze the given information: 1. The short movie review says \\"to mediocrity\\" 2. It's necessary to compare \\"to mediocrity\\" to the available options (I) negative and (II) positive Step 1: Analyze the meaning of \\"to mediocrity\\" \\"Mediocrity\\" refers to being average or of moderate quality. In the context of a movie review, this suggests that the movie did not stand out as being particularly good or bad, but rather was somewhere in the middle. Step 2: Compare \\"to mediocrity\\" with the available options Now, we need to find out whether describing a movie as mediocre aligns more with a positive or negative perspective. Usually, if someone had a positive view of the movie, they would use words like \\"good,\\" \\"excellent,\\" or \\"entertaining\\". On the other hand, someone with a negative view might use words like \\"bad,\\" \\"disappointing,\\" or \\"boring\\". In this case, \\"mediocre\\" doesn't align with either of these extremes. However, it does suggest a lack of enthusiasm or praise for the movie. Step 3: Make a conclusion Based on the comparison, we can conclude that the critic's opinion leans more towards the negative side. While \\"to mediocrity\\" doesn't explicitly mean the movie was bad, the absence of positive qualities and the overall indifference imply a less-than-positive perspective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the sorcerer who the medallion belong to?, using the article: During the Blitz, Charlie, Carrie, and Paul are evacuated from London to Pepperinge Eye, where they are placed in the reluctant care of Miss Eglantine Price, who agrees to the arrangement temporarily. The three children attempt to run back to London, but after observing Miss Price attempting to fly on a broomstick, they change their minds. Miss Price reveals she is learning witchcraft through a correspondence school with hopes of using her spells in the British war effort, and offers the children a transportation spell in exchange for their silence. She casts the spell on a bedknob, and adds only Paul can work the spell, since he's the one who handed it to her. Later, Miss Price receives a letter from her school announcing its closure, thus preventing her from learning the final spell. She convinces Paul to use the enchanted bed to return the group to London, and locate Professor Emelius Browne. They discover Browne is actually a charismatic showman who created the course from an old book, and is surprised to learn the spells actually work for Miss Price. He gives the book to Miss Price, who is distraught to discover the final spell, \\"Substitutiary Locomotion,\\" is missing. The group travels to Portobello Road to locate the rest of the book. They are approached by Swinburne, who takes them to the Bookman, who possesses the remainder of the book. They exchange their pieces, but learn only the spell was inscribed on a medallion, the Star of Astaroth, that belonged to a sorcerer of that name. The Bookman reveals the medallion may have been taken by a pack of wild animals, given anthropomorphism by Astaroth, to a remote island called Naboombu.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the building that an explorer found a well preserved room where \\"the stone walls still have their plaster upon them in a tolerable state of preservation.\\"? In the years following the Ancestral Puebloan's departure from Chaco Canyon, several migrations to the region occurred. During the 15th century, Navajo people emigrated to the area from northwestern Canada, and in the 18th century Spanish explorers and settlers came from the south. The Spanish investigated parts of the San Juan Basin, but there is no record of them ever finding Chaco Canyon. When cartographer Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco drew a map in 1774 of Spanish land holdings in the region, he labeled Chaco Canyon with the word Chaca, but it is unlikely he ever visited the area. In 1823 the governor of New Mexico, Jos√© Antonio Vizcarra, discovered ancient ruins in the canyon during a military campaign against the Navajo. Vizcarra's account is the first historical record of the Chacoan great houses that were \\"of such antiquity that their inhabitants were not known to Europeans\\". In 1844, Josiah Gregg made the first published reference to Chaco Canyon in his popular book, Commerce of the Prairies. The United States started exploring the region following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846‚Äì48 and the acquisition of the New Mexico Territory. During a military campaign against the Navajo in 1849, Lieutenant James Simpson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers became interested in the canyon's ruins. A group led by the governor of Jemez Pueblo, Francisco Hosta, explored the canyon; its members included Simpson and the brothers Richard and Edward Kern, who were respectively an artist and a cartographer. Simpson was impressed by Chetro Ketl's masonry, which he described as \\"a combination of science and art which can only be referred to a higher stage of civilization and refinement than is discoverable in the works of Mexicans or Pueblos of the present day.\\" Simpson and company documented their findings, noting the location and style of the great houses, taking measurements, and sketching the canyon's major ruins.

Answer:","completion":"The name of the building where an explorer found a well-preserved room with stone walls and plaster in a tolerable state of preservation is not explicitly mentioned in the given text.

They have a beginning, a middle, and an end with commercials thrown in every three or four minutes. The commercials are unavoidable. They happen whether you want them or not. Every couple of minutes a billboard glides by outside the bus window. \\"Buy Super Clean Toothpaste.\\" \\"Drink Good Wet Root Beer.\\" \\"Fill up with Pacific Gas. \\"Only when you have fallen asleep, which is equal to turning the television set off, can you get separated from the unending cry of \\"You Need It! Buy It Now!\\" As for the ride itself, the beginning of it is comfortable and somewhat exciting, even if you've traveled that way before. Usually some things are keeping changing out of the windows -- various houses, crop fields, attractive bridges, ... and sometimes even a small accident. Your bus driver may have a unique style of driving and it's fun trying experience it the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly reckless or daring, the ride can be as thrilling as an adventurous story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right or the left hand lane? After a while, of course, the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride. Food always makes bus rides more interesting. But you've got to be careful of what kind of food you eat. Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops. The end of the ride is somewhat like the beginning. You know the riding will soon be over and there's a kind of expectation and excitement with that. The seat, of course, has become harder for the hours having passed. By now you may sit with your legs crossed, or with your hands in your lap, or with your hands on the arms, or even with your hands crossed behind your head. That is to say that the end comes just at no more ways to sit. Options: A the commercials both on TV shows and on billboards along the road are fun B they both have a beginning, a middle and an end, with commercials in between C the drivers are always reckless on TV shows just as they are on buses D both traveling by bus itself and watching TV programs on bus are not exciting.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Options: a). yes b). it is not possible to tell c). no","completion":"b). it is not possible to tell Let's analyze both sentences: Sentence 1: \\"that's sad well it was nice to talk to you.\\" In this sentence, the speaker acknowledges that something is sad and proceeds to express that they enjoyed talking to the listener. The speaker does not specify the reason for sadness, and their exact emotional state is unclear. However, the conversation might be ending or continuing based on the context. Sentence 2: \\"I do not want to talk to you now that I am sad.\\" In this sentence, the speaker explicitly states that they're sad and do not wish to talk to the listener due to their emotional state. This indicates that their sadness has a direct impact on their willingness to engage in conversation. Now we can determine the relationship between these sentences, considering Sentence 1 as true: - If Sentence 1 is true, the speaker recognized something sad and enjoyed their conversation with the listener. This does not necessarily mean the speaker is sad. Rather, they might be empathizing with the listener or commenting on a sad topic they discussed. - Since Sentence 1 does not provide information about the speaker's emotional state, it isn't possible to determine whether Sentence 2, which depends on the speaker feeling sad, is true or not. Therefore, the correct answer is Option b). it is not possible to tell.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: oh yeah that's there is oh there is Hypothesis: Oh yeah, there is more smokers than drinkers. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"The hypothesis \\"Oh yeah, there is more smokers than drinkers\\" is not necessarily entailed by the given premise \\"oh yeah that's there is oh there is.\\" To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we must first thoroughly examine both the premise and the hypothesis. The given premise, \\"oh yeah that's there is oh there is,\\" is somewhat ambiguous, making it difficult to discern any specific meaning from it. Without any clear context or additional information, the premise appears to be a collection of exclamatory phrases without any particular argument or point being conveyed. On the other hand, the hypothesis, \\"Oh yeah, there is more smokers than drinkers,\\" presents an assertion concerning the comparative population of smokers and drinkers. To be considered entailed by the premise, this assertion would need to be a logical or necessary conclusion resulting from the information provided in the premise. Given the lack of clarity and specific meaning in the premise, it does not provide adequate information or grounds to support or draw conclusions about the number of smokers compared to drinkers. Consequently, the hypothesis, while an interesting point of discussion, is not entailed by the ambiguous premise provided. A clearer premise or additional supporting information would be required to substantiate the hypothesis and establish whether or not it is entailed by the premise. For instance, if the premise provided data or statistics on the number of smokers and drinkers, or described trends concerning smoking and drinking habits, then it might be possible to derive the proposed hypothesis as a logical conclusion. In the absence of such information, the connection between the premise and the hypothesis cannot be established conclusively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Both sentences essentially communicate that except for \\"The Kids,\\" all other \\"Space Cowboy\\" tracks were recorded with Derrick after initially being recorded with Nick Van Gelder. However, there are a few things to note: 1. In the first sentence, '...all \\"Space Cowboy\\" tracks were recorded with Derrick except \\"The Kids\\"' indicates that all tracks in the \\"Space Cowboy\\" album (with the exception of \\"The Kids\\") were recorded with Derrick. The second sentence, '...all \\"Space Cowboy\\" tracks except \\"The Kids\\" were re-recorded with Derrick,' highlights that these tracks have been re-recorded with Derrick's contribution.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Correction appended To Portlanders, in a story about heroes, George Elwood Tschaggeny was a villain. In surveillance video and photos viewed far and wide, a man is seen walking off with a backpack in the chaos of last month's horrifying MAX attack. It belonged to Ricky Best, one of three men stabbed ‚Äì two fatally ‚Äì while trying to protect two girls from a man shouting racial epithets at them. In addition to the pack, it was later discovered the thief had taken the wedding ring off Best's finger as he lay bleeding to death. That man, police say, was Tschaggeny. But those who knew him say that, before addiction destroyed his life, George Elwood Tschaggeny would have been one of the heroes who stood up on the train. That may seem improbable to those who followed the story. The 51-year-old became, in the public's eye, the person who committed the unfeeling, \\"completely heartless\\" act, as police characterized it. He was arrested June 2 at a small homeless camp near Interstate 84. He was wearing Best's wedding band. Known as \\"Elwood\\" by friends and family, Tschaggeny was once a hero himself, honored by police in 2010 with a civilian medal for stopping a bank robber armed with a knife. He was the sort of guy who'd pull over on the highway to help a motorcyclist after a crash, put the motorcycle in his truck and drive the injured biker to a doctor ‚Äì like he did in 1998. He was a military veteran, like Best, who lived in North Tabor with his wife and their five dogs. He loved hiking, biking and Westerns. That's the man his ex-wife remembers, before the painkillers prescribed for a knee injury turned into an addiction, first with pills, then heroin. \\"Not in my wildest dreams would I ever imagine he'd be facing what he's facing,\\" she said. \\"This is just not him.\\" The Oregonian/OregonLive is not identifying Tschaggeny's ex-wife at her request for safety reasons, as she has a protective order against him. She first met Tschaggeny in 1997, shortly after he moved to Oregon from his hometown Salt Lake City. She worked with his mother, who introduced the pair at a Thanksgiving celebration. Three years later, they were married, on April Fools' Day 2000. For the next 16 years, Tschaggeny's ex-wife remembers, they built a great life together. Tschaggeny introduced her to Australian shepherds, and soon, they had four ‚Äì Chris the Dog, Darwin, Howl E. Bones and Ted-E ‚Äì plus one Jack Russell terrier, Jack Jack. They spent their days hiking, mountain biking and lifting weights. At home, their TV was always tuned to the Western movie channel. Tschaggeny tended to the rose garden in their yard and, every day, he made his wife lunch for work and then dropped her off. Tschaggeny was honored by police in June 2010 for stopping a bank robber a few months earlier, Portland police spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson said. The robber led police on a car chase, then crashed into a bus at Providence Hospital. The robber ran into a nearby neighborhood. Tschaggeny, who was in his front yard of his home with another man, Scott Morales, saw the robber with a knife in his hand running from officers. They chased him down and took him to the ground, holding him there until police could arrest him. The awards ceremony lauded the men's \\"courageous and selfless\\" actions. Tschaggeny worked in property management after a stint in construction. According to court documents, Tschaggeny said he was self-employed, buying and selling property. But, his ex-wife said, he dreamed of the two of them opening a breakfast restaurant, where he could make his signature omelets. \\"It was just a happy life,\\" she said. Then his knees got worse. Tschaggeny started going to a clinic for knee pain he still had from injuries he'd gotten as a child. To help him deal with the pain, his ex-wife said, the clinic prescribed him pills. \\"That's how it all began,\\" she said. The change happened slowly. Tschaggeny's ex-wife noticed he was angry and not interested in their usual activities. At some point, though his ex-wife isn't exactly sure when, he began to use heroin. Four in five new heroin users reported they started out abusing prescription pills, according to a 2016 report by the American Society of Addiction Medicine. Many say they turned to heroin because it's cheaper and easier to obtain than prescription opioids, the report says. Tschaggeny would be in and out of rehab at least four times in about five years, his ex-wife said. But each time, he would succumb to addiction. \\"He always said, 'It calls you, it calls you, it calls you,'\\" his ex-wife remembered. \\"And every time something let him down or he let someone down, it led him back into this deep hole.\\" In February 2015, she filed for divorce, citing \\"irreconcilable differences,\\" court documents show. She told The Oregonian/OregonLive that she filed because of his addiction. In April 2015, Tschaggeny went to a rehab program in Palm Desert, California, according to a 2015 jail interview and his ex-wife. After he returned, the couple tried to reconcile. For a time, Tschaggeny seemed to be better, his ex-wife said. \\"He was so proud of himself for accomplishing that and getting over it,\\" she said. But when he started acting angry and despondent soon after, she suspected he was using drugs again. She filed a restraining order against him in June 2015, court records show. His first arrest came a few weeks later for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and trespassing. In an interview with jail staff, he said he wasn't using heroin at the time but had been using daily until his recently completed rehab program. He also said he was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD. The divorce was finalized in May 2016, according to court records. After that, his ex-wife said, he became homeless. It was devastating, she said, but she couldn't help him. He was arrested again in September 2016, court records show, this time for attempted burglary. He told jail staff he'd been homeless for six weeks and hadn't used drugs since April 2015. He said he had been employed by a janitorial company for a few weeks but had been unemployed for a couple months. Earlier this year, Tschaggeny pleaded guilty to unauthorized use of a vehicle in Washington County on Feb. 17. His jail mug shots from 2015 to 2017 show a steady physical deterioration common among people addicted to drugs. After his arrest in the MAX theft, Tschaggeny declined to speak to jail staff during his intake interview, court records show. Portland police said Tschaggeny took Best's belongings as people tried to help the stabbing victims: Best, Taliesin Namkai-Meche, 23, and Micah Fletcher, 21. Namkai-Meche, like Best, died from his wounds. Fletcher survived. Detectives did not know whether Tschaggeny was on the MAX during the stabbing or came on afterward. Tschaggeny's sister, Camille, believes her brother's gut reaction was to try to help Best, but he took Best's belongings when he realized he could not. \\"Elwood did a desperate act that desperate people do,\\" she said. She thinks the government failed her brother by not providing more resources for mental health and opioid addiction. She declined to comment further. Tschaggeny's ex-wife said nothing excuses the crime police say he committed. He should have to face the consequences of his actions, she said. But, she said, before his addiction, he would have never done anything like this. Still, she has hope that her ex-husband will get the help he needs and finally beat his addiction. \\"He's just not that person,\\" she said, \\"and he doesn't want to be that person.\\" Lynne Palombo of The Oregonian/OregonLive staff contributed to this report. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Tschaggeny was arrested June 3. ‚Äî Samantha Matsumoto smatsumoto@oregonian.com 503-294-4001; @SMatsumoto55 ||||| PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) ‚Äî The man wanted for allegedly stealing a backpack and wedding ring from Ricky Best, one of the victims killed in the MAX attack on May 26, was wearing Best‚Äôs wedding ring when he was arrested. George Tschaggeny, 51, was caught on video carrying Best‚Äôs black backpack off of the MAX train. Portland Police Sgt. Pete Simpson provided details of his arrest Friday morning, saying a tip from a Domino‚Äôs Pizza worker led them to the homeless camp where Tschaggeny lives off Northeast Halsey Street under the Cesar E. Chavez overpass along I-84. ‚ÄúDetectives noticed that he was wearing a ring and determined that was Mr. best‚Äôs wedding ring,‚Äù Simpson said. Best‚Äôs family realized the items were missing while making funeral arrangements Thursday, police said. Upon reviewing surveillance video of the crime scene, police determined the bag had been stolen. Detectives believe Tschaggeny took Best‚Äôs ring off of his finger but don‚Äôt know how he did it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs completely heartless,‚Äù Simpson said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way to describe what happened. I have only heard of one other time that something like this happened and it was a gang related incident where people took jewelry off the deceased after a shooting. That action is just incredibly heartless and unconscionable.‚Äù Best‚Äôs son, Eric, told KOIN 6 News the wallet is still missing. The wallet had contact information for people Best served with in the Army and his family wants that information so they can get in touch with those people. Police are urging people to be on the lookout for the wallet. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve suffered an immense loss and this is just one more layer of tragedy to their already awful experience,‚Äù Sgt. Pete Simpson said. Best, a 53-year-old army veteran, was stabbed to death after standing up for two girls being verbally assaulted by a man on the MAX. He was a 23-year Army veteran and father of 4. Simpson said this news has angered detectives involved with the MAX attack investigation. Court documents show Tschaggeny went through a divorce in 2015 and has faced several felony charges, including auto theft and burglary. Documents also show he has a history of cocaine and heroin use. Tschaggeny‚Äôs sister Camille told KOIN 6 News that her brother suffers from an opioid addiction. She said: First and foremost, I wish that Mr. Best‚Äôs family are able to recover the property. I understand that is no measure against their grief. I am sick inside for their loss as well as the other families and for the girls. Our concerns are with the victims in this case, all five and their families. We all love and support my brother, but my brother is a very troubled man with an opioid addiction.This is yet another failure of inhumane and gross policies and lack of healthcare infrastructure to support addicts. As much as we love and support my brother, my brother has to own the consequences of his actions.‚Äù ||||| Summary:","completion":"A man named George Elwood Tschaggeny was seen in a video stealing a backpack from a person named Ricky Best, who was hurt during an attack on a train. Ricky and two other men were trying to protect two girls from someone yelling mean things at them. George is accused of also taking Ricky's special wedding ring, which is very important. George used to be considered a hero, and he once stopped a person who was trying to rob a bank. Sadly, he became addicted to pain medicine and then started using a very dangerous drug called heroin. This addiction made him do things he wouldn't have done before."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can.

Help as much as you can. Where did the man who died on April 27, 1992 become professor of composition in 1966? Answer the above question based on the context below: Olivier Eug√®ne Prosper Charles Messiaen (French: […îlivje m…õsj…ëÃÉ]; December 10, 1908 ‚Äì April 27, 1992) was a French composer, organist, and ornithologist, one of the major composers of the 20th century. His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He said he perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords (a phenomenon known as synaesthesia in its literal manifestation); combinations of these colours, he said, were important in his compositional process. For a short period Messiaen experimented with the parametrisation associated with \\"total serialism\\", in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His style absorbed many global musical influences such as Indonesian gamelan (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works). Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 11 and was taught by Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupr√©, among others. He was appointed organist at the √âglise de la Sainte-Trinit√©, Paris, in 1931, a post held until his death. He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s. On the fall of France in 1940, Messiaen was made a prisoner of war, during which time he composed his Quatuor pour la fin du temps (\\"Quartet for the end of time\\") for the four available instruments‚Äîpiano, violin, cello and clarinet. The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners for an audience of inmates and prison guards. He was appointed professor of harmony soon...

Q: Background Paragraph: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years. Story: The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean.

Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him).

A major security flaw in Google's Play Store that could expose user's private data has been revealed by researchers. The bug, which the team has worked with Google, Facebook and other app makers to fix before revealing it, put millions of users at risk, the researchers said. The bug would allow hackers to steal user data from Facebook, Amazon and others using 'secret' keys the team uncovered. The Columbia Engineering Team found thousands of secret keys in android apps (shown by red arrows) that could be used to steal user data. The researchers created an app called PlayDrone, which used various hacking techniques to circumvent Google security to successfully download Google Play apps and recover their sources. They were then able to decompile the apps to see their code. They then found developers often store their secret keys in their apps software, similar to usernames/passwords info, and these can be then used by anyone to maliciously steal user data or resources from service providers such as Amazon and Facebook. The research was revealed in a a paper presented‚Äîand awarded the prestigious Ken Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Award‚Äîat the ACM SIGMETRICS conference. Jason Nieh, professor of computer science at Columbia Engineering, and PhD candidate Nicolas Viennot said they were stunned by the scale of their find. 'Google Play has more than one million apps and over 50 billion app downloads, but no one reviews what gets put into Google Play‚Äîanyone can get a 25 account and upload whatever they want. Very little is known about what‚Äôs there at an aggregate level,' says Nieh. 'Given the huge popularity of Google Play and the potential risks to millions of users, we thought it was important to take a close look at Google Play content.' Nieh and Viennot‚Äôs paper is the first to make a large-scale measurement of the huge Google Play marketplace. The researchers created an app called PlayDrone, which used various hacking techniques to circumvent Google security to successfully download Google Play apps and recover their sources. PlayDrone scales by simply adding more servers and is fast enough to crawl Google Play on a daily basis, downloading more than 1.1 million Android apps and decompiling over 880,000 free applications. Google Play, the Android app store, has more than one million apps and over 50 billion app downloads. Nieh and Viennot discovered all kinds of new information about the content in Google Play, including a critical security problem: developers often store their secret keys in their apps software, similar to usernames/passwords info, and these can be then used by anyone to maliciously steal user data or resources from service providers such as Amazon and Facebook. These vulnerabilities can affect users even if they are not actively running the Android apps. Nieh claims that even ‚ÄúTop Developers,‚Äù designated by the Google Play team as the best developers on Google Play, included these vulnerabilities in their apps. 'We‚Äôve been working closely with Google, Amazon, Facebook, and other service providers to identify and notify customers at risk, and make the Google Play store a safer place,' says Viennot. 'Google is now using our techniques to proactively scan apps for these problems to prevent this from happening again in the future.' In fact, Nieh adds, developers are already receiving notifications from Google to fix their apps and remove the secret keys.","completion":"A major security flaw in Google's Play Store has been discovered by researchers, potentially exposing millions of users' private data.

Context: In the early morning of 10 April, leading elements of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at Donauw√∂rth on the 17th to find the Grande Arm√©e in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by 75 miles (121 km) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckm√ºhl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckm√ºhl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia. On 13 May, Vienna fell for the second time in four years, although the war continued since most of the Austrian army had survived the initial engagements in Southern Germany.

Answer based on context: Public finances have shown a deficit in recent years. This averaged around 650 million per annum between 1999 and 2007, however this amounted to less than 23 percent of GDP. There was a slight surplus in 2008 with revenues totalling 23.16 billion and expenditures 22.93 billion. Government of Slovenia expenditure equalled 38 percent of GDP. , the total government debt of Slovenia was unknown. The Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SURS) reported it to be (not counting state-guaranteed loans) 19.5 billion euros or 54.2% of gross domestic product at the end of September 2010. According to the data provided by the Slovenian Ministry of Finance (Slovenia) in January 2011, it was just below 15 billion euros or 41,6% of the 2009 GDP. However, the Slovenian financial newspaper Finance (newspaper) calculated in January 2011 that it is actually 22.4 billion euros or almost 63% of GDP, surpassing the limit of 60% allowed by the European Union. On 12 January 2011, the Slovenian Court of Audit of the Republic of Slovenia rejected the data reported by the ministry as incorrect and demanded the dismissal of the finance minister Franc Kri≈æaniƒç.

Q:Given the below context: In 1955 in Portland, Oregon, a businessman finds his wife in bed with another man, and commits a double murder-suicide. His young son, Paul, witnesses the three deaths, and is traumatized. Twenty-five years later, in 1980, Paul is incarcerated at a psychiatric institution near Stanford Bay, a small town on the Oregon Coast. One day, Paul manages to murder an orderly, and subsequently retrieves a beloved wooden flute given to him by his father before escaping the institution. Local teenager Marion is struggling to adjust to her disability‚Äîshe survived a car accident several years prior, caused by her drunken father Frank, which left her unable to walk without the help of a leg brace. She is plagued by bizarre dreams, which she comes to discover are in fact premonitions; while in the hospital after her accident, she received a blood transfusion from Paul, which has given her extrasensory perception into Paul's actions. Marion's home life is troubled, with her father being verbally abusive to her and her mother, Bea, and she dreams of leaving Stanford Bay once her fisherman boyfriend, Joey, obtains a job in Portland.

Which continent had more birds with bigger beaks that were better off? Two ancient continents both had a great bird population. At some point in time, the continent of MU experienced a great drought that lasted for several years. The other continent, Lemuria, was unaffected by the drought. Hint: A period of very low rainfall occurred while the Grants were on the islands. The drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. Within just a couple of years, the average beak size in the finches increased. This was clearly evolution by natural selection. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Lemuria had more birds with bigger beaks that were better off. The paragraph explains that while both ancient continents had a great bird population, a significant drought occurred on the continent of MU. This drought resulted in fewer seeds for the birds to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could consume only smaller seeds, leaving them at a disadvantage during this period of limited resources. In contrast, birds with bigger beaks were better off, as they could eat seeds of all sizes and had more food available to them. The effect of the drought was that many small-beaked birds died, and more of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. This led to an increase in the average beak size in the finches within a short period, demonstrating evolution by natural selection. Since the continent of Lemuria was unaffected by the drought, the bird population there, including those with bigger beaks, was able to thrive, making it the continent with more birds with bigger beaks that were better off."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - house - stairwell - school bus - window - garage Explain why a human would choose \\"stairwell\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Stairwell\\" A human would choose \\"stairwell\\" as the answer to this question because it is the most logical option among the given choices. In the absence of windows in an area, a fire extinguisher needs to be placed in a location that is accessible, easily visible, and near exits that lead to safety. A stairwell is a common space in most buildings, often used as an escape route during emergencies, such as fires. Here's a brief explanation of why the other options are not ideal: 1. House: A house is a broad term for a type of building and doesn't provide a specific enough location for where to find a fire extinguisher. 2. School bus: While a school bus might have a fire extinguisher, the question assumes that there are no windows in the area. School buses typically have many windows, making it an improbable choice based on the scenario. 3. Window: The question states that there are no windows in the area, so this option is automatically disqualified. 4. Garage: While a garage might contain a fire extinguisher, it is not the optimal location, as it may be difficult to access during a fire emergency. A garage also might not apply to all building types, such as commercial buildings. A stairwell, on the other hand, is a common safety feature in various types of buildings. Building codes and fire safety regulations require that fire extinguishers be placed near exits or escape routes for easy access during emergencies. Stairwells generally provide direct access to exit doors and are less likely to contain flammable materials compared to other areas, making them a strategic location for installing fire extinguishers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a hypothesis: It was a horrible incident. Here are the options: Options are: (i). yes. (ii). it is not possible to tell. (iii). no. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To analyze whether it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true, we need to look at the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis and examine any logical connections. Premise: \\"There are some times where a man does something unforgivable.\\" This statement acknowledges that there are situations where a person commits an act that cannot be forgiven. It does not specify the nature, severity, or frequency of such acts but rather establishes that these acts exist. Hypothesis: \\"It was a horrible incident.\\" The hypothesis makes a claim about a specific incident, stating that it was horrible. This statement is qualitative, and it provides a value judgment of a particular event. It does not necessarily refer to an unforgivable act, but a horrible incident can be associated with unforgivable acts. Now, we examine the possible connections between the premise and hypothesis: (i) Yes The hypothesis could be true if the premise is true. If there are times when a man does something unforgivable, then it is likely that there exist horrible incidents that are linked to those unforgivable acts. It would not be a stretch to assume that an unforgivable act would also be considered a \\"horrible incident.\\" In this sense, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis can be true as well. (ii) It is not possible to tell While the premise and the hypothesis have some loose connection, the relationship between them is not absolute or definitive. The premise does not guarantee that every horrible incident refers to an unforgivable act since many horrible incidents can occur that are not necessarily unforgivable. Similarly, the hypothesis does not conclusively determine whether a horrible incident is the result of an unforgivable act by a man. Several factors and contexts come into play when assessing the connection between the premise and hypothesis. (iii) No Although it seems less likely for this option to be viable, it is theoretically possible that if the premise is true, the hypothesis could still be false. The premise acknowledges the existence of unforgivable acts, but it does not automatically mean that every horrible incident is a result of such an act. Multiple horrible incidents may occur without being connected to an unforgivable act. Considering these possible connections, the most accurate answer should reflect that it is not possible to tell (option (ii)) because the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is not definite or exclusive. If the premise is true, it does not, by default, make the hypothesis true. There should be more information or investigation of specific incidents to determine the validity of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In each sentence, \\"stress\\" has a distinct meaning which corresponds to different concepts. 1. In the first sentence, \\"Some people put the stress on the first syllable of 'controversy'; others put it on the second,\\" the term \\"stress\\" refers to the emphasis or accent placed on a particular syllable in a word when it is pronounced. In the context of linguistics and phonetics, stress is the relative prominence given to certain syllables, often resulting from the combination of higher pitch, loudness, or length in comparison to other syllables within the same word. In this example, the sentence is discussing the variation in pronunciation of the word \\"controversy,\\" with some pronouncing it with greater emphasis on the first syllable and others emphasizing the second syllable. 2. In the second sentence, \\"Go easy on him, he's been under a lot of stress lately,\\" \\"stress\\" refers to the psychological, emotional, or physical strain or tension resulting from demanding circumstances, difficult situations or a feeling of being overwhelmed. In this context, the word \\"stress\\" is related to one's mental well-being and overall emotional state. The sentence implies that the individual in question has been dealing with a high level of stress and, as a result, the speaker is suggesting that others be more understanding or lenient towards that person. In summary, these two usages of the word \\"stress\\" are distinct and pertain to different aspects: the first refers to the emphasis placed on syllables during pronunciation, while the second is associated with the emotional strain experienced in life.

Question: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

While this new appointment may not lead to drastic changes in the country, it does represent a significant milestone in Cuban history.

Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren‚Äôt sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don‚Äôt like needles. Or maybe they aren‚Äôt sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer ‚Äústronger‚Äù versions, designed for older adults? I‚Äôm never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it‚Äôs certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC‚Äôs recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I‚Äôm about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I‚Äôm not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza.

The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa).

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the types of whales that use throat pleats to expand the mouth?, using the article: Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of \\"smell\\", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing ‚àí their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that..., what would be the answer ?

Lauren Adrian (Jennifer Lopez), an impassioned American news reporter for the \\"Chicago Sentinel\\" wants to be assigned to the Iraq front-lines to cover the war. Instead, her editor George Morgan (Martin Sheen) assigns her to investigate a series of slayings involving young maquiladora factory women in a Mexican bordertown. Worker Eva (Maya Zapata), originally from the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, takes a bus to go back to her shanty-town home after work. After a while she is the last passenger still in the bus. The driver asks her if she minds if he goes to a gas station to fill up, and Eva agrees. However, he takes her to a remote place and assaults and rapes her, together with another man, who then tries to strangle her. The two men, believing she's dead, bury her alive. With the little energy she has left, Eva escapes. Adrian heads to Ciudad Ju√É¬°rez, Chihuahua, on the U.S.√¢¬Ä¬ìMexico border to investigate the murders, hoping that if she does well she will be promoted by Morgan to be a foreign correspondent.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: When did the Artizans Company finally recover from the mismanagement and fraud of Queen's Park? The Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company (Artizans Company) was established in 1867 by William Austin. Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes \\"in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements\\". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875. The company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds.The first of the four large-scale estates built by the Artizans Company was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering 42.5 acres (0.17 km2; 0.07 sq mi) built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on 76 acres (0.31 km2; 0.12 sq mi) of land to the west of London, adjacent to the newly opened Westbourne Park station, purchased from All Souls College, Oxford. A third London estate was planned at Cann Hall, and a site of 61 acres (0.25 km2; 0.10 sq mi) was purchased.However, the Queen's Park project... Answer:","completion":"The Artizans Company finally recovered from the mismanagement and fraud of Queen's Park in the late 1880s. The Queen's Park project, which began in 1874, was more ambitious than previous projects but it encountered various challenges, such as mismanagement, financial loss, and fraud, causing a significant negative impact on the company. The development failed to meet its financial goals, resulting in the company having to liquidate several of its assets. This consequently led to a period of instability and uncertainty. However, the Artizans Company managed to recover in the late 1880s, thanks to several strategic moves and changes in the company's leadership. During this period, the company refocused its efforts on new and more successful projects, adopted better financial management, and embraced a fresh strategic direction that enabled it to minimize risks and maximize profitability. The company's ability to adapt and overcome the setbacks faced during the Queen's Park project allowed it to regain its footing and continue its mission of providing affordable, high-quality housing for the working class."},{"prompt":"Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century.\\", answer the following question.

Summarize this article: Mr Duncan Smith, who quit days after the 2016 Budget, is urging the PM to postpone a plan to raise the income tax threshold to fund the move. In 2015, cuts to the Universal Credit \\"work allowance\\" were announced - reducing the amount people could earn before benefit payments were withdrawn. A government spokesperson said there were \\"no plans\\" to reverse the cuts. Universal Credit's single payment replaces six current benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). Mr Duncan Smith drove its introduction under the coalition government, although it was beset by delays, IT problems and an entire \\"reset\\" of the system, and was the subject of tensions between the Treasury and the DWP. He argues the cuts to work allowance cost people up to √Ç¬£1,000 as they move off benefits into work. Now a backbencher, he chairs the Centre for Social Justice which is making the call to reverse the cuts made by former chancellor George Osborne - who was sacked by Mrs May when she became prime minister in July. The CSJ is pointing to Mrs May's own words in her first speech as PM, in which she promised those who were \\"just managing\\" that \\"when it comes to taxes, we'll prioritise not the wealthy, but you\\". Mr Duncan Smith argued that higher earners would benefit most from raising the income tax threshold - something the government has pledged to do by 2020 - and said the money should be spent on those who were \\"just about managing\\" instead. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the former minister said: \\"One of the key elements as you cross into work, the work allowances, those were all reduced. The problem with that is it means it is more difficult to get people into work and keep them in work. \\"We want to get people into work, we want them to progress through work, but most importantly, we want to make sure work always pays.\\" He said raising the tax threshold for everyone would mean about 25p in every pound would end up with the lowest paid, while reversing the Universal Credit cuts was \\"a more direct way of delivering on Theresa May's statement, which was strong and powerful, to help those who try\\". The CSJ argues that √Ç¬£3.4bn cut from the Universal Credit budget by Mr Osborne would cost people up to √Ç¬£1,000 as they \\"transitioned\\" from Universal Credit into work, thereby undermining incentives to take a job and move off benefits. The government says Universal Credit work allowances have been simplified and people are getting extra help to move into work, as well as benefitting from increased tax allowances, childcare support and the National Living Wage. A spokesman for the DWP said: \\"There are no plans to revisit the work allowance changes announced in the budget last year. \\"Universal Credit is transforming lives with claimants moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system.\\" Mr Duncan Smith also defended his work at the DWP, following the new film by Ken Loach, 'I, Daniel Blake', which tells the story of a joiner in north east England on benefits. Mr Loach appeared on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, criticising the system that tells \\"the most vulnerable people\\" that their poverty \\"is their own fault.\\" Mr Duncan Smith said he had \\"high regard\\" for Mr Loach but added: \\"Whilst on the one level this was a human story, full of pathos and difficulties, I think is the film has taken the very worst of anything that can ever happen to anybody and said 'this is life how it is lived'. I don't believe that \\"Also, his portrayal of job centre staff was unfair. Yes, you will always get one of two, but the vast, vast, vast majority are there to work and help people. This idea that everybody is out to crunch you has really hurt a lot of job centre staff.\\"","completion":"Former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is demanding that UK Prime Minister Theresa May reverses cuts made to Universal Credit, a single-payment welfare system that began implementation under then-Prime Minister David Cameron. Introduced in order to encourage people to move from benefits back into work, the system sees six benefits disbursed in a single payment, including Jobseeker's Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance. Duncan Smith also argues that the cuts to work allowance cost people up to ¬£1,000 as they attempt to move off benefits into work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series .","completion":"The sentiment expressed in the given movie review sentence appears to be negative. To provide a detailed understanding of the negativity in the sentence, let's break down and analyze the key phrases and their impact on the overall sentiment. 1. \\"Generates little narrative momentum\\" - This phrase suggests that the film fails to build a strong, compelling story that keeps the audience engaged. By using the word \\"little,\\" the reviewer implies that the movie lacks a solid narrative structure, which is essential in creating an interesting and gripping cinematic experience. This phrase contributes to the negative sentiment of the statement. 2. \\"Invites unflattering comparisons\\" - The use of \\"unflattering comparisons\\" indicates that the movie doesn't stand up well when compared to others within its genre or context (in this case, other installments in the Ryan series). \\"Unflattering\\" can be understood as an undesirable or unfavorable attribute, hence contributing to the overall negative sentiment. 3. \\"Other installments in the Ryan series\\" - This phrase is crucial in the context of the review because it reveals that the movie is part of a series, and comparisons to previous or later installments are likely to be more meaningful and relevant for potential viewers. By stating that the film invites unfavorable comparisons to these other movies, the reviewer communicates that this particular installment might be weaker or less enjoyable than the others, which again, adds to the negative sentiment expressed in the statement. In conclusion, the sentiment of the given movie review sentence is negative as it highlights the film's shortcomings in terms of narrative momentum and its unfavorable standing when compared to other installments in the series. The reviewer uses phrases such as \\"little narrative momentum\\" and \\"unflattering comparisons\\" to convey their dissatisfaction and disappointment with the movie, which contributes to the overall negative tone of the sentence."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The song's use of Indian and free-form jazz influences, along with its impressionistic lyrics, were immediately influential on the emerging genre of psychedelic rock. Accordingly, some authors and music historians, including Eric V. D. Luft, Domenic Priore, and Dwight Rounds, have described \\"Eight Miles High\\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song. In his book Riot On Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in Hollywood, Priore cites \\"Eight Miles High\\" as being the record that kicked off the psychedelic craze, explaining \\"prior to 'Eight Miles High,' there were no pop records with incessant, hypnotic basslines juxtaposed by droning, trance-induced improvisational guitar.\\" The song was responsible for the naming of the musical subgenre raga rock, when journalist Sally Kempton, in her review of the single for The Village Voice, used the term to describe the record's experimental fusion of eastern and western music. However, although Kempton was the first person to use the term raga rock in print, she had actually borrowed the phrase from the promotional material that the Byrds' press office had supplied to accompany the \\"Eight Miles High\\" single release. In a 1968 interview for the Pop Chronicles radio documentary, McGuinn denied that the song was in fact an example of raga rock, while Crosby, speaking in 1998, dismissed the term entirely, stating \\"they kept trying to label us; every time we turned around, they came up with a new one ... it's a bunch of bullshit.\\" Nonetheless, the experimental nature of the song placed the Byrds firmly at the forefront of the burgeoning psychedelic movement, along with the Yardbirds, the Beatles, Donovan and the Rolling Stones, who were all exploring similar musical territory concurrently. Contemporary reviews for the single were mostly positive, with Billboard magazine describing the song as a \\"Big beat rhythm rocker with soft lyric ballad vocal and off-beat instrumental backing.\\" Record World magazine also praised the song, commenting \\"It's an eerie tune with lyrics bound to hypnotize. Will climb heights.\\" In the UK, Music Echo described the song as \\"wild and oriental but still beaty\\". The publication also suggested that with the release of \\"Eight Miles High\\" the Byrds had jumped ahead of the Beatles in terms of creativity, stating \\"[By] getting their single out now they've beaten the Beatles to the punch, for Paul [McCartney] admitted recently that the Liverpool foursome are working on a similar sound for their new album and single.\\" In recent years, Richie Unterberger, writing for the Allmusic website, has described \\"Eight Miles High\\" as \\"one of the greatest singles of the '60s.\\" In 1999, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, an honor reserved for \\"recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance that are at least 25 years old.\\" In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked \\"Eight Miles High\\" at number 151 on their list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and in March 2005, Q magazine placed the song at number 50 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.

He enjoys drinks at the inn and as he waits for night he is told of the rules for seeking work on whaling ships by Stubb (Harry Andrews). He is questioned, and after his answers are deemed satisfactory he is accepted by a group of seamen and he joins in drinking songs with them. During the storm, they spot the mysterious Captain Ahab (Gregory Peck) walking in the rainWhen his room and bed mate, a heavily tattooed Polynesian harpooner named Queequeg (Friedrich von Ledebur), returns very late and discovers Ishmael in the bed under the blankets, both men are alarmed, but the two quickly become close friends and decide to sail together on a whaling ship.The duo signs on with the Pequod, a whaling ship that is soon to leave port. Two owner partners make the hiring decisions and negotiate the compensation, which is a fraction of the profit from the voyage. They are suspicious of Queequeg but he shows his marksmanship with the harpoon and they gladly accept him at 1/300 fraction, where Ishmael only gets 1/600. The ships captain, Ahab, is nowhere to be seen; nevertheless, the owners speak of his solid reputation and legendary experience.On a church near the ships, townspeople and seamen gather for a Sunday service. The pastor, Father Mapple (Orson Welles) gives a sermon based on the story of Jonah and how after his earnest prayer he was saved from the great whale.The two pals encounter a man on the dock as they walk to board the Pequod, a man seeming either crazed or drunk (Royal Dano), and he makes a prophecy, that the day you smell land where there...

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn‚Äôt release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. Now, I have a new situation: There are two cities, Chien and Marisol, in France that are leaders in the amount of wine they export to the rest of the world. Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation. Answer this question please: Does Marisol have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Chien? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, Marisol has a lower chance of experiencing acid rain compared to Chien. The main reason for this difference is the source of power each city utilizes for generating electricity. Chien relies on coal to generate its electricity. Coal, as a fossil fuel, releases various pollutants when burned, including sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). When these pollutants combine with water vapor in the atmosphere, they form sulfuric and nitric acids, which will then fall back to the ground in the form of precipitation, leading to acid rain. Acid rain can have numerous damaging effects on the environment, including harming soil, waterways, vegetation, and aquatic life. It may also negatively impact human health and structures, such as buildings and monuments. On the other hand, Marisol uses nuclear power plants for electricity generation. Nuclear energy involves the process of nuclear fission, in which the nucleus of an atom, usually uranium, is split to release energy in the form of heat. This heat is then used to generate electricity without burning any fuel and consequently, do not release pollutants like SO2 and NOx which are the primary drivers of acid rain formation. Though it's true that nuclear energy relies on non-renewable materials and generates radioactive waste, when considering the risk of acid rain, Marisol's reliance on nuclear power makes it less prone to this environmental issue compared to Chien, which relies on coal. In the context of the ongoing debate on electricity generation methods, the citizens of Marisol would be voting on whether to continue using nuclear power, which does not cause acid rain or air pollution, but does pose other challenges, such as the potential risks associated with nuclear accidents and the management of radioactive waste. In conclusion, Marisol has a lower chance of acid rain compared to Chien due to its use of nuclear power for electricity generation, which does not release the pollutants responsible for acid rain formation like coal combustion does. However, it is worth noting that while nuclear energy has environmental advantages in this regard, it is not without its challenges and should be carefully considered in conjunction with other renewable and sustainable energy sources for a comprehensive approach to energy production."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

'Do you think so?' exclaimed Violet. 'I think carriages, especially late at night, make a most dismal dreary sound.' 'They remind me of an essay of Miss Talbot's where she speaks of her companions hastening home from the feast of empty shells,' said Theodora. 'Ay! those are your West-end carriages,' said Percy; 'I will allow them a dreary dissatisfied sound.

Article: (CNN) -- When Elizabeth Joice found out that she was pregnant, she and her husband, Max, were ecstatic. A fertility specialist had told her that this would never happen, Max says, because of the chemotherapy Elizabeth underwent to beat sarcoma in 2010. \\"It very much felt like a miracle,\\" he says. \\"Bringing a child into this world -- I mean, it wasn't just important for me; it was one of the most important things for Liz.\\" Then, one month into her pregnancy, Elizabeth's cancer returned, he says. Surgeons removed the tumors in her back, but she needed a full-body MRI scan to know whether the cancer had spread. Because an MRI's contrast dyes may damage a developing fetus, she faced a difficult decision. She could either terminate her pregnancy to undergo the scan or continue with the pregnancy without knowing her true cancer status. \\"We felt that if we terminated this pregnancy and did these scans, if it turned out that there was no evidence of this disease after the scans, then we would have possibly given up our only chance at having a child naturally and would have done it for nothing,\\" Max said. \\"It was a calculated risk. We knew there was a possibility of a worst-case scenario, but we also thought there was a good chance that we could have the baby.\\" Shortly after becoming pregnant, Elizabeth was introduced to filmmaker Christopher Henze. His upcoming documentary on pregnancy and motherhood will include the Joices' story. \\"It took about three minutes to realize that Liz was a stellar human being, and I wanted her for my movie,\\" Henze said. \\"I was impressed by the way she looked at cancer as another problem to be solved.\\" Even though a shielded chest X-ray taken in November found no sign of cancer, by January, she was having trouble breathing. Another X-ray revealed tumors in her lungs. Her C-section date was moved up, and on January 23 -- six weeks early -- Lily Joice was born. \\"It was incredibly difficult to want to enjoy this amazing moment as much as you possibly can,\\" Max said. \\"Yet to know that you're facing something so incredibly dire, and the chances didn't look good at that point.\\" After delivery, doctors found cancer in Elizabeth's heart, abdomen and pelvis. She died in the hospital on March 9. She was 36. \\"In the face of this life-threatening illness,\\" her husband said, \\"she was so optimistic and so strong and so willing to go through whatever fight she would have to go through in order to have this baby.\\" Henze delivered a eulogy at Elizabeth's funeral. \\"Lots of people say 'Liz was'; I say 'Liz is,' \\" Henze said. \\"Through her spirit and grace, she is still affecting people, and she will through the movie, will continue to impact people. Liz is.\\" CNN's Jennifer Bixler contributed to this report. ||||| Elizabeth Joice was only a few months pregnant when she received a devastating diagnosis, the cancer she thought had been eradicated years earlier had returned. Joice, 36, had already agreed to be a part of a documentary exploring each week of pregnancy called ‚Äú40 Weeks‚Äù when she received her diagnosis. Director Christopher Henze said that after Joice learned of her diagnosis she was faced with a choice either to abort the pregnancy or continue it with limited options on how to diagnose and treat the disease. Joice chose to continue her pregnancy and had her baby in January. But she died last month, six weeks after giving birth. Joice was initially declared cancer-free in 2010, but the chemotherapy had pushed her into early menopause. As a result, Henze said both Joice and her husband, Max Joice, were amazed when she became pregnant last year. Joice‚Äôs cancer, non-differentiated sarcoma, could be partially removed by operation. However, dyes used during scans could impact Joice‚Äôs pregnancy, so a full body scan was not done to see if there were other tumors. The Joices decided against more invasive scanning and treatment and hoped the cancer would not be virulent. ‚ÄúAround week 25 or 26, they went through the process of removing it and [she] seemed healthy. We felt as positive as we could be,‚Äù said Henze, who, with his crew, had been following Joice through pregnancy and cancer appointments. Joice appeared to love being pregnant even after she had to juggle morning sickness with cancer treatments, Henze said. ‚ÄúI would do this for living if I could,‚Äù Joice told Henze in an on-camera interview. \\"I really enjoy pregnancy a lot ... all the stuff that‚Äôs been happening has all been really cool stuff.\\" Towards the end of the pregnancy, there were signs that the cancer had returned, as Joice had trouble breathing, Henze said. A scan revealed a mass in her lungs, and doctors ordered that Joice deliver immediately. Joice‚Äôs daughter, Lily, was delivered by c-section in late January, six weeks early. Dr. Joanne Stone, the director for Maternal Fetal Medicine at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, treated Joice and said there were signs during the c-section to suggest the cancer had returned. \\"There were tons of tumor[s],\\" Stone said. \\"It had spread all over her abdomen.\\" Although Stone was worried about Joice's breathing, especially because of the mass in her lungs, she said the first thing Joice said when the breathing tube was removed was, \\"How‚Äôs Lily? How‚Äôs the baby?\\" \\"Her first thoughts were not 'Am I OK?,\\" said Stone. Further scans revealed Joice had tumors throughout her abdomen. Although she was put into treatment, the cancer advanced rapidly and she died March 9. When Joice first told Henze about the diagnosis, Henze said, he had hoped her story would be one of recovery and that she could have seen the documentary released. ‚ÄúHer spirit is really beautifully positive. She‚Äôs so open and thoughtful and considerate and honest,‚Äù Henze said. ‚ÄúAs a documentarian, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre always looking for. With Liz, it was not only getting her honest feeling. ... I was brought into her family.‚Äù Stone called Joice a \\"remarkable\\" person with a \\"sense of love and life.\\" Stone recalled visiting Joice after she was released from the ICU and was meeting her newborn for the first time. \\"She was holding the baby.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin‚Äîusually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines‚Äîa judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\"?","completion":"Question: According to the passage, what are the steps involved in the process of handling serious sins within the Jehovah's Witness congregation, and what are the various forms of discipline administered based on the offender's level of repentance and the seriousness of the sin? The passage outlines the manner in which the Jehovah's Witness congregation deals with serious sins committed by its baptized members, especially cases of sexual misconduct or apostasy, and the different forms of discipline that are applied based on the individual's level of repentance and the gravity of the offense. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin, a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help, and possibly administer discipline. There are different forms of discipline outlined in the passage, depending on the severity of the sin and the individual's level of repentance. 1. Disfellowshipping: This is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. It entails shunning the individual, with contact limited to direct family members living in the same home, congregation elders who may invite them to apply for reinstatement, and maintaining formal business dealings if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that this practice keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and may help the shunned individual realize the seriousness of their wrong and take steps to return to Jehovah. It also serves as a deterrent for other members from engaging in dissident behavior. 2. Disassociation: Members who formally resign are described as wicked in Watch Tower Society literature and are also shunned. Similar to disfellowshipped individuals, disassociated members can eventually be reinstated into the congregation if deemed repentant by the congregation elders who enforced the disfellowshipping or disassociation. 3.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The ice was not drifting fast enough to be noticeable, although by late November the speed was up to seven miles (11 km) a day. By 5 December, they had passed 68¬∞S, but the direction was turning slightly east of north. This was taking them to a position from which it would be difficult to reach Snow Hill Island, although Paulet Island, further north, remained a possibility. It was about 250 miles (400 km) away, and Shackleton was anxious to reduce the length of the lifeboat journey that would be necessary to reach it. Therefore, on 21 December he announced a second march, to begin on 23 December.Conditions, however, had not improved since the earlier attempt. Temperatures had risen and it was uncomfortably warm, with men sinking to their knees in soft snow as they struggled to haul the boats through the pressure ridges. On 27 December, carpenter Harry McNish rebelled and refused to work. He argued that Admiralty law had lapsed since Endurance's sinking, and that he was no longer under orders. Shackleton's firm remonstrance finally brought the carpenter to heel, but the incident was never forgotten. Two days later, with only seven and a half miles' (12 km) progress achieved in seven back-breaking days, Shackleton called a halt, observing: \\"It would take us over three hundred days to reach the land\\". The crew put up their tents and settled into what Shackleton called \\"Patience Camp\\", which would be their home for more than three months.Supplies were now running low. Hurley and Macklin were sent back to Ocean Camp to recover food that had been left there to lighten the sledging teams‚Äô burden. On 2 February 1916, Shackleton sent a larger party back, to recover the third lifeboat. Food shortages became acute as the weeks passed, and seal meat, which had added variety to their diet, now became a staple as Shackleton attempted to conserve the remaining packaged rations. In January, all but two teams of the dogs (whose overall numbers had been depleted by mishaps and illness in the preceding months) were shot on...

Movie title: Lemon Tree Context: Salma, a Palestinian widow - living there for decades - has to stand up against her new neighbor, the Israeli Defence Minister, when he moves into his new house opposite her lemon grove, on the green line border between Israel and the West Bank. The Israeli security forces are quick to declare that Salma's trees pose a threat to the Ministers safety and issue orders to uproot them. Together with Ziad Daud, a young Palestinian lawyer, Salma goes all the way to the Israeli Supreme Court to try and save her trees. Her struggle raises the interest of Mira Navon, the Defence Minister's wife, trapped in her new home and in an unhappy life. Despite their differences, and the borders between them, the two women develop an invisible bond, while forbidden ties grow stronger between Salma and Ziad. Salmas legal and personal journey lead her deep into the complex, dark and sometimes funny chaos of the ongoing struggle in the Middle East, in which all players find themselves alone in their struggle to survive.

Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations.

The techniques make farming possible in places where there is not enough water. Because of this, he won this year's World Food Prize. Hillel is using the techniques in his orchards near his home in Israel. Irrigating drop by drop -- called drip irrigation -- has changed agriculture by greatly reducing the amount of water needed. Farmers now rely on it in places from Spain, to Africa, to America. \\"We in California grow about 50 percent of the fruits and vegetables of the continental United States,\\" says Jan Hopmans from University of California at Davis. \\"And these drip irrigation techniques make it possible.\\" Hillel got his start in dry land farming in Israel's Negev Desert in the 1950s. \\"The key was making good use of water,\\" he says. \\"There's much land. Water is limited.\\" These farmers did not have the advantage of running irrigation water through channels to their crops. So Hillel and others gave plants just what they needed and just where they needed it. \\"The idea is to use water little by little,\\" Hillel says. It worked so well that Hillel was soon traveling around the world, showing others how to do it. Experts say drip irrigation's importance is growing, as climate change and rising population make water supplies become few in many parts of the world. \\"This is where water use, climate change and crop production all meet at one point,\\" Hillel says. \\"And this has been really the essence of my career.\\" A career whose importance can be measured drop by drop.

President Obama had that chance Sunday, assembling a virtual dream team of college and pro basketball players for a presidential pickup game in front of wounded veterans and participants in a White House mentoring program. Obama, who turned 49 on Wednesday, took to the court for a game with a stunning list of all-stars, including Grant Hill, Shane Battier, Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, Derek Fisher, LeBron James, Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson, Maya Moore, Alonzo Mourning, Chris Paul, Derrick Rose, Bill Russell, Etan Thomas, Dwyane Wade and David West. The game was closed to the media. Kobe Bryant was there but didn't play, according to the White House, and aides provided no details about the game, which took place at Fort McNair in the District, where Obama often plays basketball with friends. The presidential motorcade of black SUVs returned to the White House after about two hours for an evening barbecue on the South Lawn. Reporters could see grills being set up on the grass. The White House provided few details about the festivities but confirmed that the president and his guests would be dining on shrimp harvested from the Gulf of Mexico. Obama is known for throwing a few elbows on the court and for having a fierce determination to win. But the 6-foot-2 commander in chief had his work cut out for him. A number of the players were 6-8 or taller. Obama was the nation's bachelor in chief this weekend. His wife and younger daughter returned from a brief vacation in Spain in time for the barbecue, and his elder daughter was at camp. With his family away, Obama made it an all-sports-all-the-time weekend. He spent four hours at the Andrews Air Force Base golf course Saturday with longtime friends from Chicago and Hawaii, including Wahid Hamid, Laurent Delanney, Marvin Nicholson, Greg Orme, Bobby Titcomb, Michael Ramos, Marty Nesbitt and Eric Whitaker. That crew was said to be attending the barbecue Sunday at the White House, as well. No word on how many of them joined in the hoops competition. Basketball is undergoing a renaissance at the White House under Obama, who had a court built on what had been the presidential tennis courts. He plays with staff members and friends, including aide Reggie Love, who was on the NCAA-champion Duke team in 2001. But in June 2009, when the basketball court was being built, the president told Bloomberg News that he was itching for some professional competition. \\"As soon as we get the basketball nets up, we're going to have some of these guys over for a game,\\" he said of pros such as James. Asked by Bloomberg whether he would be playing, Obama said: \\"Of course. It's my court.\\" Staff writer Josh Barr contributed to this report. ||||| Obama tests basketball skills against LeBron James, Magic Johnson By Administrator - President Obama hosted more than a dozen current and former basketball pros for an afternoon game at Fort McNair Sunday.

The French have always wanted to know what it means to be a French¬≠man. Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes ‚Äî probably from eastern Europe ‚Äî came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comt√©, Alsace, and Bur¬≠gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar¬≠seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hy√®res, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyr√©n√©es, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger¬≠man¬≠ic tribes across the river ‚Äî the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons ‚Äî would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and N√Æmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established. Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d.

Definition: You're given a fill-in-the-blank question where the answer is PersonX. You need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to PersonY. This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"sympathetic\\" to \\"stern\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two i.e. the trigger word/phrase. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank.

Answer: PersonX Output:","completion":"Explanation: The task here requires us to slightly modify the provided question so that the answer changes from PersonX to PersonY, without altering the content significantly. We are essentially turning the focus of the narrative from PersonX to PersonY while keeping the narrative context, i.e. someone going to California to star in a movie, the same. We need to find a suitable 'trigger word' that can be replaced with its antonym so that the action accredited to PersonX would now be accredited to PersonY. Also, it has been instructed to ensure that the revised question should not comprise more than 30 words and less than 15 words, and should have at least 70% overlapping words with the initial question. Plus, PersonX and PersonY should maintain the same gender and should be utilized one time only in proper order with PersonX preceding PersonY. Let's solve the task: Initial question: PersonX said goodbye to PersonY, his best friend who was going to California to star in a movie, and _ was very sad. By changing the trigger word 'sad' to 'happy' and adjust the context accordingly to reflect the change in the narrative subject from PersonX to PersonY. Modified question: PersonX said goodbye to PersonY, his best friend who was going to California to star in a movie, and _ was very excited. Explanation: By switching the emotion from 'sad' to 'excited', the perspective shifts from PersonX to PersonY. Now the emphasis is on how PersonY feels about going to California to star in a movie, therefore answer changes from PersonX to PersonY.

Context: With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it‚Ä¶the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the ‚Äúwrath of the Internet‚Äù. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‚ÄòDealing With Disrespect‚Äô as something that can help put things in perspective. Question: What happened before the book Dealing With Disrespect was written? Answer: Answer:","completion":"Before the book Dealing With Disrespect was written, the author observed the growth of the Internet and how it enabled people to share various types of content.

An anti-government protest in Moscow turned violent Sunday, with some demonstrators clashing with police after they veered off their agreed-upon route. More than 250 people were arrested, including leading opposition figure Boris Nemtsov, leftist radical group leader Sergei Udaltsov and popular blogger Alexei Navalny, Moscow police told CNN. They were among the thousands that descended on the Russian capital for the latest demonstration denouncing Vladimir Putin, the nation's current prime minister who was recently elected to a six-year term as president. He is set to be inaugurated Monday. As they marched, many chanted slogans such as \\"Russia without Putin\\" and \\"Putin is a thief.\\" A large number of demonstrators did not follow the route to Bolotnaya Square that their leaders had agreed to with Moscow authorities, instead stopping in front of a line of police and refusing to move. Clashes broke out, with some protesters throwing various objects -- including sticks and at least one flare -- at police. Authorities responded by \\"clubbing demonstrators\\" who briefly broke through police lines, the state-run RIA-Novosti news agency reported. One of its correspondents saw \\"a male protester out cold after clashing with officers,\\" while another reported eight officers arresting one demonstrator \\"for the apparent crime of wearing a Guy Fawkes' mask,\\" the symbol of the vigilante hacking group Anonymous. Twenty officers were injured and three hospitalized in the clashes, according to RIA-Novosti, which added that those charged with assaulting police may face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Itar-Tass, another official news agency, said four officers suffered cuts and wounds after having stones and bottles thrown at them and reporters. Police denied that they used tear gas as had been reported, according to RIA-Novosti. After the arrests, authorities slowly moved forward and moved everyone out of the area. Many protesters expressed disappointment that the event was not peaceful, with some saying they were angry at those who they felt had provoked a confrontation with police. Others who faced off with authorities voiced frustration that previous peaceful rallies had done little to forward their political aims. In March, Putin won the country's presidential election with nearly 65% of the vote, claiming victory amid allegations by independent polling monitors of widespread electoral violations. International observers said there was legitimate uncertainty about the vote, with chess champion-turned opposition activist Garry Kasparov accusing Putin's supporters of \\"massive fraud.\\" Putin, the former KGB officer who has worked to both stabilize Russia's economy and curtail dissent, held the presidency for eight years before term limits forced him to step down in 2008. His election followed a series of anti-Kremlin protests in the wake of disputed parliamentary elections that took place in December.

Describing his political views, Zappa categorized himself as a \\"practical conservative\\". He favored limited government and low taxes; he also stated that he approved of national defense, social security, and other federal programs, but only if recipients of such programs are willing and able to pay for them. He favored capitalism, entrepreneurship, and independent business, stating that musicians could make more from owning their own businesses than from collecting royalties. He opposed communism, stating, \\"A system that doesn't allow ownership ... has‚Äîto put it mildly‚Äîa fatal design flaw.\\" He had always encouraged his fans to register to vote on album covers, and throughout 1988 he had registration booths at his concerts.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol. But I can use this background: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. What is an answer for this question: Who is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Ronaldo, who is a nutrition enthusiast and consumes a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol, is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to Jeff, who doesn't care about nutrition and consumes a diet with high amounts of fat and cholesterol. There are several reasons supporting this conclusion: 1. Caloric intake and overall energy balance: Consuming too many lipids can lead to a high caloric intake, given that lipids are very high in energy (9 calories per gram). If an individual consumes more energy than they spend through various activities, the excess energy can result in weight gain. Since Ronaldo is consuming a healthier diet with low amounts of fat and cholesterol, it is likely that his overall caloric intake is better balanced with his energy expenditure, given their similar physical activity levels. 2. Effects of dietary lipids on cardiovascular health: A high-fat diet, particularly one that is rich in saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol, can increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can contribute to an increased risk of developing health problems such as cardiovascular disease. Elevated levels of cholesterol are mainly responsible for narrowing arteries, which can further lead to atherosclerosis. By consuming a diet with lower levels of unhealthy fats, Ronaldo is reducing his risk for these health complications. 3. Quality of diet and bodily functions: A diet high in unhealthy lipids, like the one Jeff consumes, often lacks essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals required for optimal body functioning. On the other hand, Ronaldo's nutrition-focused diet likely includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods. A well-balanced diet supports healthy bodily functions, hormonal balance, and metabolism, which in turn, can influence body weight regulation. 4. Formation of healthy habits and lifestyle choices: By being mindful of his diet and focusing on nutrition, Ronaldo is more likely to develop healthy habits that can have a long-lasting impact on his overall health and weight. This may include regular exercise, practicing portion control, being mindful of food choices, and making informed decisions about what he consumes. Jeff's carelessness about his diet and preference for unhealthy lipids might indicate a lack of interest or discipline in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which can contribute to weight gain over time. In conclusion, considering their dietary choices and habits, Ronaldo is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to Jeff, due to his well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet, controlled caloric intake, and better overall lifestyle choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Review: Here's an excellent Barbara Stanwyck double bill on one disc. The first movie - and believe me the lesser of the two - is MGM's \\"To Please A Lady\\" (1950) in which she is paired with Clark Gable. It is essentially a star vehicle with Gable as usual dominating the film with his screen presence. Here he plays a macho racing driver who gets some bad press from feminist reporter Stanwyck and the battle of the sexes begins. Of course after much ado they eventually end up in each others arms and it all comes to a predictable and pleasing close. A bit of a fluff of a move really but Gable and Stanwyck - two icons of the Golden Age - make it watchable! But the real meat on this DVD is the second feature - a marvellous and quite unknown little thriller called JEOPARDY. Produced by MGM in 1953 this is a wonderful little gem of a movie that hasn't dated one iota! Here Stanwyck plays the wife of Barry Sullivan and mother to their young son Lee Aaker on vacation on a deserted and remote Mexican beach when suddenly tragedy strikes. A dilapidated wooden pier collapses trapping Sullivan under a heavy pylon and guess what? Yes,the tide is coming in. With not a soul in sight and unable to free him herself Stanwyck sets off by car for assistance. After driving some distance the only aid she can muster comes from an unscrupulous escaped convict (Ralph Meeker) who - in return for his help - wants more from her than money or a change of clothes (\\"I'll do anything to save my husband\\"). Does she or doesn't she??. Meeker runs away with the picture! He turns in quite a brilliant performance! Once he comes into the film you simply cannot take your eyes off him! An actor in the smouldering Brando style he surprisingly never made much of his career in films. Although he gave splendid performances as the unsavoury, disgraced cavalry officer in the outstanding Mann/Stewart western \\"Naked Spur\\" (1953) and as one of the doomed sacrificial french troopers in Stanley Kubrick's powerful WW1 drama \\"Paths Of Glory\\" (1957) his only real claim to fame was as Mike Hammer in Mickey Spillane's \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\" in 1955. His performance in \\"Jeopardy\\" should have done wonders for him but he had only a so-so career in films. He died in 1988. Because of this release \\"Jeopardy\\" can now proudly take its rightful place as a classic noir. A memorable, taut and exciting thriller thanks to fine performances, tight direction by John Sturges, the crisp Monochrome Cinematography of Victor Milner and an atmospheric score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Extras, however are no great shakes except for a radio version of \\"Jeopardy\\" and trailers for both movies. This disc is also part of a Barbara Stanwyck box set celebrating her centenary.

Paragraph: U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell arrived here on Tuesday night for meetings with fellow foreign ministers aimed at solidifying a second front, in Southeast Asia, in the campaign against global terrorism. But he has had to balance that goal with longstanding concerns about human rights abuses in the region. In meetings on Tuesday in Malaysia and Singapore before touching down in this oil-producing sultanate for two days of talks with members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, Powell said he repeatedly raised the issue. \\"We still believe strongly in human rights, and that everything we do has to be consistent with universal standards of human rights,\\" he said. But at a news conference in Singapore, Powell hinted that the Bush administration was ready to discuss resuming military cooperation with Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation and a sometimes reluctant partner in the efforts to crack down on militant Islamic groups. The United States cut virtually all military links with Indonesia in 1999 after its forces were implicated in the violence that swept East Timor after that territory voted for independence. On Thursday, Powell and representatives of the nations of the Asian group, including Indonesia, are expected to sign a declaration promising cooperation to prevent terrorism by sharing information, blocking funds, tightening borders and making it hard to use forged travel papers. \\"We recognized that terrorism is a global threat and that the disturbing acts of terrorism and transnational crimes, which continue to threaten world peace and stability, must be tackled by the international community,\\" the ministers said in a communique on Tuesday. Powell is among the representatives from 13 nations outside Southeast Asia, including China, Japan and Russia, that are taking part in the annual meeting of the group's regional forum. Terrorism dominates the agenda, though the possibility of a meeting here between Powell and his North Korean counterpart, Paek Nam Sun, has generated the most news. It would be the highest-level contact between the United States and North Korea since President Bush took office. Powell heads to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, late on Thursday before finishing a weeklong trip through the region in the Philippines on Saturday. He said that when he arrives in Jakarta, he will have \\"some ideas and some initiatives\\" to present to President Megawati Sukarnoputri. Indonesia is already receiving 400,000 in the current fiscal year for civilian training programs and is to receive a like amount next year; and the United States expects to provide an additional 16 million this year to train police officers in counterterrorism. At the same time, the Pentagon is reviewing how to allocate another 17 million in \\"counterterrorism fellowships,\\" some of which could go to Indonesia. But a senior State Department official also acknowledged that some in the administration and Congress are pushing for more direct military cooperation, which would require congressional approval. \\"I think they recognize the danger that we all face and I think they have been cooperating more fully with us as time goes by, and I'm quite sure that Mrs. Megawati is committed to this cause,\\" Powell said in Singapore. He met there with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who endorsed the idea of renewed military ties between the United States and Indonesia as an important step in stabilizing that country.

Question: How many times Irmgard Moller stabbed in the chest Title: The Baader Meinhof Complex Movie plot: The film begins on a nude beach in Germany in the late 1960s, where we are introduced to Ulrike Meinhoff, a respected journalist, and her family. Meinhoff and her husband are then guests at a party, where Meinhoff reads off a periodical that she wrote about the injustice of the Iranian Government. With the Shah of Persia arriving into Berlin, there is a rally in the streets, where half the people are protesting the injustice and the other half are praising. As the protesting goes on, the Iranian people end up going into the crowd and fighting the innocent German protesters with the help of the German Police; leaving many injured and a man killed. The next scene is of Meinhoff at a television studio arguing why she favors the protesters side instead of the Governments side, and watching the live recording on her television is Gudrun Ensslin, another activist. She explains to her parents how American Imperialism is completely corrupt while Meinhoff walks in on her husband having sex with another woman. Next, we are introduced to Andreas Baader, the ringleader of these revolutionaries who decide to name themselves The Red Army Faction (RAF). Their first major rebellious occurrence takes place in a department store, where they decide to set home made bombs and light it on fire. On a television broadcast we are informed of the many student protests at universities across America and of protests in West Germany, being led by Rudi Dutschke. The film then cuts to a famous rally where Dutschke announced his views on the protest and wars occurring around the world, trying to spark everyone to join their resistance. Rudi Dutschke is then almost assassinated by a man who is accused to be from the Springer Group, which is tied to the German Government. In effect, many activists go to the Springer Group headquarters and riot.

I like blue and white pieces the best---blue and white anything!Plates,jars,vases, cups, bowls---I love them all. Collecting items is like something you can't get enough of. You get one, and you want to have more. I find collecting to be a fun and inspirational hobby. In many ways, it's like a puzzle I'm never tired of solving. I look high and low for new pieces to add to my collection. I can often be found visiting Marshell's, looking over their inexpensive offerings. In fact, I found one of my favorite pieces there. I've mixed inexpensive pieces from Marshell's with more expensive finds. A lot of times, it's the piece I'm not looking for that falls into my lap; I find a way to make it part of my blue and white family. What I love about my collection is that when I get inspired, I can move them around the house, mix and match and make things look fresh and new. Ever since I was a little girl, blue has been my favorite color1. I think I got it from my aunt in Mexico. Some of my earliest memories are visiting her in Mexico and sitting on a chair in her kitchen, which had blue and white tiles from the floor to the ceiling.

Find the baby plants: Look at the big aloe plant and search for little plants growing beside it. These baby plants are called \\"pups.\\" 2. Get a small pot and soil: We need a small pot with drainage holes and some special soil called \\"cactus mix\\" or \\"succulent mix\\" to help the baby plant grow well. 3. Make the big plant sleepy: We need to give the big plant a nap by not watering it for about a week before taking out the baby plants. 4. Take out the baby plants: Carefully dig around the base of the baby plant with a spoon or your fingers. Gently wiggle it to loosen the roots and pull the baby plant out. 5. Put the baby plant in the new pot: Make a little hole in the special soil in the small pot. Put the baby plant's roots in the hole and cover it with the soil. Don't pack it in too tight; let the soil be a bit loose. 6. Wait before watering: The baby plant needs time to recover from its adventure. Wait for 2-3 days before giving it some water. 7. Water and sunshine: Give the baby aloe plant some water and place it in a spot where it gets bright but indirect light. Soon, it will grow and become a big aloe plant just like its parent!

Biology laboratories are equipped with the appropriate facilities and equipment needed for growing, culturing, and studying fungi in a controlled environment, ensuring that their growth, reproduction, and behavior can be monitored and documented safely and accurately. Option A, a cave, is not necessarily relevant to a university setting unless there is a specific research project or field study involving caves and the ecosystem within them. Option C, decaying matter, could potentially be found in compost heaps or in waste management areas within a university, but these would not be the primary areas for fungal study. Option D, mushroom hunting, may be an activity performed by mycology students or researchers, but it typically occurs outside of the university in woodlands or other natural environments. And option E, old cheese, while sure to contain fungus, is unlikely to be a primary source for fungal samples within a university setting.

Dissident or Protestant separatists were English Christians who separated from the English Church in the 16th , 17th and 18th centuries . English Dissenters or Protestant Separatists were English Christians who separated from the Church of England in the 16th , 17th and 18th centuries .","completion":"Yes, these two statements essentially convey the same information but with slightly different wording. Both statements refer to the same group of people: English Christians who chose to separate from the established Church of England during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. These individuals are collectively known as Dissenters or Protestant Separatists. To clarify the similarities and differences between the two statements, here is a detailed breakdown: Statement 1: - \\"Dissident or Protestant separatists\\": The term \\"dissident\\" is synonymous with \\"dissenter,\\" meaning someone who disagrees with the established norms or beliefs. In this context, it refers to people who objected to the teachings and practices of the Church of England. - \\"English Christians\\": This specifies that the dissenters were from England and followed the Christian faith. - \\"Separated from the English Church\\": This highlights the core element of their dissent -- separating from the established Church of England. - \\"16th, 17th, and 18th centuries\\": This time frame indicates when these dissenting movements occurred. Statement 2: - \\"English Dissenters or Protestant Separatists\\": This phrase mirrors the meaning of \\"dissident or Protestant separatists\\" from the first statement, referring to the same group of people who challenged the Church of England's doctrines and practices. - \\"English Christians\\": Like the first statement, this specifies that the dissenters were from England and followed the Christian faith. - \\"Separated from the Church of England\\": This phrase also emphasizes the act of separation, as in the first statement. - \\"16th, 17th, and 18th centuries\\": The time frame is identical, indicating the same period of dissent and separation from the Church. In summary, both statements mean the same, describing English Christians who separated from the Church of England (also known as the 'English Church') in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries and labeling them as either Dissidents, Dissenters or Protestant Separatists. The minor difference between the phrasing used ('Dissident' vs 'English Dissenter') does not change the overall meaning of the statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it‚Äôs common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don‚Äôt wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C‚Äôest la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27‚Ç¨ compared to 12‚Ç¨ for adults and 10‚Ç¨ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5‚Ç¨.

Catwoman is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. Created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, the character made her debut as \\"the Cat\\" in Batman #1 (June 1940). Catwoman, whose real name is Selina Kyle, has been Batman's most enduring love interest and is known for her complex love-hate relationship with him. As a Gotham City burglar, Catwoman typically wears a tight, one-piece outfit and uses a bullwhip for a weapon. In 2011, DC Comics relaunched all titles, deemed the New 52, which rebooted the DC Universe continuity. Catwoman's monthly title now focused on Selina's earlier days as Catwoman, but not her origins. The series begins with Selina frantically escaping from unknown masked men who are invading her apartment. After flitting from rooftop to rooftop, Selina looks back just in time to see her apartment blown apart by explosives. She turns to her informant, Lola, who often supplies Catwoman with information and various jobs. In this instance, Lola tips Selina off to an unoccupied penthouse where Selina can lay low for a few weeks, as well as a job stealing a painting from Russian mobsters. For this job, Selina infiltrates a Russian club by posing as the bartender. There, she recognizes a man who murdered a friend of hers, and she takes her revenge. Once her cover is blown, Selina dons her Catwoman outfit and fights her way out of the club. It is revealed through Selina's inner monologue that she and Batman are lovers, and the premiere issue ends with the first sex scene between the two. Her revised origin in Catwoman #0 draws from Batman Returns. Catwoman is later confronted by Steve Trevor, who offers her a spot on Amanda Waller's new Justice League of America. Selina initially refuses, but accepts the offer after Trevor promises to help her track down a woman who has apparently been posing as Selina. It is later revealed that Catwoman was chosen specifically to take down Batman should the JLA ever need to defeat the original Justice League. The teams eventually come into conflict in the publisher's \\"Trinity War\\" crossover. In the Earth-Two continuity, Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne are married, and their daughter, Helena Wayne, is that universe's Robin. In this universe, either Selina has reformed or was never a supervillain in the first place. It is revealed in issue #0 of Worlds' Finest that this Selina was killed while trying to stop what she believed was a human trafficking ring. What is the New 52?","completion":"The New 52 is a major relaunch and revamp of the entire line of DC Comics superhero comic books, which began in September 2011. This initiative was aimed at attracting new readers to the world of DC Comics by providing a fresh start to their characters' storylines. The New 52 involved the cancellation of all existing titles and the introduction of 52 new series, featuring updated versions of popular characters like Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and The Flash, as well as titles featuring lesser-known or new characters. In the New 52 continuity, the history of the DC Universe was altered, and characters' backstories and relationships were reimagined. This universe-wide reboot aimed to streamline and modernize the stories while preserving some iconic elements. However, it received mixed reactions from both fans and critics. Some appreciated the revitalization of certain characters and story arcs, while others were unhappy with the changes made to beloved heroes and the loss of decades of comic book history. The New 52 not only impacted well-known characters like Batman and Catwoman, as mentioned in your information, but also extended its influence to lesser-known characters and teams. It provided an entry point for new readers who were not familiar with the extensive and intricate history of the characters, making the comics more accessible to a wider audience. In 2016, DC Comics launched another initiative called \\"DC Rebirth,\\" which sought to address the criticisms of the New 52 and restore some of the legacy and history that had been lost during the reboot. As a result, the New 52 continuity was merged with elements from the previous continuity, creating a more coherent and balanced universe for the characters and their stories."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The place was dead; most people coming in were ordering to-go. Our waitress was meek and soft spoken, but she was on point for refills. My husband and brother-in-law guzzled down at least 4 cokes a piece. I took advantage of the Yelp check in offer and got 12 garlic knots for free! They came out after 10 minutes and were promptly demolished. The knots were served up hot and loaded with garlic and parmesan cheese. We all ordered from the \\"specials\\" menu. I ordered a slice of cheese pizza with a side of garlic knots (3.99). It was 0.50 extra to add mushrooms. My husband got the same special but with pepperoni.

A:","completion":"The last step of the process is the formation and dispersion of new spores, which ensures the continuation of the mold's life cycle and potential colonization of new environments. This can be further elaborated as follows: 1. Formation of sporangia: At the tips of the sporangiophores, reproductive structures called sporangia begin to develop. These structures, which can come in various shapes such as spheres, ovals, or capsules, are responsible for housing the mold's spores. The sporangia are filled with a large number of spores, which are small, reproductive cells that serve as the \\"seeds\\" for new mold colonies. 2. Spore maturation: Within the sporangium, the spores undergo maturation, a process in which they become structurally stable and more resistant to environmental factors such as temperature fluctuations, desiccation, and radiation. The mold produces spore walls made of chitin and other polymers, which help protect the genetic material inside the spores and increase their odds of survival during dissemination. In addition, some mold species produce pigments to shield their spores from ultraviolet radiation. 3. Sporangium dehiscence and spore release: Once the spores are mature and ready for dispersal, the sporangium wall ruptures through a process known as dehiscence. This exposes the spores to the external environment and allows them to be released into the air. Various factors can trigger sporangium dehiscence, including mechanical forces (e.g., wind, rain, or contact with other organisms) and changes in environmental conditions (e.g., humidity and temperature fluctuations). 4. Spore dissemination: Upon release from the sporangia, the spores become airborne and drift away from their parent colony. Mold spores are extremely lightweight and easily carried by air currents, enabling them to travel vast distances. Throughout their journey, they may encounter various obstacles such as physical barriers and predators (e.g., bacteria, mites, and insects). However, their small size and robust structure enable a portion of them to survive and reach new, suitable substrates where they can germinate and establish new colonies. 5. Germination and the initiation of a new life cycle: When a mold spore eventually lands on a suitable substrate, it absorbs water and nutrients and starts to germinate. This involves the growth of hyphae, which are thread-like structures that extend into the substrate and begin to break down organic matter to obtain nutrients for the developing mold. Over time, the new colony will expand by producing more hyphae and gaining nutrients from its environment. Eventually, the new colony will also start producing sporangiophores to produce and disperse new spores, thus completing the life cycle and perpetuating the propagation of the mold species."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Megan craved romance. 2). Patricia craved romance.","completion":"Megan wanted to make an action movie but Patricia did not because Patricia craved romance. In this scenario, Megan is enthusiastic about creating an action movie, most likely for a project, personal enjoyment, or even as part of their career aspirations. Action movies generally fall under the genre of action and adventure, typically featuring adrenaline-fueled scenes, suspenseful storylines, and engaging battles or feats of strength. These movies tend to resonate with audiences who enjoy high-stake chases, impressive displays of physical ability, and overcoming impossible odds. Megan seemingly finds excitement and appeal in these elements and wishes to bring these ideas to life in her film project. On the other hand, Patricia is opposed to the idea of making an action movie. The reason stated is that she craves romance. It implies that Patricia has a penchant for romance-themed movies. Films of this genre tend to focus on the relationships and emotional connections between characters. The plot may revolve around growing love, overcoming obstacles to be together, or other situations that evoke strong emotional responses from the audience. Patricia would rather create a film that allows its viewers to connect with the characters and their emotional journeys on a deeper level, delving into themes of love, mutual understanding, and compassion. This contrast in preference between Megan and Patricia could lead to several possible outcomes. They might decide to go their separate ways and create two separate movies that cater to their individual interests. Alternatively, Megan and Patricia could engage in a discussion about both of their ideas and potentially find a way to incorporate aspects of action and romance into a single film, as seen in many successful hybrid-genre movies. This would require collaboration, compromise, and respecting each other's creative vision. Another possibility is that they decide to partake in multiple projects, each working together on the other's preferred genre in turn. Regardless of the solution they choose, the difference in their preferences does not mean one is superior or more valid than the other. Both action and romance movies have their audience, and people's tastes vary significantly. It is essential to appreciate and acknowledge the diversity of themes, stories, and genres within the film industry and celebrate the creative minds that bring them to life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\"It will also improve visibility over much of the country, particularly the scenic vistas in national parks such the Grand Canyon.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The Grand Canyon will see an improvement in visibility thanks to it.\\"?","completion":"If the premise that \\"It will also improve visibility over much of the country, particularly the scenic vistas in national parks such as the Grand Canyon\\" is true, then it logically entails the hypothesis \\"The Grand Canyon will see an improvement in visibility thanks to it.\\" To understand this better, let's break down the premise and see why it leads to the hypothesis. Firstly, the premise states that \\"it will also improve visibility over much of the country.\\" This statement tells us that an action, policy, or event under discussion (represented by \\"it\\") will have a positive impact on visibility across a significant part of the country. The extent of this impact is not explicitly quantified, but it is implied that it would be widespread and noticeable. Secondly, the premise becomes more specific by pointing out that \\"the scenic vistas in national parks such as the Grand Canyon\\" would particularly benefit from the improvement in visibility. This part of the premise not only narrows down the focus on certain specific areas with scenic vistas but also explicitly includes the Grand Canyon as one of the examples where this improvement would be seen. Now turning our attention to the hypothesis \\"The Grand Canyon will see an improvement in visibility thanks to it,\\" we can clearly see that it is a logical consequence of the premise given. The premise's statement that visibility will improve in the country, particularly in national parks such as the Grand Canyon, leads us to deduce that the Grand Canyon's visibility will indeed improve because of the said action, policy, or event (represented by \\"it\\"). Since the premise directly identifies the Grand Canyon as an area that would benefit from the visibility improvement, it supports the hypothesis. Therefore, if the premise is true, it logically entails that the visibility at the Grand Canyon will improve due to the action, policy, or event under discussion. As a result, the hypothesis can be regarded as a valid conclusion derived from the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Many students have already registered for the cut price offer on botox. Students at the University of Central Lancashire have been offered Botox and other facial enhancements at discount prices as part of the institution's new master's programme in medicine. Feminist campaigners in the student body are outraged by the offer, claiming that the university has failed its duty of care and is promoting unhealthy ideas of beauty and aging among young people at a vulnerable age,. Registered students are now able to book appointments for Botox and fillers, lip enhancers, facial peels and laser treatments, all conducted by healthcare professionals who are studying for an MSc at the university, the Huffington Post reports. The service is offered as part of the university's MSc/PGDip in Non-Surgical Facial Aesthetics for Registered Healthcare Professionals. The graduate programme offers a part-time qualification in facial cosmetic enhancements for healtcare professionals wishing to branch out into the a booming industry. A spokesman from the university said: 'Over recent years, the provision of non-surgical facial aesthetic treatments has emerged as a key growth area within healthcare delivery in the United Kingdom. 'UCLan's MSc/PgDip Facial Aesthetics programme is designed to ensure that practising clinicians, be they doctors or dentists, are recognised to be the leading evidence-based practitioners in their field.' The saddest thing about the situation is the revelation from the Dental Clinic, where the procedures will take place, who claimed that a number of students have registered their interest. Heather Lomax, a UCLan student and member of the UCLan Feminist society has spoken of her outrage at learning of the university's offer. She told the Huffington Post's Faye Grima: 'UCLan is a university, and should be offering education and supporting the health and needs of students, not offering Botox, which certainly has its risks. The very idea of it, of students feeling the need to beat the (perfectly natural) aging process, to have perfect skin, makes me feel sick.' The University of Central Lancashire introduced the course to meet demands in a growing industry. Ed Farthing, a third-year English studies student also expressed his disgust with the recent proposals. He said: 'Botox and similar treatments epitomise the ever-growing modern day fanaticism with the \\"perfect self\\" image, and often enough force users into a never-ending life of constant addictive usage.'

Read this fact: \\"precipitation is when water falls from the sky\\" Now answer this question: \\"Needing to use an umbrella could be the result of\\"","completion":"The need to use an umbrella is primarily a result of various weather conditions, the main one being precipitation, which is when water falls from the sky. When the atmospheric conditions are just suitable enough, it condenses the water vapors to form water droplets, which combine and fall down as precipitation, taking forms such as rain, snow, sleet or hail. The use of an umbrella becomes necessary and most common during instances of rainfall, which is the most frequent and familiar form of precipitation across the world. The main function of an umbrella, with its waterproof material and dome shape, is to shield you from the rain and keep you dry. As the droplets fall from the sky, the umbrella acts like a protective barrier between you and the water. Thus, if the sky is overcast and there is a prediction of rain, it is safe to carry an umbrella while going out. Additionally, aside from rainfall, there are other types weather conditions which might necessitate the use of an umbrella. These include snowfall and sleet. In colder regions, the atmospheric water vapors often freeze and form snowflakes, which fall down as snow. Similarly, sleet is a mixture of rain and snow. In these situations, an umbrella can protect you from getting wet and cold. In some regions, particularly in tropical climates, people also use umbrellas as a shield against the blazing sun. In such cases, the umbrella serves to provide shade and reduce exposure to the UV radiation from the sun. Moreover, the need for an umbrella could also arise from geographical factors if you live in an area with a high incidence of rainfall such as coastal regions or areas near large water bodies. In certain regions with high humidity levels, due to topographical and climatic factors, the rate of precipitation could be high throughout the year, making umbrellas a daily necessity. Hence, in conclusion, the need to use an umbrella could be due to several factors, but it‚Äôs mainly a result of precipitation, which is when water falls from the sky in the form of rain, sleet, or snow. By providing an effective means of protection against these elements, umbrellas enable us to carry out our daily tasks in spite of unfavorable weather conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To be well disciplined is to have learned to live in accordance with the sensible rules and regulations that society has set up for the behavior of its members. Unless the child learns from each disciplinary situation how better to govern his conduct, effective discipline has not been developed. Parents must accept for themselves the idea that successful discipline results in learning. When they approach situations in which a child must adapt themselves to demands made upon them as learning situations, many problems usually thought of in connection with discipline disappear. Unfortunately, the word discipline has come to have other less constructive meanings. Far too often discipline is thought of as punishment. To many people, to discipline a child means to spank him or use some other method of punishment. Such people consider discipline a way of either keeping a child from doing something or of forcing him to do something. It is the task of parents to build within themselves and within the children with whom they live this capacity for self-direction, based upon an understanding of what is required of individuals in a democratic society. This means learning to act in those ways known to be necessary for the \\"good life\\", not for one's self alone but also for others. Developing the capacity for self-discipline in a child is a long, slow process. Much patience is required on the part of the parents. During this development, it is important that the child's self- confidence and comfortable acceptance of himself should never be sacrificed in a disciplinary battle; instead it should be increased through the ways in which his parents meet disciplinary situations. Many parents show a good deal of impatience if the little child does not rapidly learn how to keep clean, eat well, be orderly, and do what he is told. They are so eager for him to achieve these things that they seem to try to push him rapidly through his baby period. They seem also to think that learning to do these things...

Take pictures One of the great things about taking pictures at an event or a party is that it gives you an excuse to get in touch with the person later. Everybody loves seeing pictures of themselves, and it's very easy after taking a picture to say \\"If you'd like I can email it to you\\". This can be the seed that leads to new connections. 2. Eat alone in public You might feel self-conscious eating by yourself but it has an important benefit: you are much easier to approach when you are alone. People may be afraid of disturbing you or being rude if you talk with someone else. Bring a book or newspaper to read. Plus, having an interesting book with you will give others an excuse tostart a conversation if they've read it. 3. Join a class, sports team, or club Yoga, salsa dancing, volleyball, Toastmasters (a public speaking club), a class for work, etc. Choose a new hobby or continue an old one! These are all great places to meet new people, primarily because you will be made to see the same people over and over again in the class. You will automatically make friends with them if you have a common interest and are made to see each other again. Question: The writer wants to tell you _ .

Vice Admiral Simon Lister says the Navy is overly reliant on civilians to repair its craft, which are then left limping back to port for repairs. A serving Admiral has launched a scathing attack on the state of the Royal Navy, claiming it has been reduced to a collection of broken-down ships and ageing submarines whose crews are demoralised and poorly trained. In an extremely unusual move for such a high-ranking officer, Vice Admiral Simon Lister blamed Government spending cuts for undermining the Navy‚Äôs ability to carry out its duties. Admiral Lister complained that:. Admiral Lister, who joined the Navy in 1978, is a nuclear and engineering expert. Writing in a military journal, he said: ‚ÄòThe price of unrelenting operational tempo is unsustainable pressure on engineers as every opportunity for maintenance is squeezed out of busy programmes. ‚ÄòFor example, the lack of operators trained to stream and recover Type 23 towed sonar. ‚ÄòOverall material readiness continues to decline. From the submarine perspective, the numbers of force elements at readiness have been driven low by late delivery of Astute [a new model of submarine] and platform ageing. ‚ÄòSupport is increasingly over-reliant on [civilians] for repair. This philosophy builds in declining competence and confidence.‚Äô Admiral Lister cited the submarine HMS Trenchant, which was due to be retired in 2011, yet completed a 333-day deployment ‚Äì the longest-ever by a British nuclear vessel ‚Äì over 2012-13. HMS Dauntless, a ¬£1bn destroyer, was forced to abandon exercises in February after suffering a loss of power. A number of vessels have also had to be towed back to Britain after malfunctioning at sea. In February, HMS Dauntless, a destroyer, was forced to abandon exercises and seek emergency repairs after losing power. The 8,000-ton ship, which cost more than ¬£1 billion to build, suffered a similar problem off Senegal in 2012, as did her sister ship HMS Daring in 2009 and 2012. Engineers were unable to fix the faults and the ships had to limp to the nearest port. In his report, published in The Naval Engineer, Admiral Lister also criticised a ‚Äòchurn and outflow‚Äô of staff, which was coupled with ‚Äòreduced training investment and increasing transfer of engineering responsibility to [civilians].‚Äô The MoD said: ‚ÄòThe Admiral is merely pointing out the obvious facts given the shortage of engineers across the maritime industry. 'It is a challenge to recruit and retain these skilled personnel.

Stating that the navy is over-reliant on civilian support for repair work, he points out that this has led to decreasing competence and confidence amongst naval forces. Additionally, Admiral Lister highlights the prolonged usage of ageing submarines due to delays in the delivery of newer models, which has contributed to the declining material readiness of vessels. He also expresses concern about the reduction in training investment and the subsequent transfer of engineering responsibilities to civilians, which has further exacerbated demoralization and poor training among crew members. The MoD acknowledges these issues, attributing the problems to the shortage of engineers in the maritime industry and the challenge of retaining skilled personnel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Set in the Stone Age, Ishbo is the younger son of Mookoo, the leader of a tribe of cavemen. Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart. Much to his dismay, immediately after he finally expresses his love to her she is \\"clubbed\\" by Thudnik (and all that follows in the tradition of caveman stereotypes), and eventually married to him. Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life. After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman. He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Babies who watch TV are more likely to show late learning development and language at 14 months, especially if they are watching programs aimed at adults and older children, according to a new study, which would probably surprise those parents who leave their babies in front of a TV set. Babies who watched 60 minutes of TV daily had developmental scores a third lower at 14 months than babies who were watching less TV. Although their developmental scores were still in the normal range, the difference may have been due to the fact that when children and parents are watching TV, they are missing the talking, playing and other communications that are important to learning and development. This new study, which appeared in the Aechives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, followed 259 lower-income families in New York, most of whom spoke Spanish as their primary language at home. Other studies of higher-income families have also come to the same conclusion: TV watching is not only non-educational, but it seems to slow down babies' development. But what about \\"good\\" TV, like Sesame Street? The researchers didn't find any difference when compared to non-educational programs designed for small children, like Spongebob SquarePants. Earlier research by some of the same scientists, most of whom are at New York University School of Medicine's Bellevue Hospital Centre, has found that parents whose children watch non-educational TV programs like Spongebob SquarePants spend less time reading to their children or teaching them. At this point, parents reading this will probably be astonished. TV is so often a parent's good friend, keeping children happily occupied so that the adults can cook dinner, answer the phone, or take a shower. But, clearly, this electronic babysitter is not an educational aid. It is best to make sure the babies are fast asleep if you have to watch TV. Question: We can infer from the passage that _ .

Answer the above question based on the context below: At the age of seventeen Lancaster passed his final school examinations and gained entrance to Lincoln College, Oxford, to study history. He persuaded his mother to allow him to leave Charterhouse at once, giving him several months between school and university, during which he enrolled on a course of life classes at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London. In October 1926 he started at Oxford. There, as at Charterhouse, he found two camps in which some students chose to group themselves: the \\"hearties\\" presented themselves as aggressively heterosexual and anti-intellectual; the \\"aesthetes\\" had a largely homosexual membership. Lancaster followed his elder contemporary Kenneth Clark in being contentedly heterosexual but nonetheless one of the aesthetes, and he was accepted as a leading member of their set. He cultivated the image of an Edwardian dandy, with large moustache, a monocle and check suits, modelling his persona to a considerable degree on Beerbohm, whom he admired greatly. He also absorbed some characteristics of the Oxford don Maurice Bowra; Lancaster's friend James Lees-Milne commented, \\"Bowra's influence over Osbert was marked, to the extent that he adopted the guru's booming voice, explosive emphasis of certain words and phrases, and habit in conversation of regaling his audiences with rehearsed witticisms and gossip.\\" Lancaster's undergraduate set included Stephen Spender, Randolph Churchill, and most importantly John Betjeman, who became a close friend and lifelong influence.Lancaster tried rowing with the Oxford University Boat Club, but quickly discovered that he was no more suited to that than he had been to field games at school. He joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), acted in supporting roles, designed programme covers, wrote, and choreographed. He contributed prose and drawings to Isis and Cherwell magazines, engaged in student pranks, staged an exhibition of his pictures, attended life classes, and became established as a major figure in the Oxonian social scene.

Please answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who abandoned a romance due to someone's father? Answer the above question based on the context below: From her Parkville jail cell, Vergie Winters watches the funeral procession of Senator John Shadwell and remembers her twenty-year past with him: The moment young lawyer John returns to Parkville from an extended honeymoon with his social climbing wife Laura, he visits Vergie, his former lover. After a passionate embrace, John explains to the youthful milliner that he had abandoned their romance because Vergie's father had told him that she was pregnant by laborer Hugo McQueen and would be forced to marry. Vergie then tells John that, to keep her from marrying John, Laura's father had paid her father 10,000 to tell him that devastating lie. Still deeply in love, John and Vergie continue to see each other, but when John starts to campaign for Congress, Preston, a political boss, informs Vergie that, if John is to receive his vital support, she must forego their affair. Although Vergie agrees to Preston's terms, John refuses to end the relationship and spends a long evening with her before the election. After a victorious win, John moves to Washington, D.C. with Laura, Vergie bears his child under an assumed name. John then adopts the baby, named Joan, whom he claims is the child of a destitute family friend. At the start of World War I, John returns to Parkville and once again resumes his affair with Vergie. When one of John's late night rendezvous is witnessed by a town gossip and reported to Mike Davey, John's only political enemy, Vergie's successful millinery shop is boycotted, and she is shunned by all but the local prostitutes. In addition, Davey hires Preston's son Barry to steal from Preston's home safe a page from a hotel register on which Vergie had written her assumed name. As Barry is breaking into his father's safe, however, Preston mistakes him for a burglar and kills him, but tells his butler that a burglar shot his son.

Q: Article: The small coastal town of Broome, in northwest Australia, is a remote village in the vast countryside. There are no traffic jams and hardly any roads. There is only the massive Australian wild land, where some houses are 500 miles apart and some driveways are 50 miles long. There seem to be only two main sources of entertainment out here: the sunset at the beach and Sun Pictures. Sun Pictures is a very different movie theater:The seats are park benches and deck chairs, but you're also welcome to sit on the grass. It is the world's oldest outdoor movie garden. Sun Pictures was built in 1916 on the other side of the globe from Hollywood. All the big films were shipped here and the lonely country was amazed. Broome resident Pearl Hamaguchi has never traveled far from home. But in the Sun Pictures chairs, under the deep blue night sky, she has been almost everywhere. \\"And we came back excited about Gregory Peck,\\" she recalled. This is one of the few places left in the world where you can see two sets of stars at the same time-----one set in the sky, the other in the film. Each night, dozens of people from around the world line up at the old wooden stand, with no computer in sight, and buy their tickets to the latest films. Sun Pictures is also a museum, exhibiting projectors that date back to the silent films, a portrait gallery of the famous people who never knew about this place---- even though they came here all the time. Every once in a while, I'm told, you might find a non-ticket holder in your seat. That's why it's always a good idea to shake out your chair to make sure there are no spiders or scorpions. \\"We've only had a couple of scorpion incidents but no one's been stung yet,\\" said Aaron Mestemaker, a tourist visiting from Michigan. Sun Pictures is a holy hall of movie history and a reminder that air conditioning and carpet are no match for grass and fresh air---even when the lizards steal the scene.

Premise: Down Calle Cuba, between Sol and Luz, stands the 17th century Convento de Santa Clara, an expansive complex that takes up several blocks. Hypothesis: Convento de Santa Clara housed nuns for decades. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"The hypothesis that Convento de Santa Clara housed nuns for decades is not directly entailed by the given premise, although it is plausible based on the context provided. The premise states the location and age of the Convento de Santa Clara, but it does not offer specific information about its history, purpose, or inhabitants. However, the name \\"Convento de Santa Clara\\" suggests that it may be associated with the religious order of Santa Clara or the Poor Clares, who are nuns. To determine whether the hypothesis is valid, more information needs to be gathered about the history and the purpose of this specific convent. It is reasonable to assume that the Convento de Santa Clara may have housed nuns, given its name and the fact that convents have traditionally housed religious communities of women. However, without further evidence or context, it would be inappropriate to claim that the hypothesis is directly entailed by the premise. A more thorough investigation of the Convento de Santa Clara's history could clarify its primary function and whether or not it housed nuns for extended periods. If historical records or other sources demonstrated that this convent indeed served as a residence for nuns, then the hypothesis would be more likely to be entailed by the premise.

Calne is a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association and he is an Honorary Vice-President of the Cambridge University Lawn Tennis Club . - The endocrine system is the collection of glands of an organism that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system to be carried towards distant target organs. The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen. - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling). - An anesthesiologist (American English) or anaesthetist (British English) is a physician trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine. - The pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is also known as mixed gland. - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing). - Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with some or all of a healthy liver from another person (allograft). The most commonly used technique is phototropic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and liver tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match. - A cadaver, also called corpse (singular) in medical, literary, and legal usage, or when intended for dissection, is a deceased body. The obsolete British term \\"lich\\" for \\"corpse\\", sometimes spelled \\"lych\\", is no longer even listed in major British dictionaries such as Longman, Macmillan, Cambridge, or Oxford Online Dictionaries. However, the term \\"lich\\" has been revived in modern fantasy fiction for a type of \\"undead\\" creature. - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\" \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\" \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives. - Pancreatic juice is a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase. The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living. - Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, \\"hormones\\", directly into the blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs. Local chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include autocrines, which act on the cells that secrete them, and paracrines, which act on a different cell type nearby.

By counting the money, he can determine the exact amount he now has in his possession. This information might be important to him for planning how to use the stolen funds, as well as potentially helping him avoid suspicions from his parents if he decides to return some or all of the money later on.

What majors are they looking for?","completion":"While the two questions are similar in structure and topic, they have different meanings because they pertain to two separate companies: Resource America and Lightstream Resources. Both questions aim to identify the universities and specific majors that each company recruits new graduates from, but the answers will vary depending on each organization's recruitment preferences and strategies. 1. What universities does Resource America recruit new grads from? What majors are they looking for? Resource America is a company that could have its preferences for recruitment depending on its industry, geographical location, and university partnerships. To find the specific universities that Resource America recruits new graduates from, you can explore their career website, visit their social media profiles, or attend one of their recruitment events to get firsthand information. As for the majors they are looking for, it would depend on the company's business areas, roles they have open, and the skillsets they require for their projects. They may seek students with business, economics, engineering, or other technology-related backgrounds. However, you'll need to investigate the company's job postings and career information to accurately determine the majors they target during their recruitment process. 2. What universities does Lightstream Resources recruit new grads from? What majors are they looking for?

Concerning the majors they look for, this will vary based on the company's primary focus, job openings, and required skills. Lightstream Resources may target students from fields like engineering, geology, environmental science, or information technology, among others. To discern the precise majors the company is interested in recruiting, look into their job postings and career-related information provided on their website. In summary, while the questions have similar frameworks and purposes, they focus on different companies with distinct recruitment approaches and preferences based on their unique business needs.

Anita McCambridge.","completion":"Title: \\"The Rise of the Bulldogs\\" Genre: Sports Drama/Comedy Plot Summary: The unexpected passing of her estranged father leaves Anita McCambridge, a ruthless Wall Street executive, as the sole owner of a struggling ice hockey team, the Syracuse Bulldogs. Situated in a blue-collar town, the Bulldogs are known for their tough, no-nonsense gameplay and their loyal, devoted fanbase. As Anita is faced with the prospect of taking on this inherited responsibility, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery, finding her passion, and eventually learning that sports has the power to overcome personal differences and unite a community. Plot: Act One: Anita McCambridge (mid-30s, ambitious, and career-oriented) works as a Wall Street executive in New York City. One day, she receives news of her estranged father's death and discovers he has left her his primary asset - the Syracuse Bulldogs, an ice hockey team located in Syracuse, New York. Reluctant and inexperienced in managing a sports team, she visits the town to assess the situation, making her intentions clear that she plans to sell the team and return to New York. Upon arriving, Anita meets the team's head coach, Jack Donovon, a seasoned former player who has dedicated his life to the sport and the community. Jack's charisma and connection with both the players and the fans intrigue Anita. At the same time, the passionate fans and players are highly suspicious of Anita and her motives, worried that the sale will cause the team to relocate or disband altogether. Act Two: Tensions rise as rumors about the team's potential dismantling spread throughout the town, only adding to the pressure on the Bulldogs' performance in the ongoing season. Jack pleads with Anita to give the team a chance to prove their worth, promising to deliver results by the end of the season. Unconvinced but curious about the local fervor and attachment to the team, Anita agrees to give the team a trial run, postponing any decisions until the end of the season. Jack introduces Anita to individual players, local supporters, and the behind-the-scenes staff, exposing her to the passion, dreams, and obstacles faced by those involved with the team. During this time, Anita discovers her late father's passion for the team and his commitment to the community. She learns that he saw the Bulldogs as a beacon of hope and a symbol of strength for the town. Anita experiences transformative moments, as she realizes that her life in New York is devoid of the warmth and along the way, she starts to develop a strong bond with Jack. Act Three: With Jack and Anita‚Äôs joint efforts, the team starts to show signs of improvement, both in their gameplay and player unity. However, halfway into the season, an investor approaches Anita with a lucrative offer to sell the team, intending to relocate it to a larger market, leaving Anita with a difficult decision to make. As the Syracuse Bulldogs reach the finals in a nail-biting match, the entire town, including friends and families of the players, comes together to support the team. At the last moment, Anita has a change of heart and refuses the offer from the investor, choosing instead to uphold her father's legacy and the dreams of the community. Jack and the Bulldogs emerge victorious, and the players, fans, and town celebrate their win together. Epilogue: Inspired by her father's passion and commitment to the team, Anita takes a leave of absence from Wall Street to focus on the Syracuse Bulldogs full-time, utilizing her business acumen to ensure their success off the ice. She and Jack start working together to better understand and expand the team's potential, forming a strong partnership and further developing their romantic relationship. Anita's experiences in Syracuse reveal the profound impact sports can have on individuals and communities, bridging personal and cultural differences. \\"The Rise of the Bulldogs\\" is a story about the transformative power of sportsmanship, self-discovery, passion, and the importance of standing together in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

[1]. yes; [2]. it is not possible to tell; [3]. no;","completion":"Based on the given premise, we can infer that the hypothesis \\"The CEO and chairman of the board positions can be separated to eliminate conflicts in function\\" is likely to be true. Thus, the answer is [1]. Yes. The premise states that some participants believe that separating the roles of CEO and chairman of the board can help in recognizing their distinct functions and roles, as well as eliminating conflicts that may arise from overlapping responsibilities. It also acknowledges the differences between the two positions and takes these differences into account. Consequently, these participants essentially argue that by clearly delineating the responsibilities of each role, this separation would improve the overall functioning of the company. In general, the chairman of the board is known for overseeing the board's activities and focuses on corporate governance, while the CEO is responsible for managing the company's operations and implementing strategies. By separating these two roles, the chairman can focus on ensuring that the board is effectively carrying out its duties, which include monitoring the CEO's performance. Meanwhile, the CEO can prioritize aspects of the company's operations and strategy implementation without added pressures stemming from the need to deal with corporate governance and board-related concerns. Furthermore, separating the roles creates a system of checks and balances, ensuring that no single individual has too much power within an organization. This system is designed to help prevent disputes between executive management and the board, improving overall management and decision-making within the company. In conclusion, if the premise is assumed to be true and separation of the CEO and chairman of the board positions indeed recognizes the differences in their roles and eliminates conflicts in functions, we can support the hypothesis that the CEO and chairman of the board positions can be separated to eliminate conflicts in function. This separation could potentially result in better governance, more transparent decision-making processes, and improved overall functioning within a corporate setting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge? The paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun in the winter of 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Vel√°zquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas \\"in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.\\" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that \\"perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer.\\" This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Vel√°zquez masterpieces,...

Title: Double Indemnity Movie plot: Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), a successful insurance salesman, returns to his office building in downtown Los Angeles late one night. Visibly in pain, he begins dictating a confession into a Dictaphone for his friend and colleague, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), a brilliant claims adjuster. The story, told primarily in flashback, ensues. Neff first meets the alluring Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) during a routine house call to remind her husband (Tom Powers) that his automobile insurance policy is up for renewal. They flirt, until Phyllis asks how she could take out an accident policy on her husband's life without his knowledge. Neff deduces she is contemplating murder, and makes it clear he wants no part of it. However, he cannot get her out of his mind, and when Phyllis shows up at his own home, he cannot resist her any longer. Neff knows all the tricks of his trade and devises a plan to make the murder of her husband appear to be an accidental fall from a train that will trigger the \\"double indemnity\\" clause and pay out twice the policy's face value. After Dietrichson breaks his leg, Phyllis drives him to the train station for his trip to Palo Alto for a college reunion. Neff is hiding in the backseat and kills Dietrichson when Phyllis turns onto a deserted side street. Then, Neff boards the train posing as Dietrichson and using his crutches. He makes his way to the last car, the observation car, and steps outside to the open platform to supposedly smoke a cigarette. A complication ensues when he meets a passenger named Jackson (Porter Hall) there, but he manages to get the man to leave. Neff then throws the crutches on the railway tracks, jumps off at a prearranged meeting spot with Phyllis, and drags Dietrichson's body onto the tracks by his crutches. Mr. Norton, the company's chief, believes the death was suicide, but Keyes scoffs at the idea, quoting statistics indicating the improbability of suicide by jumping off a slow-moving...

Judith Butler FBA (born February 24, 1956) is an American philosopher and gender theorist whose work has influenced political philosophy, ethics and the fields of third-wave feminist, queer and literary theory. Since 1993, she has taught at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is now Maxine Elliot Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program of Critical Theory. She is also the Hannah Arendt Chair at the European Graduate School. Butler is best known for her books Gender Trouble: Judith Butler was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to a family of Hungarian-Jewish and Russian-Jewish descent. Most of her maternal grandmother's family perished in the Holocaust. As a child and teenager, she attended both Hebrew school and special classes on Jewish ethics, where she received her \\"first training in philosophy\\". Butler stated in a 2010 interview with Haaretz that she began the ethics classes at the age of 14 and that they were created as a form of punishment by her Hebrew school's Rabbi because she was \\"too talkative in class\\". Butler also stated that she was \\"thrilled\\" by the idea of these tutorials, and when asked what she wanted to study in these special sessions, she responded with three questions preoccupying her at the time: \\"Why was Spinoza excommunicated from the synagogue? Could German Idealism be held accountable for Nazism? And how was one to understand existential theology, including the work of Martin Buber?\\" Butler attended Bennington College and then Yale University where she studied philosophy, receiving her B.A. in 1978 and her Ph.D. in 1984. She spent one academic year at Heidelberg University as a Fulbright-Scholar. She taught at Wesleyan University, George Washington University, and Johns Hopkins University before joining University of California, Berkeley, in 1993.

In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump‚Äôs vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Let's move all the terms containing 't' to the left-hand side of the equation. To do that, add 108 * t to both sides: -108 * t + 108 * t + 191 = 160 * t - 345 + 108 * t This simplifies to: 191 = 268 * t - 345 Step 3: Move the constant term (i.e., the term without 't') to the right-hand side of the equation. Add 345 to both sides: 191 + 345 = 268 * t - 345 + 345 On simplifying, we get: 536 = 268 * t Step 4: Isolate the variable 't' by dividing both sides by 268: 536 / 268 = 268 * t / 268 On simplification, we get: 2 = t So, the value of 't' that satisfies the given equation is t = 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Make sure they fit well and are snugly around your ankles. This helps your ankles stay strong and straight. Step 3: Fall down! You probably do not usually try to fall.

The brake is usually on the back of the right skate. The brake stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Let your right skate roll a little forward. Bend your knees as if you are sitting down. Then press your right heel down hard. This will make your brake pad drag on the ground until you stop.

Process: - Air is taken through the mouth - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the carbon dioxide is already cleaned happens, how will it affect lung is cleaned of all the carbon dioxide. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis poses an interesting question regarding the effects of a lung that has already been cleaned of carbon dioxide. To understand the possible consequences of this situation, it is essential to examine the respiratory process more closely and consider the role of carbon dioxide in maintaining a balanced internal environment for the body. The primary goal of the respiratory system is to facilitate the exchange of gases between the external environment and the internal body, specifically, to provide oxygen for cellular metabolism and eliminate carbon dioxide produced as a waste product. The process of respiration mainly occurs as follows: 1. Air, containing oxygen, enters the body through the mouth and nostrils and passes through the respiratory tract, including the pharynx, larynx, and trachea. 2. The inhaled air arrives at the lungs, where it further divides into bronchi, bronchioles, and finally, into tiny sacs called alveoli. These alveoli, which have a vast surface area, are responsible for facilitating gas exchange between the air and the bloodstream. 3. Oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the capillaries, where it binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells. At the same time, carbon dioxide produced by cellular respiration diffuses from the blood into the alveoli, a process driven by the concentration gradient of both gases. 4. The now oxygen-rich blood is transported back to the heart and subsequently pumped throughout the body, providing oxygen to all cells to support metabolism and vital functions. 5. The air remaining in the lungs, which now has a higher concentration of carbon dioxide, is forced out during exhalation. This process removes carbon dioxide from the body and brings in fresh, oxygen-rich air during the next inhalation. If the lungs are already cleaned of all carbon dioxide, as in the perturbation hypothesis, a few potential direct and indirect effects could be observed: 1. Direct Effects: - Altered Regulation of Breathing: Normally, carbon dioxide levels in the blood strongly affect the respiratory centers in the brainstem, which regulate breathing rate and depth. An absence of carbon dioxide in the lungs could lead to irregular or shallow breathing, since the body relies on carbon dioxide buildup as a stimulus to breathe. 2. Indirect Effects: - Acid-Base Imbalance: Carbon dioxide is an essential metabolic waste product that helps regulate the body's acid-base balance. When carbon dioxide is removed from the body, it also reduces the levels of carbonic acid, which could lead to a potential imbalance in the body's pH, termed respiratory alkalosis. - Oxygen Transport Disruption: Hemoglobin's ability to bind and release oxygen is influenced by the presence of carbon dioxide (known as the Bohr effect). Without carbon dioxide, oxygen transport could be affected, and cells might not receive the appropriate amount of oxygen they need to maintain normal metabolic functions. This condition could lead to decreased cellular energy production and impaired physiological processes. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis concerning the absence of carbon dioxide from the lungs would have both direct and indirect effects on the respiratory process and overall homeostasis of the body. Understanding the interconnectedness of all physiological systems is critical when evaluating such hypothetical scenarios, as the effects could cascade throughout the body and result in a range of potential consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Usefulness: The review is useful to some extent, as potential players or existing users experiencing difficulties may find it helpful to know about the issues with both versions of the game. However, the review could have been more useful if it provided suggestions or solutions for the problems mentioned in the review. 3.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 1150 = 211*x - 44*x - 2190 for x, we will first combine the x terms and then isolate x to find its value. 1. Combine the x terms: 1150 = (211*x - 44*x) - 2190 1150 = (211 - 44)*x - 2190 1150 = 167*x - 2190 2. Isolate x: To isolate x, we need to get rid of the constant term (-2190) on the right side of the equation. We do this by adding 2190 to both sides of the equation. 1150 + 2190 = 167*x - 2190 + 2190 3340 = 167*x Now that the constant term is gone, we can find the value of x by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x (167). 3340 √∑ 167 = 167*x √∑ 167 20 = x So, x = 20."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully \\"escape\\" Termoli, only to be shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Force 10 member Doug Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane. On the ground, the survivors run across a group they believe to be their allies, Communist Yugoslav Partisans, led by Captain Drazak (Richard Kiel). Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air.

Write some highlights for the following article: Demonstrators clapped along to Soviet-era songs as dancers from Russia's Black Sea fleet entertained the masses at the center of Crimea's administrative capital Sunday. But it was more than just nostalgia for the old Soviet Union. With a controversial referendum over whether Crimea will remain part of Ukraine just a week away, it was a rallying cry for ethnic Russians gathered in Simferopol's Lenin Square. The large demonstration was the latest flashpoint as tensions simmer on the Crimean peninsula, which has become the epicenter of a battle for influence among Moscow, Kiev and the West since Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's ouster last month. Pro-Russian forces have pushed into the Black Sea peninsula in a bloodless siege, prompting criticism from Western nations and Ukraine's interim government. At Sunday's rally, throngs of people waved Crimean and Russian flags. And they said they want one thing: a union with Russia. Because of language and history, one man at the rally told CNN, Russia and Crimea are already \\"brothers.\\" But not all Crimeans are convinced. Across town, beneath a statue of Ukraine's most celebrated poet, the crowd was much smaller, the mood much more somber. Asked what he thought about the possibility of Crimea becoming part of Russia, one demonstrator shook his head. \\"It will be very complicated because of economics, and a lot of different nations live here, not only Russians. ... Not all of the people want to be part of Russia,\\" he said. \\"It's kind of show. Putin's show.\\" The rally was peaceful. But elsewhere, in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, another Ukrainian rally came under attack by pro-Russian gangs who whipped and beat demonstrators. In Kiev, thousands of people gathered at a rally for peace at the central Independence Square, the cradle of the protests that ousted Yanukovych. The crowd shouted slogans such as \\"Glory for Ukraine\\" and \\"Putin go away\\" as representatives of different religions prayed for a solution to the crisis. Putin speaks with Merkel, Cameron. While the autonomous Ukrainian region was the scene of emotional demonstrations by both sides, Russian President Vladimir Putin defended the breakaway moves by the pro-Russian leaders of Crimea in conversations with two world leaders on Sunday,. In separate phone calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron, Putin underlined \\"steps being taken by Crimea's legitimate authorities ... being based on international law on behalf of the interests of the population there,\\" according to a Kremlin statement. Putin also said new Ukrainian authorities were doing nothing \\"to curb ultra-nationalist and radical forces committing outrages\\" in Kiev and other regions. The three leaders spoke amid tensions on the Black Sea peninsula that have escalated since the Moscow-backed regional parliament voted to leave Ukraine for Russia and announced a March 16 referendum to give Crimeans an opportunity to vote on the idea. Despite the differences of opinion over what is happening on the ground, the Kremlin statement said there was consensus on the need to de-escalate tensions and normalize the situation. It's unclear what could happen next in the tense standoff, but Sunday's phone conversations between Putin, Cameron and Merkel send one clear message, CNN analyst and Russian journalist Vladimir Pozner said. \\"I think it shows that President Putin is very worried by the situation. I think speculation that he's trying to rebuild the Soviet empire are way off base,\\" Pozner said. \\"I think he knows all too well the necessity of Russia having an international relationship with the West. ... My hope is, with all the escalations going on, that there's a real chance of finding some way out of this very dangerous situation.\\" Moscow has denounced the events that led to Yanukovych's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities, putting the two countries on a collision course over control of Crimea, which has longstanding ties to Russia and has thousands of Russian troops stationed there. Putin has said Russia has the right to protect Russians living in the former Soviet republic. Pro-Russian forces are now in de facto control of the region ahead of the referendum, which Kiev says is illegal. Washington has warned Moscow that any moves to annex Crimea would close the door to diplomacy. On Saturday, U.S. President Barack Obama rounded up world leaders to demand Russia \\"de-escalate the situation.\\" Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk will fly to the United States this week to discuss the crisis in Crimea, as hostilities in the eastern European country's southern region intensify. Yatsenyuk is expected to arrive in the United States on Wednesday, a spokeswoman from his press office told CNN. The White House confirmed the visit and said the two will talk about the Russian military incursion and economic support for Ukraine. Referendum becomes focus. Putin last week secured permission from his parliament to use military force to protect Russian citizens in Ukraine. The move came within days after Yanukovych's flight from the country. Yanukovych was ousted after three months of protests against a decision to spurn a free trade deal with the European Union and turn toward closer ties with Moscow. A convoy of military vehicles, believed to be carrying Russian soldiers, traveled through Simferopol on Saturday, heading toward the border post at Armyansk, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense told CNN. Armyansk is one of the main access points into Crimea from the rest of Ukraine. Dozens of military observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe have tried to cross into Crimea for three days but have been refused entry by armed men. They did not attempt a crossing on Sunday. The referendum on whether the Crimean Peninsula should join Russia has become the focus of the Ukraine crisis. Yatsenyuk has called it \\"an illegitimate decision.\\" \\"If there is an annexation of Crimea, if there is a referendum that moves Crimea from Ukraine to Russia, we won't recognize it, nor will most of the world,\\" U.S. deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said on CNN's \\"State of the Union\\" on Sunday. \\"So I think you'd see, if there are further steps in the direction of annexing Crimea, a very strong, coordinated international response.\\" CNN's Claudia Rebaza, Arkady Irshenko, Azadeh Ansari and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","completion":"- Demonstrators in Simferopol's Lenin Square rallied for Crimea to become part of Russia amid tensions leading up to a controversial referendum. - Ethnic Russians in Crimea express desire for union with Russia, citing shared language and history. - Not all Crimeans support the idea of joining Russia, with economic complications and diverse nationalities as concerns. - Pro-Russian forces took control of the Crimean peninsula in a bloodless siege, drawing criticism from Western nations and Ukraine's interim government. - Russian President Vladimir Putin defended the pro-Russian leaders of Crimea in phone calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron, citing international law and the interests of the population. - Despite differences in opinions on the ground, there was consensus on the need to de-escalate tensions and normalize the situation. - Moscow has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities, creating a collision course over control of Crimea. - The upcoming referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia has become the focus of the ongoing crisis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"If you didn't want a light color wood, what should you look for?\\" Context: \\"If a heavy piece of pine is compared with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger proportion of latewood than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings. In white pines there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In hard pines, on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"If you prefer not to have a light color wood like pine, you should look for wood species that offer darker tones, richer hues, and a greater contrast between the earlywood and latewood portions of the growth rings. These wood types not only bring a different aesthetic, but often possess distinct characteristics that might better fit your needs and preferences. Several darker-toned wood options include: 1. Walnut: Known for its rich, dark brown color and beautiful grain patterns, walnut is a popular choice for furniture, cabinetry, and flooring. It is relatively hard and resistant to wear, while still being easy to work with. 2. Mahogany: With its deep reddish-brown hue, mahogany has long been prized for its luxurious appearance and durability. It is often used for fine furniture, musical instruments, and interior detailing, as it is resistant to decay and showcases excellent workability. 3. Cherry: Displaying a reddish-brown color that darkens with age, cherry wood offers an attractive grain pattern and a smooth finish. It is a popular choice for cabinetry, flooring, and furniture and is renowned for its strength and resistance to decay. 4. Oak: Oak wood comes in two primary types‚Äîred oak and white oak‚Äîeach characterized by noticeable contrasting growth rings. Red oak is lighter in color, while white oak boasts a darker, more amber hue. Both types are exceptionally strong, durable, and suitable for various applications, such as furniture, flooring, and cabinetry. 5. Teak: Famous for its golden brown color, tight grain pattern, and natural oils that protect against decay and pests, teak is a sought-after option for outdoor furniture, boatbuilding, and other applications exposed to the elements. 6. Rosewood: With a rich, dark red-brown shade and attractive grain patterns, rosewood is an exotic option often utilized for musical instruments, decorative veneers, and high-end furniture. Its highly-prized aesthetic is matched by its density and exceptional durability. 7. Wenge: This dark, chocolate-brown wood with contrasting grain is native to Africa. Wenge's unique appearance makes it popular for flooring, furniture, and paneling. However, it is relatively difficult to work with due to its hardness and brittleness. When choosing a darker wood, consider the specific application, desired aesthetics, and wood characteristics like hardness, density, workability, and resistance to decay or pests. Being aware of these factors will ensure you find the most suitable wood type for your project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A:","completion":"Cameron's decision to reduce his daily calorie intake and lose weight was likely driven by several reasons, which could include health, fitness goals, personal appearance, disease prevention, and overall wellbeing. 1. Improving Health: Weight impacts overall health significantly. Excess weight can lead to a myriad of health issues, including heart disease, certain types of cancer, type 2 diabetes, stroke, liver disease, sleep apnea and osteoarthritis, among many others. By reducing his calorie intake and consequently losing weight, Cameron might have aimed to significantly minimize these risks. 2. Enhancing Physical Fitness Levels: Excessive weight can impede an individual's ability to perform various physical activities or sports. Weight loss is often used as a strategy to boost overall fitness levels and improve endurance, agility, speed, and strength. 3. Boosting Self-confidence and Self-esteem: Society often places a heavy emphasis on physical appearances, sometimes leading individuals to lose weight in order to conform to societal standards of attractiveness. Cameron may have aimed to achieve a more socially acceptable body shape, thereby boosting his self-confidence and self-esteem. 4. Personal Goals: Cameron might have had personal fitness or health goals. People often set targets for themselves, such as running a marathon, and losing weight can be instrumental in achieving such targets. 5. Prevention of Diseases: If Cameron has a family history of lifestyle diseases like diabetes, cardiac issues, or joint pain, it's often recommended by healthcare practitioners to maintain an ideal weight to prevent such diseases. 6. Age-Related Concerns: Aging often brings with it a decrease in metabolic activity and an increased susceptibility to accumulate fat, particularly around the abdomen. Cameron may have chosen to reduce his daily calorie intake to offset these changes and maintain a healthier weight. 7. Increased Energy Levels: Being overweight often contributes to a state of constant fatigue and reduced energy levels. Reducing calorie intake, losing weight and leading a more active lifestyle can significantly increase a person‚Äôs overall energy levels. 8. Optimized Metabolism: Excessive calorie intake can make the body sluggish and decrease metabolic rate. Cameron might have reduced his calorie intake to ensure his metabolism is working optimally. In a nutshell, weight loss by reduced daily calorie intake opens the door to a plethora of benefits encompassing physical health, emotional wellbeing, and improved quality of life. Each person's reasons for opting to lose weight might be different, but the goals are universally interlinked with boosting overall personal health and wellbeing. However, it's critical to bear in mind that losing weight needs to be done in a balanced way that promotes good health, and not at the expense of it."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Wang and Nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that Tibetan areas were ruled by the Ming since Tibetan leaders were granted positions as Ming officials, that horses were collected from Tibet as a mandatory \\"corv√©e\\" tax, and therefore Tibetans were \\"undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy\\". Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing. He also argues that the embassies of Tibetan lamas visiting the Ming court were for the most part efforts to promote commercial transactions between the lamas' large, wealthy entourage and Ming Chinese merchants and officials. Kolma≈° writes that while the Ming maintained a laissez-faire policy towards Tibet and limited the numbers of the Tibetan retinues, the Tibetans sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming because imperial patronage provided them with wealth and power. Laird writes that Tibetans eagerly sought Ming court invitations since the gifts the Tibetans received for bringing tribute were much greater in value than the latter. As for the Yongle Emperor's gifts to his Tibetan and Nepalese vassals such as silver wares, Buddha relics, utensils for Buddhist temples and religious ceremonies, and gowns and robes for monks, Tsai writes \\"in his effort to draw neighboring states to the Ming orbit so that he could bask in glory, the Yongle Emperor was quite willing to pay a small price\\". The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC lists the Tibetan tribute items as oxen, horses, camels, sheep, fur products, medical herbs, Tibetan incenses, thangkas (painted scrolls), and handicrafts; while the Ming awarded Tibetan tribute-bearers an equal value of gold, silver, satin and brocade, bolts of cloth, grains, and tea leaves. Silk workshops during the Ming also catered specifically to the Tibetan market with silk clothes and furnishings featuring Tibetan Buddhist iconography.

Movie title: The Thing Movie plot: In the Antarctic, a Norwegian helicopter pursues an Alaskan Malamute to an American research station. Upon landing, the passenger accidentally drops a thermite charge, which destroys the helicopter and kills the pilot when he tries to retrieve it. The passenger pursues the dog, firing a rifle, until he is shot dead by Garry, the station commander. The Americans send a helicopter pilot, MacReady, and Dr. Copper to the Norwegian camp for answers, but they find only a charred ruin. Inside, they find a corpse with its throat and wrists slashed in the radio room. Outside, they discover the burned remains of a humanoid corpse with two faces, which they bring back along with some video tapes. Their biologist, Blair, performs an autopsy on the corpse, finding a normal set of human internal organs. Clark kennels the Malamute with the station's sled dogs; it soon metamorphoses and attacks them. When he hears the commotion, MacReady pulls the fire alarm, and Childs incinerates the creature. Blair performs another autopsy which leads him to believe the creature perfectly imitates other organisms. The Norwegians' records lead the Americans to a buried flying saucer that the station's geologist, Norris, hypothesizes is likely over 100,000 years old. Blair becomes increasingly paranoid and withdraws, calculating that if the alien escapes to a civilized area, all life on Earth will be assimilated within a few years. Fuchs tells MacReady that he is worried about Blair, and according to Blair's journal, the creature's \\"dead\\" remains are still active on a cellular level. The camp enacts safety measures designed to reduce risk of assimilation. The creature assimilates Bennings, but Windows catches him outside before his metamorphosis is complete and MacReady burns the creature before it can escape. They discover Blair has wrecked all the transports and killed the remaining sled dogs. The team corners Blair as he is destroying the radio and locks him in an isolated tool shed. Copper recommends a blood-serum test to determine who... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Thing,\\" as MacReady sits near the burning camp towards the end of the film, Childs, played by Keith David, reappears. Childs had gone missing after the explosion of the power generator, and his return raises suspicions in MacReady about whether Childs is still human or has been assimilated by the alien creature.

She catches the attention of marine engineer Oliver Reed, who strikes up a conversation. Irena invites him to her apartment for tea. As they walk away, one of Irena's discarded sketches is revealed as a panther impaled by a sword. At her apartment, Oliver is intrigued by a statue of a medieval warrior on horseback impaling a large cat with his sword. Irena informs Oliver that the figure is King John of Serbia and that the cat represents evil.

At the time of her birth, her parents had been living in Utah with her elder brother, Shane; her father was attending Brigham Young University. She is a first cousin once removed of actress Q'orianka Kilcher. Her father, originally from Alaska, was a Mormon, though the family stopped attending The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after her parents' divorce when she was eight years old. For a time, Kilcher lived in her car while traveling around the country doing street performances and small gigs, mainly in Southern California. She gained recognition by singing at The Inner Change Cafe and Java Joe's in San Diego; she would later make her debut record at Java Joe's when it was in Poway, where she had worked as a barista. Her friend Steve Poltz's band, The Rugburns, played the same venues. She later collaborated with Poltz on some of her songs, including \\"You Were Meant for Me\\". (He also appeared in the song's second, better-known video.) The Rugburns opened for Jewel on her Tiny Lights tour in 1997. Poltz appeared in Jewel's band on the Spirit World Tour 1999 playing guitar. Kilcher was discovered by Inga Vainshtein in August 1993 when John Hogan, lead singer from the local San Diego band Rust, whom Vainshtein was managing, called to tell her about a girl surfer who sang at a local coffee shop on Thursdays. Vainshtein drove to The Inner Change with a representative from Atlantic Records, and after the show they called Danny Goldberg, the head of Atlantic Record's West Coast operations, and asked him to pay for her demo, since at the time she was living in a van and lacked the means to record any of her own music. Vainshtein, who at the time was working as a film executive at Paramount, eventually became her manager and was instrumental in creating a major bidding war that led to her deal with Atlantic Records. She continued to manage Jewel until the end of the first album cycle. Her debut album Pieces of You was released the eponym of Jewel, in 1995 when she was 21 years old. Recorded in a studio on singer Neil Young's ranch, it included Young's backing band, The Stray Gators, who played on his Harvest and Harvest Moon albums. Part of the album was recorded live at The Inner Change Cafe in San Diego, where she had risen to local fame. The album stayed on the Billboard 200 for two years, reaching number four at its peak. The album spawned the Top 10 hits \\"You Were Meant for Me\\", \\"Who Will Save Your Soul\\", and \\"Foolish Games\\". The album eventually sold over 12 million copies in the United States alone. In the late 1990s, Mike Connell created an electronic mailing list for fans, known as \\"Everyday Angels\\". Although Jewel herself does not subscribe to this mailing list, she maintained communication with her EA fans. On July 18 and 19, 1996, she gave a two-day concert known as \\"JewelStock\\" at the Bearsville Theatre. Jewel allowed the concert to be taped, and fans circulated the concert without profit.

The toilet paper roll was on the floor (the roll holder was broken), and there was no soap or hot water available (we reported this to the health dept.) Do yourself a favor and eat at the 4* Chuck Wagon Restaurant in the Longhorn Casino 100 yards to the north. The only reason we visited this Denny's was that the Longhorn was crowded....Pick your answer from: 1). negative. 2). positive. I think the answer is","completion":"1). negative. The reason the answer is negative is because the person writing the review did not have a good experience at the Denny's restaurant. They talked about it being dirty and not very well taken care of. They even had to report the condition of the restroom to the health department, which is not a good thing. Also, they suggested people should go to a different restaurant nearby instead. That's why it's a negative review. The other option, 2). positive, is not correct because the review does not say anything good about the Denny's restaurant. If it was positive, it would say nice things about the food, service, or cleanliness, and people would want to go there. But that's not what this review is saying, so it cannot be a positive review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mercury complains that the older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him, while he gets no credit for all his drudgery. Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it. Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance. Thespis's acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis. The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic. Sparkeion flirts with his former fianc√©e, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis. In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back. Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter. All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis. Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods. Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to \\"mingle\\" and judge for themselves what people think of them. They agree to invest the actors with their powers, as they take a merry holiday below on Earth. Thespis agrees that he and his company will keep things running on Mount Olympus during the gods' absence. Each actor takes the place of one of the gods, with Thespis himself replacing Jupiter. Mercury stays behind to offer any advice the actors may need., can you guess it ?

He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird.

I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship.

He may be a well-known music-lover having hosted high-profile shows on MTV, XFM and NME Radio. But Alex Zane reveals he more than happy to shun the masses of Ibiza's hard-partying tourists, booming beats and sprawling nightclubs to take a trip to the north of the island, which is littered with breath-taking beaches. The 35-year-old presenter says the Spanish island has 'two characters' explaining the tranquil villages and peaceful orange groves are just a bike-ride away and offer the opportunity to 'live like a local'. Read our Q and A with Alex to find out how he spends his time on the island. Many people are cautious of visiting Ibiza as they think it's all about clubbing and rowdy youngsters. But what else has the island got to offer? 'Ibiza is an island of two characters; the south which is devoted to the mega clubs and party-goers and the other, lesser known Northern side of the island, which is peaceful, tranquil and full of unspoilt beauty. Of course, the boundaries aren't as clear cut as this, but for every all-night DJ session there is an early morning sunrise at one of the many breath-taking little coves that litter the Island. The nightlife may have gained a reputation for the island amongst tourists, but it's this other side to Ibiza that the locals rave about. If you are one of the 50 per cent of Brits who, according to research by American Express, are after the authentic experience of 'living like a local', then the best way to explore this quieter side of the island is to hop on a bike and get off the beaten track to explore the many villages, peaceful orange groves and quaint little restaurants that tourists don't usually get to experience. I guarantee you won't hear a baseline the whole time you are there.' Alex Zane recommends escaping Ibiza's crowded clubbing areas and visiting the island's northern coast. Beaches such as Cala de Sant Vicent (pictured) can be found on the North East of Ibiza. Best restaurant? 'My favourite restaurant on the island is a little family owned place called Sabores Naturales in the centre of the small town of San Juan. It's got a quiet courtyard outside where you can just sit, relax, eat, drink and let time pass you by without a care. All the food is vegetarian and organic with fresh fruit juices and, in my opinion, the best homemade pizza on the island.' Best beach? 'Picking my favourite beach in Ibiza is a bit of a tricky one. If I did have to choose though, it would probably be Cala Xuclar. It felt like I was on a tropical beach without the long-haul flying. With great views and white sand, combined with a few fisherman's huts and a tiny kiosk serving food, it was the perfect place to escape from it all.' Great outdoors: Alex Zane loves the party side of Ibiza but also enjoys going out exploring. Best place to stay? 'If you are going in search of sunset bike rides and early morning strolls around the old towns, then I'd advise staying in any one of the boutique hotels in the north of the island, like the Hotel Hacienda Na Xamena, with its series of spa pools and waterfalls built into the cliff face. We stayed in Can Curreu and it's safe to say that that the view from the breakfast table made the early starts much better.' Your favourite thing about Ibiza and why? 'My favourite thing about Ibiza is discovering the hidden gems of the island. When you say to people you are heading on holiday to Ibiza, they immediately imagine rows of sun beds on the beaches and overcrowded bars blasting out music. Yet you only need to venture a little off the tourist trails and, even in peak season, you can find stunning, empty beaches and relaxing places to sit for a drink. Perhaps the island's reputation has meant less people visit Ibiza in search of a rejuvenating holiday. For whatever the reason, they're missing out.' The ultimate island guide: Alex produced his quick guide to what is great about Ibiza. What are your packing essentials? 'Packing light is the key if, like me, you enjoy moving around a lot. There's nothing worse than heaving a giant case jammed full of clothes to lug on and off various forms of transport. As long as you've got one smart outfit in there and the facilities to clean it you'll be fine. And if you don't have the facilities to clean it, you're probably not in a place you're going to need it in the first place.' Which destination is top of your wishlist? 'I'd like to explore more of South America. I've seen a lot of Brazil: Rio, Sao Paulo and up to Manaus and then deep into the Rain forest, but that's it. I'd really like to go further south to Argentina.' What is your earliest travel memory? 'Scotland. I remember being in Scotland so much as a kid. My mum often took myself and my brother to stay on the West Coast. We spent time on Skye, around Oban and Arisaig and then on the banks of Loch Awe. It is still one of my favourite places in the world to spend time‚Ä¶ stunning scenery, wild weather and fascinating history.'

Gerald Howarth said the notorious Conservative MP had been correct to warn that mass movement of ‚Äònon Christian‚Äô migrants to Britain would cause problems. His comments were made in an email to a constituent about the Islamist 'Trojan Horse' plot in Birmingham to radicalise school children by taking over governing boards. In the leaked letter the former defence minister wrote: ‚ÄòClearly, the arrival of so many people of non-Christian faith has presented a challenge, as so many of us, including the late Enoch Powell, warned decades ago. ‚ÄòRecent events have illustrated that some of these new arrivals have a very different ethos from traditional Christian schools and we are right to intervene to prevent them from teaching divisive ideology to children born here.‚Äô Mr Howarth tonight confirmed that the leaked letter was 'entirely accurate' and reflected his views about the dangers of immigration.

It is decades of political correctness and it's allowed this disgusting abuse of children to take place. 'It's the Labour party who are responsible. The Labour party and the left.' He said England was now 'fighting back' against political correctness. He added: 'This is the United Kingdom for goodness sake - if you don't like it go and live somewhere else.' Sir Gerald said the problem with immigration was about 'numbers', which he said 'Enoch always said'. Enoch Powell‚Äôs notorious ‚ÄòRivers of Blood‚Äô speech was delivered in Birmingham in April 1968, sparking widespread condemnation. In the speech Mr Powell called for the ‚Äòrepatriation‚Äô of non-white immigrants, claiming the racial mix in Britain would lead to city riots. Sir Gerald did not advocate repatriation in the leaked email to his constituent. Mr Powell was immediately sacked from the Conservative shadow cabinet by the party‚Äôs then leader Edward Heath. Enoch Powell, the late Tory MP, sparked widespread anger after attacking migration in a 1968 speech on race relations.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Factors Unrelated to Driving Can Affect Car Insurance ARE you married or single? Have you been widowed or divorced? Is your credit history less than stellar? Your answers to those questions can affect the rates you pay for car insurance. Your driving record and habits factor into your premiums, of course. But many insurers also use a variety of other data, like your marital status and a version of your credit score, to set your rate. An analysis by the Consumer Federation of America found that online quotes from most companies were almost always higher for single, separated and divorced drivers than for married drivers. Notably, the study found that quotes for annual premiums for a young woman were an average of 14 percent higher if she was a widow, rather than married. Stephen Brobeck, the federation‚Äôs executive director, and another researcher examined quotes from six major insurers in 10 American cities based on a hypothetical 30-year-old single woman. (Differences in marital status probably hold for single men as well, Mr. Brobeck said.) For the analysis, the researchers obtained premium quotes from the auto insurers‚Äô websites for the minimum liability coverage required by states. (All states but New Hampshire require liability coverage.) In seeking quotes, the study varied the driver‚Äôs marital status while keeping other characteristics constant. The test driver had no accidents or moving violations, held a high school diploma, worked as a bank teller and rented in a ZIP code with median household income of 30,000. Average quotes for a widowed driver obtained from five insurers ‚Äî Geico, Farmers, Progressive, Nationwide and Liberty Mutual ‚Äî were higher than for a married driver, ranging from 3 percent more (Nationwide) to 29 percent more (Geico). State Farm was the only insurer that did not quote higher premiums for a widow in any of the markets. The company‚Äôs quotes in a given city were the same, regardless of the driver‚Äôs marital status. Eric Hardgrove, a spokesman for Nationwide, said in an email statement that a number of factors affected a customer‚Äôs price. ‚ÄúNationwide doesn‚Äôt have different prices based solely on whether a driver is widowed or married,‚Äù he said. He said that significant life events like a marriage or a death in the family ‚Äúwarrant a conversation with an insurance professional who can determine an individual‚Äôs specific insurance needs and advise on the appropriate coverage at the right price.‚Äù Geico did not immediately return emails and a phone message seeking comment. David Snyder, a spokesman for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, said that rather than showing a penalty applied to widows or other unmarried people, the analysis reflected that many insurers gave a discounted premium to married couples, because they tended to be more responsible and had a lower rate of filing claims. So if drivers are not married, they will not receive a quote with that discount. Also, Mr. Snyder said, punching information into a website to get a quote doesn‚Äôt reflect what occurs with actual customers. If a customer becomes widowed and later receives a premium increase, she can call her agent and explain that her spouse has died. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs an agent out there that wouldn‚Äôt adjust the rate,‚Äù he said. Consumer Reports recently published an analysis that examined two billion insurance price quotes from 700 insurers and concluded that factors that don‚Äôt have to do with driving ‚Äî like your credit history and whether you use store or bank credit cards ‚Äî are increasingly used as criteria in setting rates. A single New Yorker, for instance, with merely ‚Äúgood‚Äù credit would pay an average of 255 more in annual premiums than someone with ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù credit, the analysis found. Mr. Snyder again said that insurers were basing their premium decisions on data that indicated higher risk: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not people being judged,‚Äù he said. Rather, he said, ‚Äúcertain factors correlate to increased risk.‚Äù Mr. Brobeck argues that because auto insurance is state-mandated, insurance companies should be more transparent about how they set rates and should stick primarily to driving-related factors to set premiums. He cited as an example California, which has mandated that driving-related factors must be the primary criteria used to set premiums. (Three states, California, Hawaii and Massachusetts, prohibit insurers from using credit scores to set insurance rates.) Here are some questions to consider asking about auto insurance rates: ‚ñ† How can I increase my chances of getting a good auto rate? Because information in your credit report can affect your premium, you should check your report for possible errors and seek to have them corrected, said Margot Gilman, money editor at Consumer Reports. Using national bank credit cards rather than store-specific cards may help, she said, because insurers rank bank cards more highly. And, she said, if you receive notice of a rate increase, push back by contacting your insurer and asking for a lower premium. ‚ñ† Do I have recourse if my credit score harmed my premium? Many states allow consumers to ask their insurer for an ‚Äúextraordinary life circumstances‚Äù exception, which would eliminate the use of their credit score as a factor in setting their premium if they are affected by a job loss, illness or other serious life event. Consumer Reports suggests seeking an exception, although it‚Äôs unclear how often such requests are granted. ‚ñ† Does it still make sense to shop around for insurance rates? Yes, said Ms. Gilman. But checking one or two different insurers isn‚Äôt enough. Most consumers check three insurers at the most, she said, ‚Äúand falsely convince themselves that they‚Äôve shopped around.‚Äù To get the best premium, she said, you should check rates ‚Äúbroadly and frequently‚Äù ‚Äî and that means up to a dozen quotes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pain in the neck,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs worth it.‚Äù Make the most of your money.

Oklahoma! is the first musical written by the team of composer Richard Rodgers and librettist Oscar Hammerstein II. The musical is based on Lynn Riggs' 1931 play, Green Grow the Lilacs. Set in Oklahoma Territory outside the town of Claremore in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry. A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fiancee, Ado Annie. The original production of Oklahoma! was an unprecedented critical and popular success. John Anderson of the New York Journal American pronounced the musical \\"a beautiful and delightful show, fresh and imaginative, as enchanting to the eye as Richard Rodgers's music is to the ear. It has, at a rough estimate, practically everything\\". In the New York Herald Tribune, Howard Barnes wrote, \\"Songs, dances, and a story have been triumphantly blended.... The Richard Rodgers score is one of his best, and that is saying plenty. Oscar Hammerstein 2nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics; Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes, while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship.\\" Louis Kronenberger of PM opined that \\"Mr. Hammerstein's lyrics have less crispness and wit than Lorenz Hart's at their best, but the songs in Oklahoma! call for less sophisticated words, and Mr. Hammerstein has found very likeable ones.\\" In the New York Daily News, Burns Mantle declared that \\"Oklahoma! really is different - beautifully different. With the songs that Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, Oklahoma! seems to me to be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since Edna Ferber's Show Boat\\". New York World-Telegram critic Burton Rascoe particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that \\"Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet [corps], is actually the biggest hit of the show. The \\"Out of My Dreams\\" and \\"All Er Nuthin'\\" dances are such supreme aesthetic delights.... They are spinetingling, out of this world.\\" In The New York Sun, Ward Morehouse commented that \\"Oklahoma! is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical,\\" as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. \\"It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B.\\" Lorenz Hart himself \\"pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in Sardi's restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life.\\" The only negative review of the musical appeared in the New York Post: The critic wrote that \\"it all seemed just a trifle too cute\\", stating that the score consisted of \\"a flock of Mr. Rodgers's songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation.\\" She concluded that the show was \\"very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm is apt to become a little tiresome.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What else is significant about the reception?","completion":"The significant aspect of the reception of Oklahoma! can be found in the praise for its groundbreaking choreography from New York World-Telegram critic Burton Rascoe, who stated that \\"Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had.

Translate to German German:","completion":"Ja, wir m√ºssen die Verantwortung f√ºr unsere vielen Misserfolge √ºbernehmen, aber wir haben nicht alleine gehandelt. Here's a detailed explanation of the translation: Ja - This is the direct translation of \\"Yes\\" in German. It has the same meaning in English. wir - It is the German word for \\"we.\\" In sentences, it is usually used before the verb. m√ºssen - It is the German word for \\"have to.\\" In this context, it is used to express obligation or necessity. die Verantwortung - This term translates to \\"the responsibility\\" in English. In German, nouns are usually preceded by an article (der, die, das). Here, the gender of \\"Verantwortung\\" is feminine which is why we use \\"die.\\" f√ºr - It is the translation of \\"for.\\" unsere - This is the plural possessive pronoun used to denote \\"our.\\" In German, possessive pronouns change depending on the gender and number of the noun they're associated with. As \\"Misserfolge\\" is plural, we use \\"unsere\\". vielen Misserfolge - This translates to \\"many failures\\". Here, \\"vielen\\" is the adjective modifying the noun \\"Misserfolge\\" to illustrate multiple instances of failure. √ºbernehmen - It means \\"assume or take.\\" It's the verb used here to express the action of taking responsibility. aber - It is the exact translation of \\"but\\" in German, a coordinating conjunction used to connect two clauses or ideas. wir haben - It translates directly to \\"we have.\\" Just like in English, it's a verb phrase present in the sentence. nicht - It means \\"not.\\" It's used here to negate the verb, expressing the idea of not acting. alleine - It translates to \\"alone.\\" It is used here to denote action that was not done singularly or independently. gehandelt - It is the past participle form of the verb \\"handeln,\\" which means \\"to act.\\" In German, the past participle is often used at the end of a sentence to express past actions. So, piecing it all together, the sentence \\"Ja, wir m√ºssen die Verantwortung f√ºr unsere vielen Misserfolge √ºbernehmen, aber wir haben nicht alleine gehandelt.\\" translates in English as \\"Yes, we have to take responsibility for our many failures, but we did not act alone.\\" It carries the same context and sentiment from English to German."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're shown a three-part story, with a beginning, middle, and ending.

He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is endangered when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death-threatening postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected.Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill lurks around Kahane's home and is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi), whom he watches while talking to her on the phone, that Kahane is at a showing of 'The Bicycle Thief'. Mill goes to the theater, pretending to recognize Kahane in the lobby after the film, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar and have some drinks. Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mills offer; he calls Mill a liar, pointing out that he knows Mill didn't really go to the theater to see 'The Bicycle Thief' because Kahane saw Mill wander in late and only catch the last five minutes of it, and denies responsibility for sending Mill the postcards. Kahane continues goading Mill about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot the two men fight. Mill loses his balance and falls, and feeling threatened, kills Kahane, then makes the death look like a robbery gone wrong.The next day, Mill receives another postcard. Mill attends Kahanes funeral and gets along with June; she knows none of the other mourners. Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts Mill about the murder and says that the police know Mill was the last one to see Kahane alive.

The band, led by Anthony Green, consists of former members from Saosin, This Day Forward, and Taken. Circa Survive quickly made a name for themselves in the indie music scene in little over two years with their 2005 debut album, Juturna, and second album, On Letting Go, released in 2007. Both albums were released on Equal Vision Records. Juturna, Circa Survive's first album, was released on April 19, 2005, in the United States and on January 31, 2006, in Japan on Equal Vision Records. It had been initially announced via the band's MySpace page in November 2004. Details as to its sound remained vague, although the band stated they would keep their fans posted via their website, MySpace page, PureVolume page, and YouTube page. Shortly before its official release, the album was posted on their MySpace page in its entirety. Juturna peaked at #183 on the Billboard 200. The album was produced by Brian McTernan at Salad Days Studios in Baltimore. The band drew inspiration for the album from House of Leaves and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. During an online Q&A session on April 20, 2010, Brendan dismissed the claim that Juturna was a concept album based on Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but did say that there is an underlying concept. That concept is speculated by fans to be vaguely about human memories. \\"Oh, Hello\\" exemplifies this with its lyrics. The decision to call the album's bonus track that appears after \\"Meet Me In Montauk\\" and the silence that follows it at 8:56, \\"House of Leaves\\" was more or less a joint one by the band and their fans. Various members of the band have stated that they have read at least some portion of the book over the years since its 2000 release. The album's sound is characterized by its prominent utilization of effects-laden, dual guitar melodies over polyrythmic percussion. The guitarists' approach to songwriting takes on characteristics of jazz and shoegaze music. The album has since gone on to be considered massively influential to the post-hardcore community.

News article: GOING OUT GUIDE - NYTimes.com The new year is under way, the tinsel has come down and New Yorkers have returned to the long winter period of nonfestivity that is January. Instead of the time when every family was its own going-out center for the holidays, entertainment has reverted to the zones where it is a year-round staple. One of the biggest of these Manhattan playgrounds is Greenwich Village, where the small nightclub, the checker-and-chess emporium, the coffeehouse, the art gallery flour ish in season and out. Monday is not Greenwich Village's liveliest night, particularly after the New Year weekend, but it is never a dark night; one can always find the spark of life, the joyous note, the bubbling spirit in the Village. Tonight, for instance, there is life at the Horn of Plenty, 91 Charles Street, at Bleecker. This is a restaurant with one of those deceptive exteriors that mask a lavish interior, several rooms whose main decor consists of plants and other greenery. There is a winding staircase down to the main restaurant, while a back room has the feel of a greenhouse. Off to one side is a handsome bar and next to that is the spacious music room. In the music room, the spark that ignites tonight and every night through Saturday from 6:30 to 8 P.M. is Blossom Dearie. Miss Dearie is pianist and singer and has made her mark over the last 30 years, having her performing roots in the late 1940's, days when she played piano and moved with the crowd at Gil Evans's basement apartment, along with Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, John Lewis, Lee Konitz and Gerry Mulligan. Miss Dearie, who has described her performances as ranging from ''the meticulous to the sublime,'' sings songs written by herself and by others, new numbers like ''I Have a Feeling I've Been Here Before'' by Roger Kellaway and Marilyn and Alan Bergman and three new ones she has written with Jack Segal. Not to mention her performing staples such as ''Peel Me a Grape,'' ''Sophisticated Lady'' and ''I'm Hip.'' There is a 5 cover, plus a two-drink minimum. The restaurant works from 5 P.M., the bar from 4 to 11 P.M. Reservations: 242-0636. NEARBY Continue your wanderings in the Village, in the general latitudes of Bleecker Street and you will come to the Duplex, 55 Grove Street, off Seventh Avenue South (255-5438). The Duplex is another Village cornerstone, a place where, at least figuratively, you can take your shoes off. It is homey and chatty and, downstairs, Villagers sit and perhaps even intrude on each other's conversation, but amiably. Upstairs is the showroom, where the schedule is in effect just about every night. Tonight at 8 P.M., you can hear a singer, Deborah Unger. At 10 P.M., a more ambitious production: Lynda Rodolitz, who gives out with songs and humor. She will be abetted by Sande Campbell and Andy Gale. There is a 4 cover in this drinks-only emporium. Drinks, from 2 up. LUNCH BREAK The Quaigh Theater, one flight up in the Hotel Diplomat, 108 West 43d Street (221-9088), offers, in addition to its normal nighttime theater presentations, the only persisting noon-hour theater in the city. The Quaigh has a far-flung relationship with Lafayette University in Louisiana. Each year, eight or so plays by the university's playwriting group are selected and given one performance each by Quaigh. This year, Quaigh so liked one of the offerings that it is running it for two weeks, Monday through Friday this week and next at 12:15 P.M. The play is ''Snuff Flick,'' by John Fiero, professor of English at the university. It is farce about a young woman getting a test on a movie set only to find that the lead actor has just died; the farce is about how the deceased is made to give a smashing performance. Admission by donation; 2 is suggested; over-65's, students and members of Actors' Equity free.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: Blessed with children as well as a career outside the home, working mums may seem to have it all. But actually they suffer a double guilt burden ‚Äì that they are bad mothers because they work and bad employees because they have a family, a study shows. Researchers found that working mothers agonised more about their job outside the office than fathers and had more negative thoughts about their family while at work. Guilt: Mother-of-four Victoria Beckham (with husband David and sons Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn) admitted to Vogue last year that she feels 'guilty' every time she goes out to work. Both parents think about their. families, but only for mothers is this type of thought associated with. increased stress and negative emotions. Shira. Offer, an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology and. Anthropology at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, studied mental labour in. working parents in pressurised jobs. She. defines the term as thoughts and concerns that can impair performance,. make it difficult to focus on tasks, and even hurt our sleep. The. study, presented to the American Sociological Association, relies on data. from the 500 Family Study, which investigates how. middle-class families balance family and work experiences. The. study looked at 402 American mothers and 291 fathers in dual-earner. families who completed a survey and a time and emotions diary. Asst. Professor Offer found that working mothers engaged in mental labour in about. one fourth of their waking time. Working fathers spent one fifth of their working time engaged in it. This amounts to approximately 29 and 24 hours per week of mental labour for mothers and fathers, respectively. Working guilt: Sarah Jessica Parker starred in the film 'I Don't Know How She Does It', playing ever-juggling working mother Kate Reddy. However,. mothers and fathers both spent about 30 percent of the time they were. engaged in mental labour thinking about family matters. Last year, Victoria Beckham spoke of her guilt of going out to work. Mrs Beckham - mother to Brooklyn, 14, Romeo, 11, Cruz, eight, and Harper, two, - admitted balancing her parenting duties with managing her clothing empire leaves her feeling 'constantly guilty'. Speaking at London's Vogue Festival, the 39-year-old, said: 'I think you feel so torn, don't you? But I've got great people who handle my schedule and everything does revolve around the children.' Commenting on her research, Asst. Professor Offer said: 'What my research actually shows is that gender differences in. mental labour are more a matter of quality than quantity. 'I assume that because mothers. bear the major responsibility for childcare and family life, when they. think about family matters, they tend to think about the less pleasant. aspects of it and are more likely to be worried.' Asst. Prof Offer added: 'We know that mothers are the ones who usually adjust. their work schedule to meet family demands, such as staying home with a. sick child. 'Desperate to be with her': Daybreak presenter Lorraine Kelly said last year that she 'suffered terribly from working mother guilt' 'Therefore,. mothers may feel that they do not devote enough time to their job and. have to ‚Äòcatch up,‚Äô and, as a result, they are easily preoccupied with. job-related matters outside the workplace. 'This illustrates the double burden, the pressure to be \\"good\\" mothers and \\"good\\" workers, that working mums experience. 'I thought that highly educated fathers holding professional and managerial positions would often be preoccupied with job matters when doing things such as housework or during their free time. 'It appears, however, that fathers are quite adept at leaving their work concerns behind and are better able to draw boundaries between work and home. 'I believe that fathers can afford to do that because someone else, namely their spouse, assumes the major responsibility for the household and childcare.' She added: 'It is true that fathers today are more involved in childrearing and do more housework than in previous generations, but the major responsibility for the domestic realm continues to disproportionately fall on mothers‚Äô shoulders and this has to change.' Highlights:","completion":"1. Working moms have a double guilt burden - they feel like bad moms when they work, and bad employees when they have a family. 2. Researchers found that working moms worry more about their jobs outside the office than dads and have more negative thoughts about their family while at work. 3.

Once you've taught your fish how to swim through hoops, they should be able to swim through and around anything with some guidance. Be patient when teaching your fish how to swim through an obstacle course, as it may take some time. Your fish will most likely follow your finger around once it has mastered that trick, so lead your fish through its obstacle course. Start with simple obstacle courses, and make them harder once your fish starts to master the obstacles. Use a treat on a string or a hood to lead your fish around instead of your finger. If you want your fish to follow you all around the tank, it may be hard for you to use your finger. Stick a treat on a hook, stick, or string and move it around the course so that the fish follows it. Make sure the fish doesn't get the treat until it's finished the course. Just like all the other tricks, positive reinforcement will help train your fish quickly. Give them a treat every time they complete the obstacle course.

Knut's restricted diet, intended to curtail the natural weight gain necessary to survive harsh winters, made headlines outside of Germany. His daily meals were reduced in number from four to three, and treats, such as croissants, which were favored by the young polar bear, were restricted. After he hurt his foot while slipping on a wet rock in his enclosure a month later in September, there was an outpouring of concern and support from fans worldwide.In November 2007 and weighing over 90 kg (198 lb), Knut was deemed too dangerous for close handling and his interaction with human handlers was further diminished. The celebration of the cub's first birthday, which was attended by hundreds of children, was broadcast live on German television. The national mint also issued 25,000 special commemorative silver coins to mark his birthday. Knut's role at the Berlin Zoo was to have included his becoming an \\"attractive stud\\" for other zoos in order to help preserve his species.

Here is an article: Updated MAY 04, 2014 3:12a ET After waiting 20 years to meet in the playoffs, the Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks provided an overtime thriller in the opening tussle for Southern California supremacy. Marian Gaborik scored with seven seconds left in regulation to force overtime, and then scored 12:07 into the extra period to lift the Kings to a 3-2 victory Saturday night. Wresting home-ice advantage from the Ducks comes after the Kings staged a memorable comeback against San Jose, becoming the fourth NHL team to win a best-of-seven series after losing the first three games. \\"It was awesome. Really, it was what you expect,\\" Kings coach Darryl Sutter said. \\"It was a physical game. I think the crowd really responded to that.\\" Gaborik redirected Anze Kopitar's shot past Jonas Hiller for the winner before being mobbed in the corner by his teammates. \\"We did a good job on the forecheck,\\" Gaborik said. \\"The puck got to Kopi, he saw me driving to the net, and made a nice play. I just tried to tip it in.\\" Gaborik \\"is a big reason that we won the first round, and if he hadn't finished some of those opportunities it would have only gone six,\\" Sutter said. \\"If you look at both those goals, those are classic goals. You got to go to the net to score in the playoffs. \\"Doesn't matter if we pull the goalie, still got to go to the net. Not many guys can score those goals, but you still got to go to the net.\\" Hiller said the Kings \\"suddenly had a 2-on-1 out of nowhere. It was a shot-pass that went off the post and off my back and in. It's too bad. We had a couple chances in OT to finish it, but at the end it's still a 1-0 series. We need to focus on the next game and learn from this. We have room for improvement.\\" The Ducks and their fans -- who got to chant \\"Beat LA!\\" for the first time in the postseason -- appeared poised for a win after 43-year-old Teemu Selanne beat Jonathan Quick between the pads for a go-ahead goal with 11:52 to play in regulation. It was the first goal and fourth point of the playoffs for the Finnish Flash, who plans to retire at season's end. But the Kings pulled Quick for a sixth attacker with 1:22 left. In the closing seconds, Mike Richards took a shot from along the left boards, and Gaborik wristed the rebound past Hiller, who slumped in the net after giving up the tying goal. \\"They just threw it at the net,\\" Hiller said. \\"I thought I got a piece of it, but it got up in the air and he batted it out of the air back door. We weren't strong enough. We were too passive there.\\" Gaborik also had an assist on L.A.'s first goal of the night. Quick, who led the Kings to their only Stanley Cup championship two years ago, came up big several times in overtime. Even when he didn't, the Kings held off the Ducks. Quick got out of position during one wild scramble and defenseman Alec Martinez jumped into the net until Quick recovered. \\"Unbelievable. It was a little chaotic. Probably owe him dinner there,\\" Quick said. Their rinks just 30 miles apart, the Kings and Ducks have played each other 117 times in the regular season since Anaheim entered the NHL as a Disney-backed expansion franchise in 1993. They even met at Dodger Stadium in January, with the Ducks winning 3-0. But never in the playoffs, until Saturday night in Orange County. Game 2 is Monday night at Anaheim. The Ducks advanced after beating Dallas in overtime in Game 6 of their opening series. Martinez scored his first goal of the playoffs on a power play 9:04 into the game, beating Hiller on the glove side with a backhander after taking a pass from Gaborik from behind the net. Nick Bonino was in the penalty box for hooking. Anaheim's Matt Belesky tied it less than three minutes later after a beauty of an assist by Ryan Getzlaf. Getzlaf skated into the Kings zone and behind the net, drawing Quick out of the crease. He passed to Belesky in the slot, who put home a wrister before Quick could get back into position. It was Belesky's second goal of the playoffs. Getzlaf, who also assisted on Selanne's goal, has nine points in the playoffs. Hiller, a veteran who came in and saved Game 6 against Dallas -- and beat the Kings at Dodger Stadium -- got the start over 24-year-old Frederik Andersen.

A remix album, titled Year Zero Remixed, was released in November 2007. Due to the expiration of his contract with Interscope Records, the album's release, marketing, and promotion were completely in Reznor's control. The album features remixes from artists including The Faint, Ladytron, Bill Laswell, Saul Williams, Olof Dreijer of The Knife, and Sam Fogarino of Interpol. Reznor himself strongly supports fan-made remixes of songs from the album, as evidenced by his decision to upload every song in multi-track form to the then-newly launched Nine Inch Nails remix website. Instrumental versions of the songs on Year Zero are available at the site for download in multiple formats, including MP3, WAV, GarageBand, and Ableton Live formats. A planned film adaption of Year Zero became a television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched the idea to television networks. The 2007‚Äì08 Writers Guild of America strike affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is \\"still churning along\\", and that he had begun working with American film producer Lawrence Bender.

However, they do ultimately convey the same meaning, just expressed differently. Both sentences provide information about the location of Suq Al Lail, that it is a neighborhood in Mecca, which is situated in western Saudi Arabia within the Makkah Province. The first sentence: \\"Suq Al Lail is a neighborhood of Mecca in Makkah Province, in western Saudi Arabia.\\" In this sentence, the information is presented by first stating that Suq Al Lail is a neighborhood of Mecca, followed by its placement within Makkah Province. Lastly, it informs us that the province is located in western Saudi Arabia. The structure of the sentence is more linear, moving from the specific neighborhood through the geographical context (province) to the wider location (Saudi Arabia). The second sentence: \\"Suq Al Lail is a neighborhood of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, in the western province of Makkah.\\" This sentence conveys the same meaning but structures the information differently. It first states that Suq Al Lail is a neighborhood in Mecca and immediately places it within the context of Saudi Arabia. Then, it specifies that the province of Makkah is the western province in which Mecca is located. This sentence has a slightly different flow, presenting a broader context first (Saudi Arabia) before specifying the province (Makkah).

Paragraph: (CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

Dhanusha, Nepal (CNN)At Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport, hundreds of migrant workers line up daily at the immigration counters, clutching newly printed passports and boarding passes. Many of them, though, are clueless as to where they're headed. As a frequent traveler to the country, I've been approached many times by these men, asking me to help fill out their departure forms. Usually, when I ask what country they're traveling to, I get the same answer: \\"I'm not sure.\\" They seem weary and lost but still hopeful that they can make their lives better. This time, however, I'm at the airport to follow up on the repatriation of the most unfortunate of these migrant workers -- far too many of them make the return journey in caskets. Almost every day, the remains of three or four workers arrive back in Nepal from the Middle East, according to Bhola Prasad Siwakoti, the secretary of the Nepalese Ministry of Labor and Manpower. Every other day, at least one dead body arrives from Qatar, he said. \\"Nepali migrant workers have the lowest per capita income in Qatar,\\" says Suryanath Mishra, who served as ambassador to Qatar from 2007 to 2012. \\"They get exploited the most out of all the migrant workers.\\" He cites lack of education and technical skills as the main causes. We are waiting for the body of Kishun Das, who left Nepal for Qatar only eight months ago. The 38-year old was his family's breadwinner and the father of five children.

More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable. It was fiscal suicide. The hospital was perfectly willing to let the local experts in deadbeats handle the workload. Tonight, Ray could tell them no.

Sentence from a movie review: infrequently breathtaking Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the given sentence from a movie review, which says \\"infrequently breathtaking,\\" it is difficult to conclude whether the movie was viewed positively or negatively without more context. The term \\"breathtaking\\" implies that there were impressive or stunning aspects of the movie, such as its visuals, cinematography, acting, or other elements. However, the use of \\"infrequently\\" suggests that these moments of breathtaking wonder were not consistently present throughout the film. In some cases, the reviewer might have appreciated those sporadic extraordinary moments, seeing them as interesting highlights that stood out amid an otherwise mediocre or dull film. In such a scenario, the movie could be seen as somewhat positively by the reviewer because of its moments of greatness. This might encourage the audience to watch the movie for these specific thrilling segments, even if they have to tolerate other less engaging parts. On the other hand, the reviewer might have felt disappointed that these occasional breathtaking points weren't enough to elevate the overall quality of the movie. They may have expected more consistent brilliance and found it lacking, which would lead them to view the film negatively. For example, the movie may have failed to meet the expectations set by its promotional materials, talent involved, or source material. In this case, the infrequency of such breathtaking moments may not be sufficient to compensate for the underwhelming aspects of the film. Ultimately, it is not possible to determine whether this movie was considered positively or negatively based solely on the sentence provided.

However, we can analyze the given information and deduce a general rating. Considering the use of the word \\"good,\\" which conveys a positive sentiment, we can establish that the review is favorable. Consequently, we can assert that the rating should be at least average or higher. This would translate to a rating of three stars (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ) or more. To arrive at a better understanding, a detailed analysis could be done by comparing the given review to other reviews that have similar wording and their respective star ratings. For instance, if a majority of reviews containing the word \\"good\\" have a 4-star rating, then this review would likely fall into that range. Nonetheless, one must proceed with caution in drawing a definitive conclusion from this single-word review. A more accurate rating determination would necessitate additional context and information about the user's experience with the app. Taking these factors into account, it can be estimated that the star rating for this review likely falls between ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (average) and ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (above average).

Information: - A pub, or public house, is an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic drinks, which traditionally include beer, ale and other brewed alcoholic drinks. It is a relaxed, social drinking establishment and a prominent part of British culture, Irish culture, New Zealand culture and Australian culture. In many places, especially in villages, a pub is the focal point of the community. In his 17th century diary Samuel Pepys described the pub as \\"the heart of England.\\" - Samuel Pepys (; 23 February 1633 26 May 1703) was an administrator of the navy of England and Member of Parliament who is most famous for the diary that he kept for a decade while still a relatively young man. Pepys had no maritime experience, but he rose to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and King James II through patronage, hard work, and his talent for administration. His influence and reforms at the Admiralty were important in the early professionalisation of the Royal Navy. - Introduction. An award is something given to a person, a group of people, or an organization to recognize their excellence in a certain field; a certificate of excellence. Awards are often signified by trophies, titles, certificates, commemorative plaques, medals, badges, pins, or ribbons. An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient; for example, the Nobel Prize for contributions to society or the Pulitzer Prize for literary achievements. An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize of excellence. - A resource is a source or supply from which benefit is produced. Resources are two types based upon their availability they are renewable and non renewable resource s.Typically resources are materials, energy, services, staff, knowledge, or other assets that are transformed to produce benefit and in the process may be consumed or made unavailable. Benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth or wants, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well being. From a human perspective a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants. From a broader biological or ecological perspective a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism (see biological resource). - Leadership is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or organization to \\"lead\\" or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations. The literature debates various viewpoints: contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) US vs. European approaches. US academic environments define leadership as \\"a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task\\". Leadership seen from a European and non-academic perspective encompasses a view of a leader who can be moved not only by communitarian goals but also by the search for personal power. - In game theory and economic theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. Thus, cutting a cake, where taking a larger piece reduces the amount of cake available for others, is a zero-sum game if all participants value each unit of cake equally (see marginal utility). - A drinking establishment is a business whose primary function is the serving of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Some establishments may also serve food, or have entertainment, but their main purpose is to serve alcoholic beverages. There are different types of drinking establishment ranging from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed \\"dive bars\\", to 5,000 seat beer halls and elegant places of entertainment for the elite. A public house, informally known as a \\"pub\\", is an establishment licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises in countries and regions of British influence. Although the terms are increasingly used to refer to the same thing, there is a difference between pubs, bars, inns, taverns and lounges where alcohol is served commercially. A tavern or pot-house is, loosely, a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and, more than likely, also be served food, though not licensed to put up guests. The word derives from the Latin \\"taberna\\" and the Greek \\"\\"/taverna. - A game is structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games). - An alcoholic drink, or alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains a substantial amount of ethanol (informally called \\"alcohol\\"), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism. - The National Pub of the Year is an annual competition held by CAMRA in February that finds the best pub in the UK . Established in 1988 , the competition helps to highlight quality pubs around the UK that are worth seeking out and visiting . Each year , each local CAMRA branch nominates one pub in their area to be entered . These 200 pubs then go through to the regional competition , which then whittles down to 4 pubs to go to the national final . The pubs in the national final are evaluated on : Quality of the Real Ales served Value for money Atmosphere Interior decoration Customer service and welcome - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties. - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. - Competition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (a zero-sum game).

General Dix Hauser Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Dix Hauser: A Brawl to Remember\\" Plot Summary: In a small, quiet Midwestern town, General Dix Hauser, a battle-hardened military veteran now leading a reclusive life, finds himself drawn to a local dive bar, \\"Benny's,\\" as his sanctuary where he tries to escape from the ghosts of his past. Little does he know that his presence at Benny's will spark a chain of events that will change the whole town's demeanor and earn him both allies and enemies that he never could have expected. Act 1: The movie begins by introducing General Dix Hauser as an enigmatic and silent regular patron at Benny's bar. The bar is seen as a melting pot, inhabited by people from various walks of life, each escaping their troubles with a drink. Hauser himself is a solitary figure who has shut himself off from the world, haunted by memories of his past military missions and personal losses. There he finds solace in the company of Jenny, the warmhearted bartender who seems to be the only person in town who understands him. One fateful evening, a group of rowdy out-of-town bikers arrives at Benny's, led by a cunning and ruthless man named Cash. As the night progresses, Cash and his gang become increasingly aggressive and confrontational, harassing the bar's regular customers, including Hauser. Unable to bear the sight of innocent people struggling, Hauser decides to intervene, sparking a huge bar fight. Act 2: The brawl results in serious damage to the bar and several injuries, leaving Benny's as the talk of the town. Cash swears revenge on Hauser for humiliating him in front of his gang and framing him for the brawl. Simultaneously, he plots to take over the town's criminal underbelly, setting up illegal operations ranging from drug trafficking to illegal betting rings. Slowly, tension builds up in the town among its citizens as their once peaceful and friendly community descends into darkness. Meanwhile, Hauser's actions earn him the admiration of many townspeople, with some taking a stand with him against Cash's criminal activities. Among them is a group of former soldiers who served alongside Hauser, who are galvanized to take a stand with their former leader, seeing in him a chance to forge a better future for their town. Together, they form a ragtag militia with the aim of stopping Cash's evil plans. Act 3: The climax of the film sees Hauser and his loyal band confront Cash and his gang in a final battle to save the town and the people they care for. The action-packed showdown takes place in a cat-and-mouse game across several iconic locations of the town, ending back at Benny's, the place where it all began. In the end, it is a battle-hardened Hauser who manages to defeat Cash, finally coming to terms with his own demons long enough to put his past behind him and use his skills for the greater good. As Cash is arrested and his gang dismantled, Hauser's life begins to change as he realizes that he has found a new purpose and a sense of belonging within the community. The film concludes with a scene of Hauser, again seated at Benny's, no longer a lonely, tormented man, but surrounded by his newfound comrades. Together, they raise a toast to the brighter future they have fought for, as the camera pans out to reveal a bustling and rejuvenated town, the spirit of unity and resilience shining through."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about Intel's announcement of a delay in the production and release of its highly anticipated television chips, which are based on the Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCOS) technology. LCOS technology is a type of micro-display innovation with the potential to significantly lower the cost of large-screen TVs, making them more affordable for consumers. The decision to delay the release of these chips may have potential implications for the market and the adoption of LCOS technology in the television industry. LCOS technology functions by reflecting and modulating light through liquid crystals instead of directly transmitting light as traditional LCD displays do. This approach can lead to improvements in the quality of images, high-definition resolution, and overall visual performance, as well as offering cost benefits. Intel's announcement of delaying the highly anticipated television chips could be attributed to various reasons, including technical challenges, the need for further refinement, possible competition with related technologies, or strategic considerations. This likely affects not only Intel's own product development plans but also the broader television market, manufacturers, and consumers who might have been eagerly awaiting the introduction of large-screen TVs with LCOS technology at significantly reduced prices. In summary, the text is about Intel's decision to postpone the launch of its innovative television chips built on LCOS technology, which has the potential to considerably decrease the cost of large-screen TVs.

Despite possibly winning the short-term political blame game concerning the budget, Obama finds himself in a losing position due to increased dysfunction in Washington. Step 1: Discuss President Obama's re-election and initial call to action - Mention Obama's high hopes and renewed energy for his second term in office - Provide examples of his progressive goals and ambitious plans he laid out during his re-election campaign - Highlight the optimism among supporters and the expectation for significant progress on key issues Step 2: Analyze the legislative disappointments of 2013 - Detail the major setbacks and challenges Obama faced in pushing his agenda forward - Examine the reasons behind the failures, including opposition from Republicans and internal divisions among Democrats - Discuss the impact of these failures on the overall perception of the President and his administration Step 3: Delve into Obama's potential \\"win\\" in the political blame game on the budget - Explain the dynamics of the budget debate and how Obama may succeed in shifting the blame onto the Republicans - Discuss the implications of this \\"win\\" for the short-term political landscape in Washington - Argue that despite this perceived victory, Obama is ultimately losing in the broader sense due to the continued deterioration of the political climate in the capital Step 4: Examine the deepening dysfunction in Washington - Assess the impact of partisanship and gridlock on the legislative process - Analyze the role of President Obama in either contributing to, or trying to alleviate, the dysfunction - Debate whether this dysfunction will persist throughout the remainder of Obama's term, and what the potential consequences could be for his legacy and for the country Conclusion: In the face of President Obama's high hopes for his second term, the reality of the legislative landscape in 2013 has proven to be a significant disappointment. Despite the possibility of a short-term \\"win\\" in the budget blame game, President Obama is ultimately losing out due to the deepening dysfunction in Washington. As this dysfunction threatens to engulf his second term, it remains to be seen if he can successfully navigate the troubled political waters and leave a lasting, positive impact on the nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given those answer options, answer the question: After their cat developed a cyst on its face, Cameron took it to the veterinarian. Given the context: What will happen to the cat? A:","completion":"After Cameron takes their cat to the veterinarian due to the development of a cyst on its face, the most likely scenario, considering the options provided, is that the cat will be prescribed strong antibiotics to treat the cyst. The veterinarian will first assess the cyst to determine its severity, underlying cause, and the best course of action. In many cases, cysts can result from an infection, such as bacterial or fungal, or they can also be the result of inflammation due to an allergy or some other irritant. The vet may take a sample of the cyst contents to examine it under a microscope, or possibly to conduct a biopsy if they are concerned about the potential of it being a cancerous growth. Once the veterinarian has ruled out more serious concerns and identified the underlying cause, they will likely prescribe strong antibiotics, which Cameron's cat will need to take according to the prescribed regimen. Antibiotics are a common treatment option for bacterial infections and will usually help reduce inflammation and heal the cyst. In some cases, the veterinarian may also drain the cyst to make the healing process faster and to prevent further complications. Throughout the healing process, Cameron needs to closely monitor their cat and ensure it is taking the antibiotics as prescribed. They should also keep an eye on the cyst to ensure it doesn't worsen or start to affect the cat's overall health. Signs such as lack of appetite, lethargy, and increased pain could indicate that the treatment is not working and that Cameron should consult the veterinarian again. Considering the provided answer options, being put up for adoption is not a suitable option for the cat, since Cameron is its owner, and they have already taken the initiative to bring the cat to the vet for treatment. The cat is not a stray or abandoned, and thus, there is no reason for adoption to be a viable solution. In summary, the most probable outcome for Cameron's cat, given the context and answer options, is that it will be prescribed strong antibiotics by the veterinarian to counter the infection and to treat the cyst on its face. With proper care and medication, Cameron's cat should be on the road to recovery and will be able to return to its normal, healthy life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Line your eyelids strategically with eyeliner. Use lengthening mascara on the lashes of your smaller eye. Put eyelid tape on your eyelids to lift the skin.\\"","completion":"Title: Enhancing Eye Symmetry: A Comprehensive Guide to Makeup Techniques Introduction: Eyes are often considered the windows to the soul, and their symmetry plays a crucial role in making our faces appear more even and attractive. However, no one's face is entirely symmetrical; it's perfectly natural to have slight variations in eye shape, size, and even position. The great news is that makeup provides a powerful tool to enhance the beauty of your eyes and create a more balanced appearance. In this article, we'll explore the top techniques to make your eyes appear more symmetrical using eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, and eyelid tape. 1. Eyeshadow Application to Create Symmetry Applying eyeshadow strategically can greatly enhance the symmetry of your eyes. Here are some key steps to achieving a balanced look: A. Choose Complementary Colors: Select eyeshadow shades that complement your eye color, skin tone, and your overall makeup look. For daily wear, opt for neutral shades, while for special occasions or nights out, feel free to experiment with more vibrant colors. B. Prime Your Eyelids: Apply an eyeshadow primer to your eyelids before applying the eyeshadow. This step creates a smooth canvas for the eyeshadow and ensures it lasts throughout the day without creasing or fading. C. Apply Base Shadow: Apply a light-colored eyeshadow all over your eyelid as a base. This will set the tone for your look and provide a foundation to build other colors upon. D. Contour and Highlight: Use a slightly darker shade to contour the crease of each eye. This will create depth and dimension. If one eye appears smaller, contour this eye slightly higher and blend well to make both eyes look even. Apply a highlight shade under the brow bone and the inner corner of each eye to lift and illuminate those areas. 2. Strategic Eyeliner Application Eyeliner can either accentuate eye asymmetry or work wonders to balance it out. Here's how you can strategically apply eyeliner to create symmetry: A. Choose the Right Eyeliner: Select an eyeliner that glides smoothly and blends easily for a seamless look. You can choose from a variety of formulas, such as pencil, gel, or liquid. B. Start by Mapping Out Your Line: Before applying the eyeliner, visualize how the liner should follow the natural shape of your eyes. Map it out in your mind, focusing on the areas that need more emphasis for an even appearance. C. Apply Eyeliner on both Eyes: Start by drawing a thin line following your upper lash line. For the smaller eye, you may want to make the line slightly thicker towards the outer corner to create an illusion of a larger and balanced eye. For the other eye, use a thinner line. Take time to analyze and compare both eyes to ensure that the eyeliner is applied evenly and symmetrically. 3. Lengthening Mascara for Smaller Eye Mascara can work wonders in opening up and balancing your eyes. For the smaller eye, focus on applying lengthening mascara on the lashes, concentrating on the outer corner of the eye. This will help create an illusion of larger and more symmetrical eyes. For the other eye, apply mascara evenly, focusing on separating the lashes to avoid clumps. 4. Eyelid Tape for Instant Lift Eyelid tape is an excellent tool in lifting and balancing the skin on the eyelids. This semi-permanent solution works by applying a small piece of adhesive tape on the eyelid crease, instantly providing your eyes with a more even and symmetrical appearance. Follow these steps to apply eyelid tape: A. Clean the Eyelid: Ensure your eyelid is clean and free of any makeup or oils, as this will help the tape adhere well. B. Cut the Tape: Cut a small piece of tape based on the size of your eyelid. Depending on your eye shape and desired symmetry, you may want to cut it into a crescent shape or keep it as a straight strip. C. Apply the Tape: Using a tweezer, place the tape on the upper eyelid skin. Press gently and adjust as needed to create a natural-looking crease that balances both eyes. D. Blend with Makeup: After applying the eyelid tape, use eyeshadow, and eyeliner to blend the tape seamlessly with your overall makeup look. Conclusion: With these strategic makeup techniques, you can enhance your eye symmetry and achieve a more well-balanced appearance. Remember that practice makes perfect, and as you refine your makeup skills, the more naturally symmetrical your eyes will appear. Embrace the unique beauty of your eyes and remember to let your confidence shine through."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

B). fruits were just easier for him..","completion":"Growing vegetables was a success for the man, but he could never grow fruits, as vegetables were just easier for him to cultivate and maintain in comparison to the fruit varieties. Various factors contributed to his thriving vegetable garden and his inability to grow fruits successfully. The man had a natural affinity and understanding for nurturing vegetables, as he was familiar with their growth patterns, nutritional needs, and seasonal demands. He had acquired substantial knowledge about vegetables over the years through research, trial and error, and his observations of other successful gardens. This expertise allowed him to create a nurturing environment for vegetable growth that matched the specific needs of each plant ‚Äì whether it be the soil type, watering schedule, or the amount of sunlight and shade each plant required. Furthermore, his location and local climate played a significant role in the success of his vegetable garden. The region in which he lived might have been more favorable for vegetable cultivation, providing the right combination of temperature, humidity, and seasonal changes to help vegetables thrive. This factor could also contribute to his inability to grow fruits, as certain fruit varieties require specific climate conditions that might not have existed in his area. In addition to climate constraints, the man's lack of knowledge about fruit cultivation could have played a role in his failure to yield a successful fruit garden. Growing fruits can be more challenging than vegetables, as they often require additional care, such as pruning, disease prevention, and proper pollination techniques. Moreover, certain fruit varieties can be more susceptible to pests, which may have caused a significant setback in his attempt to grow them. Finally, the space available in his garden might have limited the man's capacity to grow fruits, as many fruit trees need ample room for root growth and may require more space to mature compared to vegetables. The available soil quality may not have been favorable for fruit trees, as they typically demand specific nutrient compositions and pH levels to grow and produce fruit. In conclusion, the success of the man's vegetable garden was primarily driven by his extensive knowledge, favorable climate, and suitable space for growing vegetables. However, his inability to grow fruits could be attributed to the lack of proper information about fruit cultivation, unsuitable climate conditions for specific fruit varieties, increased susceptibility to pests and diseases, and available garden space. With the right information, resources, and adjustments in his gardening practices, the man might be able to overcome these challenges and achieve success in growing fruits as well."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
