Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. and the situation: John wanted to charge his electronic gadgets remotely. To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C. Answer the following question: Would the objects be closer to or farther from each other in case A than in case B? Answer:","completion":"The objects would be closer to each other in case A than in case B. In case A (charging by conduction), the objects need to touch each other for the electrons to transfer and even out the charge. In case B (charging by induction), the objects do not have to touch each other, as the charge transfer occurs due to the influence of the charged object's electric field on the uncharged object. Therefore, there is some distance between the objects in case B."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

He was a vice-president of the CBS Entertainment division. He later became the president of Entertainment at Fox Broadcasting in September 1995. In 1996 he became the president of HBO. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? John Matoian was an tv industry executive in the mid 90s","completion":"Yes, the next sentence does follow, given the preceding text. The information provided about John Matoian's career in the television industry aligns with the statement that he was a TV industry executive in the mid-90s. Here is an elaboration: John Matoian, born in 1949, has had an impressive career in the television industry as a businessman and executive. Initially serving as a vice-president of CBS Entertainment, Matoian's primary responsibility was developing and overseeing content for primetime, late night, and daytime programming. In this capacity, he played a vital role in shaping the direction of the network's offerings and increasing its viewership. In September 1995, Matoian took up the position of president of Entertainment at Fox Broadcasting. With this move, he continued his work as a television industry executive and expanded his influence in the world of media. During his tenure at Fox, he contributed to the network's growth in ratings and charted a new course for the type of programming that viewers would come to know and love. Matoian's career continued to evolve, and in 1996, just a year after joining Fox Broadcasting, he became the president of HBO. Here, he was responsible for overseeing the production and development of all HBO entertainment programming, including television series, movies, specials, and miniseries. Under Matoian's leadership, HBO solidified its standing as a premier provider of innovative and critically acclaimed programming. This role further cemented Matoian's status as a leading executive in the television industry during the mid-90s. Given John Matoian's various roles in the television sector, including his positions at CBS, Fox Broadcasting, and HBO, it is accurate to state that he was a TV industry executive in the mid-90s. His influence on popular programming and media culture from that era is evident through the numerous projects overseen and guided by his expertise during this time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick your answer from: (i) yes (ii) it is not possible to tell (iii) no","completion":"(ii) it is not possible to tell In order to analyze this multi-choice question, let's dissect both sentences and understand the logical relationship between the two. Sentence 1: The intensity of the expression she had surprised had impressed her powerfully. This sentence states that the intensity of a particular expression she had surprised (possibly referring to the surprise expressed by her) had a powerful impression on her. It does not provide information about how often she has intense expressions or how other people reacted to her expressions. Sentence 2: She had intense expressions and people were amazed, since she rarely had strong feelings. This sentence states that she generally has intense expressions, people are amazed by her expressions, and the reason behind their amazement is that she rarely showcases strong feelings. This sentence provides information on the frequency of her intense expressions (rarely) and other people's reactions to her expressions (amazed). Now, when comparing both sentences, we can see that the first sentence does not give enough information to draw a conclusion about the second sentence. The first sentence simply discusses one instance of her intense expression that had a powerful impression on her. On the other hand, the second sentence generalizes her expressions, their rare occurrence, and people's amazement. As the information presented in the first sentence does not clarify whether she has intense expressions generally, or how other people responded to her expressions, it is not possible to tell if the second sentence is true or false based on the first sentence alone. Therefore, the correct answer is (ii) it is not possible to tell."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The family of Tamerlan and Dzhokar Tsarnaev, the alleged Boston bombers, have, like all their ethnic kin, led lives marked by violence and deportation. Chechnya is a small land in the Caucasus mountains that was one of the last places to be conquered by the Russian empire in the 19th century. Chechens are also Muslims. In February 1944, Joseph Stalin added them to his list of \\"punished peoples,\\" whole ethnic groups who were deemed disloyal to the Soviet Union and subjected to wholesale deportation. Every Chechen -- man, woman and child -- was packed into freight cars and shipped to the freezing steppe of Soviet Central Asia. The republic of Chechnya was erased from the map. Around a quarter of the 400,000 deported Chechens died in the process. It was only 13 years later, after Stalin's death, that they were miraculously forgiven and allowed to return home. But some, including members of the Tsarnaev family, stayed on in places like the republic of Kyrgyzstan. Chechnya has a warrior tradition and many Chechen males and their fellow","completion":"Caucasians have often found themselves fighting for their homeland, their rights, and their identity. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Chechnya declared independence, but Russia was unwilling to let them go. This led to a brutal war between Russia and Chechnya, and later, to a second conflict in the late 1990s. The wars caused massive destruction, loss of life, and suffering for the Chechen people, leading many to seek refuge in other countries. In the years following, Chechnya has been struggling to rebuild and find peace. However, the lingering effects of war, poverty, and a sense of injustice have sometimes fueled radicalization, both in Chechnya and among the Chechen diaspora. This often results in some Chechens joining extremist groups or participating in acts of terrorism around the world. As for the Tsarnaev brothers, they found their way to the United States, where they lived seemingly normal lives. However, underneath the surface, they were grappling with their own identity and resentment, which ultimately led them to carry out the tragic Boston Marathon bombing in 2013. While it's essential to remember that the actions of these brothers do not represent the entire Chechen population, understanding the historical and cultural context can help shed light on the factors that contribute to such violent actions and provide a basis for encouraging healing, understanding, and integration among all communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is revealed that while they were there, James proposed to Kristen and she refused, claiming she is not ready for marriage yet. James calls his friend Mike to come pick him up in the morning. Shortly after 4 a.m., there is a knock at the door, surprising to them both since the house is so remote and far from any civilisation for miles. They open the door and a young blonde woman, whose face is obscured by low lighting, is standing on the porch asking for Tamara. When told that she is at the wrong house, she asks if they're sure, then leaves with the casual caveat that she will \\"see them later\\". Due to the tension between him and Kristen, James leaves to go for a drive and to buy cigarettes. While alone in the house, Kristen hears another knock at the door; she refuses to open it after realising that it is the same woman from earlier, who has returned to ask for Tamara again. She leaves. Kristen then starts hearing strange noises around the outside of the house and her cell phone goes missing. She calls James using the house phone but the line goes dead. The smoke alarm goes off and Kristen disarms it as there is another loud bang on the front door. She goes to the kitchen and grabs a large knife.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: A farm with a pasture for cattle and a grain silo near buildings.","completion":"In the sentence \\"A farm with a pasture for cattle and a grain silo near buildings,\\" the most important words are: 1. Farm: This is the main subject of the sentence. It sets the context of what type of area we are talking about and highlights the agricultural nature of the scene. 2. Pasture: This word helps to describe a key element of the farm by specifying an area where the cattle are kept and allowed to graze. It contributes to creating a vivid image of the scenery and functionality of the farm in the reader's mind. 3. Cattle: Although not the main subject, cattle play a significant role in the sentence as they reveal what type of livestock is present on the farm. This word suggests that the farm primarily focuses on raising cattle, which aids in understanding the farm's overall purpose. 4. Grain silo: This word introduces another important feature related to the farm and serves as a way to store harvested grains. The mention of the grain silo implies that the farm not only focuses on cattle but also engages in crop production to some extent. 5. Near: This term helps to clarify the position of the grain silo in relation to the buildings. It indicates that the silo and buildings are close to each other, setting a clearer spatial image of the farm's layout. 6. Buildings: This word highlights that there are other structures on the farm, apart from the pasture and grain silo. While it doesn't specify the type of buildings, their mention helps the reader further visualize the farm's setting, imagining various possibilities like barns, houses, or other agricultural facilities. These six words are crucial in developing a comprehensive understanding of the sentence by providing context and specific details about the farm, its purpose, and its primary components."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: While pomegranates are more of a shrub than tree if left to grow untrained, you can trim the plant so that it looks like a tree. This is something that many gardeners do. Using gardening shears or clippers, cut the suckers (the smaller branches that help the plant take on its shrub form) growing at the base of the plant so that it takes on more of a tree shape. Do this shortly after the plant has become established. If you don't care whether your plant is tree-like or not, let it grow naturally. You don't really need to prune your pomegranate tree to maintain it, but it is a good idea to cut away dead or dying branches in the spring to help the tree grow well. You can also thin the plant as you see necessary. If you are growing the pom in a container, you will need to prune and train a bit more heavily, in order to keep the pom the size and shape you want it to be. Avoid mold growth by making sure you do not over water the pom. The two other problems some pomegranates face are aphids and the pomegranate butterfly. You can kill aphids by using a spray bought at your local nursery or garden store. You can also use an integrated pest management practice for killing aphids, which may include attracting ladybugs, spraying trees with water to knock aphids down, or even purchasing predatory insects to consume the aphids. The pomegranate butterfly is not very common and should not be a problem. If it is, use a butterfly spray to rid your trees of the larvae.

'\\"Resonance is a special case of forced vibration' justify the given statement.?\\" What is daily work of R developers? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"1. Justification of the statement \\"Resonance is a special case of forced vibration\\": Step 1: Define forced vibration Forced vibration occurs when an external force is applied to a mechanical system, causing it to oscillate at a specific frequency. This external force can be periodic, driving the system to vibrate in a repetitive motion. Step 2: Define resonance Resonance occurs when the frequency of the external force applied to a mechanical system matches or is very close to the system's natural frequency. This causes the amplitude of the oscillation to increase significantly, leading to a maximum response of the system. Step 3: Relate resonance to forced vibration Resonance is a special case of forced vibration because it happens only when the frequency of the external force matches or is close to the system's natural frequency. In this unique scenario, the system exhibits an extreme response to the external force, with its amplitude growing significantly. Resonance emphasizes the impact of forced vibrations, as it highlights the critical conditions where a system might experience significant oscillations. So, to justify the statement \\"Resonance is a special case of forced vibration,\\" we can say that resonance is a particular situation within the broader context of forced vibrations, in which the frequency of the external force aligns with the system's natural frequency, causing an extraordinary response in the system's oscillatory behavior. 2.

Please answer the following question: The political landscape in the United States looks a bit different in the wake of Tuesday's Senate election victory by Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama. In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\\" Jones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans.

Answer the above question based on the context below: R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—\\"Radio Free Europe\\"—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \\"The One I Love\\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors.

Answer: Fluorescence has many practical applications, including mineralogy , gemology , chemical sensors ( fluorescence spectroscopy ), fluorescent labelling , dyes , biological detectors, and, most commonly, fluorescent lamps . Question: how does uv light activated fluorescence A:","completion":"UV light activates fluorescence through a process involving the absorption of energy by fluorescent molecules followed by emission of light at a longer wavelength. This process can be broken down into several stages, which will explain in detail how UV light activates fluorescence: 1. Absorption: The first stage in the process is the absorption of UV light by the fluorescent material. When a molecule absorbs ultraviolet radiation, its electrons become excited, gaining energy and reaching a higher level or excited state. In short, UV light provides the energy for electrons to move to a higher energy level. 2. Excitation: When a molecule becomes excited, the electrons move to a higher electron shell, or orbital, which is further away from the nucleus. The energy difference between the ground state and an excited state determines the specific wavelength of light that the molecule can absorb. This wavelength is typically in the UV region, though some molecules can also absorb visible light. 3. Vibrational Relaxation: After the electrons reach the excited state, the molecule undergoes a process called vibrational relaxation. In this stage, excess energy from the electron's excited state is released as thermal energy or heat to the surrounding environment. This process reduces the energy level of the electron slightly, while still remaining in the excited state. 4. Fluorescence Emission: Eventually, the excited electron returns to its original energy level, or ground state, through a process called fluorescence emission. As the electron transitions back to the ground state, it releases the stored energy in the form of light. This emitted light typically has a longer wavelength than the originally absorbed UV light, resulting in visible light that we perceive as fluorescence. 5. Intensity and Decay: The intensity of fluorescence depends on several factors, such as the concentration of fluorescent molecules and the efficiency with which the irradiating light is absorbed and re-emitted. After the emitted light is detected, the fluorescence decays or decreases over time when the molecules return to their ground state. This decay can occur over microseconds to seconds, depending on the type of fluorescent material. Fluorescence has many practical applications across various fields, thanks to its unique properties and ability to detect and analyze specific substances. Some of these applications include: - Mineralogy and gemology: Certain minerals and gemstones exhibit unique fluorescent colors when exposed to UV light, making it easier to identify them or distinguish fake gems from real ones. - Fluorescence spectroscopy: This technique allows researchers to study the structural and electronic properties of molecules, making it particularly useful in analytical chemistry and biology. - Fluorescent labeling: Attaching fluorescent dyes or tags to specific biomolecules allows scientists to track and visualize these molecules within cells or tissues, aiding in the understanding of cellular processes. - Chemical sensors: Since the fluorescence intensity is highly dependent on the surrounding environment, these sensors can be used to detect and quantify the presence of certain substances, such as metal ions or organic compounds. - Fluorescent lamps: By utilizing a phosphorescent material that emits visible light when excited by UV light, these lamps have become an energy-efficient alternative to traditional incandescent bulbs. In summary, UV light activates fluorescence by providing the necessary energy to excite electrons within molecules. This absorbed energy is then released in the form of visible light when the electron returns to its ground state, creating the characteristic glowing appearance that we associate with fluorescence. This process has a wide range of applications across various fields, including mineralogy, gemology, chemistry, biology, and lighting technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The frantic Jonathan explains that he is the secret lover of flamboyant stage actress/singer, Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich). He claims that Charlotte visited him after killing her husband in an argument. She was wearing a bloodstained dress and Jonathan agreed to go back to her house and obtain another one. He found the body of Mr. Inwood at the residence, took a spare dress from the wardrobe and then tried to simulate a burglary gone wrong, only to be caught in the act by Charlotte's theatre maid and dresser, Nellie Goode (Kay Walsh). He is now on the run, wanted by the police.Eve has long had a crush on Jonathan, but accepts that he is not interested in her romantically. She takes him to hide in a house near the coast owned by her father, Commodore Gill (Alastair Sim).

Question: If you entire body is experiencing fatigue what would you do at the end of the day? Choices: - sleep - sit down - sit on chair - have rest - lie on floor The rationale to choose \\"sleep\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Sleep is the most appropriate choice when experiencing full body fatigue at the end of the day because it provides the mind and body with the necessary restorative and regenerative advantages. The following points support this rationale: 1. Quality sleep is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being. It enables the body to restore itself and prepare for the next day by improving the immune system, repairing tissues, and recharging the brain. This is particularly important for individuals experiencing mental or physical stress, as it reduces inflammation and aids in muscle repair. 2. Sleep is critical for cognitive function, memory consolidation, and emotional well-being. A good night's sleep enhances learning, creativity, problem-solving, and decision-making capabilities, while also helping in regulating emotions, such as anxiety and depression. Fatigue may be an indicator of inadequate rest, and choosing to sleep over other options can directly address the issue that caused the fatigue in the first place. 3. The other options - sitting down, sitting on a chair, having a rest, or lying on the floor - may provide temporary relief from fatigue, but they do not offer the same level of rejuvenation and restoration that comes with quality sleep. 4. Choosing to sleep over other alternatives contributes to the regulation of mood and stress levels. Adequate sleep can directly affect the production of stress hormones like cortisol and positively influence the regulation of other hormones, such as melatonin and serotonin. This, in turn, helps combat stress, anxiety, and other emotional states that may contribute to or result from fatigue. 5. Sleep also plays a role in maintaining a healthy metabolism. Chronic fatigue may be a sign that the body is not getting enough rest, which can lead to difficulty in maintaining a healthy weight and normal metabolic function. Proper sleep helps regulate metabolism and appetite, further supporting overall health and wellness. 6. Choosing sleep over other options at the end of the day may help to establish a healthy sleep schedule. Having a consistent sleep routine can lead to improved sleep quality and increased energy levels during the day, ultimately reducing fatigue and supporting overall well-being. In conclusion, if experiencing full-body fatigue at the end of the day, the most beneficial response would be to sleep. Sleep offers a comprehensive restoration of the body's physical, cognitive, and emotional systems, enabling a person to function optimally during their waking hours. The other alternatives may offer some temporary relief, but they lack the restorative power of quality sleep, making \\"sleep\\" the optimal choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: The man enjoyed sitting quietly by himself, he felt it helped him come up with his best what about things? Options: - anxiety - happiness - insights - inspiration - wisdom The answer is \\"insights\\" because Answer:","completion":"The man enjoyed sitting quietly by himself, as he felt it helped him come up with his best insights about things. The reason the answer is \\"insights\\" rather than the other options is because insights refer to a deep understanding or realization about something, often gained from quiet reflection or introspection. By contrast, anxiety is a feeling of unease or worry, happiness is a state of well-being or contentment, inspiration is the stimulation of creativity or ideas, and wisdom is the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment. When one sits quietly alone, it allows the mind to process thoughts and experiences without being influenced by external factors such as conversations, distractions, or feelings of anxiety or happiness. This quiet time can lead to new perspectives, a better understanding of situations, or the ability to think outside the box – all of which are aspects of gaining insights. In this context, the man's best insights are likely to be a result of his quiet, solitary moments allowing him to deeply reflect on various topics, enabling him to discover new ideas, understand complex situations, and potentially find innovative solutions to problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Process: - Electromagnet creates magnetic field with electricity - Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electric current gets introduced from power source - Flows through the wire - Magnetic field gets created in the wire - And the metal gets magnetized - When turned off it is no longer magnetic. Question: suppose fewer copper wire loops happens, how will it affect a STRONGER electromagnet. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: less A detailed explanation: An electromagnet is a device that produces a magnetic field when an electric current passes through it. In an electromagnet, a conductive copper wire is coiled around a core, usually made of soft iron or other ferromagnetic materials. When an electric current from a power source flows through the wire, it generates a magnetic field around the wire, which magnetizes the core. The magnetic field is directly related to the number of loops and the amount of electric current flowing through the wire. Given that the question is asking about the effect of fewer copper wire loops on the strength of an electromagnet, let's consider the following: 1. The strength of an electromagnet depends on the number of turns or coils of copper wire wrapped around the core. More turns of copper wire mean a higher density of magnetic field lines produced, leading to a stronger electromagnet. 2. When there are fewer copper wire loops, the magnetic field produced is less dense, resulting in a weaker electromagnet. This is because fewer loops mean fewer opportunities for the magnetic field lines to interact with the core and create a strong magnetic field. 3. Reducing the number of wire loops also affects the inductance of the electromagnet. Inductance is directly proportional to the square of the number of turns in a coil. Lowering the number of turns will lead to a weaker electromagnet, as the inductance of the coil is reduced. 4. However, it should be noted that current also plays a significant role in the strength of an electromagnet. The strength of the created magnetic field depends on the product of the number of turns (N) and the current (I) passing through the wire (Magnetic field ∝ NI). So, even if we see a decrease in the number of wire loops, increasing the current might compensate for the reduction in loops, maintaining the overall magnetic field strength or possibly increasing it. Therefore, the effect of fewer copper wire loops on an electromagnet is that it becomes weaker (option B: less) unless other factors, such as increasing the current flowing through the wire, are changed to compensate for the reduction in loops."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To isolate the term with m, you need to eliminate the constant term -2381. You can do this by adding 2381 to both sides of the equation. -77 + 2381 = 192*m - 2381 + 2381 2304 = 192*m Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 192.

Cette déclaration met en évidence les préoccupations des éditeurs de journaux face à la concentration des médias et aux défis posés par les régulations qui autorisent un seul groupe à posséder plusieurs chaînes de télévision et stations de radio dans une même région. La crainte principale est que cela limite la diversité des points de vue et des informations présentés au public, et que cela nuise à la mission des journaux de fournir un journalisme indépendant et de qualité. Les propriétaires de journaux étaient inquiets non seulement pour leurs propres entreprises, mais aussi pour la démocratie et la liberté de la presse en général.

How to recover from ocd Talk to a therapist. Attending sessions with a professional counselor or therapist may help with calming down the anxiety that led to ocd. Rituals associated with ocd are often used to calm the person down.","completion":"Continuing the therapeutic journey, it is essential to establish a strong rapport with your therapist to foster a safe, judgement-free environment where you can openly discuss your OCD triggers, thoughts, behaviors, and experiences. Through a symbiotic collaboration, you and your therapist can identify, assess, and extensively explore the underlying causes and factors contributing to your OCD, while also gaining insight into how it impacts your daily life and relationships. This meaningful connection can also provide a supportive space for you to share your fears, doubts, and emotions without reservations. When working with a seasoned therapist, various evidence-based treatments such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) may be chosen depending upon the nature and severity of your OCD symptoms. CBT is a type of talk therapy highly effective in cultivating an individual's understanding of the connection between their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, empowering them to challenge and reframe their negative thought patterns to minimize the compulsion to engage in OCD-related rituals. ERP is a more specific approach, encouraging the individual to face their fears and compulsions by mindfully exposing themselves to their triggers, and gradually reducing the frequency and intensity of their reactions to them. ACT, on the other hand, facilitates a shift of focus from changing or challenging thoughts and feelings to accepting and coexisting with them, ultimately aiding in the development of more flexible and adaptive coping mechanisms. Consistent, engaged participation in your therapy sessions is crucial to seamlessly progress through the different stages of healing, with periodic reassessments and modifications of your treatment plan tailored to your individual needs. Involving close friends and family members in your recovery process can act as an additional layer of support, providing love, understanding, and encouragement while you undergo these transformative endeavors. Moreover, their active involvement can aid in dismantling misconceptions and stigmas surrounding OCD, fostering an atmosphere of empathy and compassion for your mental health journey. In addition to therapy, integrating various holistic self-care practices, such as engaging in regular physical exercise, maintaining a balanced and nutritious diet, practicing mindfulness and meditation, and prioritizing rest and sleep, can strengthen your resilience and overall well-being, allowing you to better cope with the challenges of OCD. Throughout the course of your recovery, remember that seeking assistance from a therapist is a critical milestone in overcoming OCD. Your unwavering determination, combined with their professional expertise and guidance, can ultimately empower you to regain control over your thoughts and actions, fostering a healthier, balanced, and more fulfilling life."},{"prompt":"What is the final step of the following process: - Sediment transport is the movement of solid particles (sediment) - The movement is due to a combination of gravity acting on the sediment, and/or the movement of the fluid in which the sediment is entrained - Sediment transport occurs in natural systems where the particles are clastic rocks (sand, gravel, boulders, etc.), mud, or clay - The fluid is air, water, or ice - And the force of gravity acts to move the particles along the sloping surface on which they are resting - Sediment transport due to fluid motion occurs in rivers, oceans, lakes, seas, and other bodies of water due to currents and tides","completion":"The final step of this process is the deposition of sediments, where the transported sediment particles eventually settle down and accumulate in a specific location, forming sedimentary layers.

Article: Teenagers who drink alcohol are at higher risk of becoming victims of violence, a Cardiff University study has found. A team from the School of Dentistry's Violence Research Group studied drinking habits in children aged 11 - 16 in England. They found not only a link between drink and violence but also that children who drank were more likely to be hit, even if they weren't violent themselves. The researchers are now calling for measures to prevent alcohol misuse to reduce injury risk. Current policy focuses on reducing aggression but this research shows that there should be equal effort to reduce victimization. More than 4,000 children were surveyed at 13 schools at four local authorities in the North, the Midlands, London, and the South. The study found that 25% of 11-year-olds were drinking monthly and 3.6% daily, with 12.8% admitting to getting drunk 3 to 5 times a year. By the age of 16, 40% were drinking weekly and 6.2% were drinking every day. The research also showed 22.6% of 16-year-olds were getting drunk more than 21 times a year. The study, which has just been published in the Journal of Adolescence, found a strong link between frequency of drinking and frequency of hitting other people. However, children who reported drinking monthly were also three times more likely to be hit. Adolescents who drank but didn't get into fights were more likely to be hit than those who did fight. Professor Jonathan Shepherd, who led the research, said a lot of previous alcohol-related violence work had focused on the offenders rather than the victims. His team is calling for more prevention work from parents and teachers in the first two years of secondary school by taking advantage of the \\"teachable moment\\", that is, immediately after a student has missed school because of drunkenness. Previous work by Professor Jonathan Shepherd has shown drinkers may be more at risk of violence because of reduced physical co-ordination, poor decision-making in threatening situations and isolation while out late at night.

Question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what currency do the ukraine use?\\" Answer:","completion":"The currency used in Ukraine is the Ukrainian Hryvnia, abbreviated as UAH. The Hryvnia was introduced as the official currency of Ukraine on September 2, 1996, replacing the temporary currency called the Karbovanets that was being used after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Ukrainian Hryvnia is issued and regulated by the National Bank of Ukraine, which is the country's central bank. The name \\"Hryvnia\\" is derived from the Old Ruthenian or Old Ukrainian word \\"гривна\\" (hryvnia), which is a historical term that originally referred to a weight measure (around 210 grams) of silver used in medieval Kievan Rus for trading purposes. The term has been revived and adopted for the modern currency to signify the historical continuity of the Ukrainian monetary system. The symbol of the Ukrainian Hryvnia is \\"₴\\", which is designed as an \\"S\\" with two horizontal strokes running across the middle of the letter. This symbol was created by the Ukrainian graphic designer, Vasyl Lopata, and the strokes represent the stability of the currency. The Ukrainian Hryvnia is subdivided into 100 smaller units called kopiyki (singular: kopiyka). Banknotes are available in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 Hryvnia, while coins are available in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50 kopiyki, as well as 1 Hryvnia. The National Bank of Ukraine manages the exchange rate of the Hryvnia, determining its value through a managed float against other major currencies, such as the US Dollar, the Euro, and the Russian Ruble. The exchange rate of the Hryvnia may be influenced by factors such as the economic situation in Ukraine, global economic trends, geopolitics, and international trade relations. While the Ukrainian Hryvnia is the primary currency used in the country, some businesses in tourist-heavy areas and border zones may also accept foreign currencies, like the US Dollar, the Euro, or the Russian Ruble. However, it is always best to have Hryvnia on hand for transactions within Ukraine, as it is the legal tender and most widely accepted means of payment. For travelers visiting Ukraine, it is advisable to exchange their foreign currency for Hryvnia at authorized exchange offices, banks, or hotels to ensure they have the local currency for various expenses during their stay."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his Austrian citizenship, as Austria does not usually allow dual citizenship. His request was granted, and he retained his Austrian citizenship. In 2005, Peter Pilz, a member of the Austrian Parliament from the Austrian Green Party, demanded that Parliament revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship due to his decision not to prevent the executions of Donald Beardslee and Stanley Williams, causing damage of reputation to Austria, where the death penalty has been abolished since 1968. This demand was based on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act that states: \\"A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship, if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic.\\" Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights) had indeed done damage to Austria's reputation.

Article: Congress was scheduled to be off this week, but lawmakers must stay in Washington because they made no progress over the weekend in settling a dispute over spending that threatens a possible government shutdown. Despite promises to work together following a public backlash against the bickering that consumed much of the summer, Republicans and Democrats face the reality that disaster aid could run out Tuesday and the government could partially shut down beginning this weekend unless they strike a deal quickly. ... ||||| With time running out, Congress returns Monday to try to pass a short-term funding measure to avert a government shutdown and avoid yet another market-rattling showdown over the federal budget. The Democratic-led Senate, which on Friday blocked a GOP House measure to fund the government through Nov. 18, will vote late Monday on its own version of the bill. The Senate bill includes dollars for disaster relief without an offsetting spending cut elsewhere that the House GOP demands. It is not clear how the dispute will be resolved. A spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said Sunday that leaders have been in touch, but other congressional aides said there was no progress toward a compromise over the weekend. And members of Congress who appeared on Sunday talk shows gave little sign that they would move quickly from their parties’ positions on disaster relief. “The Senate is saying . . . why should we, in effect, rebuild schools in Iraq on the credit card but expect that rebuilding schools in Joplin, Missouri, at this moment in time have to be paid for in a way that has never been in any of the previous disaster assistance that we’ve put out before?” Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” He blamed the dispute on tea-party-affiliated Republicans in the House who demanded the spending cut. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said on the same program: “Everybody knows we’re going to pay for every single penny of disaster aid that the president declares and that FEMA certifies. And the House sent over a bill that does that and the Senate should have approved it.” He blamed Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) for manufacturing a crisis over funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But Warner and Alexander, who have been pushing for more bipartisan cooperation over the far more difficult and consequential task of deficit reduction, appeared weary over the mess. Warner called it “embarrassing.” “I don’t like this business of sitting around blaming each other over such small potatoes,” Alexander said. But the small potatoes are part of a much larger and ongoing fight about debt and deficit spending in Washington. Last week, Boehner lost a vote on how to fund the federal government, sending Washington bumbling into its third shutdown showdown in the past six months. His problem was the same as in the previous spending battles — roughly 50 of the most conservative Republicans who mutinied in the name of deeper spending cuts. But Boehner may have strengthened his hand in the fight by persuading his fractious team to rally around his leadership. The fact that a resolution now hinges on action in the Senate is a sign that Boehner is in stronger position politically than he was a week ago — that he can now sometimes harness the power of his majority, despite nine months of often chaotic rule. Rather than working with Democrats, he worked on Republicans, persuading enough to switch their votes. The House passed an almost identical version of the spending bill Thursday and forced the issue to the Senate. Boehner has had to rely on temporary and unstable coalitions to achieve victories, often won with bluffs and brinkmanship against a deadline of impending doom. Last week, he built one with Republicans. This week, he may be forced to turn to Democrats. Without the full strength of his majority behind him, that has been Boehner’s go-to in the past — tricky arrangements that have required him to win three-quarters of the votes of Republicans but still keep nearly half of Democrats on board. What appeared in the end to persuade the reluctant GOP members who switched last week was not arm twisting or legislative pressure tactics that were once famous in the House, but something else entirely: logic. Leaders argued that if members wanted to cut spending, voting for the measure was their only viable option. The alternative was to require Boehner to negotiate with Democrats on a bill that would not offset any of the 3.65 billion Republicans had agreed to set aside for FEMA and other disaster relief efforts. In other words, voting against the bill in hopes of forcing government to spend less would actually result in spending more. “He said you have to pick — and they picked,” said Rep. Steven C. LaTourette (R-Ohio), a close ally of Boehner’s. “It’s too bad we had to have the vote and lose, but I think people came to the right conclusion pretty quickly.” One key moment came in a closed-door meeting Thursday for House Republicans, when Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) rose to his feet and acknowledged that he had planned to support the bill the night before but decided to vote against it when he saw it was headed for defeat. It was cowardly, he said. If given another opportunity, he promised to stick by Boehner and vote “yes.” “That helped,” said Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.). “It defused things and made it so it wasn’t like a test of wills.” King said people laughed. Then others acknowledged they had done the same. “He saw it was going to go down anyway, so he could take the easy vote and vote ‘no’ and be a hero to the people back home to people who wanted more cuts,” King said. Slowly but surely, Republican leaders are persuading freshman elected last year on promises to remake Washington that there’s more to being an effective congressman than heroics for the folks back home. “I think the speaker and the leader are trying to get that across,” King said. “I think it is starting to sink in.” The message worked on some. Rep. Jeffrey M. Landry (R-La.), who had voted against the bill Wednesday, said he was persuaded to support the bill a day later by the argument that his “no” vote would help produce a bill with higher spending. “That would have been a bill that I wouldn’t have supported but Americans would likely have had to live with,” he said. Boehner found a way to entice conservatives, including Landry. Rather than eliminating the spending offset as Democrats wanted, he added a new cut — 100 million from the program that had loaned money to the now-bankrupt Solyndra solar-panel manufacturer that had been championed by the Obama administration. Though a minor cut, it gave Republicans an opportunity to bash the administration over a loan to the failed company. Despite the hard sell from Boehner, a bloc of 24 Republicans still defied the speaker on Thursday. “I represent 600,000 people,” said Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.), one of the “no” votes. “I think I know them. I think I know what they want me to do.” Read more on PostPolitics.com Government Shutdown 2011 Pessimism grows after new congressional feud Fact Checker: Obama’s strained symbolism at an Ohio River bridge |||||Summary:","completion":"The US Congress faces a possible government shutdown due to a dispute over spending that has not been resolved over the weekend.

It may not be clear, for instance, whether an area should be considered to be a satellite and part of an agglomeration, or a distinct entity in itself. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe.

Reduce stress.","completion":"Title: Simple Lifestyle Changes for a Healthier and Happier Life Introduction In today's fast-paced world, it is easy to become overwhelmed by daily stressors, fall into unhealthy habits, and struggle to maintain a balanced life. One of the most effective ways to improve overall well-being is by adopting a few straightforward lifestyle changes. Reducing alcohol consumption, cutting down on caffeine, avoiding nicotine, and managing stress can have profoundly positive effects on a person's physical and mental health. This article explores how these changes can lead to a healthier, more satisfying life. 1. Reducing Alcohol Consumption Many individuals enjoy a glass of wine or a cold beer at the end of a long day. However, it is essential to be aware of the adverse effects that alcohol can have on the body and mind when consumed in excess. Heavy alcohol consumption has been linked to liver damage, increased risk of certain cancers, and cognitive impairments. To reduce alcohol intake: - Set specific, achievable goals for reducing the number of drinks consumed per week. - Replace alcoholic beverages with non-alcoholic alternatives, such as sparkling water with fruit slices. - Practice mindful drinking techniques to savor each sip and avoid mindless consumption. 2. Cutting Down on Caffeine Caffeine is a common stimulant found in coffee, tea, and many energy drinks. While it can offer a much-needed boost during the day, excessive caffeine consumption can lead to sleep disturbances, nervousness, and increased heart rate. To cut down on caffeine: - Gradually reduce the number of caffeinated beverages consumed per day. - Substitute caffeinated drinks with healthier alternatives, such as herbal tea or decaffeinated coffee. - Implement a caffeine cut-off time, such as avoiding caffeine after 2 pm. 3. Avoiding Nicotine Nicotine, found in cigarettes and many vaping products, is a highly addictive substance associated with various health risks such as heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer. Eliminating nicotine from your life can dramatically improve your overall health and well-being. To avoid nicotine: - Consider nicotine replacement therapies, such as patches or gum, to assist with withdrawal symptoms. - Seek out support groups or professional help for assistance during the quitting process. - Establish new, healthier habits to replace the routine of smoking or vaping. 4. Reducing Stress Chronic stress can have negative effects on mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and difficulty concentrating. While it may be impossible to eliminate stress entirely, adopting strategies to manage everyday stress can lead to better mental health and improved overall well-being. To reduce stress: - Engage in regular physical activity to release endorphins, natural stress relievers. - Develop and maintain a support network of friends and family to help navigate difficult times. - Incorporate mindfulness practices such as meditation, yoga, or deep-breathing exercises into daily routines. Conclusion Adopting these simple lifestyle changes can greatly improve a person's overall health and well-being. By reducing alcohol consumption, cutting down on caffeine, avoiding nicotine, and managing stress, individuals can experience increased energy, better mood stability, and a higher quality of life. Embracing these adjustments will lead to a healthier, happier, and more balanced existence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy.

The World's Best Whiskey Tours “There are few things as beautiful as a glass bottle filled with deep amber whiskey.” –Walter Mosley, “Black Betty” To the uninitiated, whiskey is simply a rough drink that burns as it slides down the throat. For aficionados, it is nothing short of liquid gold. To really appreciate whiskey, there can be few better ways than doing so at the source, as it were. Just like wine tastes better at the vineyard and trout best fresh out of the stream, the drink that some call “Kentucky tea” rarely tastes better than at the distillery where it is made. Whether one wants to see where a favorite bourbon gets born or brave a journey to a remote Scottish island, more and more distilleries are seeing the advantages in welcoming whiskey-loving tourists. With visitors buying whiskey-related merchandise, eating in local restaurants and staying at local inns, the distilleries are not limited to selling whiskey to generate profits. Fortunately, thanks to a happy confluence of geography, climate and culture, most whiskey distilleries in Scotland–where it’s spelled “whisky,” which is derived from the Gaelic word uisgebeatha, meaning “water of life”–are located fairly close to one another. A visitor to the island of Islay, in Scotland’s Hebrides, can tour the distilleries of Lagavulin , Laphroaig and Bowmore all in the same day. Equally convenient is the Whisky Trail, the informal name given to a group of distilleries in the Speyside region of the Scottish Highlands. The area is home to some of the world’s finest distilleries, such as Glenlivet , Cardhu and Glenfiddich . Since all of these offer visitors healthy samples of their products, it is recommended that at least one member of the party be the designated driver–or hire a car. The roads in the Highlands are famous for their inability to go in a straight line. Whiskey drinkers who want to stay closer to home can visit distilleries in Tennessee or Kentucky, and even in Canada. Forbes.com has selected some of the best whiskey tours in the world, from schools and cruises to traditional distillery visits. Happy trails, and bottoms up. Maker’s Mark President Bill Samuels Bill Samuels Jr. is the Richard Branson Richard Branson of the bourbon world. This seventh-generation distiller started out as a rocket scientist, studying engineering and physics at UC Berkeley, before one of his experimental rockets crashed through the roof of a building. These days, he’s applying his showmanship to marketing his liquor. After the Arthur Andersen / Enron fiasco, Samuels commissioned a billboard in Times Square featuring an empty bottle of Maker’s Mark with the caption, “Disappears faster than a Big Five accounting firm.” The billboard quickly came down. The Maker’s Mark distillery is located in Loretto, Ky., which is one stop on the so-called Bourbon Trail. The Jim Beam and Wild Turkey distilleries are also close by, but Maker’s Mark is the only one that gives full tours. Real whiskey aficionados will want to make a pit stop at the Oscar Getz Museum of Whiskey History in nearby Bardstown. Maker’s Mark looks more like a tiny village than a place of business. The red visitors’ center was built in 1889 and was originally the resident distiller’s home. A sign on the gatehouse has the same warning it did 100 years ago: “Passage is free to anyone going to church.” This credo is perfect for those who worship at the altar of whiskey.

The Glenora Inn & Distillery bills itself as the only single-malt distillery in North America. It’s located in Glenville, in Inverness County, Nova Scotia, and has been producing whiskey for 12 years. Glenora also produces three types of rum, called Smugglers Cove. The Glen Breton whiskey is made from already-malted barley imported from Scotland and is aged in oak barrels formerly used at the Jack Daniels distillery in Tennessee. Tours are only C5, and prices at the inn range from C92 to C120 for rooms and C147 to C210 for chalets. What’s next, Californian whiskey? Glenora Inn & Distillery P.O.

Each summer, up to 200 boats can register to be a part of the Classic Malts Cruise , which is a loosely organized 200-mile tour through the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, with daily stops to distilleries. Captains can choose their own route from Oban to Skye, and back south to Islay. Along the way, ships will make port calls near the distilleries of Oban, Talisker and Lagavulin, and can spend the night. Crews also meet up for barbecues, tastings and distillery tours on set dates to ensure some mingling. There is no fee to participate, but attendance is limited to the first 200 people who sign up their boats.

The school offers a three-day course, where students follow the process of Scotch whisky production, lend a hand and, of course, sample the goods. The owners of the distillery are there to demonstrate the steps involved in creating the “water of life”: milling, brewing, fermenting and distilling. Class size is restricted to 12 people, and the school costs £295 (approximately 450) per person, or £520 (approximately 790) for two. Accommodations are not included. The next session starts in October, so book now. The Whisky School at Bladnoch Distillery Bladnoch Distillery Bladnoch, Wigtown Dumfries and Galloway Scotland Phone: (01988) 402605 E-mail: office2@distillers.com The Speyside region of Scotland is home to some of the world’s finest distilleries, such as Glenfarclas , Dallas Dhu and Glenlivet . More than half of Scotland’s malt whisky distilleries are in Speyside. All of the distilleries have tours (as well as places to eat and usually an on-site bed-and-breakfast), so many people take several days to stumble around the Highlands, sampling the different varieties of the liquor. In between having a few drams, visitors can also treat themselves to rounds of golfs, castle tours and hiking through the rolling hills, all scented by the biscuity smell of fermentation. Many of the distilleries have developed their own non-whisky-based attractions. The gardens at Glen Grant, originally created in the 1870s, have just been completely restored. Guests who hike to the top of Major’s Dram Hut will cross through orchards and over rustic bridges, and can view a waterfall that cascades near the distillery. Technically, the Whisky Trail only refers to seven distilleries, which have formed a coalition of sorts: Cardhu, Dallas Dhu, Glenfarclas, Glenfiddich, Glen Grant, Glenlivet and Strathisla. During the four-day Spirit of Speyside whisky festival each May, visitors can enjoy whisky in a variety of ways, such as while hang gliding.

At the Glenmorangie distillery, located in the Highlands, visitors can learn about the entire distillation process, as well as the selection of the barrels, which come from oak trees in the Ozarks. The barrels are then loaned to the Heaven Hill Bourbon distillery until reclaimed by Glenmorangie. The on-site inn, Glenmorangie House, is also worth a stop. From the outside, it looks like a typical Highlands mansion, but inside the atmosphere is warm and relaxed. Royal Dornach golf course is also nearby. Glenmorangie Cadboll, Fearn Ross-Shir, Tain Scotland Phone: 01862 871671 While the Whisky Trail is the best-known distillery tour in Scotland, the distilleries along the islands of Islay and Jura are also worth a stop. These islands, on the west coast of Scotland, are home to such distilleries as Ardbeg, Bowmore, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain, Caol Ile, Jura, Laphroaig, Lagavulin and Kilchoman. What makes these Scotch whiskies different from their Highland counterparts is the abundance of peat bogs, which affect the water and result in a very peaty, strong taste. Some say the seaweed affects the air in which it ages, and hints of this can also be detected. Islay and Jura are dotted with bed-and-breakfasts and small inns. Every summer, Islay hosts a weeklong whisky festival, which includes ceilidhs (traditional Scottish storytelling evenings), Celtic music concerts, distillery tours, golf competition, cooking-with-whisky evenings and a sponsored charity “barrel push” across Islay. The festivities culminate in a carnival on Port Ellen Green. Islay Whisky Festival E-mail: islayfestival@lineone.net For a taste of Irish whiskey, head to the Jameson distillery in the heart of Dublin, just north of the River Liffey. The distillery began giving tours in 1997, and the first tour each day starts at 9:30 AM. Visitors will learn about the differences between Irish whiskey and Scotch whisky. (Irish whiskey is produced from a mixture of malted and unmalted Irish barley. The barley is then dried in a closed kiln to preserve its malty flavors.

Q:Information: - Ann Hart Coulter (born December 8, 1961) is an American conservative social and political commentator, writer, syndicated columnist, and lawyer. She frequently appears on television, radio, and as a speaker at public and private events. - Roger Joseph Ebert (June 18, 1942 April 4, 2013) was an American film critic and historian, journalist, screenwriter, and author. He was a film critic for the \\"Chicago Sun-Times\\" from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. - Structural engineering is mainly a sub-division of civil engineering where structural engineers are trained to understand, predict, and calculate the stability, strength and rigidity of built structures for buildings and non-building structures, to develop designs and integrate their design with that of other designers, and to supervise construction of projects on site. They can also be involved in the design of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles etc. where structural integrity affects functioning and safety. - An arch is a curved structure that spans a space and may or may not support weight above it. Arch may be synonymous with vault, but a vault may be distinguished as a continuous arch forming a roof. Arches appeared as early as the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamian brick architecture, and their systematic use started with the Ancient Romans who were the first to apply the technique to a wide range of structures. - News of the Weird is a syndicated newspaper column edited by Chuck Shepherd that collects bizarre news stories. It was created in 1988. , it is syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate and published in more than 250 newspapers in the United States and Canada. As of July 2008, the daily internet column has merged with two other \\"weird\\" websites to form Weird Universe. - Earthquake engineering is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with earthquakes in mind. Its overall goal is to make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake engineering is the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels. Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to seismic loading; it is considered as a subset of structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of civil engineering, mechanical engineering and from the social sciences, especially sociology, political science, economics and finance. - In the United States, same-sex marriage has been legal in all states, Washington, D.C., as well as all U.S. territories except American Samoa, but not on Indian lands, since June 26, 2015, when the United States Supreme Court ruled in \\"Obergefell v. Hodges\\" that state-level bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional. The court ruled that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples and the refusal to recognize those marriages performed in other jurisdictions violates the Due Process and the Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The ruling overturned a precedent, \\"Baker v. Nelson\\". - Compression members are structural elements that are pushed together or carry a load, more technically they are subjected only to axial compressive forces. That is, the loads are applied on the longitudinal axis through the centroid of the member cross section, and the load over the cross sectional area gives the stress on the compressed member. In buildings posts and columns are almost always compression members as are the \\"top chord\\" of trusses. - Uclick LLC was an American corporation (a division of Andrews McMeel Universal) selling \\"digital entertainment content\\" for the desktop, the web and mobile phones. The company owns and operates several consumer websites, including the comic strip and editorial cartoon site GoComics and the puzzle and casual game sites ThePuzzleSociety.com and UclickGames.com. - GoComics is a website launched in 2005 by the digital entertainment provider Uclick. It was originally created as a distribution portal for comic strips on mobile phones, but in 2006, the site was redesigned and expanded to include online strips and cartoons. GoComics publishes editorial cartoons, mobile content and daily comics; thus its subtitle toon in daily. - Margaret Gallagher Srivastav ( born September 14 , 1960 ) , better known by her working name Maggie Gallagher , is an American writer and socially conservative commentator .

It distributed lifestyle and opinion columns, comic strips and other content. Popular columns include Dear Abby, Ann Coulter, Roger Ebert and News of the Weird. Founded in 1970, it was merged in July 2009 with Uclick (which published its comics on GoComics) to form Universal Uclick. - A column or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that transmits, through compression, the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below. In other words, a column is a compression member. The term column applies especially to a large round support (the \\"shaft\\" of the column) with a capital and a \\"base\\" or pedestal and made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers. For the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering, columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. Other compression members are often termed \\"columns\\" because of the similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture, \\"column\\" refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features. A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are \\"engaged\\", that is to say form part of a wall. - Architecture (Latin \\"architectura\\", from the Greek \\"arkhitekton\\" \\"architect\\", from - \\"chief\\" and \\"builder\\") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements. - The National Organization for Marriage (NOM) is an American non-profit political organization established in 2007 to work against the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States. It was formed in 2007 specifically to pass California Proposition 8 prohibiting same-sex marriage in California. The group has opposed civil union legislation and gay adoption, and has fought against allowing transgender individuals to use bathrooms that accord with their gender identity. Brian S.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue the following story. Living in a big city is stressful for Samantha buy not Rachel so","completion":"far, the two friends had managed to adapt to the different lifestyles in their own ways. Samantha had grown up in a small town, surrounded by nature and nurturing friendships, where life always seemed to move slowly, and the pace was calm. Rachel, on the other hand, had embraced the chaotic energy of the city ever since she could remember. In their early thirties, Samantha and Rachel found themselves living in the same metropolis as work and relationships brought them together again after college. Initially, Samantha found it hard to adjust to the loudness, the crowds, and the fast pace of life in the city. Rachel, on the other hand, felt at home every time she was surrounded by the skyscrapers, neon lights, and the vibrancy of urban living. Despite their different outlooks on city life, Samantha and Rachel's deep-rooted friendship helped ease the transition. Recognizing Samantha's struggles, Rachel shared her secrets for making the city feel more like home. Together, they explored parks and natural escapes within the city's limits, to give Samantha the chance to reconnect with nature. They found a community garden where they could plant flowers and grow vegetables, a place where Samantha found solace and relaxation among the sounds of rustling leaves and the hum of pollinating bees. Rachel taught Samantha to appreciate the avant-garde street art that adorned the walls, and the two spent Sundays visiting galleries and attending cultural events that brought people from different walks of life together. These moments made Samantha realize that the city was not just noisy, crowded, and stress-inducing but also a place filled with color, creativity, and opportunities for growth. On their city walks, Samantha found delight in small things like unexpectedly encountering a farmer's market or stumbling upon a street musician whose melodies managed to transcend the clamor of impatient car horns. These simple occurrences began to endear the city to Samantha, a feeling she had longed to have since her initial days in the city. In return, Samantha showed Rachel the benefits of slowing down in such a hectic environment. They started a weekly meditation group at their apartment, where they would teach and encourage each other to take mental breaks and breathe. They tried out barre and yoga classes, learning to appreciate the strength and grace their bodies brought them amid the seemingly superficial perfectionism of city life. Rachel and Samantha also discovered the importance of cooking and sharing meals together, especially on weekends. They would invite their closest friends, creating an atmosphere that reminded Samantha of her small-town potlucks. The conversations would flow easily over homemade dishes, and for a moment, the city's chaos outside their walls would cease to exist. As time went on, Samantha's relationship with the city continued to evolve. While she still missed the quietude of her small-town life, she began to see the beauty in the diversity, cultural richness, and unique experiences that the city had to offer. In essence, she started to accept that the city—although sharply removed from her comfort zone—was now a place she could call home. Rachel, forever grateful for Samantha's perspective, was also reminded of the importance of balance in life. She continued to thrive in the bustling urban landscape, but she had now learned to value moments of tranquility amid the chaos. In the end, the two friends, now rooted in the city, flourished together, navigating the intricacies of their personal and professional lives knowing they had the support of one another. Their resilience, adaptability, and shared love for their friendship only grew stronger with each bustling day in the heart of the city."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Write an article based on this summary: A Glasgow building restoration firm has been fined £80,000 for making nuisance phone calls, following an investigation by the information watchdog. Article:","completion":"Title: Glasgow Building Restoration Firm Fines £80K for Nuisance Phone Calls Introduction A building restoration company from Glasgow has been recently fined £80,000 due to a string of nuisance phone calls. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) spearheaded the investigation, leading to the imposition of the seemingly hefty fine. The case sheds light on the responsibility of businesses to respect privacy and maintain ethical conduct in their client interactions. Background The Glasgow-based firm, known for offering building restoration services, has been committing infractions by making involuntary, disruptive phone calls, causing a public disturbance and infringing on the privacy rights of customers. Identified as a nuisance to the community, the company's activities triggered a large number of complaints, prompting the ICO to launch their investigation. Information Commissioner's Office Investigation The Information Commissioner’s Office, an independent authority in the UK responsible for upholding information rights, performed a thorough investigation into the actions of the Glasgow-based firm. This was prompted by the numerous complaints filed by affected individuals who were repeatedly receiving unwarranted phone calls from the company. The ICO assessed the severity of the nuisance calls and examined the company's adherence to legal requirements. ICO Findings Following their comprehensive investigation, the ICO found the restoration firm in violation of guidelines governing privacy and communication with customers. Phone calls made by the company were deemed as disruptive, unsolicited and persistent, causing significant distress to recipients. Moreover, the ICO discovered that the Glasgow-based firm did not maintain a valid consent from the people they contacted. This lack of consent is a direct violation of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR). The regulations represent a legal framework protecting the privacy of individuals receiving electronic communications and stipulate that all parties must have given consent to receive such communication. Fines and Penalties Due to these blatant disregard for privacy regulations and the unwelcome nature of the phone calls, the ICO decided to impose a fine of £80,000 on the Glasgow building restoration firm. The considerable sum underscores the seriousness of the violation and the intention to penalize the company for detracting from the privacy rights of citizens within the community. Impact on the Restoration Firm and Industry The fines imposed on the Glasgow firm serve as a reminder for other businesses to maintain a transparent and respectful communication with their customers. It highlights the importance of complying with privacy regulations and ensuring ethical practices when reaching out to potential clients. The financial penalty also represents a palpable deterrent capable of discouraging similar actions from other industry members. Conclusion The Glasgow building restoration firm's case illustrates the significance of privacy rights and the responsibility of businesses to engage in ethical client interaction. The Information Commissioner’s Office demonstrates its commitment to protecting the public by maintaining strict guidelines and penalizing those who infringe on privacy regulations. This outcome invites companies to reflect on their practices and ensure they are operating within the boundaries of the law while maintaining respect for consumers' privacy rights."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Billardiera is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pittosporaceae. This genus comprises about 54 species, which are endemic to Australia. Billardiera species are usually characterized by their long, fleshy fruits, and twining or scrambling habit. Some well-known species of this genus include Billardiera scandens (commonly known as apple berry) and Billardiera longiflora (purple apple berry). Calothamnus, on the other hand, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. There are around 40 species in this genus, and they are mostly native to Western Australia. Calothamnus plants are commonly known as netbushes, and they are characterized by their needle-like leaves and distinctive, claw-like flowers. Some popular species include Calothamnus quadrifidus (one-sided bottlebrush) and Calothamnus sanguineus (red claw flower).

Answer the following question: Jesse took a chance on Sandra and asked her to the prom only to be embarrassed when she accepted but danced with Jack all night. Given the context: How would Jesse feel afterwards? Select from: [+] like he had been used. [+] like he made Sandra's night. [+] like he was cupid's twin. Answer:","completion":"Jesse would likely feel like he had been used after asking Sandra to the prom and witnessing her dance with Jack all night. This experience would understandably leave Jesse feeling hurt, rejected, and humiliated, especially since he took a chance on asking her to the event, possibly expecting to have a pleasant and memorable time together. In situations like these, strong emotions such as disappointment, insecurity, and regret may also arise. Jesse may question why Sandra accepted his invitation if she had the intention of dancing with Jack throughout the night, and he may feel as if he's been unfairly treated. Additionally, Jesse might feel embarrassed in front of their peers, who may have witnessed the situation. This embarrassment is likely to be amplified by the fact that prom is considered a high-stake social event for most teenagers. In this context, being publicly rejected or feeling like a third wheel can have an immense impact on one's self-esteem and confidence. However, despite these feelings of humiliation and rejection, one could also argue that Jesse might feel like he contributed to Sandra's happiness. Seeing Sandra enjoying herself with Jack, he might feel as if he made her night. This outcome is significantly less likely given the negative emotions involved, but it does demonstrate a level of selflessness and acknowledgment of the situation. In summary, considering the context provided, Jesse would most likely feel like he had been used by Sandra after she accepted his prom invitation, only to spend the night dancing with Jack. This would lead to feelings of embarrassment, rejection, and possibly even resentment. While less likely, it's also possible that Jesse might feel content knowing he made Sandra's night, showcasing a more altruistic perspective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cherished family heirlooms were among the 21 firearms Michael Roberts surrendered to the Torrance Police Department in 2010, after his doctor filed a restraining order against him. The court order was the result of a dispute Roberts had with a member of the doctor’s staff and, after Roberts pleaded no contest, the matter was resolved. Yet, even though he filed the proper Law Enforcement Gun Release paperwork on four separate occasions, obtained clearance from the California Department of Justice and had two court orders commanding the return of his guns, police refused to hand them over. With the backing of the National Rifle Association and California Rifle and Pistol Association, Roberts filed a federal lawsuit in May 2014, over the 15,500 worth of firearms. In the end he got the money, but not the guns. The police had had them destroyed. Second Amendment lawyers say his case is not rare. “NRA and CRPA constantly get calls from law abiding people having problems getting their guns back,” said Chuck Michel of Long Beach based Michel & Associates, who represented Roberts in the case. “The state Department of Justice wrongly tells police not to give guns back unless the person can document ownership of the gun and it is registered in the state DOJ’s database. But the law doesn’t require this.” Gun owners can’t comply anyway, Michel said, because police themselves routinely fail to enter the firearms into the DOJ’s database, and most people don’t have receipts for the guns they own. While Americans have the constitutional rights to keep and bear arms – and protect their property from government’s unlawful seizure – it is not just in California where guns are seized and destroyed illegally, attorneys charge. \\"This kind of below-the-radar bureaucratic gun confiscation is a growing Second Amendment and property rights violation problem, particularly in strict gun control states like California, New Jersey and Massachusetts,” said Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation. “People can't afford to spend tens of thousands of dollars on legal fees to get back a 500 firearm.\\" The Second Amendment Foundation’s most recent case involves Rick Bailey, a 56-year-old Navy veteran from Glendale, Ariz., whose entire collection of 28 firearms valued at 25,000 was seized by authorities because of an ongoing dispute with a neighbor. After Bailey complained over several months to the city of Glendale that his neighbor frequently parked his landscaping company’s dump trucks in front of Bailey’s home -- and toxic chemical odors were coming from his neighbor’s property -- the neighbor obtained a harassment order against Bailey. Police showed up and seized Bailey’s gun collection. “Mr. Bailey is devastated by this situation. We seem to live in an environment when someone’s life can be turned upside down on an allegation that should have been thoroughly investigated before any action was ordered by a court,” Gottlieb said. “We’re helping Bailey in his appeal of the judge’s order so he can not only reclaim his valuable firearms, but also some of his dignity as well.” Probably the most notorious gun confiscation case happened after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005 when the city’s then-mayor, Ray Nagin, ordered all legally owned firearms seized. The Second Amendment Foundation successfully sued on behalf of thousands of law abiding gun owners to stop, or reverse, the confiscations. But hundreds more gun owners without legal representation or ownership paperwork had to abandon their guns. Those firearms still have not been destroyed, Gottlieb said. - Alan Gottlieb, Second Amendment Foundation In Massachusetts, residents who had their guns taken because of restraining orders or other reasons must pay a fee to a private storage company when their legal issues are resolved, regardless of their own culpability. The fees can run in the thousands of dollars, often exceeding the value of the guns. Instead of paying the fee, they often forfeit the firearms and the company auctions them off, Gottlieb said. In Kentucky, a law passed in 2014 that allows law enforcement to take firearms from those accused – not convicted – of domestic violence crimes. Similar laws are in place in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Louisiana. In Lakewood, Ohio, in August 2011, police seized 13 firearms valued at 15,000 from U.S. Army veteran Francesca Rice while she wasn’t home, according to Cleveland Scene. Police reportedly had an employee of the condominium complex let them in. The firearms collection of Rice, who served her country in Iraq, included handguns, shotguns, a vintage Chinese SKS M21 semi-automatic carbine and a semi-automatic rifle. The seizure was based on a “situation involving the gun owner's absence from a VA hospital where she had been receiving treatment…. However, no charges were ever filed, and a year later, Rice's requests to have her guns returned had gone unanswered,” the Ohio-based Buckeye Institute reported, noting after the lawsuit was settled, the police were ordered to return her firearms. These tactics are a way for police departments or the government to make it more costly to own guns, said John Lott, an economist, leading expert on guns, and author at the Crime Prevention Research Center. Lott believes the illegal policies most hurt poor gun owners, who not only are less likely to afford to get their property back, but also typically live in neighborhoods where they are more vulnerable to crime. Seizing legally owned guns can also be a way for law enforcement agencies to boost their revenue if, as in some cases, they sell the firearms rather than destroying them, Lott said. In the Roberts’ case in California, police blamed a letter from the California Department of Justice that required gun owners to produce documentation showing it was their firearm that was seized and ordered them to register all firearms that previously had been exempt. The receipt the police department issued when confiscating the firearms wasn’t sufficient proof, the DOJ said, and most firearms owners don’t have other proof of purchase, especially for firearms passed down from generation to generation. The case was settled for 30,000 and the department changed its policy, but Roberts suffered through three years of aggravation and lost family heirlooms as a result of the department’s actions. In 2012, California civil rights attorney Donald Kilmer represented the Second Amendment Foundation and CalGuns Foundation in the first legal challenge in California for wrongful retention of firearms and won, leading San Francisco and Oakland to change their policies. But remarkably, the situation in California in some respects is getting worse. “The legislature has never met a gun regulation they didn’t like and the state is populated with millions of people who want to exercise their Second Amendment rights,” said Kilmer. The problem now is that the State Bureau of Firearms is issuing letters that misstate the law with regard to what documentation gun owners must produce to get their property back, Kilmer said. In the past, if firearms were seized in California from a home because of psychiatric issues, domestic violence allegations, restraining orders or other issues, the firearms were returned after the case was resolved through a court order. However, under a new law, Kilmer said a background check is required to ensure the property is not stolen, the owner has to prove ownership, and then the owners get a letter clearing them to pick up their property. “It makes sense on its face, but it is taking longer to issue letters,” Kilmer said, adding most gun owners can’t meet other requirements because they don’t have paperwork to show title, many legally owned guns are not registered, the federal government is forbidden from keeping firearms ownership records with the exception of for specialty guns, and California just started its database in 1996 exclusively for handguns. “People keep forgetting the right to keep and bear arms, the Second Amendment, is protected by the U.S. constitution, and private property is protected under the Fifth Amendment,” Kilmer said. “Government cannot take property without just compensation and due process. The great thing is that when it comes to guns, you get protection under both amendments.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is about how some people in the United States are having their guns taken away by the police, even though they have the right to own them. Michael Roberts had 21 guns that he gave to the police for a while after his doctor filed a restraining order against him. But when he tried to get the guns back, the police wouldn't give them to him, even though he did everything the law required. A group called the National Rifle Association and another called the California Rifle and Pistol Association helped Roberts file a lawsuit to get his guns or their value in money, and in the end, he got 15,500 but not the guns because the police had destroyed them. Some lawyers say this is happening to other people and not just in California. In some cases, people have had their guns taken away because of problems with their neighbors, like a man named Rick Bailey. Sometimes these situations can be very difficult for the people involved. After a big hurricane in New Orleans in 2005, the mayor ordered that all legally owned guns be taken away. Some of these people got their guns back, but not all of them. In different states, there are different laws about when it's okay for police to take away someone's guns. Sometimes, if a person gets their legal problems solved, they still have to pay a lot of money to get their guns back. This can be hard for people who don't have a lot of money, as they may not be able to afford to get their property back. One expert named John Lott thinks that these situations hurt poorer gun owners the most, since they may not be able to afford to get their guns back and might be more vulnerable to crime. He also thinks that sometimes the police might take the guns as a way to make extra money. Some lawyers believe that the right to have guns is protected under the US constitution, and that taking away someone's guns without a good reason is not right."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

According to the Dictionary of American Hymnology \\"Amazing Grace\\" is John Newton's spiritual autobiography in verse.In 1725, Newton was born in Wapping, a district in London near the Thames. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience. As a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, \\"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\\" His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary \\"Polly\\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love. After enduring humiliation for deserting, he managed to get himself traded to a slave ship where he began a career in slave trading.

Premise: dirt and noise Hypothesis: dirt, noise, and balloons on the dirt Does the premise entail the hypothesis? OPT: a). yes. b). it is not possible to tell. c). no.","completion":"b). it is not possible to tell. In order to understand the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let's first dissect and define the elements involved. Premise: Dirt and noise - It entails two separate elements, which are dirt and noise. However, without a clear context provided, these elements could refer to various circumstances or situations. Dirt could be actual soil, or it could represent uncleanliness in general. Noise, on the other hand, can be any form of sound that can be considered unwanted or interfering. Hypothesis: Dirt, noise, and balloons on the dirt - The hypothesis introduces a new element, balloons, in addition to dirt and noise, which were already mentioned in the premise. The hypothesis suggests that there are balloons on the dirt, implying that they may be placed on or touching actual soil or dirty surface. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis to determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. Entailment means that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. In this case, we are given that there is dirt and noise. However, the presence of these two elements does not necessarily mean that there must also be balloons on the dirt. The existence of dirt and noise may be related to the situation involving the balloons, but there is no direct or necessary connection between them. For example, we could have a construction site where there is dirt (soil) and noise (from the construction work). In this environment, there is no inherent reason for balloons to be placed on the dirt. On the other hand, we could also have a birthday party in a park where there is dirt (grassy surface) and noise (from party guests). In this situation, there may be balloons on the dirt even if the balloons themselves are not explicitly mentioned in the premise. Thus, from the information provided, it is not possible to tell if the premise entails the hypothesis. The reason is that the presence of dirt and noise does not guarantee the existence of balloons on the dirt, and different situations could lead to various interpretations on how these elements interact or relate to each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sentence begins by stating 'He used his own body wash instead of the soap the hotel provided for his bath'. This indicates that the subsequent part of the sentence is likely about the body wash, not the soap. 2. The sentence continues with, 'He thought the', implying what follows is his opinion about what was mentioned previously - in this case, his own body wash. 3. Thus, Option (B). body wash had an inconspicuous scent makes the most sense in context, as it provides a possible reason for why he might have chosen to use his body wash over the hotel's soap. 4. This is also supported by the principle of referential coherence, which means that the topic introduced first (his body wash) is likely to continue being the focus of discussion. Thus, the sentence is likely about his body wash, not the soap. So, the sentence ends as: \\"He used his own body wash instead of the soap the hotel provided for his bath.

Would \\"Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"The question about what triggered the Civil War is a complex one, as there were multiple factors that fed into this bloody and defining conflict in American history. Saying that \\"Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession\\" oversimplifies many underpinning causes and could misrepresent the disorienting reality of that tumultuous period. To provide a more detailed and insightful response, let's decompose the set of conditions that led to the Civil War. Firstly, one key trigger of the Civil War was the economic and social differences between the North and the South. The South was largely agrarian with an economy heavily dependent on agriculture and slave labor. Conversely, the North had rapidly industrialized and its population, more urban, had begun to see slavery as morally repugnant. As such, an increasing ideological chasm grew between these two regions over the issue of slavery. Secondly, states' rights versus federal rights were a continuous source of tension throughout the early history of the United States. Southern states felt their rights were being infringed upon by the federal government, particularly when it came to matters involving slavery. The tussle between states’ rights and federal involvement essentially translated into a battle over the power to decide whether slavery was acceptable within each state. Further, the trigger point for the Civil War was arguably the election of Abraham Lincoln as President in 1860. Although Lincoln wasn't an abolitionist, he was the candidate of a party which contained many abolitionists, causing Southern states to fear that the institution of slavery was under direct threat. The election of Lincoln led seven Southern states to secede from the Union even before Lincoln officially assumed office. Lastly, while it's accurate that there were eight so-called Upper South or \\"border\\" states (Arkansas, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, and Delaware) that initially rejected secession, this statement doesn't unravel the entire story. Following the attack on Fort Sumter and Lincoln's subsequent call for volunteers to suppress the rebellion, four of these states (Arkansas, North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee) did secede. The remaining four states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, and Delaware) stayed in the Union, but with divided loyalties. In essence, the Civil War was not triggered by a single factor or event but was, instead, the product of a multitude of conflicts and escalating tensions in the decades leading up to 1861. The idea that \\"Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession\\" is a component of the larger narrative and only represents one aspect of the broader historical, political, and societal canvas that ultimately erupted into the Civil War."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jean-Philippe Rameau (French: [Zafilip Ramo]; (1683-09-25)25 September 1683 - (1764-09-12)12 September 1764) was one of the most important French composers and music theorists of the 18th century. He replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer for the harpsichord of his time, alongside Francois Couperin. Little is known about Rameau's early years, and it was not until the 1720s that he won fame as a major theorist of music with his Treatise on Harmony (1722) and also in the following years as a composer of masterpieces for the harpsichord, which circulated throughout Europe. Unlike Lully, who collaborated with Philippe Quinault on almost all his operas, Rameau rarely worked with the same librettist twice. He was highly demanding and bad-tempered, unable to maintain longstanding partnerships with his librettists, with the exception of Louis de Cahusac, who collaborated with him on several operas, including Les fetes de l'Hymen et de l'Amour (1747), Zais (1748), Nais (1749), Zoroastre (1749; revised 1756), La naissance d'Osiris (1754), and Anacreon (the first of Rameau's operas by that name, 1754). He is also credited with writing the libretto of Rameau's final work, Les Boreades (c. 1763). Many Rameau specialists have regretted that the collaboration with Houdar de la Motte never took place, and that the Samson project with Voltaire came to nothing because the librettists Rameau did work with were second-rate. He made his acquaintance of most of them at La Poupliniere's salon, at the Societe du Caveau, or at the house of the Comte de Livry, all meeting places for leading cultural figures of the day. Not one of his librettists managed to produce a libretto on the same artistic level as Rameau's music: the plots were often overly complex or unconvincing. But this was standard for the genre, and is probably part of its charm. The versification, too, was mediocre, and Rameau often had to have the libretto modified and rewrite the music after the premiere because of the ensuing criticism. This is why we have two versions of Castor et Pollux (1737 and 1754) and three of Dardanus (1739, 1744, and 1760).

Cinema: A cinema is a place where people go to watch movies, which can offer an opportunity to unwind and escape from reality temporarily. However, not all movies may suit a gentleman's taste or promote relaxation. Therefore, the cinema could be a suitable relaxation spot but depends on the individual's preferences. 3.

News article: Hard Choices: Is it a book rollout or campaign tune up? Washington (CNN) -- A few hours before Hillary Clinton addressed an audience of around 6,000 people near Denver, the former secretary of state did what few people looking to sell a book would do: She toured a plastics factory. Clinton aides say the event was tied to her family's foundation -- the Clinton Global Initiative -- and the fact that its annual meeting will be held in Denver later this month. But the optics of the event said something different. After touring the factory and giving short remarks about the power of American business -- \\"I am convinced that American businesses can compete and win against anybody anywhere if we are at the top of our game,\\" she said -- Clinton stepped off the stage and headed to a rope line of eager factory workers and camera-toting employees. \\"Let me shake a few more hands,\\" Clinton said, a comment reminiscent of refrains made by Iowa- or New Hampshire-bound politicians. In the last month, these two facts have been evident: Clinton-land wants you to know she has a memoir -- \\"Hard Choices\\" -- coming out on June 10 and she has become more open about her presidential ambitions. Clinton discusses Berghdal in book And the two have a lot to do with one another. Instead of surrounding herself with the regular PR flacks and publicists in preparation to sell her book, Clinton has brought on seasoned campaign veterans and political communicators. Sources close to Clinton are talking about \\"war rooms\\" and \\"surrogate operations\\" instead of book signings. Clinton to take part in CNN town hall as book launches \\"This is a very well orchestrated roll out that is going to make the book have far more impact and, yes, will add to her sense of candidacy,\\" said David Gergen, a senior political analyst with CNN who has deep connections with the Clintons. \\"I think what you will see with her over the next year until she makes a firm decision is an occasional set of events like this that will keep her fresh, allow her to say her piece.\\" In addition to helping Clinton, the hypothetical candidate, Gergen said the book rollout will help her staff. \\"It gives them a sense of what a political campaign feels like,\\" he said. \\"I don't think she has made her final call yet, but she is clearly laying the groundwork in a way that suggests a very professional operation.\\" Earlier this year, the former senator was also more measured in her remarks and more sheepish when answering questions about 2016. In January, Clinton told an audience in New Orleans that she \\"wasn't thinking about\\" running and that she has \\"tried to get other people not to think about it.\\" In Portland, she shrugged when asked about 2016 and walked off stage to a chorus of laughs. In Miami, she commended the way the question was asked, but failed to actually answer it. Fast-forward to June and Clinton was more openly talking about the worst-kept-secret in Washington: She is thinking about running for president. In an interview with People Magazine that was part of the book rollout, Clinton said she knows she has \\"a decision to make\\" on 2016 and that she will \\"just have to make my own decision about what I think is right for me.\\" In her Colorado speech on Monday -- the one after her campaign style tour of the plastics plant -- Clinton called the presidency \\"as much a job as it is a mission\\" and when asked about how difficult it is to run, she remarked that she \\"luckily\\" has \\"a lot of resilience and a lot of stamina.\\" Her rhetoric, too, has started to sound more like a campaign. At the end of the speech in Colorado on Monday, Clinton closed with what sounded like an impassioned plea for support and, if the venue was different, for votes. \\"Please join me,\\" she said, her voice raising over the roaring crowd, \\"in making some hard choices for America.\\" Seasoned hands help communicate message With the stepped up rhetoric has come a more robust inner circle of Clinton aides to tightly and systematically trickle out information about the book. Once an operation with just a few press staff and advisers - along with dozens of informal friends and longtime confidants - the Clinton world has added a few seasoned political hands to help communicate Clinton's message around the book. The Clinton team brought on Tommy Vietor, a National Security Council spokesman during Obama's first term, to coordinate and assist in the response to the book and questions about Clinton's record at the State Department. It has also tapped Kiki McLean, a former Clinton senior adviser and veteran of five presidential campaigns, to coordinate the surrogate operation around the book. With the new hires comes what one source called a war room of former diplomats who stand ready to respond to criticism of Clinton's tenure at the State Department. It is safe to say that Clinton's book roll out is one of the first to use phrases like war room and surrogate operation. One of Clinton's closest advisers - Philippe Reines - also briefed a group of Democratic national security experts and communicators last week on the political scrutiny over the Benghazi terror attack and the themes of Clinton's book. The meeting was tightly controlled by Clinton's advisers, who told attendees that there would be no leaking what was discussed in the briefing. Outside groups have also begun to step up their activity around the book. Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton messaging and rapid response organization with deep ties to Clinton, hosted media training for their surrogates in May. Ready for Hillary, a pro-Clinton super PAC that is building grassroots support for the former first lady, announced on Wednesday that they would follow Clinton's book tour in \\"The Hillary Bus,\\" a mobile venue for the group to sign up supporters and support the pseudo-campaign. The groups that have Hillary's back Leaks and excerpts trickle out As her aides have been planning and preparing, Clinton has been all over the news. She appeared on the View in May - joking that she was \\"running ... around the park\\" -- and details about her book have slowly leaked out on a nearly daily basis. The first book excerpts came out in early May, when in honor of Mother's Day Vogue published a passage of Clinton's book that was dedicated to her mother. Then came the book's Author's Note, put out by Simon & Schuster, the book's publisher. Shortly after that, the most highly anticipated chapter of Clinton's book - her recollections and thoughts about Benghazi - was leaked to Politico. The speculation was that Clinton's staff wanted to get the news out of the way early so that it wouldn't shadow the rest of the book. On Thursday, CBS reported that Clinton talks about negotiations for captured soldier Bowe Bergdahl's release and her differences with Obama over arming Syrian rebels in the book, which it said it had gotten a copy of. Along the way, locations for Clinton's book tour were released: New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco, to name a few. If all of this seems reminiscent of a campaign, that's because it is. Seasoned staff, effective surrogate operations and coordinated leaks are what can make or break a political campaign. And as is evident with Clinton's stepped up presence and the slow trickle of news about her campaign, Clinton's book tour appears to be as much a memoir roll out as it is political tune up. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. Hillary Clinton's book rollout for \\"Hard Choices\\" has many similarities to a political campaign. 2. Clinton has brought on seasoned campaign veterans and political communicators for her book rollout, rather than regular PR staff. 3. She has become more open about her presidential ambitions in recent events and interviews. 4. A more robust inner circle within the Clinton team includes former political hands to help communicate her message around the book. 5. External pro-Clinton groups are stepping up their activity in support of her potential candidacy. 6. The article suggests that the book rollout is serving as a way to gauge public response and provide a political tune-up in preparation for a potential presidential campaign."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: Whose wife thinks he's a doctor?, using the article: Paige Collins and her husband Leo come out of a movie theater. On their way home, at a stop sign, Paige unbuckles her seatbelt to lean over and kiss Leo. At that very moment, a truck rams their car from behind and Paige crashes through the windshield. Both of them are rushed to the emergency room, and as Leo, in a voice-over talks about how \\"moments of impact help in finding who we are\\" the movie cuts to how Paige and Leo first met. The scenes of how they courted, became engaged and married at the Art Institute of Chicago and share a kiss under the Cloud Gate are interwoven with the present. When Paige regains consciousness, she thinks Leo is her doctor, having lost all memories of the past few years. When her wealthy parents, Bill and Rita Thornton, learn about this, they visit her. This is the first time that Leo meets them, and they do not appreciate Leo taking their daughter, and not being informed. Paige does not understand why he would not have met her parents, after having been married to her. She finds it even stranger that he did not know why either. Nor did she understand why she left law school, broke her engagement with her previous fiancé, Jeremy, and why she has not been in touch with her family and friends. Her parents insist on taking her home with them and Paige agrees, thinking she might have married Leo for some mutual benefit. She seeks evidence of the marriage. Just as she is about to leave, Leo comes running to play her a voice message in which she sounds very happy and romantic. Paige decides to go back with Leo, hoping it will help her regain her lost memory. Paige is welcomed home with a surprise party by her friends, but as she is not able to remember any of them, she finds it overwhelming and is extremely confused., what would be the answer ?

Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"sidewalk\\" and \\"grass lawn\\". A:","completion":"The surface with the most resistance between the two options is the \\"grass lawn.\\" When Eric tried rollerblading on the grass lawn, he experienced difficulty in moving easily and keeping up his speed. The reason behind this is that grass provides a higher resistance to movement due to its uneven surface, natural cushioning, and friction. Additionally, the softness and flexibility of grass make it difficult for the wheels of the rollerblades to maintain solid contact and achieve a smooth glide. On the other hand, the sidewalk provides a significantly smoother and harder surface for rollerblading. This allows Eric to move effortlessly and quickly on his rollerblades, giving him more control over his actions. The sidewalk's relatively even surface minimizes friction and resistance, making it the ideal option for rollerblading activities. In summary, the grass lawn presents more challenges and resistance for rollerblading when compared to the sidewalk, which offers an easier and faster rollerblading experience."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The group reacted in different ways--Daltrey and Entwistle lived comfortably, Townshend was embarrassed at his wealth, which he felt was at odds with Meher Baba's ideals, and Moon spent frivolously. During the latter part of 1970, Townshend plotted a follow up Tommy: Lifehouse, which was to be a multi-media project symbolising the relationship between an artist and his audience. He developed ideas in his home studio, creating layers of synthesizers, and the Young Vic theatre in London was booked for a series of experimental concerts. Townshend approached the gigs with optimism; the rest of the band were just happy to be gigging again. Eventually, the others complained to Townshend that the project was too complicated and they should simply record another album. Things deteriorated until Townshend had a nervous breakdown and abandoned Lifehouse. Entwistle was the first member of the group to release a solo album, Smash Your Head Against the Wall, in May 1971. Recording at the Record Plant in New York City in March 1971 was abandoned when Lambert's addiction to hard drugs interfered with his ability to produce. The group restarted with Glyn Johns in April. The album was mostly Lifehouse material, with one unrelated song by Entwistle, \\"My Wife\\", and was released as Who's Next in August. The album reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 4 in the US. \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" are early examples of synthesizer use in rock, featuring keyboard sounds generated in real time by a Lowrey organ; on \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", it was further processed through a VCS3 synthesizer. The synthesizer intro to \\"Baba O'Riley\\" was programmed based on Meher Baba's vital stats, and the track featured a violin solo by Dave Arbus. The album was a critical and commercial success, and has been certified 3x platinum by the RIAA. The Who continued to issue Lifehouse-related material over the next few years, including the singles \\"Let's See Action\\", \\"Join Together\\" and \\"Relay\\". The band went back on tour, and \\"Baba O' Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" became live favourites. In November they performed at the newly opened Rainbow Theatre in London for three nights, continuing in the US later that month, where Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times described the Who as \\"the Greatest Show on Earth\\".

In the equation -15*g + 9*g + 36 = 0, we can combine the terms with the variable g. -15g + 9g = -6g So, our equation becomes: -6g + 36 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable g. In order to solve for g, we need to isolate it. To achieve this, we can move the constant term (36) to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides. -6g + 36 - 36 = 0 - 36 This simplifies to: -6g = -36 Step 3: Solve for g. Now that we have isolated the variable, we can solve for g by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of g, which is -6. -6g / -6 = -36 / -6 This simplifies to: g = 6 So, the solution for the equation -15*g + 9*g + 36 = 0 is g = 6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. Nate and Andy were two zoologists.

Write an article based on this summary: – The hunt for an abandoned whaling fleet took NOAA archaeologists to what they describe as \\"one of the planet's most unexplored ocean regions\\": the waters off the Arctic coast of Alaska. There they say they've found two ships that have slumbered in the deep for almost a century and a half. And while the shipwrecks are associated with no human toll, an NOAA press release explains they did contribute to a death of sorts. The backstory: In September 1871, 33 of 40 whaling ships operating in the North Pacific—a group that had dwindled from 292 ships 25 years prior—found themselves trapped in ice. They were near the shore, and in prior years, the wind typically shifted, pushing the ice seaward and effectively unlocking the ships. That didn't happen that year, leaving 1,219 people \\"stranded at the top of the world.\\" Incredibly, they all survived, having made the decision to row 90 miles in whaling boats to the seven ships that had escaped the ice, reports KTVA. Still, the NOAA explains that the event is viewed as \\"one of the major causes of the demise of commercial whaling in the United States.\\" A project co-director explains to the Alaska Dispatch News that while items have washed ashore over the years, no items tied to the lost fleet had been found beneath the water. Using modern sonar and sensing technology and aided by an absence of ice in the Chukchi Sea, the \\"magnetic signature\\" of the two ships was established down to the \\"outline of their flattened hulls.\\" And while sea ice typically proves unfriendly to such relics, \\"we found artifacts that were just sitting\\" there in the fall of 2015, perhaps long protected by a sandbar. Among the finds: pots that rendered whale blubber into oil. (The ancient shipwreck capital of the world has been found.) Article:","completion":"A Forgotten Whaling Fleet: Rediscovering Abandoned Treasures in the Arctic Deep below the Arctic waters, off the Alaskan coast, lies a mystery that has been at rest for nearly 150 years. Recently, a team of NOAA archaeologists uncovered the remains of two ships belonging to a stranded whaling fleet from 1871, a finding that has shed light on the distant past and allowed a glimpse into the commercial whaling industry's decline in the United States. In September 1871, a group of 33 whaling ships in the North Pacific found themselves unexpectedly trapped in ice near the Alaska coastline. This was a stark contrast to their once-thriving fleet of 292 ships, which had dwindled significantly over a span of 25 years. Amid the icy surroundings, winds that would have typically pushed the ice seaward failed to shift, leaving the 1,219 crew members stranded far from civilization. This event, which marked a turning point in the U.S. commercial whaling industry, was often referred to as the death knell for American whaling. In dire circumstances, the crews from the trapped ships made the courageous decision to row 90 miles in their whaling boats to meet the seven ships that had managed to escape the grip of the unforgiving ice—saving their lives in the process. In the years since the mysterious disappearance of the fleet, no items tied to the lost ships had been discovered underwater. The recent discovery, however, has provided a valuable look at the remains of the fleet, shedding light on what once was. Using advanced underwater sonar and sensing technology, the NOAA archaeologists carefully surveyed the water and sea floor of the Chukchi Sea—an area that's often plagued by dangerous ice—and established the magnetic signature of the two shipwrecks down to their flattened hulls’ precise outlines. As they explored further, the archaeologists stumbled upon several artifacts that had been perfectly preserved, seemingly protected by a sandbar for over a century. Among the many archaeological treasures, they discovered pots that were once used for rendering whale blubber into precious whale oil—a discovery that decisively ties the artifacts to the 1871 whaling fleet whose fate had previously confounded historians. This underwater exploration at the top of the world provides an essential piece of information in unraveling the long-forgotten history of the whaling industry in the United States. As more research begins, it is hoped that the story of this fleet will reveal further insights into the era of commercial whaling and contribute to the broader understanding of our past. With stunning discoveries such as this, it's a clear reminder that there are countless stories yet to be uncovered beneath the ocean's constantly changing landscape. Through the tireless efforts of research teams like the NOAA archaeologists, we can piece together the hidden clues that lie in the watery depths and illuminate the fascinating history that binds us all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him. As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: I read this background article the other day: The Mercator projection is best within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. Yet, on a Mercator projection, Greenland looks almost as big the United States. Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continent's shape and size are greatly increased. The United States is closer to its true dimensions. I am facing a new situation today: Bob is looking at a map with Mercator projection to help him with his geography class. He noticed that Ecuador is within fifteen degrees north or south of the equator, but Norway is farther north of the equator. Bob starts to see how a country's location on a map affects how they look. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would Norway be closer to or further from its true dimentions? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information from the background article, Norway would be further from its true dimensions on a Mercator projection map. This is because Norway is located farther north of the equator, beyond the 15 degrees range where the Mercator projection is most accurate. As a country moves further away from the equator in the Mercator projection, its shape and size become more distorted and stretched, resulting in a less accurate representation of its true dimensions. Therefore, Norway's appearance on a Mercator projection map would be more distorted compared to a country like Ecuador, which is within the 15 degrees range where the map projection is more accurate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Douglas practised on his own until 1884, when his son, Colin, became ill. He then took Daniel Porter Fordham into partnership and practised as Douglas & Fordham. Fordham was born around 1846 and had been an assistant in Douglas's office since at least 1872. In 1898, having developed consumption, Fordham retired from the practice and went to live in Bournemouth where he died the following year. He was replaced as partner by Charles Howard Minshull, who had been born in Chester in 1858 and who became articled to Douglas in 1874; the practice became Douglas & Minshull. During the first decade of the 20th century, Douglas became less active but, for reasons which are unknown, the partnership was dissolved in 1909. The practice returned to the title of John Douglas, Architect. Minshull went into partnership with E. J. Muspratt in Foregate Street, Chester. When Douglas died, this partnership worked from the Abbey Square address as Douglas, Minshull & Muspratt.Little is known about Douglas's private life and personality. Only two images of him are known to survive. One is a photograph taken in later middle age. The other is a caricature sketch made by an assistant in his office. This shows him in old age, bowed, bent and bespectacled, carrying a portfolio and an ear trumpet.

His obituary in the Chester Chronicle stated that he \\"lived heart and soul in his profession\\".Douglas was a dedicated Christian who regularly attended his local church, St Paul's Church, Boughton, a church he rebuilt. His house, Walmoor Hill, included an oratory.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two sentences are not paraphrases of each other as they convey different information and have a different focus. Their structures, though similar, result in different meanings. The first sentence: 1. Corozal is a town and municipality in the Sucre department of northern Colombia. This sentence is focused on Corozal and conveys that it is a town and municipality located within the Sucre department of northern Colombia. Here, the Sucre department is a broader geographical and administrative area, within which the town of Corozal is situated. The second sentence: 2. Sucre Department is a town and municipality in the Corozal, northern Colombia. This sentence, on the other hand, appears to be incorrect or at least confusing in its structure and meaning. It seems to convey that the Sucre Department is a town and municipality located within Corozal, which contradicts the information in the first sentence. In actuality, Sucre is a department in northern Colombia, and Corozal is a town within Sucre. The sentence should be rephrased to reflect this correct relationship. A more accurate revision of the second sentence would be: 2. Sucre Department is a department in northern Colombia, home to the town and municipality of Corozal. In summary, the original sentences are not paraphrases of each other, as they provide different information and have distinct meanings.

Step 1: Combine like terms on the right side of the equation. -35 - 78 equals -113. So, the equation now becomes: 21w - 29 = -113. Step 2: To isolate the term with variable 'w', we need to get rid of -29 from the left-hand side which is subtracting from 21w. We do this by adding 29 to both sides of the equation. This does not change the equality. This gives us: 21w = -113 + 29. Step 3: Further simplify the right side: -113 + 29 equals -84. So, the simplified equation is: 21w = -84. Step 4: To solve for 'w', we must get rid of the coefficient of 'w'. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 21. This operation does not change the equality: w = -84 / 21. Step 5: After performing the division, we find that 'w' equals -4. Therefore, the solution to the given equation is w = -4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Geologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes. To understand the differences, they have made a chart where they divided the earth into two regions, region A and region B. In region A many earthquakes happen, but in region B no earthquakes happen. Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Answer:","completion":"Region B would be further from a plate boundary. The paragraph states that almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, and that all types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. This is due to the convection within the Earth, causing the plates to move and stresses to build up within the rocks. When the stress becomes too much, the rocks break and release the energy stored in them, creating an earthquake. Given this information, we can infer that region A, where many earthquakes occur, would be closer to a plate boundary where the tectonic plates are interacting, causing frequent earthquakes. On the other hand, region B, where no earthquakes happen, would likely be further from a plate boundary, as there is less or no interaction between tectonic plates in that area, resulting in a lower likelihood of earthquakes occurring. Therefore, region B would be further from a plate boundary in comparison to region A, which would be nearer to a plate boundary and experience more earthquakes due to the tectonic plate interactions and stress buildup."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

City go top of tree, down Magpies in controversial affair - Premier League News Updated Jan 12, 2014 2:06 PM ET Manchester City beat Newcastle United 2-0 on a controversial afternoon at St James' Park to go top of the Premier League. Edin Dzeko put Manchester City ahead from Aleksandar Kolarov's cross after just eight minutes, but their lead was only intact at half-time thanks to a contentious decision from referee Mike Jones. Cheick Tiote thought he had equalized with a powerful strike into the top corner from the edge of the area, but the goal was disallowed after Jones consulted with his assistant and ruled that Yoan Gouffran was offside and interfering with play. Newcastle kept pushing for an equalizer and Joe Hart had to make several important stops in a fiery second half, when Samir Nasri was stretchered off after a challenge by Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa. Alvaro Negredo then grabbed a second on the counter-attack in stoppage-time to lift City above Chelsea and Arsenal. City, fresh from their 6-0 Capital One Cup semi-final first leg demolition of West Ham, started well as Kolarov terrorized Yanga-Mbiwa. It took them just eight minutes to go ahead when David Silva played Kolarov in behind Yanga-Mbiwa and his driven cross was thumped home by Dzeko. It could have been worse for the Magpies with the in-form Negredo just failing to connect with another Kolarov cross in front of goal and then looping a header on to the roof of Tim Krul's net. But with Yohan Cabaye, who had started in a No.10 role behind Loic Remy, dropping deeper, the home side took a foothold in the game and gradually stemmed the tide. Steven Taylor stabbed a Cabaye corner wide, and the Frenchman forced a fine 33rd-minute save from Hart with a rasping shot from a tight angle. But the resulting corner brought controversy as Newcastle thought they had dragged themselves back into the game. The ball was cleared to Tiote on the edge of the box and he unleashed the sweetest of left-foot strikes which left Hart rooted to the spot as it screamed into the back of the net. The midfielder set off on a joyous run, unaware that Jones was consulting his assistant. Replays confirmed that Gouffran was one of three players in an offside position, and the pair decided the Frenchman was interfering with play, a view not shared by the vast majority of the 49,423 spectators inside St James' Park. Alan Pardew was certainly of that persuasion and he and Manuel Pellegrini were involved in a heated exchange as the whistle approached. Buoyed by a sense of injustice, the Magpies returned in determined mood and Vurnon Anita forced a 48th-minute save from Hart before Remy was presented with a glorious opportunity to level. Which big name stars could be on the move? Find out at the Rumor Mill. Moussa Sissoko's pass put the striker in on goal, but as he tried to turn inside Vincent Kompany rather than shooting first time, he took a touch too many and the chance had gone. However, City were far from done and Krul had to make a fine 55th-minute block to keep out a point-blank header from Negredo, who had earlier fired high over on the turn. But Hart had to dive to his right to keep out Cabaye's swerving 59th-minute attempt and then punch away the same player's free-kick two minutes later with the home side dominating. The former Lille midfielder was waging a one-man war on Hart's goal and sent another dipping shot just over with 68 minutes gone, but it was Remy who was denied by the goalkeeper after latching on to Gouffran's cross two minutes later as Kompany and Pablo Zabaleta collided. As Newcastle pushed forward, City exploited the space they left behind and Fernandinho rattled Krul's crossbar with an 87th-minute header. Remy might have snatched a point with a header which sailed just high and wide from Cabaye's corner and Taylor saw an injury-time shot blocked by Dzeko. However, Negredo made sure City would displace Chelsea deep into the 95th-minute, despite Krul blocking his initial effort. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1.

Question: Two farms were selling on Seattle markets. Berry farm, which used organic methods, no fertilizers and pesticides, and Rose farm, which used conventional agricultural methods, including fertilizers and pesticides. Which farm contributes less to the carrying of chemicals to nearby rivers? Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Answer:","completion":"After considering the given information, we can determine which farm contributes less to the carrying of chemicals to nearby rivers. Step 1: Analyze the farming methods - Berry farm uses organic methods, with no fertilizers and pesticides. - Rose farm uses conventional agricultural methods, with fertilizers and pesticides. Step 2: Consider the impact of these methods on the environment - Berry farm's methods are less likely to introduce chemicals into nearby bodies of water, as there are no synthetic chemicals used. - Rose farm's methods introduce chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, into the environment. These chemicals can be picked up by rainwater, infiltrate the groundwater, and lead to contaminated water sources. Step 3: Establish which farm contributes less to the carrying of chemicals to nearby rivers - Based on the given information and the analysis of the two farms' methods, Berry farm is less likely to contribute to the carrying of chemicals to nearby rivers. This is because they use organic methods without adding synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, reducing the chances of chemicals contaminating water sources. On the other hand, Rose farm's use of conventional agricultural methods with fertilizers and pesticides increases the risk of contributing to chemical pollution in nearby rivers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Yes for the following movie plot: The initial scenes establish that Joanna Stayton (Goldie Hawn), is a spoiled brat who always gets her way, the ultimate rich bitch, and the pampered wife of pretentious socialite Grant Stayton III (Edward Herrmann).Using Roman numerals after your name is Hollywood shorthand for \\"pretentious snob\\", and Grant is that, and self centered to boot, however, Joanna is far worse. She is not only snobbish but also idle, pampered, sharp-tongued, impossible to please and unfailingly rude to anyone she considers her social inferior, which is virtually all of the human race. To describe Joanna as unsympathetic is a huge understatement, a better description would be \\"prize bitch\\".When Grant's luxury yacht develops engine trouble, Grant is forced to put into the small Oregon coastal town of Elk Snout for repairs.While the huge yacht is in port, Joanna hires Dean Proffitt (Kurt Russell), a poor carpenter who has just moved to Oregon, to build better shoe storage for her closet in the yacht. Dean is a skilled craftsman, rather picky about what he uses, such as the wood that should be used to protect the leather from salt spray in a ship. Joanna is also not impressed by his taking so long, as he designed intricate shelves that confuse and annoy her.An early funny scene in the movie has Joanna lecturing Andrew the butler ( Roddy McDowall), on why the caviar he had just delivered her was no good, while Dean, standing in the background, has his tape measure pointing suggestively skyward.When the work is complete she refuses to pay him in a dispute over the quality of his workmanship, claiming that the closet is not up to her standards. In the ensuing argument Joanna loses her temper, pushes Dean overboard and throws his tools after him.The yacht crew has long ago gotten used to keep quiet and accept the guff from Joanna and Grant, despite that they have been treated like dirt, particularly family butler Andrew.After a typically stormy dinner that night, Joanna drops her wedding ring behind a seat on the deck.

It takes 24 hours for #39;The Sun #39; to identify the woman as the US publisher of The Spectator - Kimberly Fortier, who has since adopted her married name Quinn. What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about the revelation of an affair between David Blunkett, a prominent British political figure at the time, and a married woman, Kimberly Fortier, who has since adopted her married name of Quinn. This information was made public by two major British newspapers, the News of the World and The Sun. David Blunkett served as the Member of Parliament for Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough and held various positions within the UK government, most notably as the Home Secretary. In this role, he was responsible for overseeing matters related to immigration, national security, and criminal justice in the country. He was also a prominent member of the Labour Party. On the other hand, Kimberly Fortier (now Quinn) was a US-born publisher, who at the time of the news, was the publisher of The Spectator, a long-running British political and cultural magazine. She held a significant position in the UK media landscape and was married to Stephen Quinn, the publisher of British Vogue. The text highlights the quick response of the papers in reporting on the affair, with The Sun identifying Kimberly Fortier less than 24 hours after the original revelation in News of the World. Both newspapers are known for their sensationalist and tabloid-style coverage of public figures, which contributes to the rapid dissemination of the news. The implications of this revelation concerning Blunkett's affair were undoubtedly significant for both parties involved. For Blunkett, the scandal not only affected his private life but also had severe repercussions for his political career. The speculation around this affair led to his resignation from his position as Home Secretary in December 2004, following a separate issue involving the fast-tracking of a visa for Fortier's nanny. This resignation marked a turning point in his political career, and he later resigned from the Shadow Cabinet and Parliament. On the other hand, the revelation of the affair put a spotlight on Kimberly Fortier's personal life, which attracted a lot of unwanted media attention. This undoubtedly led to strains on her marriage with Stephen Quinn and affected their family life. It is also reasonable to assume that her professional life, as publisher of The Spectator, was affected by the unwanted publicity following the scandal. In conclusion, this text is about the public exposure of an affair between a prominent British politician, David Blunkett, and a married woman, Kimberly Fortier. The quick reaction of the British newspapers in reporting and identifying Fortier emphasizes the sensationalist nature of tabloid journalism. The scandal had significant ramifications for both parties involved, leading to the eventual resignation of Blunkett from his political career and causing personal and professional upheaval for Fortier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration . Options are: + negative + positive","completion":"Upon analyzing the sentiment of the given sentence, let us break down its various components to understand the overall meaning and tone. 1. \\"comically dismal social realism\\": This phrase contains seemingly contradictory elements like 'comically' and 'dismal'. \\"Comically\\" implies humor or amusement, while \\"dismal\\" denotes a gloomy or depressing situation. The combination of these words suggests that the subject consists of a humorous or amusing take on a bleak social reality. 2. \\"farcically bawdy fantasy\\": The term \\"farcically\\" evokes a sense of theatrical exaggeration, while \\"bawdy\\" alludes to humorously indecent or risque content. When combined with \\"fantasy,\\" this phrase implies an over-the-top and outlandish scenario that carries a rather positive and entertaining connotation, as it diverts from the norm and suggests a departure from the \\"dismal social realism\\" mentioned previously. 3. \\"redemption and regeneration\\": Lastly, these words contribute a positive sentiment to the sentence, as they imply a possibility of improvement or change for the better. \\"Redemption\\" indicates that there is hope for rectifying past mistakes, and \\"regeneration\\" suggests a renewal or revival of some sort. To sum up, the sentence's overall sentiment does comprise a balance between negative aspects (dismal social realism) and positive elements (comically bawdy fantasy, redemption, and regeneration). However, it seems to lean more towards a positive sentiment, as the negative facets are tempered by comical tones, and the conclusion of the sentence features hope and optimism. Hence, I would conclude that the sentiment of the sentence is + positive."},{"prompt":"Information: - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe.

A man living in Vancouver, Canada, dismayed by the everyday litter pollution, has opted to quit his job and take up the responsibility of improving the environment. This tale of selflessness rekindles the perspective that every person has a role to play in ensuring nature thrives for future generations. Step 1: Background on the situation in Vancouver The city of Vancouver, a coastal seaport in western Canada, has been grappling with an escalating litter problem. The surge in discrepancies concerning disposal of waste has led to environmental issues such as pollution to urban water systems and harm to local wildlife. In addition, litter on streets and public spaces results in a negative public perception of the local community, deterring tourists and investment. Step 2: Introducing the protagonist The protagonist in this inspiring narrative is an ordinary resident of Vancouver, passionate about preserving the environment and making the world a better place. Recognizing the need for immediate action, he made the decision to quit his job and devote his time to solving the problem of litter pollution in his community. Step 3: Address the importance of tackling litter Litter may seem like a relatively minor issue compared to large-scale environmental concerns, such as climate change or deforestation. However, litter pollution is a pressing matter in numerous cities across the world. It poses threats to local ecosystems, breeds disease-carrying pests, promotes pollution, and takes away from the city's beauty. Step 4: Describing his actions and initiatives The man in question, after leaving his job, embarked on a one-man crusade to create a cleaner Vancouver. He began by picking up garbage daily, determined to raise awareness about the litter problem and inspire others to join in. As he identified different litter hotspots, he developed strategies to target specific areas or organize larger clean-up events, which drew upon the support and enthusiasm of fellow residents. Step 5: Results and impact on the local community As a direct result of his tireless efforts, the streets of Vancouver have started to garner a more positive reputation. The cleanups have encouraged a newfound sense of pride and community spirit, with residents appreciating the importance of maintaining a clean environment. Streams and other bodies of water once littered with waste have become cleaner and healthier, improving the welfare of local wildlife, water quality, and overall ecosystem health. Step 6: Fostering a global mindset of environmental stewardship The story of the man in Vancouver represents a shining example of civic duty and environmental awareness. His journey should serve as motivation for individuals worldwide to step up, act locally and think globally. With collective effort, we can work together to address the litter pollution problem and protect our environment for future generations. Conclusion: The selfless actions of one man in Vancouver, driven by love for his city and concern for the environment, have made a remarkable difference in improving the issue of litter pollution. This tale should serve as a reminder to all that each of our actions, no matter how small, can have a significant impact on our environment and the quality of life for future generations. Let us embrace this spirit of social responsibility and be active stewards of our planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: PURPOSE Most patients with advanced pancreas cancer experience pain and must limit their daily activities because of tumor-related symptoms. To date, no treatment has had a significant impact on the disease. In early studies with gemcitabine, patients with pancreas cancer experienced an improvement in disease-related symptoms. Based on those findings, a definitive trial was performed to assess the effectiveness of gemcitabine in patients with newly diagnosed advanced pancreas cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS One hundred twenty-six patients with advanced symptomatic pancreas cancer completed a lead-in period to characterize and stabilize pain and were randomized to receive either gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 weekly x 7 followed by 1 week of rest, then weekly x 3 every 4 weeks thereafter (63 patients), or to fluorouracil (5-FU) 600 mg/m2 once weekly (63 patients). The primary efficacy measure was clinical benefit response, which was a composite of measurements of pain (analgesic consumption and pain intensity), Karnofsky performance status, and weight. Clinical benefit required a sustained (> or = 4 weeks) improvement in at least one parameter without worsening in any others. Other measures of efficacy included response rate, time to progressive disease, and survival. RESULTS Clinical benefit response was experienced by 23.8% of gemcitabine-treated patients compared with 4.8% of 5-FU-treated patients (P = .0022). The median survival durations were 5.65 and 4.41 months for gemcitabine-treated and 5-FU-treated patients, respectively (P = .0025). The survival rate at 12 months was 18% for gemcitabine patients and 2% for 5-FU patients. Treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that gemcitabine is more effective than 5-FU in alleviation of some disease-related symptoms in patients with advanced, symptomatic pancreas cancer. Gemcitabine also confers a modest survival advantage over treatment with 5-FU. A:","completion":"True"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

After a tough home loss to the Ravens, the Steelers traveled to San Diego to take on the Chargers. The Chargers scored first in the first quarter when Philip Rivers found Antonio Gates on a 12-yard pass for a 7-0 lead. The Steelers got on the board in the 2nd quarter when Chris Boswell nailed a 47-yard field goal for a 7-3 game at halftime. After the break, the Steelers took the lead as Antwon Blake picked off Philip Rivers and returned it 70 yards for a TD and a 10-7 lead for the only score of the period. In the 4th quarter the Chargers scored 10 points first tying the game 10-10 when Josh Lambo kicked a 40-yard field goal followed up by Rivers and Gates hooking up again this time on an 11-yard TD pass for a 17-10 lead. The Steelers tied the game back up when Michael Vick found Markus Wheaton on a 72-yard TD pass for a 17-17 game. The Chargers retook the lead when Lambo kicked a 54-yard field goal for a 20-17 lead. Getting the ball back with less than 2 minutes left, the Steelers drove down the field. Le'Veon Bell ran for a TD from a yard out to win the game. With the game 23-20, officials had to review it to make sure he reached in before his knee hit the ground. The call stood and then Boswell kicked the PAT for a 24-20 victory. The Steelers defense continued their surprising resurgence of sacks and takeaways by sacking Rivers twice and getting two more turnovers. The offense scored on their final possession as time expired to clinch a much-needed road win against the Chargers. The win improved the Steelers to 3-2 on the season and snapped a five-game losing streak in California. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many yards shorter was Josh Lambo's first field goal from his second?","completion":"Josh Lambo's first field goal was 40 yards and his second field goal was 54 yards. To find how many yards shorter the first field goal was, we subtract the smaller number (40) from the bigger number (54). So, 54 - 40 = 14 yards.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Premise: \\"is uh appropriate but i think there are some some modifications even that could be made uh\\" Hypothesis: \\"I think you can change how it looks.\\" The premise suggests that something is suitable or acceptable as it is, but the speaker thinks that there could be some modifications made. The context or nature of the modifications isn't specified - it could be about how it looks, works, sounds, etc. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is suggesting that the appearance of something can be altered. To decide if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, I need to assess if the premise logically implies the hypothesis. In this case, while it's possible that the modifications could be related to appearance, the premise doesn't specifically confirm this - it just mentions vague \\"modifications\\". So, based on the premise provided, we don't have enough specific information to say that it directly leads to the hypothesis. There's no clear necessary connection or logical implication that the premise, which talks about generic modifications, entails the hypothesis, which specifically talks about changing looks, without additional context. Therefore, I would conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Becoming a Microsoft MVP doesn’t technically mean you’ve joined a club; rather, it means you’ve earned an award. And, like most awards, this one can be rescinded if you don’t conduct yourself in a professional manner. In reality, though, there aren’t any big surprises in the code of conduct, which can be found at https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/mvp-code-of-conduct. Grounds for having your award rescinded include, for example: harassing, abusing, or discriminating against others; libeling or slandering Microsoft or any of its employees; violating confidentiality agreements; plagiarizing the work of others; posing as a Microsoft employee. In addition to the honor of getting the award, there are also tangible benefits that come with becoming a Microsoft MVP. These include, but are not limited to, the following: Early access to Microsoft products. Direct access to Microsoft product teams in your field. An invitation to the Global MVP summit, held annually at Microsoft HQ in Redmond, Washington, USA. Microsoft MVP awards last for 1 year, unless you do one of the following: give back the award; have the award rescinded for misconduct; or take a job with Microsoft. You can’t renew an existing MVP award, but you can be nominated year after year continuously. For example, you’ll see people in the field who style themselves as an “8-year Microsoft MVP.” This means that they’ve held 1-year MVP awards 8 different times (consecutively or not), not that they’ve held a single MVP award for 8 years. As soon as you finish celebrating your first MVP award, start thinking about what you can do to earn another one. Each year, your nomination will be evaluated over again, with the expectation that you’ve continued to share your passion, knowledge, and expertise. This means that someone who has held MVP awards for 10 consecutive years has consistently worked to earn that recognition the entire time. Microsoft MVPs often form both professional relationships and personal friendships during their terms. To help facilitate continued networking among former MVPs, Microsoft has created the “MVP Reconnect” program. It’s essentially an online forum that makes it easier for former MVPs to keep in touch. You’re eligible if: you’re a former MVP who left the program in good standing (that is, didn’t have your award rescinded); you still meet the conditions of the MVP Code of conduct; and you don’t work for Microsoft. If you take a job with Microsoft or earn another MVP award, you’ll have to quit the MVP Reconnect program. You can join again if your circumstances change once more.","completion":"The Microsoft MVP award recognizes individuals for their professional conduct and expertise in Microsoft technologies, offering benefits such as early product access, invitations to Global MVP summits, and networking opportunities, while the award can be rescinded for misconduct or violation of the MVP Code of Conduct."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Why is Selena interested in Union Station? Movie title: Collateral Damage Movie plot: A bomb detonates in the plaza of the Colombian Consulate building in Los Angeles, killing nine people, including a caravan of Colombian officials and American intelligence agents. Among the civilians killed are the wife and son of LAFD firefighter, Captain Gordon \\"Gordy\\" Brewer, who was injured in the explosion. A tape is sent to the U.S. State Department, in which a masked man calling himself \\"El Lobo\\" (The Wolf) claims responsibility, explaining it was in retaliation for the oppression of Colombia by the United States. The FBI believes El Lobo is a Colombian terrorist named Claudio Perrini. CIA Special Agent Peter Brandt, the Colombia Station Chief, is harshly reprimanded for the incident by a Senate Oversight Committee, who promptly terminate all CIA operations in Colombia. Brandt angrily returns to MompÃ³s and meets with his paramilitary allies to plan a major offensive to take down Claudio. Frustrated at the political red tape regarding the investigation, Brewer travels to MompÃ³s to personally hunt down Claudio but is quickly arrested for illegal entry. The guerrillas stage a prison break to free their comrades and abduct Brewer to demand a large ransom for him. Brandt's unit is alerted to Brewer's presence in Colombia but arrive too late. Brewer escapes the prison, avoids being captured, and secures a guerrilla zone pass from Canadian mechanic Sean Armstrong. Armstrong introduces him to drug runner Felix Ramirez, the manager of the cocaine distribution facility that finances the guerrillas. Pretending to be a mechanic, Brewer rigs several improvised explosives and destroys the facility. Felix is blamed for the destruction of the drug plant and is executed in front of a hiding Brewer's eyes. Brewer infiltrates Claudio's headquarters and plants a bomb to kill him, but he is captured when he tries to prevent a woman, Selena, from being caught in the blast radius along with her son, Mauro. At Claudio's home compound, Selena reveals she is Claudio's wife. She and Claudio once lost their own child during an... Answer:","completion":"Selena is interested in Union Station for a few reasons. Firstly, Union Station is a symbolic location that holds significance for various groups and individuals in the film. As a central hub for transportation in Los Angeles, it represents a prime target for acts of terrorism or sabotage, which would garner significant attention and potentially further the goals of the film's antagonist, Claudio Perrini (El Lobo). Another reason Selena may be interested in Union Station is that it could serve as an ideal meeting point for planning and coordinating the activities of Claudio's group. Its busy nature and multiple points of entry and exit make it a suitable location for carrying out operations discreetly, without raising suspicion. Additionally, Selena might see Union Station as a potential location to use as leverage against authorities. Given the high stakes of the film's plot, taking control of such a high-profile location would put pressure on law enforcement and government agencies to cooperate with the demands of Claudio and his group, or risk further loss of life and property. It is also possible that Selena, as Claudio's wife, has personal motivations for being interested in Union Station. She may have a personal connection to the location or some unresolved issues from her past that have led her to become entangled in Claudio's campaign of violence and revenge. Selena's interest in Union Station may not be strictly aligned with Claudio's motives, but rather tied to her own personal journey and evolution as a character in the film. In summary, Selena's interest in Union Station can be attributed to its symbolic importance, its strategic location for planning and executing operations, its potential use as leverage against authorities, and personal motivations related to her connection within the film's plot. Recognizing these dimensions of her interest can help in understanding how Union Station serves as a key element in the film and provides a backdrop against which significant events and character interactions take place."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How do you program a robot?","completion":"Imagine you have a toy robot, and you want to teach it to do things like move, dance, or pick up stuff. To do that, you need to tell the robot exactly what to do using a special language called programming. Think of programming a robot like giving it a set of instructions, kinda like a recipe. 1. Choose the right programming language: Just like how people speak different languages like English, Spanish, or Chinese, robots understand programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or C++. You need to pick the one that your robot can understand. 2. Learn the basics: Before you start telling your robot what to do, you have to learn its language. You can read books, watch videos, or take a class to learn how to write simple instructions. 3. Plan your robot's actions: You need to decide what you want your robot to do. Break the goal into smaller steps. For example, if you want your robot to pick up a ball, you might break it into steps like move forward, lower its arm, grab the ball, and lift its arm. 4. Write the instructions: Now that you know the language and have a plan, you can start writing the instructions for each step. These instructions are called code. 5. Test and fix: Once your code is written, you need to see if it works. Turn on your robot and watch what it does. If it doesn't do what you want, you'll need to change the code and fix any mistakes. 6. Practice and improve: The more you work with your robot, the better you'll get at programming it. Keep learning, trying new things, and making your robot do more cool stuff! Remember, programming a robot can be hard sometimes, but it's also really fun, like teaching your toy robot to dance!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's...

The adaptations of lyrics, script and music are often awkward: it was a bad move to base the film on Marc Blitzstein's bowdlerised Broadway version, but at least his words were singable, unlike most of what's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness. And the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist-shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain-basement Vittorio Storaro fails utterly -- the film just looks cheap, shoddy and thoughtlessly made. Disgraceful. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review thought negatively of the movie.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Paragraph: Bob's parents were in their early 60's. He sent them to the doctor's for a routine check up. Dan, his dad, had very high cholesterol, while Mary, his mom , had normal levels in her blood. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which parent had fewer plaques that could potentially block blood flow? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Mary, Bob's mom, had normal cholesterol levels in her blood. Since high cholesterol contributes to the formation of plaques in the arteries, which can potentially block blood flow, it is more likely that Mary had fewer plaques compared to Dan, who had very high cholesterol levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: On a hot summer's day Jonathan and his classmates were anxiously sitting in their classroom, waiting for the final bell of the day to sound. Jonathan prayed that the bell would ring soon, because he wanted to quickly run home before the three huge, fat, smelly bullies could see him. Every day the three bullies would wait there for an innocent school kid to tease and bully. The moment the bell sounded, Jonathan rushed out with his bag. He sped off across the school field and out onto the walkway. However, all of his effort was useless because leaning on a fence were the three bullies. Jonathan thought about crossing the street next to him, but it would be too risky. So he hid behind a small bush in hope that the three would leave. But he moved too quickly and was seen by one of the bullies. They approached him then. One bully grabbed Jonathan by the collar of his shirt and grabbed the money out of Jonathan's pocket and put it into his own. \\"G-Give it back\\", Jonathan weakly said. \\"G-G-Give it b-back\\", mocked the bully. The other two bullies laughed. Beside them was a small dirty stream. \\"Let's throw him in there\\", said one of the bullies. Then they threw Jonathan into the stream and walked off down the walkway. Jonathan shakily picked himself up out of the creek and continued his walk home with his head down and tears in his eyes. He dared not cry because he knew boys didn't cry.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON — As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted. South Dakotans will decide whether to make statewide offices nonpartisan and create a citizens commission to redraw voting districts after each 10-year national census, removing...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: This method is sometimes called \\"the traditional method.\\" It involves adding the numbers in units of single digits, then by units of tens, then by units of hundreds. This is accomplished by working from right to left.Start by adding the figures 383 + 412 + 122. Draw a line below the numbers. This line is equivalent to the equal sign in linear math. You will write your final sum below this line, starting on the right and moving to the left. Careful placement of each number is essential in this method. Make sure you are careful to place each number directly below the one above it. That is, 3, 1, and 2 should each be in a column of their own - these are the single digits. 8, 2, and 2 should be in a column - these are the units of tens. 3, 4, and 1 should be in a column - these are the hundreds. You may wish to use graph paper to help you keep your lines straight. Beginning learners may even draw templates of horizontal rows and vertical columns to practice lining their numbers up correctly. Add these numbers, and write the sum directly below this column, below the line. In the example above, adding 3 + 2 + 2 = 7. Write the 7 below the line. You can also choose to add these numbers individually: 3 + 2 = 5. 5 + 2 = 7. Add the number from the next column to the left. In our example, this would be 8 + 1 + 2. Continue working in this way from right to left until all numbers are added. It is the same sequence no matter how many columns of numbers you have. You can have as few as two columns, and as many as your page will hold. It is also the same sequence no matter how many numbers are in your columns. Use this sequence to add any two or more large numbers. If the sum is more than one digit, you will need to \\"carry\\" the extra digit. This means that you will need to add an additional number into the next column to the left. You easily do this by writing a small number one to the top of your next column. This is called \\"showing your work.\\" For example, add the sum 982 + 247 + 475, then draw a line beneath. Using the right-to-left method, add 2 + 7 + 5. The sum is 14. Write the 4 beneath the line on the right side as the sum, and write a small number 1 above the next column to the left. When you are adding the next column, simply include the additional 1 as a part of your sum. For example, the next column would be the equation 8 + 4 + 7 (+1) = 20. Write the 0 below the line, and write the 2 above the next column to the left. Your next column will now read: 9 + 2 + 4 (+2). Add these numbers. Because there is no additional column, you can now write your sum entire, whether it's one digit or two. In this case, the sum is 17. Look at the sum now written below the line: 1704. This is your total. This process can be done either mentally or on paper, and consists of rearranging the digits you're adding for easier arithmetic.This technique works well when adding long columns of numbers. Either mentally or with a pencil, go down the vertical column of numbers you need to add, and group them into units of 10. For instance, in the vertical column 9 + 3 + 7 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 4 + 1, you can find three units of 10 (3 + 7, 2 + 4 + 4, 9 + 1) with 7 left. Therefore, your sum of this single column will be 37. If you have a second vertical column, write the 7 at the base of the right column, and carry the 3. Repeat this process until all columns have been added. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the traditional method for adding large numbers involves placing the numbers in columns according to their place value (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) and working from right to left. Draw a horizontal line beneath the columns and tally the numbers in each column, starting from the rightmost. Record your sum beneath this line, moving leftward across the columns.

GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Even if you are not a boxing fan you probably heard of Muhammad Ali, right? You are about to meet a man some say is even greater than Ali. They call him the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. His name is Manny \\"Pacman\\" Pacquiao, and he is from the toughest streets in the Philippines. He's a national hero there for winning 10 world titles in eight different weight classes, also he's an elected congressman back home. So what is he doing in Washington? He came to meet with Capitol Hill leaders, as well as President Obama. SEN. HARRY REID, D-NEV.: He's a fighter, the best pound-per-pound fighter on the planet today. He's a man who is so fun to watch. JENKINS: Congressman, welcome to Washington. MANNY PACQUIAO, BOXER: Thank you. JENKINS: You have been called by Senator Reid the greatest fighter of all time. But you are in politics. Why did you get into politics? PACQUIAO: I want to serve people. JENKINS: What do you hope to achieve with public service to your family, friends and countrymen in the Philippines, what do you hope to accomplish with your service? PACQUIAO: Before I have a dream to be a champion. Now in politics I have a dream to achieve to be champion also, being a public servant. I want to help people. JENKINS: Your political party, the People's Champ Movement. You guys work on issues like poverty. What else is the movement about? PACQUIAO: It is the people's movement combined with poor people, helping each other to grow. JENKINS: How did you up -- when did you decide -- you clearly became a hero, a national hero winning many fights in the Philippines. One day you decided I want to be a politician as well. When did that happen? PACQUIAO: When I started boxing, my dream also is not only for boxing, it is in my heart and mind, I want to help people, maybe at the right time.

While traditionally this grooming practice has been associated with women, in recent years it has gained popularity among men as well. Also known as \\"Brozilian\\" or \\"Manzilian,\\" male Brazilian waxes remove hair from the pubic and anal region, providing a clean and groomed appearance. Many professional salons and spas now offer Brazilian waxing services for men. Keep in mind that the process might be slightly different since the male anatomy requires different techniques for hair removal. Prices for men's Brazilian waxes are generally similar to those for women, but it's best to call your local salon or spa and inquire about the service and pricing beforehand. --- Are these two questions asking the same thing? No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question asks about places where one can get a professional Brazilian waxing done in Pune and the associated costs.

Movie title: Karla Movie plot: The film starts with a framing device of psychologist Dr. Arnold (Patrick Bauchau) in a session with Karla Homolka (Laura Prepon) on May 11, 2000, at Canada's Regional Psychiatric Centre in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Dr. Arnold's evaluation will determine Karla's eligibility for parole. During the session, Dr. Arnold shows Karla a photo album of herself and her husband Paul Bernardo (Misha Collins) in happier times, and Karla has a memory of how they first met. However, when Dr. Arnold introduces the subject of Karla's sister Tammy, Karla becomes uncooperative. Over the following weeks, Dr. Arnold probes Karla about her knowledge of Paul's secret life as a serial rapist, and it is revealed that shortly before their marriage Paul began to rape women. Paul convinced Karla to help him rape her sister on camera. At first Karla disagrees, but eventually steals Halcion from the veterinary clinic where she works. Tammy gets drunk at a Christmas party and becomes unresponsive after the two drug her. Tammy is raped, and ends up getting sick while drugged, choking on her own vomit. Karla calls 911 and the two hide the assault evidence so her death would appear accidental. Afterwards, Paul beats Karla for \\"ruining his movie\\". Karla learns never to ruin Paul's \\"movies\\". Karla tells Dr. Arnold that Paul became obsessed with Tammy and kept watching the video after her death, even showing it to friends. Paul also threatened to reveal Karla's role in her sister's murder if he should get into any more trouble, but Karla finally leaves him anyway. Paul is open with Karla about his crimes, yet Karla does not object to them, even when Paul begins to bring his victims home. Although disturbed at that part of Paul's life, Karla learns to accept it, knowing that she too will be killed if she does not. At Paul's request, Karla hesitantly participates in these assaults.

Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Karla,\\" Tina McCarthy is held captive by Paul Bernardo (Misha Collins) and Karla Homolka (Laura Prepon) for 3 days. During this time, she is subjected to abuse and assault at the hands of Paul, as he forces her to undress on camera. Karla witnesses these horrors but is too afraid to tell anyone or intervene, as she fears for her own life. Throughout the movie, it becomes apparent that both Paul and Karla engage in a series of heinous acts, including the rape and murder of Karla's sister Tammy. They manage to cover up their involvement in the crimes, causing Tammy's death to appear accidental. As their violent and criminal activities continue, Karla becomes increasingly disturbed by their actions but feels trapped in the situation and is eventually forced to participate in the assaults. This is due, in part, to the fear of her own life and the overwhelming control that Paul has over her. Dr. Arnold, the psychologist who is evaluating Karla for parole, attempts to unravel the truth behind Karla's involvement in these crimes. Throughout their sessions, Karla's true feelings and thoughts about her actions are revealed, providing insight into the dynamics of her relationship with Paul and her role in the crimes they committed together. Ultimately, the film \\"Karla\\" explores themes of power, manipulation, fear, and the darker side of human nature. It is a controversial and disturbing portrayal of the real-life criminal couple, Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka, and their notorious crimes in the 1990s that shocked Canada and the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He painted sporadically and without commitment during the late 1920s and early 1930s, when he worked as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs. He later admitted that his career was delayed because he had spent so long looking for a subject that would sustain his interest. He began to paint images based on the Crucifixion in 1933, when his then-patron Eric Hall commissioned a series of three paintings based on the subject. These abstract figurations contain formal elements typical of their time, including diaphanous forms, flat backgrounds, and surrealist props such as flowers and umbrellas. The art critic Wieland Schmied noted that while the early works are \\"aesthetically pleasing\\", they lack \\"a sense of urgency or inner necessity; they are beautiful, but lifeless\\". The sentiment is echoed by Hugh Davies, who wrote that Bacon's 1933 paintings \\"suggest an artist concentrating more on formal than on expressive concerns\\". Bacon admitted that his early works were not successful; they were merely decorative and lacking in substance. He was often harshly self-critical during this period, and would abandon or destroy canvasses before they were completed. He abandoned the Crucifixion theme, then largely withdrew from painting in frustration, instead immersing himself in love affairs, drinking and gambling.When he returned to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, \\"I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.

Q: If I tell you that Lymphoma causes cells to divide more often than normal cells and to grow out of control, and ask you the question \\"what does lymphoma do to cells?\\", is the correct answer \\"stops cells from dividing\\"? OPT: -Yes -No A:","completion":"The correct answer is -No. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that begins in the cells of the lymphatic system, a part of the body's immune system. Specifically, this disease starts in lymphocytes, the white blood cells that play a significant role in combating infections and diseases. Instead of stopping cells from dividing, Lymphoma actually boosts an abnormal division or multiplication of cells. In a normal condition, cells grow, divide, and produce new cells to replace old or damaged ones. However, when you have lymphoma, lymphocytes begin to multiply at an abnormal rate, much faster than usual. This abnormal multiplication sometimes leads to the formation of a lump or mass, normally felt as swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin, where lymph nodes are located. This process also leads to \\"immortal\\" cells that live much longer than they should. As these abnormal cells build up in the body, they begin to interfere with the function of the immune system as they overtakes the healthy lymphocytes. They grow so out of control and rapidly that they form tumors, which may affect surrounding tissues and organs, further impairing the body's ability to fight infections. Therefore, it's incorrect to say that lymphoma stops cells from dividing. Instead, it causes the lymphocytes to divide and grow more than they should, thereby inhibiting the normal functioning of the lymphatic and immune system. This often results in a compromised immune system which is less equipped to fight off infections, leading to the possible onset of various symptoms associated with lymphoma and overall poor health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Earlier this month the government said it had killed \\"terrorist fighters\\" in an operation in three neighbouring districts in al-Bayda and Baniyas in the west of the country. But graphic video footage and fresh eyewitness testimony appear to support claims that the area was witness to one of the worst atrocities of the conflict. \\"No matter how I describe what we heard and what we've seen, it would be nothing like the real thing.\\" Clothed in a black shroud, Om Abed did not want to use her real name. She is afraid of reprisals. The mother of two wept as she talked about what she says she saw in al-Bayda in early May. \\"You could not walk without stepping over bodies, either slaughtered or burnt,\\" she said. \\"Blood was everywhere.\\" On 2 May, government troops and militias marched into al-Bayda, in Tartous province on Syria's Mediterranean coast. The following day they attacked neighbouring Baniyas. Together government forces have described these operations as a \\"strike against armed terrorists\\". State media reported that 40 opposition fighters were killed. But Syrian human rights activists and eyewitnesses claim that more than 200 civilians died and hundreds are missing in what they allege was a brutal sectarian attack against innocent civilians. Video footage and photographs show the smouldering remains of burnt corpses, the bloodied bodies of men, women and young children with terrible injuries. It is impossible to independently verify these images, but interviews conducted by the BBC with four women who say they were there at the time appear to back claims that the area was witness to a horrific massacre. They all describe a military assault on the village that began on the morning of 2 May. What provoked it is disputed but both sides seem to agree that government troops had been ambushed by rebel fighters earlier that day, although tensions in the area had been simmering since the uprising began. Families huddled together as regular troops, backed by the paramilitary National Defence Force (NDF), entered the village. Residents say they embarked on a murderous attack: burning, looting and killing. \\"They started insulting us, uttering dirty words,\\" says Om Abed. \\"They told us to send the men out of the house, or we would all be shot.\\" What appears to be a leaked video taken by a government soldier gives a sense of what happened next. Troops can be seen in al-Bayda square; houses and cars are on fire, puddles of blood are visible on the road. Then the camera moves along a path past a man prostrate on his back, dead. There is a large red smear under the back of his head marking where he had been dragged. The film ends in what appears to be a shop. The floor is full of bodies, arranged in neat rows. \\"Suddenly, we started smelling fire, we heard the wild screams of men all over the village,\\" says Om Abed. It was not until six that night that the women left their homes. Timeline: Syria's bloodiest days One of her friends, Om Ahmed, described the horrors that greeted her when they emerged. \\"I ran down the road and saw 20 to 30 men, lying on the ground, all shot up. Then I saw my husband and my father-in-law. They were shot in the head. \\"There was nothing left of my husband's face apart from his mouth and nose.\\" Activists and residents say the troops then moved on to two Sunni districts in neighbouring Baniyas. State media said 40 terrorists were killed over the three-day operation but eyewitnesses talk of a frenzied sectarian assault by Alawite militias against the local Sunni population. Numerous pictures and videos that appear to show the aftermath of Baniyas are horrific; men, women and children, some terribly disfigured, piled together, and what appear to be entire families killed. The women we interviewed described similar scenes. \\"There were slaughtered corpses and charred bodies everywhere\\", says Om Abed. \\"Houses were on fire. The people inside them were burning. An entire family lay down dead, slaughtered in one house. There was so much blood.\\" This was not the first massacre of this war and it won't be the last. Some in the international community have placed their faith in diplomacy, pushing for a peace conference next month. Few appear convinced about its chances of success and as long as both sides in this conflict continue to believe they can win, the people of Syria will continue to die. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"This story is about a very sad event that happened in Syria earlier this month.

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Federalism: Federalism in the United States is the evolving relationship between state governments and the federal government of the United States.

In Federalist No. 64, Jay discusses the role of the Senate in the conduct of foreign affairs, particularly regarding the ratification of treaties and the appointment of ambassadors, ministers, and consuls. He emphasizes the importance of having a responsible, stable, and wise government body to handle such critical matters. Jay also highlights the trust placed in the Senate for this purpose, given their position, experience, and the six-year term that senators serve, which provides stability and continuity in decision-making. Moreover, Federalist No. 64 elaborates on the necessity of safeguarding national security by maintaining confidentiality in negotiations involving sensitive matters or the protection of national interests. The Senate, Jay argues, is well-suited for this task, as its members would display a higher sense of responsibility and knowledge than a larger assembly like the House of Representatives. Additionally, Jay contends that the Senate's smaller size would allow it to better maintain secrecy and act with expediency when necessary, providing confidence to foreign nations that sensitive information would be protected during negotiations. In summary, Federalist No. 64 focuses on the role of the Senate in handling foreign affairs and the wisdom of entrusting this government body with the responsibility of managing treaties and diplomatic appointments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Start looping through the sorted list from the second element: - Calculate the absolute difference between -55 and -51: \`abs(-55-(-51)) = abs(-4) = 4\`, which is smaller than the current \`min_diff\`, so update \`min_diff\` to 4. - Calculate the absolute difference between -51 and -16: \`abs(-51-(-16)) = abs(-35) = 35\`, which is not smaller than the current \`min_diff\`, so no change. - Calculate the absolute difference between -16 and 28: \`abs(-16-28) = abs(-44) = 44\`, which is not smaller than the current \`min_diff\`, so no change. 4.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 2182*h = 150*h + 772*h - 9100*h - 528360 for h.","completion":"To solve the equation 2182*h = 150*h + 772*h - 9100*h - 528360 for h, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on the right side of the equation. The right side of the equation can be simplified by adding the terms with h: 150*h + 772*h - 9100*h = (150 + 772 - 9100) * h = (-8178) * h Now the equation looks like this: 2182*h = -8178*h - 528360 Step 2: Add 8178*h to both sides of the equation to isolate the h term. Add 8178*h to the left side of the equation to eliminate the -8178*h term on the right side: 2182*h + 8178*h = -8178*h - 528360 + 8178*h Combine the h terms on the left side: (2182 + 8178) * h = 10360*h Now the equation looks like this: 10360*h = -528360 Step 3: Divide by 10360 to solve for h. Divide both sides of the equation by 10360 to get the value of h: h = -528360 / 10360 Step 4: Calculate the value of h. Calculate the division: h = -51 So, the solution to the equation 2182*h = 150*h + 772*h - 9100*h - 528360 is h = -51."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: who composed the song sare jahan se achha hindustan hamara? A:","completion":"The song \\"Sare Jahan se Accha Hindustan Hamara\\" has a historical significance linked with the freedom movement of India. The poetry was composed by one of the most notable literary figures in the Urdu language, Dr. Allama Muhammad Iqbal. The composition is widely recognized and celebrated as a symbol of India's rich historical and patriotic legacy. Dr. Allama Muhammad Iqbal was born on November 9, 1877, in Sialkot, a city in British India (now in Pakistan). He was deeply involved in the academic world, being known as a philosopher, a poet, and an influential politician who played a significant role in inspiring the Pakistan Movement, leading to the creation of Pakistan. However, he initially advocated Hindustani unity, and \\"Sare Jahan se Accha\\" is a testament to that phase of his life. \\"Sare Jahan se Accha\\" was written in 1904, originally in the Urdu language, in Ghazal style of Urdu poetry and it's noted for its heartfelt expression of love and pride for the Indian subcontinent. It quickly gained vast popularity among the masses and has since been regarded as an anthem of sorts for India. The poem's title directly translates to \\"Better than the entire world, is our India,\\" a sentiment that has resonated with millions of Indians for well over a century. Dr. Iqbal's patriotic spirit is widely echoed keenly in the lyrics that articulate the beauty, culture, and spirit of India. The musical composition for this song is credited to Pandit Ravi Shankar, an internationally renowned Indian sitar virtuoso and composer. He composed this melody for All India Radio (AIR) sometime around 1945, which has been the familiar tune associated with this song ever since. \\"Sare Jahan se Accha\\" strikes a chord in many due to its vivid depiction of India's diverse cultures, landscapes, and the pride of its inhabitants. It continues to be a favorite among numerous patriotic songs and is frequently performed during the Republic Day and Independence Day celebrations in India. It also holds a special position in the hearts of Indians residing across the globe. The core sentiment of the song is more than just a geographical attachment; it is a celebration of the essence that is India."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Definition: In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context. You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Input: Context: Natriuretic peptide (NP) levels are routinely employed as useful diagnostic and prognostic tools in the evaluation of patients with heart failure (HF). As hospitalization is the major consumer of healthcare resources, the prognostic power of admission NPs with regard to the duration of hospitalization deserves further investigation.', 'We assessed retrospectively the association between NP values sampled shortly following unplanned admission and the duration of hospitalization in 2978 patients admitted to a cardiology department. Duration of hospitalization (hours) and survival were determined by interrogation of the electronic medical records system. Associations with peptide levels were estimated using regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results demonstrate a significant positive relationship between NP levels and the duration of hospitalization, after adjusting for age (P < 0.001). The median duration of hospitalization for the lowest BNP and NT-proBNP quintiles were 80 and 97 h, respectively, vs. 224.5 and 236 h for the highest quintiles. Using cut-off levels of 115 pmol/L for BNP and 390 pmol/L for NT-proBNP, the peptides have a positive predictive value of 78% and 85% for a stay >4 days. During follow-up, NP levels were strongly predictive of all-cause mortality.Question: Do natriuretic peptide levels taken following unplanned admission to a cardiology department predict the duration of hospitalization?

Part #2: Identify the question from the passage. Usage: The question is \\"Do natriuretic peptide levels taken following unplanned admission to a cardiology department predict the duration of hospitalization?\\" Explanation: The question asks whether there is a relationship between natriuretic peptide levels and the duration of hospitalization. Part #3: Analyze the findings of the study. Usage: The study found a significant positive relationship between NP levels and the duration of hospitalization after adjusting for age (P < 0.001). The median duration of hospitalization for the lowest and highest NP quintiles varies, with a positive predictive value of 78% and 85% for a stay longer than 4 days. Explanation: The study results show a significant correlation between NP levels and hospitalization duration. Higher NP levels were associated with longer stays in the hospital. Part #4: Generate an answer to the question based on the context. Usage: Based on the study, natriuretic peptide levels taken following unplanned admission to a cardiology department are predictive of the duration of hospitalization. Explanation: The answer is based on the study's results, which indicate a significant positive relationship between NP levels and the duration of hospitalization, showing that higher NP levels are associated with longer hospital stays."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The robbery is successful, but Mexican Rurales track them and catch them celebrating in a cantina, killing Doc. Dad and Rio manage to escape. After getting cornered on a high ridge, with Rio's horse dead, Rio figures the Rurales will be \\"swarming all over us inside an hour.\\" Deciding that one partner might take the remaining pony, ride to a jacalito down the canyon about five miles and return with fresh mounts, they gamble for it, with Rio fixing the deal so his pal Dad can be the one to go. Dad gets to a corral, strapping the swag bag onto a fresh pony, but he gets second thoughts. He casts one eye towards a point on the ridge sure to be taken by the Rurales, and with the other he gazes off in the opposite direction out past a low-lying treeline towards the border and safety. One way leads to danger and a poor chance at surviving with half the booty, the other towards a virtual certainty with all of it. After a decidedly short moment of reflection, he leaves his friend to be taken by Rurales. Rio is arrested and transported to prison by way of the jacalito, where he learns firsthand of Dad's betrayal from the owner. Rio spends five hard years in a Sonora prison, giving him ample time to mull over Dad's betrayal before escaping with new partner Chico Modesto (Larry Duran) and going hunting for him. When he locates him, Longworth has used his wealth to become the sheriff of Monterey, California. Instead of ambushing Dad, Rio gives him a chance to explain why he left him back in Mexico, pretending he had never been captured to put him off-guard.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Here's a short story: A frying pan will produce more heat when sliding it over a dirt floor then when sliding it over a stovetop. The _____ is rougher (A) stovetop (B) dirt floor. What is the most sensical answer between \\"dirt floor\\" and \\"stovetop\\"? Answer:","completion":"The most sensical answer between \\"dirt floor\\" and \\"stovetop\\" is \\"dirt floor.\\" To provide a detailed explanation, we must first address the background context of the question; it's a short story that says, \\"A frying pan will produce more heat when sliding it over a dirt floor than when sliding it over a stovetop.\\" Although it is generally true that friction increases with surface roughness, it is essential to keep in mind that heat is produced as a byproduct of the conversion of mechanical energy into thermal energy. As a result, the amount of heat generated does not solely depend on the roughness of the surface but also on other factors, such as the speed at which the frying pan moves across the surfaces and the material's properties. In this situation, the context provided by the short story gives a specific conclusion about heat generation tied directly to surface roughness, which implies that we prioritize this factor over the others. Comparing the roughness of a dirt floor and a stovetop, we can identify a few key differences. A dirt floor is comprised of granular materials like soil, pebbles, and organic matter. These materials create an uneven and irregular surface, which will increase the friction encountered when sliding a frying pan over it. On the other hand, a stovetop typically has a much smoother and even surface made from ceramic, metal, or other materials designed to be easy to clean and use for cooking. These surfaces will lead to lower levels of friction compared to a dirt floor. Under the premise of the short story, a frying pan would produce more heat when sliding over a dirt floor due to its increased roughness, which results in a higher level of friction and, subsequently, more heat generation. Thus, the answer would be \\"dirt floor\\" (Option B), highlighted as the rougher surface. This answer assumes that other factors remain constant, and the sole basis of comparison is the surface roughness of a stovetop and a dirt floor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I used to review videos for Joe Bob Briggs' legendary \\"We Are The Weird\\" newsletter. I saw a lot of stinkers, but this by far was the worst, and the years have not been kind - it remains the most indecent crime against cinema I have ever witnessed. Don't get me wrong - CAGED TERROR is nominally more technically competent than, say, MONSTER-A-GO-GO or THE GUY FROM HARLEM or something of that ilk. What solidifies its claim as Worst Movie Of All Time for me is its unique blend of bare proficiency with crippling pretension. Is it a Vietnam commentary? An ecological protest? An incitement to race riot? A study of man's inhumanity to man? A novel exercise in padding nature footage out to (nearly) feature length? In short: a hep young urban professional (possibly the most loathesome screen character ever) somehow seduces a nubile Asian-American associate into camping in the woods with him. After brow-beating her with quasi-philosophical clap for the better part of an hour, they run across two wandering veterans, the unforgettable Jarvis (a righteous brother) and the Troubadour (guitar-toting Manson Family reject). Hey, a plot twist! Tension! Action! Suspense! Well, no, just a climactic getting-locked-in-a-makeshift-wire-chicken-coop-and-lightly-belittled scene. The victim in question stares listlessly at the captors and mutters, \\"No... no... please... don't...\\" Meanwhile, Jarvis addresses the Troubadour as \\"Trouby\\" once every two minutes, bringing to mind nothing so much as the alien star of Juan Picquer's POD PEOPLE. That's about all that happens in CAGED TERROR, and such a synopsis perhaps makes it seem almost tolerable. But trust me, I've seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one has remained, for the past eight years since I first saw it, the absolute worst. (I pop it in the old VCR once every two years or so just to reassure myself, and reassure myself I certainly do.) I think the element which makes CAGED TERROR so particularly hateful is this: very little happens, and although what little does happen happens quite poorly and quite slowly, what truly makes it compulsively unwatchable is the suffocating sense that the filmmakers REALLY, REALLY WANT to shove some kind of message down your throat. But because CAGED TERROR is so incompetent and ineffectual, what was intended as a civics lesson becomes a crash course in intense viewing discomfort. This film is 75 minutes long and feels like three and a half hours. It's terrible, truly truly terrible. Folks, trust me, I saw GHOSTS THAT STILL WALK and this one is worse. Go see it! You'll thank me. And curse me.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: For the past few weeks I have been talking about the merits of the Mediterranean Diet. However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost.

First, let's rewrite the given equation: 121 * z - 7843 - 8840 = -2862 - 1479 Now, we need to simplify the equation. 1. Add 7843 and 8840 together: 7843 + 8840 = 16683 2. Add -2862 and -1479 together: -2862 + (-1479) = -4341 3. Now, the equation will look like this: 121 * z - 16683 = -4341 4. Let's make the equation even simpler. Add 16683 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -16683: 121 * z = -4341 + 16683 5. Add -4341 and 16683: -4341 + 16683 = 12342 6. So now the equation is: 121 * z = 12342 7. To solve for z, divide both sides of the equation by 121: z = 12342 / 121 8. Divide 12342 by 121: 12342 ÷ 121 = 102 So, the answer is z = 102.

Q:I have never been a stop-and-smell-the-roses type of person. For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

Answer the following question: This article: In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who wanted to start the tour right away?, what is it ?

Since we are looking for the most likely result of a small fall, we can begin by eliminating extreme options that seem less plausible for a small episode. Step 3: Eliminate unlikely answers: Considering the context, \\"broken bones\\" is a more severe outcome and less likely to be the result of a small fall. Similarly, \\"contact with going down\\" seems less relevant to the question. Considering this elimination, we are left with pain, injury, and getting hurt.

It is something that all human have, and it tells the body what to do. DNA is the reason that we look like our parents, because we get some of their DNA to make our own. People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Mr. Mendel discovered why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things called \\"genes\\" in our body. In 1953, two scientists, Watson and Crick, found out that those small parts are really messages. They're written in the DNA with a special language. In 1961, another two scientists found the first \\"word\\" that they could understand in that language. It shows how DNA tells the cell to build its parts. So far, scientists have found all the words in the DNA map, but we still do not understand what they all do.

El mareo por movimiento es un problema común que afecta a muchas personas, especialmente al viajar en automóvil, barco o avión. Esta sensación incómoda se debe a una discordancia entre los sistemas sensoriales del cuerpo, como la vista, el equilibrio y el oído interno. Cuando estos sistemas no están sincronizados, se puede experimentar náuseas y vómitos. Las enfermedades autolimitadas, como los virus o la intoxicación alimentaria, son otras causas frecuentes de vómitos. Estas infecciones, a menudo causadas por bacterias, parásitos o virus, irritan el estómago y los intestinos, lo que provoca síntomas como náuseas, vómitos, diarrea y malestar estomacal. Estos síntomas suelen durar desde unas pocas horas hasta unos días y, en la mayoría de los casos, no requieren tratamiento específico, ya que el cuerpo es capaz de combatir la infección por sí solo. Por último, las toxinas, como ciertos medicamentos, pueden causar vómitos. Algunos fármacos pueden irritar el estómago, lo que provoca síntomas como náuseas y vómitos. Algunos ejemplos de estos medicamentos son los antiinflamatorios no esteroideos (AINE), como el ibuprofeno y la aspirina, ciertos antibióticos y la quimioterapia. En estos casos, es importante comunicarse con un profesional de la salud para determinar si es necesario modificar la medicación o recibir tratamiento adicional. En conclusión, los vómitos pueden ser causados ​​por diversas razones, como el mareo por movimiento, las enfermedades autolimitadas y las toxinas que incluyen ciertos medicamentos.

S Club 7 was a pop group created by former Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller, with auditions and the selection process beginning in 1998. The group was initially composed of seven members, including Tina Barrett, Paul Cattermole, Jon Lee, Bradley McIntosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt, and Rachel Stevens. The single \\"Bring It All Back\\" was released on June 7, 1999, in the United Kingdom under the record label Polydor Records. It served as the lead single from their debut album, \\"S Club,\\" which was released later that year in October. The song was written by Eliot Kennedy, Mike Percy, and Tim Lever and produced by the last two. The track is an upbeat, catchy pop tune with a sound that reflects the energy and enthusiasm of the late 1990s' pop music scene. \\"Bring It All Back\\" was an instant success for the group, reaching the number-one spot on the UK Singles Chart and quickly cementing S Club 7's status as a new and popular band. Additionally, the song charted well in several other countries, including Australia, where it reached number three on the ARIA Singles Chart and received a platinum certification for sales. The music video for \\"Bring It All Back\\" further contributed to the group's burgeoning fame. With vivid and colorful visuals, the video showcased the group's members performing choreographed dance routines and highlighted their youthful exuberance and individual personalities. The video received heavy rotation on music television channels, especially in the UK and Europe. S Club 7 quickly gained a significant fan base, primarily among teens and younger audiences, and went on to release four albums and several successful singles. Some of their other popular songs include \\"S Club Party,\\" \\"Two in a Million,\\" and \\"Reach.\\" The group also ventured into television, starring in their own TV series called \\"Miami 7,\\" which debuted in 1999 and followed the fictional lives of the members as they tried to become successful singers in Miami. Despite the band's early success, S Club 7 eventually disbanded in 2003 due to members pursuing solo careers or focusing on other endeavors.

She often spent her days chasing after the sun to capture its fleeting beauty within her creations. As she swirled and mixed colors, her paintings became a breathtaking kaleidoscope of sunrises and sunsets. People from across the land visited the quiet village, drawn by Emily's mesmerizing images hanging in the town square. They admired her dedication and how she woke up before dawn and worked until twilight, endlessly honing her skills. One day, as Emily wandered further than usual in search of inspiration, she stumbled upon a mysterious, hidden grove. Enchanted by its aura, her eyes couldn't help but notice the strange and alluring colors of the ever-moving clouds above. Intrigued, Emily began to paint the scenery, only to feel a sudden surge of energy fill her as if the place seemed to call upon her innermost desires. A slow, gentle whisper echoed through the grove, tingling at the edge of her consciousness. \\"Oh, dear child, what is it you seek?\\" the soft voice inquired. Magic hung heavy in the air, and without caution, Emily replied, \\"I've always wanted to create the most spectacular, unforgettable sunset the world has ever seen.\\" In response, a beautifully ethereal woman materialized before her eyes, adorned with a crown of lush leaves and flowers, her robes billowing like the wind. She was the Queen of Dusk and Dawn, the guardian of all things magical and beautiful beyond measure. With a warm smile on her face, she lovingly granted Emily's wish, warning the young painter that it would not come without cost or sacrifice. Emily nodded her agreement, awestruck and honored that the Queen had deemed her worthy of such a gift. She returned to her village, her heart beating with anticipation as her brush bristled with newfound power. In the days that followed, Emily diligently crafted her magnum opus under the strange skies of that mysterious grove. As her fantastical masterpiece neared completion, Emily noticed she was growing weaker with each stroke. Unbeknownst to her, the Queen's gift was not only potent but also carrying a heavy burden. She had never experienced such tiredness before— every morning she woke up less refreshed, every evening she retired feeling more drained than before. Despite her weariness, Emily pressed on determinedly. Her dreams of creating something utterly breathtaking and unforgettable propelled her weary body to continue suffering for her art. As her strength waned, she found solace in the thought of sharing her masterpiece with the world. She knew the price she might pay was worth the beauty she was creating. Finally, the day arrived when Emily finished her work. The painting she had labored over was truly a sight to behold. The colors on the canvas danced and shimmered, bringing the sunset to life, causing all who saw it to stand in wonder. It was an extraordinary ode to the heavens—a sight so powerful that it invoked tears of joy in the villagers who came to witness her creation. With her dream now a living reality and her painting unveiled to much praise and admiration, Emily knew she had accomplished what she had set out to do. The Queen's gift had been both her blessing and her curse, exacting a toll on her body and spirit. As the sun dipped below the horizon that night, Emily slowly made her way back to her home. Knowing that the time had come for her to rest, she closed the door behind her, her eyes heavy with fatigue. When she came home, she fell asleep immediately, exhausted."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\"For many items, the two small northern islands have the lowest prices in the Caribbean.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The lowest prices in the Caribbean for many items can be found at the small northern islands.\\" is true?","completion":"In order to evaluate the validity of the hypothesis \\"The lowest prices in the Caribbean for many items can be found at the small northern islands,\\" based on the given premise \\"For many items, the two small northern islands have the lowest prices in the Caribbean,\\" we must first break down and analyze the context, phrasing, and logical structure of both statements. Let us start by examining the premise. It states that there is a certain scope of items ('many items') in which the two small northern islands have the lowest prices in the Caribbean region. This information provides us with a specific geographic focus (the two small northern islands) and it also compares the prices within the Caribbean in general. The key phrasing here is \\"lowest prices in the Caribbean.\\" Now, let's turn our attention to the hypothesis. It seeks to make a conclusion based on the given premise and posits that the lowest prices in the Caribbean for many items can be discovered in the small northern islands. While this statement does not explicitly mention the quantity of small northern islands, it implies a broader focus on northern islands in the area. Based on the logical structure and similar phrasing between the premise and the hypothesis, we can infer that the conclusion drawn in the hypothesis is related to the premise provided. Nonetheless, we must now determine whether the hypothesis accurately reflects or supports the initial premise, or if there are discrepancies between the two statements. The key difference between the premise and the hypothesis is the specificity of their geographic focus. While the premise refers to two small northern islands as having the lowest prices, the hypothesis extends this assertion to the general category of small northern islands. This distinction could potentially lead to inconsistencies or a lack of proper support for the hypothesis, as the premise's details are more narrowly defined. In conclusion, we can recognize that the hypothesis is indeed related to the original premise, as both statements emphasize the presence of lower prices for various items within the Caribbean's small northern islands. However, additional evidence and research would be necessary for us to conclusively establish the hypothesis to be true, considering the minor mismatch in geographic focus between the two statements. To address this, a comprehensive examination of the different small northern islands within the Caribbean, as well as comparing prices for a wide range of items, would help solidify the authenticity of the hypothesis. Without such extended study and knowledge, it remains uncertain whether the hypothesis accurately encapsulates the full truth of product pricing within the region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Read this: The early Manchu rulers also established two foundations of legitimacy which help to explain the stability of their dynasty. The first was the bureaucratic institutions and the neo-Confucian culture which they adopted from earlier dynasties. Manchu rulers and Han Chinese scholar-official elites gradually came to terms with each other. The examination system offered a path for ethnic Han to become officials. Imperial patronage of Kangxi Dictionary demonstrated respect for Confucian learning, while the Sacred Edict of 1670 effectively extolled Confucian family values. The second major source of stability was the Central Asian aspect of their Manchu identity which allowed them to appeal to Mongol, Tibetan and Uighur constituents. The Qing used the title of Emperor (Huangdi) in Chinese while among Mongols the Qing monarch was referred to as Bogda khan (wise Khan), and referred to as Gong Ma in Tibet. Qianlong propagated the image of himself as Buddhist sage rulers, patrons of Tibetan Buddhism. In the Manchu language, the Qing monarch was alternately referred to as either Huwangdi (Emperor) or Khan with no special distinction between the two usages. The Kangxi Emperor also welcomed to his court Jesuit missionaries, who had first come to China under the Ming.

Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Reuters reported that the companies were in negotiations but no deal had been agreed. The move would enable Google to produce its own smartwatches. It already develops a version of Android for wearables. Fitbit's share price increased by 19% before being suspended. Google has not commented. A spokeswoman for Fitbit said it \\"does not comment on rumours or speculation\\". Reuters did not say what sum had been offered. It emerged in September that Fitbit, currently valued by the markets at around 1.4bn (£1.1bn) after Monday's surge, was touting itself for a sale. Fitbit, which in its latest quarterly earnings posted a loss of 68.5m, is looking precarious as a standalone entity since bigger firms have gained a strong footing in wearable technology. \\"A key tipping point is likely to have been Apple's decision to price its Series 3 Apple Watch at 199/£199,\\" said Leo Gebbie, from the consultancy CCS Insight. \\"That will have put immense pressure on Fitbit's own products, which are already feeling the challenge from low-cost rivals such as [China's] Xiaomi.\\" In an attempt to diversify its income, Fitbit has expanded into other areas - including monitoring users' breathing during sleep, and diabetes management. But the firm trails Huawei, Apple and Xiaomi in fitness tech sales. For Google the deal, if confirmed, would represent a renewed effort to develop its Wear OS platform. \\"Although Google has been lukewarm in its commitment to wearables recently, this indicates it is serious about the segment and could provide a strong boost to its ambitions,\\" Mr Gebbie added. CCS Insight predicted 142 million wearable devices would be sold worldwide this year, at a value of 17.1bn. Meanwhile, Google's parent company Alphabet released its third quarter results which showed a drop in net profit to 7bn in the three months to 30 September. Analysts had been expecting profit of 8.8bn. It fell from 9bn in same period last year when changes to US tax law had boosted Alphabet's bottom line.

Research the origin and history of grunge music. 2. Identify the cities that have played a significant role in the development and popularity of the genre. 3. Determine the city that is most commonly associated with grunge music based on the information gathered. Step 1: Research the origin and history of grunge music Grunge is a genre of rock music that emerged in the mid-1980s in the United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its heavy guitar sound, raw vocal style, and introspective lyrics. Grunge gained mainstream popularity in the early 1990s, with bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains leading the movement. Step 2: Identify the cities that have played a significant role in the development and popularity of the genre Based on my research, Seattle and its neighboring cities in Washington state have been the epicenter of the grunge movement. Step 3: Determine the city that is most commonly associated with grunge music based on the information gathered With the information from my research, it is clear that the city most associated with grunge music is Seattle, Washington. Reasons for this association include the city's significant role in the development of the grunge sound, the origins of influential bands within the genre, and its continued recognition as a hub for alternative rock music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A. chew B. eating C. digest D. prepare E. eat food The best answer is The answer to this question is:","completion":"D. prepare The best answer for this question is \\"prepare\\" as it indicates that the man wants to have his meals ready and organized for the work week ahead. Meal prepping is a great way to save time, manage portion sizes, and ensure that healthy meals are available during busy times. Meal prepping can involve preparing individual meals, cooking items in bulk, and portioning food out into individual containers. This can help make weekday meal times easier, since everything is already prepared and ready to grab and go. Preparing meals in advance can also help an individual stay on track with their diet and nutrition goals, by providing ready-to-eat healthy options that can be easily accessible when hunger strikes. Opting for \\"prepare\\" over the other options makes the most sense in the context of the question, as it best aligns with the idea of planning and organizing meals for the week. The other options do not quite fit the context: A. Chew: This involves the act of breaking down food in one's mouth and does not pertain to planning or organizing meals. B. Eating: While eating is related to consuming food, it does not explicitly involve the planning or organizing of meals for the week. C. Digest: This refers to the process that occurs in the body once food is consumed, breaking down the food into essential nutrients, and is unrelated to meal planning. E. Eat food: This option is too vague and does not convey the intention to plan or organize meals like the option \\"prepare\\" does.

He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again. However, when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930, Beiderbecke did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly. On his last recording session, in New York, on September 15, 1930, Beiderbecke played on the original recording of Hoagy Carmichael's new song, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", with Carmichael doing the vocal, Eddie Lang on guitar, Joe Venuti on violin, Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto..., what would be the answer ?

Summarize: You will never know if you like or don’t like certain types of art if you don’t try to enjoy them. You can think of going to see new kinds of art as exposing yourself to new experiences, rather than just seeing art. Be in touch with your own emotions as you view art. Do you feel excited? Calm? Anxious? Confused? Art can evoke a wide range of emotional responses, so do your best to be conscious of yours. Part of the fun of viewing art is that you get to come up with your own story about it! Art is very subjective, so even if your interpretation of a piece isn’t exactly what the artist intended, it’s okay! There is often not just one right answer. What’s important is that you make a genuine effort to extract meaning from their work. Because every person has a different set of unique experiences, it’s valid for every person who views a piece of art to walk away with a different understanding of it. This can lead to interesting discussions! Ask the person next to you what they think. It’s also completely fine to offer no interpretation at all, and instead just enjoy the art for its physical properties. Abstract art — art that doesn’t look like anything in the real world — can be a little harder to appreciate because the message or emotion that the artist is trying to convey is not always immediately clear. To enjoy abstract art, think about what grabs your eye first in the piece, and why the artist might have wanted your attention to go there. Abstract art can be fun because it’s like a puzzle. You really have to give it some thought to come up with a potential meaning for it. Remember, your meaning doesn’t have to be necessarily correct! As you view more and more art, you will start to develop an understanding of what you like and dislike in a piece of art. This can help you seek out similar artists. You don’t have to love everything that you see! Artist statements or descriptive brochures can sometimes be misleading, so if you unexpectedly don’t like a certain type of art, that’s fine.","completion":"To truly know if you like certain types of art, you must expose yourself to new experiences and be conscious of your emotions while viewing them. Art is subjective and may evoke various interpretations based on an individual's unique experiences. Engage in discussions with others and enjoy the process of understanding each piece, including abstract art. Developing an appreciation for art and discovering your preferences may involve some trial and error, and it's alright not to love everything you see.

Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

The detailed aspects of the review and how they might contribute to this impression are analyzed below. 1. \\"Hilariously bad\\": The term \\"hilariously bad\\" implies that the product is not only poor in quality, but also so exceptionally terrible that it evokes laughter. This is a clear indication that the reviewer does not hold the product in high esteem and suggests that it fails to meet even the most basic standards of quality. 2. \\"Rubber sets\\": Rubber sets could refer to the low-quality production design and materials used in the making of the product. This implies that the creators did not invest enough time, effort, or resources to ensure the believability and authenticity of the product's setting and environment, ultimately leading to a subpar final outcome. 3. \\"Stoic direction\\": Stoic direction suggests that the person responsible for guiding the artistic and creative vision of the product has done so with little passion or emotion. This implies that the performances, pacing, and storytelling of the product may be lacking in dynamism and engagement, with the individuals involved coming across as stiff or wooden. 4. \\"Synth music\\": The mention of synth music points towards the '80s electronic music that was often used in low-budget films and projects during that era. This could be another suggestion of the product's low production value, as the reviewer may have found the music to be dated or cheesy, further detracting from the overall quality and appeal of the product. 5. \\"It looks like Jack London wrote a '80s porn movie\\": Jack London is a famous author known for his classic novels, such as \\"The Call of the Wild\\" and \\"White Fang.\\" The reviewer humorously compares the poor quality of the product to the idea that a respected writer like Jack London wrote an '80s porn movie, which is typically regarded as a low-quality and crass form of entertainment. This analogy likely serves to emphasize the perceived absurdity and dysfunction of the product. In conclusion, the review appears to depict the product in an unflattering light by using humor and sarcasm to highlight its numerous perceived shortcomings. The reviewer's choice of language and imagery seems to convey a sense of disappointment, frustration, and disbelief in the quality of the product, ultimately suggesting that it fails to meet even the most basic expectations, making the overall review unflattering."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sabrina Fairchild is the young daughter of the Larrabee family's chauffeur, Thomas, and has been in love with David Larrabee all her life. David is a playboy, constantly falling in love, yet he has never noticed Sabrina, much to her dismay. Sabrina travels to Paris for a fashion internship at Vogue and returns as an attractive, sophisticated woman. David, after initially not recognizing her, is quickly drawn to her despite being newly engaged to Elizabeth Tyson, a doctor. David's workaholic older brother Linus fears that David's imminent wedding to the very suitable Elizabeth might be endangered. If the wedding were to be canceled, so would a lucrative merger with the bride's family business, Tyson Electronics, run by her father Patrick. This could cost the Larrabee Corporation, run by Linus and his mother Maude, in the neighborhood of a billion dollars. Linus tries to redirect Sabrina's affections to himself and it works. Sabrina falls in love with him, even though she quotes others as calling Linus \\"the world's only living heart donor\\" and someone who \\"thinks that morals are paintings on walls and scruples are money in Russia.\\" In the process, Linus also falls in love with her.

If I remember right, after some folks left, there was one couple, a couple girls (maybe 3?), and myself who stayed over. I had known them all for a month or so and had spent a ton of time hanging out at the barracks or around the school area. The couple took one bed, the girls took the other, and I took the floor at the foot of the girls’ bed. About the time everyone started to nod off, one of the girls woke me, asking if I would share the blanket, as the bed was too crowded. She and I had both recently gotten engaged to people two plane flights away and had been nothing more than friends previously - with no hint of anything else… I thought nothing of it and said sure. After a few minutes, she said she couldn’t sleep and asked if she could snuggle up a little. I thought nothing of it and said sure. I started to think… hunh… this is peculiar… After a few more minutes, she asked if I minded if we kissed a little.

Background: John Bowden Connally Jr. (February 27, 1917 - June 15, 1993) was an American politician. He served as the 39th Governor of Texas and as the 61st United States Secretary of the Treasury. He began his career as a Democrat but switched to the Republican Party in 1973. Born in Floresville, Texas, Connally pursued a legal career after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin. Context: Connally announced two weeks before Christmas of 1961 that he was leaving the position of Navy secretary to return to Texas to seek the 1962 Democratic gubernatorial nomination. He would have to compete against the incumbent Marion Price Daniel, Sr., who was running for a fourth consecutive two-year term. Daniel was in political trouble following the enactment of a two-cent state sales tax in 1961, which had soured many voters on his administration. Daniel had let the tax become law without his signature but could have vetoed the measure. Former state Attorney General Will Wilson, who had run for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1961, also entered the gubernatorial campaign and was particularly critical of Johnson, who he claimed engineered Connally's candidacy. Other primary candidates were highway commissioner Marshall Formby of Plainview, another party conservative, and General Edwin A. Walker, who made anti-communism the centerpiece of his campaign. Connally waged the most active campaign of any of the Democrats, traveling more than 22,000 miles across the state. He made forty-three major speeches and appeared on multiple statewide and local telecasts. Connally ran as a conservative Democrat. He was placed in a primary runoff election against a liberal attorney from Houston favored by organized labor, Don Yarborough, no relation to Connally's long-term party nemesis U.S. Senator Ralph W. Yarborough. After winning the runoff against Yarborough by a close vote, Connally faced a determined bid by the conservative Republican and oilfield equipment executive Jack Cox, also of Houston. Cox, a former state representative from his native Stephens County, had run unsuccessfully two years earlier in the Democratic primary against Daniel. Connally received 847,036 ballots (54 percent) to Cox's 715,025 (45.6 percent). In the campaign, Connally made an issue of Cox's switching to the Republican Party (GOP) the previous year. Eleven years later, Connally made the same switch. Cox, as it turned out, was the strongest Republican gubernatorial candidate in Texas since 1924. Not until 1972, when Henry Grover carried the GOP banner, did the Republicans make a better showing for governor. Connally was a master campaign professional, having worked on several of Lyndon Johnson's campaigns. He believed in the entourage and advance men, the practice of having staff aides checking out events and having press interviews on the run to demonstrate Connally's heavy schedule of commitments. Biographer Charles Ashman claims that Connally would have aides telephone airports which he would shortly visit and ask to page him for an urgent message. Such manipulation, he believed, impressed airport patrons, many of whom would also be Texas voters. In 1971, Republican President Nixon appointed the then Democrat Connally as Treasury Secretary. Before agreeing to take the appointment, however, Connally told Nixon that the president must find a position in the administration for George H. W. Bush, the Republican who had been defeated in November 1970 in a hard-fought U.S. Senate race against Democrat Lloyd M. Bentsen. Connally told Nixon that his taking the Treasury post would embarrass Bush, who had \\"labored in the vineyards\\" for Nixon's election as president, while Connally had supported Humphrey. Ben Barnes, then the lieutenant governor and originally a Connally ally, claims in his autobiography that Connally's insistence saved Bush's political career because the then former U.S. representative and twice-defeated Senate candidate relied on appointed offices to build a resume by which to seek the presidency in 1980 and again in 1988. Nixon hence named Bush as ambassador to the United Nations in order to secure Connally's services at Treasury. Barnes also said that he doubted George W. Bush could have become president in 2001 had Bush's father not first been given the string of federal appointments during the 1970s to strengthen the family's political viability. Shortly after taking the Treasury post, Connally famously told a group of European finance ministers worried about the export of American inflation that the dollar \\"is our currency, but your problem.\\" Secretary Connally defended a 50 billion increase in the debt ceiling and a 35 to 40 billion budget deficit as an essential \\"fiscal stimulus\\" at a time when five million Americans were unemployed. He unveiled Nixon's program of raising the price of gold and formally devaluing the dollar--finally leaving the old gold standard entirely, a process begun in 1934 by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Prices continued to increase during 1971, and Nixon allowed wage and price guidelines, which Congress had authorized on a stand-by basis, to be implemented. Connally later shied away from his role in recommending the failed wage and price controls, and announced guaranteed loans for the ailing Lockheed aircraft company. He also fought a lonely battle against growing balance-of-payment problems with the nation's trading partners, and undertook important foreign diplomatic trips for Nixon through his role as Treasury Secretary. Historian Bruce Schulman wrote that Nixon was \\"awed\\" by the handsome, urbane Texan who was also a tough political fighter. Schulman added that Henry Kissinger, Nixon's National Security Advisor, noted that Connally was the only cabinet member that Nixon did not disparage behind his back, and that this was high praise indeed. Connally stepped down as treasury secretary in 1972 to head \\"Democrats for Nixon\\", a group funded by Republicans. Connally's old mentor, Lyndon B. Johnson, stood behind Democratic presidential nominee George S. McGovern of South Dakota, although McGovern had long opposed Johnson's foreign and defense policies. It was the first time that Connally and Johnson were on opposite sides of a general election campaign. Connally's brother, Golfrey Connally, an economics professor at a junior college in San Antonio, also endorsed McGovern. Some evidence even suggests that Connally was \\"privately\\" for Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956, not the Democratic candidate Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, for whom Johnson campaigned with considerable loyalty. During the war, Connally had served on Eisenhower's planning staff for the invasion of North Africa. In the 1972 U.S. Senate election in Texas, Connally endorsed the Democratic Harold Barefoot Sanders, later a federal judge from Dallas, rather than the Republican incumbent John G. Tower, also of Dallas. Connally had considered running against Tower in 1966, but chose to run for a third term as governor. Tower then defeated a Connally ally, state Attorney General Waggoner Carr of Lubbock. Tower, Nixon's choice in the Senate race, won handily over Sanders, but the Republican candidate for governor, Henry Grover of Houston, a victim of intraparty maneuvering, fell short and lost to Democrat Dolph Briscoe of Uvalde, a city in South Texas. In January 1973, Johnson died of heart disease. He and Connally had been friends since 1938. Connally took part in eulogizing Johnson during interment services at the LBJ Ranch in Gillespie County, along with the Rev. Billy Graham, who officiated at the service. Millions around the world viewed Connally's eulogy as the most famous moment of the LBJ funeral, as it was a reminder that Connally was wounded in the assassination that made his mentor and fellow Texan president.

His sales manager, Andrew Lucas called me as they didn't have the exact color I wanted. Nonetheless, he asked me to hold tight and give him (and Justin) an hour or two and one of them would find it. Sure enough, a couple hours later he called me with a firm time that the exact car I wanted would be at his dealership. I arrived at the dealer, none of the normal games I have had in the past (\\"The oh there is a speck of dirt on your trade, now it's worth 2000 less) so I really appreciated it. He had the car ready for me to inspect right out front. We test drove it and it was exactly what I wanted. He then needed a little time to get the car clean and polished which I completely understood as they just drove it all the way from the Southeast Valley for me. Next, we went in to finance and met with a very prepared Zoe. He had the agreed price and everything correct on the forms, the first time. I say this because shady dealers will usually try to play the bait and switch game in finance and put the car in for a different price (Oh, that was just a typo), but none of that nonsense here. In and out in under five minutes. No games in here. No mystical protection from alien space creatures was forced upon me to buy. Side note: I did let them know I usually don't buy any of that stuff as I only keep a car until its warranty is up. But all around nice guy and was easy to work with. No wasting my time. Last stop, Justin helped me remove everything from my old car and then put it in my new car. He did a tour of the vehicle with me and explained and setup lots of features including the keyless buttons to unlock the doors. (I had no clue how they worked or how cool they were). It was nice to see that he knew what he was doing and could quickly show me features. It was not like he was figuring it out for the first time. He clearly knew what he was doing.

To remove rust from a metal object, one should gather fresh water along with some more supplies and follow the steps detailed below. Fresh water is an essential component as it is less aggressive on the metal than saline water, which contains salts that can lead to further oxidation and corrosion. Step-by-step process to remove rust from a metal object: 1. Gather supplies: Collect the necessary materials, such as fresh water, a sponge or cloth, steel wool or a wire brush, baking soda, vinegar, dishwashing soap, a bucket, and a towel. 2. Create a solution: Mix one tablespoon of baking soda with one gallon of fresh water in the bucket. Alternatively, pure white vinegar can be used by itself as a cleaning liquid. 3. Test an inconspicuous area: Before applying the baking soda solution or vinegar to the metal object, test it on a small, inconspicuous section to ensure it does not damage the surface. 4. Apply the solution: Soak the sponge or cloth in the solution and rub it gently on the rusty area. For more stubborn rust spots, use a steel wool or wire brush in the same way to scrub the surface. 5. Rinse with fresh water: After treating the rusted area with the cleaning solution, use fresh water to rinse the area to remove any residual baking soda or vinegar. 6. Use dishwashing soap: If there is any residual rust, add a few drops of dishwashing soap to the fresh water and gently scrub the rusted areas, then rinse again with clean water. 7. Dry the metal object: Using a dry towel, remove any excess water from the metal object. Make sure it is completely dry to prevent future rust formation. 8. Apply a protective coating: Apply a protective coating, such as oil or wax, to the metal surfaces to protect them from future rusting. Make sure the product is suitable for your specific type of metal. By following these steps and utilizing fresh water, you can effectively remove rust from a metal object, helping to prolong its life and maintain its appearance. Keep in mind that more severe rust damage may require professional help or more aggressive treatments, such as rust converters or sanding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The band originally called themselves \\"Magneto U.S.A.\\" but changed their name after signing with Hollywood Records. In 1998, their album All the Pain Money Can Buy reached platinum sales within six months of its release, and stayed on the Billboard 200 chart for a year. In addition, the group has been nominated for two Grammy Awards - Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for \\"The Way\\", and Best Long Form Music Video for their promotional video \\"The Way\\". The members of Fastball still had side jobs as late as January 1998. Tony Scalzo worked the graveyard shift at The Bagel Manufactory in Austin. He, Shuffield, and Zuniga would be on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Late Night with Conan O'Brien just four months later. Fastball's second album, All The Pain Money Can Buy, was released on Hollywood Records. Within just six months, it had sold more than a million copies. The single \\"The Way\\" stayed on top of Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart for seven weeks, and was a top five hit on Billboard's Top 40 Mainstream chart. Scalzo was inspired to write the song in 1997, after reading a news article about Lela and Raymond Howard, an elderly couple who had disappeared in Texas. Though Lela had Alzheimers and Raymond was recovering from brain surgery, the couple had been driving to a local festival. They were discovered two weeks later, dead, at the bottom of a ravine near Hot Springs, Arkansas, hundreds of miles off their intended route. Scalzo chose to imagine that they began reminiscing and decided to become ethereal beings on a permanent romantic trip, the answer to the song's question, \\"Where were they going without ever knowing the way?\\" Fastball followed up \\"The Way\\" with a second single \\"Fire Escape\\" and a third single, \\"Out of My Head\\", which quickly joined its chart-topping predecessor. \\"Out of My Head\\" reached the top ten on Billboard's Top 40 chart and was a top ten hit on the Adult Top 40 chart for 29 weeks. The band followed up their album release with a tour that also featured Marcy Playground and Everclear. After that, they landed a spot on the H.O.R.D.E. tour. In 1999, Fastball received two Grammy Award nominations as a result of All the Pain Money Can Buy. One was for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, and the other was Best Long Form Video for \\"The Way\\". They also received an MTV Award nomination for Best New Artist.

In the episode, the twisted metal of the downed plane is treated as any other prop, with a bright ‘Amazing Race’ ‘Double-U-Turn’ signed planted in front of it, signifying to contestants the next phase of their scavenger hunt. The show also had contestants learn a song that was performed for them by children in front of a portrait of North Vietnam communist leader Ho Chi Minh, with subtitled lyrics that included “Vietnam Communist Party is glorious. The light is guiding us to victory.” “It’s like One Direction,” one contestant said of the performance, referring to the popular boy band. “How did it not cross the producers’ minds that this might offend the men who fought in Vietnam and the families of those who died there?” Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld said on his late night show “Red Eye.” Fox News contributor Bob Beckel agreed later on the news program “The Five.” “I’m so outraged by this I can’t believe it. CBS is idiotic; they’re stupid,” Beckel said. “To have people go to a memorial where Americans died, then you ought to get off the network.” The two weren’t alone in their opinions. “So, did anyone but me find the ‘Amazing Race’ going to Hanoi and extolling the greatness of Hanoi offensive?” a viewer remarked online. “Especially the part where the contestants had a ‘clue’ box at a Hanoi monument of a downed B-52? And none of them even slowed down to look at it or reflect on what it meant?” “This will ensure that I will continue to miss the 'Amazing Race,'\\" wrote one on an online message board, while another on the same board added: “I don’t know how many Vietnam vets are on here, but there should be a campaign to have CBS apologize publicly.” An email for comment from a rep for ‘The Amazing Race\\" was not immediately returned.

Summarize this article: Video Image China bridge collapse kills at least five Highway bridge collapses in central China after a truck carrying fireworks explodes, killing at least five people and injuring 11. Sarah Sheffer reports. THE collapse of a bridge on an expressway in central China was likely caused by an explosion on a lorry carrying fireworks, a local official has said as state media reports the death toll is 11. The accident on Friday sent an 80-metre stretch of viaduct crashing to the ground and left the twisted remains of cars and lorries scattered among the rubble, once again raising questions over the safety of China's infrastructure. State television network CCTV today said 11 people had been killed in the accident and four arrested because the lorry was not permitted to carry explosives. An official with the Sanmenxia municipality's public security bureau named Zhang said rescuers using equipment to search for any more survivors had not detected any signs of life, warning that the toll could rise further. ''There are still vehicles buried in the rubble and we'll need heavy lifting equipment to get them out,'' he said. The municipality's deputy propaganda chief Ren Zhanzhou added that initial investigations suggested the lorry carrying firecrackers and fireworks ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays was the likely cause of the disaster. Drivers interviewed by CCTV said they saw an explosion before the bridge collapsed, but on popular internet forums, people were sceptical. ''Firecrackers and fireworks are not enough to destroy a bridge,'' one user identified as Xinghuhuhu wrote on Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. ''Have some respect for the dead, please! If a poor quality bridge is destroyed by firecrackers going off, it's not a question of a loss of face, some officials have to be fired,'' they added. ''There are times when you have to take responsibility.'' State-run China National Radio initially said on Friday that 26 people had been killed, but the report could not later be found on its website, after local authorities in Henan province called the figure ''inexplicable''. Pictures of the accident showed tangled wreckage beneath the bridge, including three upturned lorries with their wheels pointing skywards, as rescue workers in orange uniforms scaled the wreckage. A crowd of people peered at the debris through thick hazy fog as another lorry teetered on the mangled edge of the bridge's collapsed section. A new bridge appeared to be under construction right next to the collapsed section. The bridge near the city of Sanmenxia is on the G30 expressway, the longest road in China, which stretches for nearly 4400 kilometres from China's western border with Kazakhstan to the eastern Yellow Sea. It stands 30 metres above the ground, media reported. According to police statistics, around 70,000 people die and 300,000 more are injured in road accidents every year in China, state media have reported. ||||| At least eight killed as China bridge collapses (AFP) – Feb 1, 2013 BEIJING — A bridge on a major expressway in central China collapsed Friday, leaving the twisted remains of cars and trucks scattered among the rubble as state media reported at least eight fatalities. There was confusion over the toll, with the official news agency Xinhua saying eight people were dead and 13 injured after a fireworks-laden truck exploded, sending a long section of the viaduct crashing to the ground. State-run China National Radio initially said that 26 people had been killed, but the report could not later be found on its website, after local authorities in Henan province called the figure \\"inexplicable\\". State broadcaster CCTV quoted nearby residents as saying they heard a loud booming noise, although it added the cause of the collapse was unclear and it was not known if the truck exploded before or after the bridge collapsed. Pictures showed tangled wreckage beneath the bridge, including three upturned trucks with their wheels pointing skywards, as rescue workers in orange uniforms scaled the wreckage. At least five cars could also be seen. CCTV said on its website that at least 25 vehicles were involved. A crowd of people peered at the debris through thick hazy fog as another lorry teetered on the mangled edge of the bridge's collapsed section. A new bridge appeared to be under construction right next to the collapsed section. The bridge near the city of Sanmenxia is on the G30 expressway, the longest road in China, which stretches for nearly 4,400 kilometres (2,700 miles) from China's western border with Kazakhstan to the eastern Yellow Sea. It stands 30 metres (yards) above the ground, media reported. Many of China's roads are packed as the country gears up for its most important holiday, the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of people travel back to their hometowns in what is billed as the world's largest annual human migration. The season is also a peak period for fireworks producers, as Chinese traditionally buy the explosives to celebrate the festival, which falls on February 10 this year. According to police statistics, around 70,000 people die and 300,000 more are injured in road accidents every year in China, state media have reported. China has seen a number of bridge collapses in recent years, which are often blamed on overloading and shoddy construction. One such incident in northeast China last August killed three people.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. While you might be tempted to completely overhaul your lifestyle, it is not necessary to make big changes to start living in the moment. Start by incorporating new habits one at a time. Once you feel like you have mastered a habit, add something else. For example, instead of trying to meditate for 20 minutes per day right away, start by trying to meditate for three minutes per day. Then, increase your time as you become more comfortable with meditation. Walk to work with your phone in your pocket. Do not text or talk on the phone unless it is an emergency. Learning to live in the moment can also be a part of your daily routine. You can incorporate mindfulness into your daily routine by deliberately noticing the sensory details of something that you are doing. Focus on the sight, sound, smell, and feel of your daily activities. For example, the next time that you brush your teeth, notice the smell of your toothpaste, the sound of the brush against your teeth, and the way that it feels. It is normal for your mind to wander, but in order to live in the moment, you need to keep your mind focused on the present. When you notice that your mind is wandering, use gentle redirection to focus on the present again. Acknowledge that your mind is wandering without judging yourself for doing so. Don't get upset at yourself if your mind wanders. It is normal for your mind to wander sometimes. Just accept that you took a little mental vacation and return your focus to the present. It may be difficult to remember to be mindful when you are very busy. A mindfulness cue, such as a string tied around your wrist, a pen mark on your hand, or a coin in your shoe can help you to remember to be mindful. When you notice the cue, make sure that you take a moment to stop and notice your surroundings. You can also use something more external like making a cup of tea, looking in the mirror, or removing your shoes after work as your cue. After a while, you may begin to ignore the cue because you are used to it. If this happens, change your cue to something else. You may not be living in the moment because you are too set in your routine. One way that you can become more aware is to change up your routine. You can do something as simple as changing the way that you drive to work, altering the way you introduce yourself, or tweaking a favorite story. Making a small change to one of your routines may be enough to make you more aware of your surroundings. Try taking a different route for your evening walk or add a new ritual to your bedtime routine. Meditation is a great way to train your brain to live in the moment. As you meditate, you practice noticing your thoughts and simply watching as they go by. Learning to meditate takes time, practice, and guidance, so your best bet is to find a meditation class in your area. If no classes are available in your area, you can also buy CDs that will help you learn how to meditate. To get started with meditation, find a quiet spot and get comfortable. You can either sit in a chair or on a cushion on the floor with your legs crossed. Close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing. As you focus on your breathing, try not to get distracted by your thoughts. Just let them happen and pass by. Without opening your eyes, observe the world around you. Pay attention to how you feel as well. What do you hear? What do you smell? How do you feel? physically? emotionally? Set a gentle timer on your phone so that you know when to stop. You may want to start by meditating for 5 minutes and build up from there. Make sure the people you live with know that you will be meditating and ask them not to disturb you.

The family lived on the city's west side in a neighborhood chiefly populated by immigrants from the south of Italy, first at the corner of Lewis Avenue and Bartlett Street, then on Foster Street, where Ponselle was born, moving when she was three to Springdale Avenue. Her parents were Italian immigrants from Caiazzo, near Caserta. Ponselle had an exceptionally mature voice at an early age and, at least in her early years, sang on natural endowment with little, if any, vocal training. Rosa Ponselle made her Metropolitan Opera debut on November 15, 1918, just a few days after the Great War had finished, as Leonora in Verdi's La forza del destino, opposite Caruso. It was her first performance on any opera stage. She was quite intimidated for being in the presence of Caruso, and in spite of an almost paralyzing case of nervousness (which she suffered from throughout her operatic career), she scored a tremendous success, both with the public and with the critics. New York Times critic James Huneker wrote: \\"...what a promising debut! Added to her personal attractiveness, she possesses a voice of natural beauty that may prove a gold mine; it is vocal gold, anyhow, with its luscious lower and middle tones, dark, rich and ductile, brilliant in the upper register.\\" In addition to Leonora, Ponselle's roles in the 1918/19 season included Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana, Rezia in Weber's Oberon, and Carmelita in the (unsuccessful) world premiere of Joseph Carl Breil's The Legend. In the following Met seasons, Ponselle's roles included the lead soprano roles in La Juive (opposite Caruso's Eleazar, his last new role before he died), William Tell, Ernani, Il trovatore, Aida, La Gioconda, Don Carlos, L'Africaine, L'amore dei tre re, Andrea Chenier, La vestale, and in 1927 the role that many considered her greatest achievement, the title role in Bellini's Norma. In addition to her operatic activities, which were centered at the Met, Ponselle had a lucrative concert career. A tour of the West coast included an appearance at the Lobero Theatre in Santa Barbara on March 14, 1927 in the Artist Series of the Community Arts Association's Music Branch, accompanied by pianist Stuart Ross.","completion":"This text is about Rosa Ponselle, a famous opera singer who was born on January 22, 1897, in Meriden, Connecticut.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case suggests that cutting a deeper gash in the river could potentially have an effect on the formation of more or larger ravines. Let's analyze the potential direct and indirect effects of this perturbation on the process: Direct effects: 1. Accelerated erosion: A deeper gash in the river may lead to faster erosion rates due to increased water velocity. Faster erosion could contribute to the formation of larger and/or more ravines over time. 2. Downstream effects: A deeper gash may cause increased sediment transport downstream, potentially leading to the formation of additional ravines or enlargement of existing ravines as the extra sediment is deposited and eventually eroded. Indirect effects: 1. Changes in water table and vegetation: A deeper gash may alter the local water table, which could impact the surrounding vegetation. This might lead to changes in erosion patterns and the formation of ravines as vegetation helps to stabilize soil and slow down erosion. 2. River migration and avulsion: A deeper gash could lead to changes in the river's path or even avulsion, where the river rapidly changes course. These changes in river dynamics could lead to more ravines forming. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that cutting a deeper gash in the river may lead to both direct and indirect effects on the formation of more, or larger, ravines.

Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere). Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity). Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes.

Background: Reba Nell McEntire was born March 28, 1955, in McAlester, Oklahoma, to Jacqueline (nee Smith; born November 6, 1926) and Clark Vincent McEntire (November 30, 1927 - October 23, 2014). Her father, and her grandfather, John Wesley McEntire (February 19, 1897 - February 13, 1976), were both champion steer ropers and her father was a World Champion Steer Roper three times (1957, 1958, and 1961). John McEntire was the son of Clark Stephen McEntire (September 10, 1855 - August 15, 1935) and Helen Florida McEntire (nee Brown; May 19, 1868 - May 16, 1947). Context: On October 21, 2014, it was announced that McEntire would be the inaugural signing for Big Machine's new imprint Nash Icon Music. She also disclosed that she was working on a new album, with 11 new songs. Her first single for the new label, \\"Going Out Like That\\", was announced December 16, 2014 and was released on January 6, 2015. It served as the lead-off single to Love Somebody, McEntire's twenty-seventh studio album, released on April 14, 2015. Love Somebody debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums--her twelfth number-one album on the chart--and No. 3 on Billboard 200, selling 62,469 copies in the U.S. The album has sold 171,600 copies in the U.S. as of October 5, 2015. In 2016, McEntire was selected as one of thirty artists to perform on \\"Forever Country\\", a mash-up track of Take Me Home, Country Roads, On the Road Again and I Will Always Love You which celebrates 50 years of the CMA Awards. McEntire released her third Christmas album My Kind of Christmas on September 2, 2016. The album was exclusively sold at Cracker Barrel and online. She also announced she would soon be selling her own line of clothing, home decor, jewelry and other things under the \\"Rockin' R by Reba\\" line also at Cracker Barrel. McEntire was a guest judge on the July 13, 2016 episode of America's Got Talent. She used her golden buzzer, which she could only use once and allowed an act to go straight to the live shows, on contortionist Sofie Dossi.

Question: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities. Tammy and Rob rode a tandem bike down the hill. They hit a large rock and fell. Tammy wound up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. Rob suffered only a mild concussion. Which person had fewer problems with mental abilities? Answer:","completion":"Rob had fewer problems with mental abilities. Justification: In the given information, Tammy sustains a serious brain injury, which could potentially result in problems with mental abilities such as memory, based on the initial context provided. On the other hand, Rob suffers only a mild concussion. While concussions can impact mental abilities temporarily, they are considered less severe than serious brain injuries and usually result in fewer long-term problems with mental abilities.

Read this: But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the \\"Axis\\" (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, Office of Strategic Services and the Office of War Information). At the same time, David H. Price's work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies. What did many anthropologists serve in? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Many anthropologists in the 1940s served in two primary areas during the allied war effort against the Axis (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). The first area was in the armed forces, and the second was in intelligence. In the armed forces, these anthropologists were involved in various capacities. They could have served as soldiers, strategists, or advisors, among other roles. Their understanding of human cultures and behaviors could have been crucial in devising strategies or interpreting the actions and intentions of the enemy forces. They could have provided an understanding of the cultural context of the areas in conflict which would have been invaluable in the armed forces' operations. In intelligence, anthropologists worked in offices like the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the Office of War Information (OWI). The OSS was a wartime intelligence agency of the United States during World War II, and a predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The OWI was a United States government agency created during World War II to consolidate government information services. It operated from June 1942 until September 1945. Within these roles, anthropologists contributed their expertise on human cultures and societies to gather, analyze, and interpret information. They likely played key roles in understanding the cultures and societal contexts of the Axis powers, which could inform the design of psychological operations, propaganda, and other strategic efforts. However, it's important to note, as David H. Price's work illustrates, that this was a contentious period for anthropologists and their profession. Several anthropologists were pursued and dismissed from their jobs due to suspected communist sympathies during the Cold War. This suggests that while many anthropologists were contributing to the war effort, the profession as a whole faced scrutiny and debate over its members' political affiliations and beliefs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. Why did the group pick the color orange? A. Because the FBI likes it B. not enough information C. Because hunters wear it while hunting D. Because the NRA likes it Answer:","completion":"C.

I will analyze each sentence closely to highlight their differences. 1. \\"It was described by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874 and is found in North America.\\" This sentence begins with the passive voice in the main clause (It was described by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874) and the active voice in the coordinate clause (is found in North America). The focus in this sentence is on the object (presumably a species or an item) that Alpheus Spring Packard described in 1874, and the subsequent discovery of its presence in North America. 2. \\"It is found by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874 and is described in North America.\\" This sentence uses the active voice in both main and coordinate clauses. The first part (It is found by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874) maintains the primary focus on the object mentioned and emphasizes Alpheus Spring Packard's role in discovering that object in 1874. However, the second part (is described in North America) differs from the first sentence, switching the focus to the object being described in North America (potentially referring to where the description of the object was recorded or where the description is available). In summary, these sentences share similarities in discussing Alpheus Spring Packard and his work in relation to the object in 1874. However, differences in sentence structures and the focus on particular elements of the statement create distinctions in how the ideas are expressed. The first sentence emphasizes Alpheus Packard's description of the object and its existence in North America. In contrast, the second sentence highlights Alpheus Spring Packard's discovery of the object and its detailed explanation in North America."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Physically inspect the statue: A visual inspection of the statue would allow you to observe any missing pieces or damages that may not be mentioned in the initial information provided. 2. Check historical records: Examining historical records, photographs, or descriptions of the statue might provide information about any changes it may have experienced over time, including damage, restoration, or alterations.

Glycyrrhizin is a triterpenoid saponin that is a root centric secondary metabolite having numerous pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiallergic, antiulcer, and is found to be effective even against HIV. Harvesting of the roots for high value glycyrrhizin destroys the whole plant causing existential threat to the plant itself and consequent damage to biodiversity. The present study establishes that hairy root cultures of G. glabra, using an optimized elicitor, can dramatically enhance focused production of glycyrrhizin at a much faster pace year-round without causing destruction of the plant. Hairy root cultures of G. glabra were developed using the Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4 strain. The glycyrrhizin content was enhanced using different biotic and abiotic elicitors, for example, PEG (polyethylene glycol), CdCl 2 , cellulase, and mannan at different concentrations and durations. PEG at 1% concentration enhanced the yield of glycyrrhizin up to 5.4fold after 24 h of exposure, whereas 200 µg mL −1 cellulase enhanced glycyrrhizin yield to 8.6-fold after 7 days of treatment. Mannan at 10 mg L −1 concentration enhanced the production of glycyrrhizin up to 7.8-fold after 10 days of stress. Among different antioxidant enzymes, SOD activity was significantly enhanced under drought, cellulase and mannan stress. This identification of elicitors can result in abundant supply of valuable glycyrrhizin to meet broad spectrum demand through commercial production without endangering G. glabra L.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A breach of contract occurs when one party fails to uphold his side of the contract without an adequate legal excuse. A breach of contract can be indicated by a failure to perform or by words or actions that indicate future nonperformance. If you are involved in a contract that involves materials (such as the sale of an item), you should be entitled to a full recovery of materials if the other party does not fulfill his end of the contract. For example, if you sell a boat to your neighbor and give him an owner-financed payment plan but he stops making payments, you are entitled to a full recovery of the boat, regardless of the amount your neighbor has paid towards the full amount. If you are the non-breach party in a contract, you can seek to mitigate (lessen) the damages caused by the other party’s breach of contract by seeking replacement goods or services (known as “cover.”) If the cover costs you the same or less money than your original contract, you may not be entitled to damages. However, if your cover costs you more, you can ask the contract-breaching party to pay the damages (the difference between the original cost and the cover.) Finding cover as soon as possible to the breach of contract can help you show the court that you’ve done your best to avoid consequential damages, or further expenses due to your own failure to act. For example, you may have a contract with a wedding photographer. If your photographer backs out of the contract the week before your wedding, you may need to scramble and find a new photographer at the last minute. If the last-minute photographer costs the same as your original photographer, there are no damages. If the last-minute photographer charges you an additional 500 for the lack of notice, you can ask that the original photographer pay the 500 fee. If you cannot uphold your end of a contract, you can refuse to fulfill the obligations that are laid out in the contract. Refusing to perform your contractual obligations will constitute a breach of contract and may expose you to a breach of contract lawsuit. Before choosing this option, you should consult with an attorney to ensure that you completely understand all consequences of deciding to breach a contract. If the other party has breached a contract, you can file a lawsuit for damages incurred due to the breach. Be sure that you have a copy of the contract, can specifically identify how and when the breach occurred, and document any financial or other damages that you accumulated as a result of the breach. You can hire a lawyer to file the lawsuit for you, or you can do it yourself at your local courthouse. File the lawsuit as soon as possible after the breach. States have varying statutes of limitations for how long after a breach a lawsuit can be filed, but waiting too long can prevent you from being able to take legal action against the breaching party. After a contract has been breached, the parties involved may want to consider using Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as a tool to settle a contract dispute. With ADR, anyone involved in the contract often share the cost of hiring a neutral mediator. This person will assist all of you to work out a mutually agreeable outcome. The ADR process includes an evaluation by a neutral third-party who isn’t a lawyer. It also includes a negotiation and mediation. Arbitration is another form of ADR. It allows you to take care of the problem without going to court. Arbitration is a good idea in complex cases or when damages are difficult to calculate.","completion":"The article discusses breach of contract, which occurs when a party fails to uphold their contractual obligations, and explains the potential consequences, options for the non-breaching party, and steps to take in such cases.

Write an article that answers the following question: How long were each of the touchdowns longer than 50 yards?","completion":"Title: Unraveling the Details: Touchdowns Longer Than 50 Yards Introduction American football is a sport filled with action-packed plays and jaw-dropping moments. One of the most exhilarating events in a football game is the touchdown scored from breaking away for a long run, particularly those covering more than 50 yards. In this article, we delve into the details of such touchdowns that occurred during a specific game, season, or time frame, assessing their length and examining the players responsible for these remarkable feats. Step 1: Gather and Organize Data Before diving into the analysis, it is crucial to collect a reliable dataset containing information on touchdowns longer than 50 yards. Data can be sourced from reputable sports websites, official league statistics, or football publications. Once the data is gathered, it should be organized in a clear and systematic manner, indicating the player who scored, the distance covered, as well as the game, season, or time frame in which it took place. Step 2: Calculate the Length With the data now in hand, the next step involves determining the precise length of each touchdown longer than 50 yards. To do this, subtract the starting yard line from the opponent's end zone (100 yards) and consider the additional yards made during the play. Here's an example: Player A scored a touchdown from their team's 30-yard line. The distance to the opponent's end zone would be 70 yards (100 - 30). If the player made a 55-yard run, the total length of the touchdown would be 75 yards (70 + 5). Step 3: Make Comparisons and Offer Insights Now that the lengths of each touchdown have been calculated, the next step is to compare them, highlighting those that stand out in terms of distance or frequency in the specified time frame. For example, if several touchdowns were 70 yards or longer, it would be worth noting this in the analysis. When examining individual players, it is essential to consider factors such as their position, team, and personal achievements, as these can add valuable context and insight into the incredible accomplishment of scoring a touchdown over 50 yards. Step 4: Presenting the Findings In presenting the results, lay out the key findings in a logical sequence, possibly beginning with a summary of the most significant results and then proceeding to offer supporting details. Make use of descriptive statistics and visual aids such as charts, graphs, and infographics to help readers grasp the data more effectively. Conclusion Scoring a touchdown covering more than 50 yards is an impressive accomplishment for any football player. Analyzing and understanding the lengths and fine details of these outstanding plays provides a greater appreciation for the athleticism, skill, and determination of the players involved. Through careful data collection, calculation, and analysis, we can not only answer the question of how long each touchdown longer than 50 yards was but also gain insight into the remarkable talent and prowess of the athletes responsible for them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Information: - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Arkansas is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Its name is of Siouan derivation from the language of the Osage denoting their related kin, the Quapaw Indians. The state's diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the Ozark and the Ouachita Mountains, which make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, to the densely forested land in the south known as the Arkansas Timberlands, to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River and the Arkansas Delta. - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information across the world. - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States. Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts).

Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation. - Mississippi is a state in the southern region of the United States, with part of its southern border formed by the Gulf of Mexico. Its western border is formed by the Mississippi River. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - WPRE ( 980 AM ) is a radio station broadcasting a classic hits format to the Prairie du Chien , Wisconsin , USA area .

Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - Oldies is a radio format that concentrates on rock and roll and pop music from the latter half of the 20th Century, specifically from around the mid 1950s to the 1970s or 1980s. - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules. - Wisconsin is a U.S. state located in the north-central United States, in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions.

Wisconsin is the 23rd largest state by total area and the 20th most populous. The state capital is Madison, and its largest city is Milwaukee, which is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan. The state is divided into 72 counties. - A meander, in general, is a bend in a sinuous watercourse or river. A meander forms when moving water in a stream erodes the outer banks and widens its valley, and the inner part of the river has less energy and deposits silt. A stream of any volume may assume a \\"meandering\\" course, alternately eroding sediments from the outside of a bend and depositing them on the inside. The result is a \\"snaking\\" pattern as the stream meanders back and forth across its down-valley axis. When a meander gets cut off from the main stream, an oxbow lake forms. Over time meanders migrate downstream, sometimes in such a short time as to create civil engineering problems for local municipalities attempting to maintain stable roads and bridges. - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin. - Classic hits is a radio format which generally includes rock and pop music from 1964 to 1988 or 1989, with occasional songs as recent as the early 1990s or before 1995. The term is erroneously used as a synonym for the adult hits format (which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from the 1970s through the 1990s), but is more accurately characterized as a contemporary style of the oldies format, although most classic hits stations focus on pop hits from the late 1960s through the 1990s. - Adult hits (sometimes also called variety hits) is a radio format that draws from a wide variety of different musical genres. Most adult hits stations play a mix of rock, pop, pop rock, soft rock, classic rock, adult contemporary, and new wave hits as well as select oldies hits, predominantly drawing on music from the late 1960s through the present day. Adult hits is akin to classic hits, although the classic hits format uses a slightly older and often narrower playlist (1960s to 1980s). - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States.

Louisiana is bordered by Arkansas to the north, Mississippi to the east, Texas to the west, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. - Crawford County is a county in the southwest part of the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2010 census, the population was 16,644. Its county seat is Prairie du Chien. - The Mississippi River Delta region is a 3-million-acre (12,000 km) area of land that stretches from Vermillion Bay on the west, to the Chandeleur Islands in the Gulf of Mexico on the southeastern coast of Louisiana. It is part of the Louisiana coastal plain, one of the largest areas of coastal wetlands in the United States. The Mississippi River Delta is the 7th largest river delta on Earth (USGS) and is an important coastal region for the United States, containing more than 2.7 million acres of coastal wetlands (and 37% of the estuarine marsh in the conterminous U.S. he coastal area is the nations largest drainage basin and drains about 41% of the contiguous United States into the Gulf of Mexico at an average rate of 470,000 cubic feet per second. - The Appalachian Mountains, often called the Appalachians, are a system of mountains in eastern North America. The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period. It once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before naturally occurring erosion. The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel, as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to most roads running east or west. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains.

Leadbeater arrived around the same time as Fuller, and soon afterward he \\"discovered\\" the person he believed would become a global teacher and orator, Jiddu Krishnamurti (then in his teens). Leadbetter and others tutored Krishnamurti. Fuller may have taught him photography. She also had a small studio built in the grounds, and painted. Her works from the period include a portrait of Leadbeater and Portrait of the Lord Buddha. McFarlane emphasises the significance of the latter work, pointing out that it is \\"strikingly modern\\" in comparison to all of Fuller's other work, and more radical than compositions created by Grace Cossington Smith and Roland Wakelin, half a decade later. The painting owes much to theosophy's emphasis on seeing the subject \\"through a psychic, visionary experience\\". Sources describing Fuller's movements after her time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but found it difficult to realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable.

Question: Who is public relations chief? Title: The Towering Inferno Movie plot: Doug Roberts is chief architect for Duncan Enterprises, an architectural firm specializing in skyscrapers. Their greatest project, the Glass Tower, is 1,800 feet high and set for dedication in San Francisco, and a lavish ceremony is scheduled to include Mayor Robert Ramsey and Senator Gary Parker. Jim Duncan, the company's president, is wooing Senator Parker because his support for an urban renewal effort will allow the company to build more such skyscrapers. When Roberts flies back to San Francisco for the party, he finds in his office his fiancée, magazine editor Susan Franklin, and when the two renew romantic acquaintances, she reveals that she has received a long-sought promotion - which throws a wrench into their plans to move to the countryside to have a family.Doug, however, is interrupted when he gets a call from the Tower utility room in the building's massive basement. In routine checking of the building's generators, a power surge blows out a circuit breaker - and unknown to everyone the surge blows out another circuit breaker, this one on the 81st floor in a large storage closet that sends a wire flopping onto shop rags that catch fire.Roberts consults his pal, Will Giddings, and the two confront Jim Duncan about the wiring; Duncan's chief electrical engineer is his son-in-law, Roger Simmons, and to all three men's chagrin Simmons cannot be reached by phone. While Will Giddings works with the building's chief security officer, Harry Jernigan, on the electrical systems, Doug Roberts tracks down Roger Simmons and his wife Patty, and confronts Simmons about the wiring. Simmons, a thoroughly oily man, insists the wiring is up to city safety codes, but those codes are not sufficient for an 1,800-foot skyscraper. Simmons nonetheless blows off Doug, which agitates Patty as she doesn't want her father's business to suffer because of him.The dedication ceremony goes off as scheduled and the entire building is lit up for the party in the Promenade Room some 135 floors up.

A: A:","completion":"After reading the question and evaluating the options provided, my thought process is as follows: 1. The question is about waste material transported in the circulatory system and safely stored at high concentrations. 2. I know that proteins are essential nutrients for the body and play a significant role in building muscle and other tissues. They are unlikely to be the correct answer because they are not waste material. 3. Carbon is an essential element in organic compounds, but it is not a waste material. It is a part of various molecules and compounds required for life processes. Thus, carbon seems an unlikely answer. 4. Phosphorus is an essential element found in the form of phosphate ions in the body. It plays a role in several biological functions, including the formation of ATP (energy currency) and DNA. As an essential nutrient, phosphorus is not considered a waste material, making it an unlikely answer. 5. Urea is a waste product formed during the breakdown of proteins and amino acids. It gets transported in the circulatory system and can be stored safely at high concentrations. Urea is produced when the liver converts ammonia to urea which is then filtered and excreted via the kidneys in mammals. This makes urea the best choice for the answer.

Jimmy and Fletch are two friends living in London, experiencing life problems. Jimmy is dumped by his unscrupulous girlfriend, and Fletch is fired from his job as a clown for punching a child. They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer. As the barman offers the two men free ale as an apology for the vicar, they learn the students they saw earlier are going to a cottage, where they are to stay the night. Jimmy and Fletch pursue the students' van, catching up to it as the engine has broken down, and are introduced to four girls (Heidi, Lotte, Anke and Trudi).

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

Bruce Humberstone and starring Vera Ellen, David Niven, and Cesar Romero. The film was made and first released in the UK, and distributed in the US by RKO Radio Pictures in 1952. Can we draw the following conclusion? Happy Go Lovely was released in the early 50s.","completion":"Yes, we can certainly draw the conclusion that Happy Go Lovely was released in the early 50s. The film was created in 1951, which falls within the first half of the 1950s. Multiple aspects further substantiate this assertion. Firstly, the film was directed by H. Bruce Humberstone, a talented director who was mostly active during the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. His involvement in the film is consistent with the timeline placing it in the early 1950s. Secondly, the film features a notable cast of actors and actresses who were prominent during this time period. Vera Ellen, an accomplished actress and dancer, was popular in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Her starring role in this film reflects the era of production. Similarly, the careers of both David Niven and Cesar Romero were flourishing during the 1950s as well, suggesting that the film's production coincides with the peak years of their fame. Moreover, the musical comedy genre of the film is representative of the early 1950s. Films from this period were often characterized by their lightheartedness, colorful cinematography, and musical components. Technicolor technology, which allowed for vibrant color schemes, had become more widespread by this time and was utilized to enhance audience experiences. Additionally, the film's distribution by RKO Radio Pictures also signals its release during the early 1950s. RKO was a significant motion picture studio during the Golden Age of Hollywood and was particularly active until the mid-1950s when financial troubles led to its eventual decline. Happy Go Lovely's distribution by RKO is indicative of its production timeline within the early 50s. Lastly, the exchange between the UK and the US film industries during this period reflects the global popularity of American and British cinema. The fact that Happy Go Lovely was initially made and released in the UK and later brought to the US in 1952 by RKO Radio Pictures further cements its position within the early 1950s film landscape. Taking into account the film's production year of 1951, the key contributors to the film such as the director and leading actors, its genre and use of Technicolor technology, and distribution patterns, we can securely conclude that Happy Go Lovely was indeed released in the early 1950s."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Quintanilla and Cruz Martinez. Their music encompasses the styles of cumbia (hence their name), hip hop, and R&B. They produce songs in both Spanish and English. The band's producers from the beginning have been Quintanilla and Cruz Martínez. Quintanilla is the brother of the late \\"Queen of Tejano\\", Selena. Quintanilla played bass guitar for the group, while Martínez, husband of international artist Alicia Villarreal, played keyboards. Both co-wrote songs for the Kumbia Kings. Though the group has gone through a revolving door of members in recent years amid controversy and finger-pointing, and the Kumbia Kings of today are vastly different from what originated in Corpus Christi over eight years ago, Quintanilla and Martínez were always the soul of the group. Gone are original members Frankie J and DJ Kane, both of whom have gone on to significant success as solo artists, as well as the group K1 (Kingz One), a collaboration of founding members of Kumbia Kings who have defected from the group for reason of \\"internal dissension\\". Quintanilla, Irvin \\"Pee Wee\\" Salinas, as well as Selena's widower Chris Pérez, also decided to leave the group due to that same \\"internal dissension\\".

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room!

Question: when did they show cartoons in movie theaters I found the following answer on Google: A typical multiplex ( AMC Promenade 16 in Woodland Hills , Los Angeles , U.S. ) Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer provided is not correct. The information given about AMC Promenade 16 in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, U.S., is related to a modern multiplex cinema and not the history of cartoons being shown in movie theaters. Cartoons have a rich history in movie theaters, dating back to the early days of animated films in the early 20th century. The first animated cartoon, \\"Humorous Phases of Funny Faces\\" by James Stuart Blackton, was released in 1906. In the following years, several well-known animation studios and creators, like Winsor McCay, Walt Disney, and Max Fleischer, started producing animated films and cartoons. The 1920s and 1930s, often referred to as the \\"Golden Age of Animation,\\" witnessed the rise and popularity of animated short films that were shown before feature films in movie theaters. During this time, famous characters such as Felix the Cat, Mickey Mouse, and Betty Boop were created and gained widespread popularity. In 1928, Walt Disney's \\"Steamboat Willie,\\" featuring Mickey Mouse, made its debut in theaters and was one of the first films with synchronized sound. This animation greatly contributed to the widespread showing of cartoons in theaters. As a part of the Golden Age, the 1940s and 1950s saw the rise of Warner Bros. animated characters, such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and the introduction of the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies animated series. These cartoons continued to be shown as short films before the main feature, often providing comic relief and entertainment for audiences of all ages. Towards the end of the 20th century, especially with the rise of television, the trend of showing cartoons in movie theaters started to decline. However, with the modern advent of Pixar and CGI animation, theaters continue to showcase animated short films before the main feature. In conclusion, the history of showing cartoons in movie theaters began in the early 20th century and gained widespread popularity during the 1920s and 1930s, with the emergence of iconic animated characters and studios. Although the tradition of showing cartoons before feature films has diminished, the influence of animation on the film industry remains strong today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Attawapiskat First Nation in Ontario saw 28 suicide attempts in March and more than 100 since last September, Canadian media said, with one person reported to have died. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the news \\"heartbreaking\\". Canada's 1.4 million indigenous people have high levels of poverty. Their life expectancy is also below the Canadian average. Bruce Shisheesh, the chief of the Attawapiskat First Nation community, said 11 people attempted to take their own lives on Saturday, prompting him to declare a state of emergency. He tweeted that the regional Weeneebayko Health Authority was flying in a crisis team, mental health nurses and social workers, and that he was waiting for Ontario's minister of health to deliver more emergency workers to the area. The First Nations government was sending a crisis response unit to the community following the declaration on Saturday, Canadian media said.

Charlie Angus, the local MP, said: \\"This is a systemic crisis affecting the communities.\\" \\"There's just not been a serious response from any level of government until now,\\" he said. \\"We'll continue to work to improve living conditions for all Indigenous peoples,\\" Prime Minister Trudeau said. Another Canadian aboriginal community in the western province of Manitoba appealed for federal aid last month, citing six suicides in two months and 140 suicide attempts in two weeks. Suicide and self-inflicted injuries are among the top causes of death for First Nations, Métis and Inuit people, according to studies from Health Canada. National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Perry Bellegarde called for a national strategy to combat indigenous suicide last month. \\"Immediate support to communities is essential & a #FirstNations driven national strategy on mental health,\\" he tweeted on Monday.

SEAN KILPATRICK/THE CANADIAN PRESS Where is Attawapiskat? The Attawapiskat First Nation is located at the mouth of the Attawapiskat River on James Bay in Northern Ontario and is home to about 2,000 people. It has been plagued by suicides for decades. How did it start? The suicide epidemic in Attawapiskat started in the fall, when a number of people tried to kill themselves, said Jackie Hookimaw, a member of the community. She said the latest round of youth suicide attempts started with the death of her great-niece Sheridan, who took her life in October. She was 13 years old. What is being done? Chief Bruce Shisheesh and council declared a state of emergency on Saturday. The designation has meant that a Nishnawbe Aski Nation crisis response unit is being sent to the community. The federal and Ontario health ministers said the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority hospital was immediately flying in a crisis team, including mental health nurses and social workers. Meanwhile, Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said he has offered Chief Shisheesh his support and is pressing for long-term help for the community in addition to immediate action, adding that the crisis is a \\"national tragedy.\\" Story continues below advertisement The news from Attawapiskat is heartbreaking. We'll continue to work to improve living conditions for all Indigenous peoples. — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) April 10, 2016 The crisis in context 1. Suicide is not just an Attawapiskat problem Previous studies have suggested suicide and self-inflicted injuries are among the leading causes of death among First Nations, Métis and Inuit people. Waves of suicides like the one in Attawapiskat are not new, but several others in recent months have gained renewed attention – such as a string of deaths in northern Manitoba's Pimicikamak Cree Nation, also known as Cross Lake, which has also declared a state of emergency. A grave site for Finola Muswaggon, who died at Cross Lake in March, 2016. She was 14. ANN MARY FOR THE GLOBE AND MAIL Mr. Bellegarde said last month that there should be a national strategy to combat indigenous suicide. \\"Our young people need hope and inspiration,\\" Mr. Bellegarde said. \\"They don't see that right now. We've got to make those key strategic interventions now. It's a life-and-death situation.\\" 2. Suicide is not just an on-reserve problem The renewed attention on suicide crises on reserve had led some critics to propose urban resettlement as a solution. Indigenous suicide problems do not disappear in cities, however. A Statistics Canada report released in January found that more than one in five off-reserve First Nations, Métis and Inuit adults reported having suicidal thoughts at some point in their lives. Problems with suicide on reserve can be more acute, though, due to challenges of distance and availability of mental-health services. Charlie Angus, the MP for the Attawapiskat area and NDP indigenous affairs critic, said northern communities aren't given the resources to deal with complicated grief. \\"When a young person tries to commit suicide in any suburban school, they send in the resources, they send in the emergency team. There's a standard protocol for response. The northern communities are left on their own,\\" he said. \\"We don't have the mental health service dollars. We don't have the resources.\\" 3. Indigenous suicide is not just a mental-health problem Conditions on reserves lag behind those in the rest of Canada in more respects than just suicide and health: Unemployment, lack of access to education and substandard infrastructure are factors too. Attawapiskat declared a state of emergency five years ago over a housing crisis that James Anaya, then UN Special Rapporteur on indigenous peoples, said \\"seems to represent the condition of many First Nation communities living on reserves throughout Canada, which is allegedly akin to Third World conditions.\\" Studies have pointed to economic hardships and the legacy of colonialism as key factors in high indigenous suicide rates. The January Statscan study, for instance – which reviewed findings from the 2012 Aboriginal Peoples Survey and the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey – found a strong connection between residential-school experience and suicidal thoughts. Doing more to prevent suicide was one of the recommendations of last June's report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on residential schools. Federal Health Minister Jane Philpott said in a statement regarding the Attawapiskat suicide crisis that improving the wellness of indigenous peoples will require a focus on improving the socioeconomic conditions they face. \\"I have worked with the province to set up a joint action table so that federal and provincial governments can work together, hand-in-hand with First Nations leadership, to find concrete solutions,\\" Ms. Philpott said. Story continues below advertisement 4. Attawapiskat is more than just a community with problems During some of Attawapiskat's previous moments in the national spotlight – the housing crisis, former chief Theresa Spence's contentious role in the Idle No More movement – Attawapiskat residents have sometimes criticized outside observers for only paying attention during times of crisis. Residents tried to challenge that narrative in 2014 with a 1,000-kilometre trek to Ottawa to urge politicians and First Nations chiefs to renew discussion of treaty rights.

The suicide epidemic in Attawapiskat started in the fall, when a number of people tried to kill themselves, said Jackie Hookimaw, a resident of First Nation on James Bay. Hookimaw’s great niece Sheridan took her own life in October. She was 13 years old. Hookimaw said Sheridan had a big heart, but she was plagued with multiple health conditions and was bullied at school. More recently, Hookimaw said, she was at the community’s hospital where she saw a number of teenage girls being treated after purposely overdosing on drugs. As she was leaving, a man came in for treatment. Later, she would learn that he, too, had tried to take his own life. There’s different layers of grief The Attawapiskat First Nation, which has been plagued by suicides for decades, is home to about 2,000 people, and Hookimaw said the community needs more resources. She said the latest round of youth suicide attempts started with Sheridan’s death. Sheridan’s peers were grieving, Hookimaw said. They didn’t have the support they needed to manage their grief, so they tried to end their lives, she said. “There’s different layers of grief,” she said. “There’s normal grief, when somebody dies from illness or old age. And there’s complicated grief, where there’s severe trauma, like when somebody commits suicide.” Charlie Angus, the MP for the area and NDP indigenous affairs critic, said northern communities aren’t given the resources to deal with complicated grief. “When a young person tries to commit suicide in any suburban school, they send in the resources, they send in the emergency team. There’s a standard protocol for response. The northern communities are left on their own,” he said. “We don’t have the mental health service dollars. We don’t have the resources.” He said it’s been a “rolling nightmare” of more and more suicide attempts among young people throughout the winter. They didn’t think it could get any worse than it was in March, he said. But April brought even more attempts. We don’t have the mental health service dollars. We don’t have the resources On Saturday alone, 11 people tried to commit suicide, Chief Bruce Shisheesh told the CBC. It’s that situation that led the Attawapiskat chief and council to declare a state of emergency on Saturday. The designation has meant that a Nishnawabe Aski Nation crisis response unit is being sent to the community. On Twitter, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the news from Attawapiskat “heartbreaking.” “We’ll continue to work to improve living conditions for all indigenous peoples,” Trudeau tweeted. The federal and Ontario health ministers said the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority hospital was immediately flying in a crisis team, including mental health nurses and social workers. “We will be providing additional health-care experts as needed and we have contacted the ministry of children and youth services about providing emergency life-promotion supports,” Ontario Health Minister Eric Hoskins said in a release. Federal Health Minister Jane Philpott said in a statement that improving the wellness of indigenous peoples will require a focus on improving the socio-economic conditions they face. “I have worked with the province to set up a joint action table so that federal and provincial governments can work together, hand-in-hand with First Nations leadership, to find concrete solutions,” Philpott said. Hoskins said Ontario has asked Ottawa to accelerate the work of the action table and will be identifying additional community programming that can help “give people hope in this terrible time.” Angus said that the work of grief counselling often gets left to untrained community members who are dealing with their own grief. “It’s the local cops, it’s the local teachers, it’s parents,” he said. And now, Hookimaw said, some of the youth are taking healing into their own hands. Youth from Attawapiskat and neighbouring communities held a healing walk last week to create awareness, she said. “They said, ’We will not give up, because our youth are killing themselves … We will not be defeated.”’ Feel like you need help and want to speak with someone?

On Saturday night alone, 11 people attempted to take their own lives, Chief Bruce Shisheesh said. Shisheesh and the council met Saturday night and unanimously voted to declare the state of emergency. That compels such agencies as the Weeneebayko Health Authority in Moose Factory, Ont., and Health Canada to bring in additional resources. Including Saturday's spate of suicide attempts, a total of 101 people of all ages have tried to kill themselves since September, Shisheesh said, with one person dying. The youngest was 11, the oldest 71. The Cree community — home to about 2,000 residents — saw 28 attempts in March alone. Last September, a group of five girls overdosed and had to be medevaced out of the community, Shisheesh said. I have relatives that have attempted to take their own lives ... cousins, friends. - Attawapiskat Chief Bruce Shisheesh Four health-care workers without specialized mental health training are trying to keep up with the attempts and to avert future ones, he said. \\"I'm asking friends, government, that we need help in our community,\\" Shisheesh said. \\"I have relatives that have attempted to take their own lives... cousins, friends.\\" The council has hired security to keep an eye on patients currently in hospital. The Mushkegowuk Council, which represents eight northern Ontario First Nations, is also trying to help. \\"These four workers, crisis workers, are burned out. They can't continue working daily because of the amount of suicides [that] have happened. They're backlogged,\\" said the council's Deputy Grand Chief Rebecca Friday. \\"There are no services at the moment, no counsellors in the community.\\" A few support workers have been brought in by the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, an association of northern Ontario First Nations, she said, but that's not enough to stem the number of attempted suicides. Government response The federal and Ontario health ministers announced support for Attawapiskat on Sunday evening, saying that the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority hospital was immediately flying in a crisis team, including mental-health nurses and social workers. Ontario also said it would deploy its Health Ministry's Emergency Medical Assistance Team to \\"get to work immediately\\" as well as to \\"determine what further supports are needed for the medium term.\\" \\"Hearing about the loss of life to suicide and the feelings of despair felt by the community of Attawapiskat reminds us of how important it is to work with First Nations and indigenous peoples across the country to address the very real challenges facing their communities,\\" federal Health Minister Jane Philpott said in a statement. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also weighed in on the situation Sunday, calling the news from Attawapiskat \\"heartbreaking.\\" The news from Attawapiskat is heartbreaking. We'll continue to work to improve living conditions for all Indigenous peoples. —@JustinTrudeau Charlie Angus, the region's MP and NDP indigenous affairs critic, echoed others' sentiments that northern communities aren't given the resources to deal with complicated grief. \\"When a young person tries to commit suicide in any suburban school, they send in the resources, they send in the emergency team. There's a standard protocol for response. The northern communities are left on their own,\\" he said. \\"We don't have the mental health service dollars. We don't have the resources.\\" Angus said it's been a \\"rolling nightmare\\" of more and more suicide attempts among young people throughout the winter. Triggers include overcrowding, abuse As for the triggers, there are many, Shisheesh said. Overcrowding with 14 to 15 people living in one home is difficult, he said. Bullying at school is another trigger. Emotional damage caused by abuse during enrolment at residential schools is having a ripple effect through the generations, he said. (Erik White/CBC ) Drug abuse is another factor, Shisheesh said. People try to numb themselves after physical and sexual abuse. \\"We have people that are on prescriptions. We have people that are selling pills. And I believe that's how some of them have withdrawals and they feel unwanted, or they don't know how to express their feelings and they have to use a drug to drown their problems or their pains,\\" Shisheesh said. \\"And when you don't have money to buy drugs, that's when they turn to suicide.\\" As for the near-daily attempts in March, Shisheesh said he had no explanation. He just said he worried every time his phone rang in case it was more bad news. The chief and council are planning to meet Monday to formulate a strategic plan. \\"We need help in Attawapiskat,\\" Shisheesh said. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The Attawapiskat First Nation in northern Ontario, Canada, has declared a state of emergency after 11 people attempted to take their own lives in one day.

Write an article using the following points: Zamperini passed away at his home on Wednesday after battling pneumonia for over a month, Universal Pictures announced. Angelina Jolie said: 'It is a loss impossible to describe' Zamperini competed in the 5,000 meters in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. In WWII, he was on an Air Forces bomber that crashed into the ocean and spent 47 days adrfit on a raft before being captured by the Japanese. He was a POW for 2 years and tortured before his release. His story was turned into a best-selling book and Jolie's movie about his life, 'Unbroken', is due out in December. Article:","completion":"Title: Remembering Louis Zamperini: A Life of Resilience and Triumph On the 2nd of July 2014, the world mourned the loss of an extraordinary man, Louis Zamperini, who passed away at his home surrounded by loved ones. The Olympic athlete, distinguished war hero, and inspiration behind the best-selling book and movie \\"Unbroken\\" had been battling pneumonia for over a month. In an announcement from Universal Pictures, it was noted that the loss has been, in the words of Angelina Jolie, \\"impossible to describe.\\" Today, seven years since his passing, let us celebrate the remarkable journey and legacy Zamperini left behind. Born on January 26, 1917, in Olean, New York, to Italian immigrants, Louis Zamperini's early years were filled with challenges. As a young boy, he often found himself in trouble with the law, but through the insistence and guidance of his older brother Pete, he found solace in competitive running. This led to a prosperous athletic career, with Zamperini setting high school records in track and ultimately competing in the 1936 Berlin Olympics at the age of 19. It was here that he participated in the 5,000 meters race, coming in 8th overall, but nonetheless leaving a profound impression with his swift finish. Little did he know that his resilience and vigor would save his life just a few years later on another battlefield. In 1941, with the outbreak of World War II, Zamperini enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces, leaving behind a promising athletic career. Trained as a bombardier, he found himself aboard a B-24 Liberator bomber, which tragically crashed into the Pacific Ocean during a search and rescue mission in May 1943. Of the 11 crew members, only Zamperini and two others survived the crash. What ensued was a harrowing 47-day test of survival, resilience, and unbeatable will. Adrift on a life raft with no food or water, Zamperini and his fellow survivors battled the scorching sun, hunger, thirst, and circling sharks, as well as enduring a strafing attack by a Japanese aircraft. Despite the unfathomable odds against them, the men held on, driven by a deep faith in themselves and each other. On the 47th day, their strife took a sudden twist as they were captured by the Japanese navy. Zamperini's incredible story, however, did not end there. For the next two years, he would face unimaginable torture, starvation, and humiliation as a prisoner of war in various Japanese camps. Despite the relentless brutality of his captors, he continued to exhibit an unshakable spirit, ultimately leading to his liberation in 1945, as the war came to an end. Upon returning to the United States, the once-renowned athlete faced a new challenge - adjusting to life after the horrors he had experienced. Haunted by the physical and emotional scars of his ordeals, Zamperini struggled with alcoholism and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), threatening to destroy his marriage and family life. However, by evolving the same resilience that saw him through the darkest hours, he found solace and redemption in the Christian faith, which would shape the rest of his life. The inspirational story of Louis Zamperini came to broader public attention in the form of a best-selling book by Laura Hillenbrand titled \\"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption\\", published in 2010. Four years later, Angelina Jolie directed and produced the adapted movie \\"Unbroken\\", which immortalized his tale and is set to release in December 2014. The film captures the extraordinary life and strength of a man who overcame insurmountable challenges, teaching us the true power of the human spirit. As we remember Louis Zamperini, we cannot help but marvel at the life of a man, who through adversity and triumph, leaves behind a legacy of courage, resilience, and unbreakable spirit.

Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said Wednesday that U.S. intelligence officials should be questioned over their handling of \\"Curveball,\\" an Iraqi defector whose now discredited claims on weapons of mass destruction helped fuel the Bush administration's drive to war in 2003. It has become clear over the years that \\"the source called Curveball was totally unreliable,\\" Powell said in a statement to CNN. \\"The question should be put to the CIA and the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) as to why this wasn't known before the false information was put into (a key intelligence estimate) sent to Congress, the president's State of the Union address and my February 5 presentation to the U.N.\\" Powell, in an address to members of the United Nations Security Council in February 2003, said the U.S. government had \\"first-hand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels.\\" \\"The source was an eyewitness, an Iraqi chemical engineer who supervised one of these facilities,\\" Powell said at the time. \\"He actually was present during biological agent production runs. He was also at the site when an accident occurred in 1998. Twelve technicians died.\\" Two months later, the invasion of Iraq began. No biological weapons, no germ labs, and no weapons of mass destruction were found. The defector, Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, has admitted in an interview with Britain's Guardian newspaper that he lied to help bring down Saddam Hussein's regime. \\"I had the chance to fabricate something, to topple the regime,\\" he said. \\"I did this, and I am satisfied, because there is no dictator in Iraq anymore.\\" When Alwan spoke to CNN in 2008, he said, \\"I never told anyone Saddam Hussein was producing weapons of mass destruction.\\" At the time, intelligence sources told CNN that Alwan had claimed that Iraq had a secret bioweapons program. But now, Alwan admits that after he was granted asylum in Germany in 2000, he used his training as a chemical engineer to concoct for his debriefers a story of Iraqi WMD production. Although the CIA was not given a chance to interview Alwan directly, and German officials had questioned some aspects of Alwan's story, his assertions were included in the material provided to Powell for his U.N. presentation. Tyler Drumheller, who was the CIA's chief of European operations at the time, agrees that the \\"Curveball\\" information was not well-enough vetted. He says he had reservations at the time about relying on it, but that when he asked for direct CIA access to Alwan through the German intelligence service, he was rebuffed. A representative of Germany's intelligence service declined to comment. Drumheller claims top Bush administration officials were too willing to believe Alwan's story \\"because that was the only piece of intelligence they had that really fit what the administration was looking at.\\" Former President George W. Bush declined through a spokesman to comment. Representatives for former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and the DIA did not reply to CNN's inquiries. Former CIA director George Tenet, who was Drumheller's boss, wrote in his memoirs that \\"perhaps some people's recollections of 'if only someone had listened to me' have become sharper than reality.\\" Without naming names, Tenet said that \\"concerns about Curveball did not get disseminated far and wide through the agency as they should have been.\\" Former Homeland Security adviser Frances Townsend says that the U.S. government should seek Alwan's extradition and prosecution, for \\"intentionally lying and deceiving the U.S. government.\\" \\"It absolutely makes my blood boil,\\" she told CNN. Not all observers are accepting Alwan's claim that his goal in spinning his WMD tale was to free the people of Iraq from Hussein. \\"He told the story because he wanted to get out of a refugee camp in Germany,\\" said Bob Drogin, author of a book about the episode. \\"He wanted to get his wife out and bring her to Germany, he wanted to get citizenship, and he wanted a Mercedes Benz. And he got all of those things.\\" But in his interview with the Guardian, Alwan said he had already won asylum before he spoke to German intelligence about weapons programs in Iraq, and that telling them his story did not win him a life of ease. Alwan insisted he is proud of the role he played in the toppling of Hussein. In the video of the interview posted online, he said that if he had it all to do over again, he would say the same thing \\"because I wouldn't want that regime to continue in our country.\\" CNN's Frederik Pleitgen and Pam Benson contributed to this report.

Powell stated that the CIA and the DIA should have known the source was unreliable before including it in the intelligence reports sent to Congress, the President's State of the Union address, and his U.N. presentation. 2.

There are concerns that some officials in the Bush administration believed Alwan's story because it confirmed their existing suspicions about Iraq's WMD capabilities.

Carpenter spent several years singing in Washington, D.C. clubs before signing in the late 1980s with Columbia Records, who marketed her as a country singer. Carpenter's first album, 1987's Hometown Girl, did not produce any singles, although 1989's State of the Heart and 1990's Shooting Straight in the Dark each produced four Top 20 hits on the Billboard country singles charts. Carpenter's most successful album to date remains 1992's Context: Carpenter's first album, \\"Hometown Girl\\" was produced by John Jennings and was released in 1987. Though songs from Hometown Girl got play on public and college radio stations, it was not until Columbia began promoting Carpenter as a \\"country\\" artist that she found a wider audience. For a long time, Carpenter was ambivalent about this pigeonholing, saying she preferred the term \\"singer-songwriter\\" or \\"slash rocker\\" (as in country/folk/rock). She told Rolling Stone in 1991, \\"I've never approached music from a categorization process, so to be a casualty of it is real disconcerting to me\\". Some music critics argue that Carpenter's style covers a range of influences even broader than those from \\"country\\" and \\"folk\\". Time critic Richard Corliss described the songs in her album A Place in the World as \\"reminiscent of early Beatles or rollicking Motown\\", and one reviewer of Time* Sex* Love* noted the \\"wash of Beach Boys-style harmonies ... backwards guitar loops\\" and use of a sitar on one track, all elements not commonly found on a country or folk album. After 1989's State of the Heart, Carpenter released Shooting Straight in the Dark in 1990, which yielded her biggest single up to that point, the Grammy Award-winning \\"Down at the Twist and Shout\\". Two years later, Carpenter released the album that, to date, has been her biggest popular success, Come On Come On (1992). The album went quadruple platinum, remaining on the Country Top 100 list for more than 97 weeks, and eventually spawned seven charting singles. Come On Come On was also critically acclaimed; The New York Times's Karen Schoemer wrote that Carpenter had \\"risen through the country ranks without flash or bravado: no big hair, sequined gowns, teary performances.... Enriched with Ms. Carpenter's subtlety, Come On Come On grows stronger and prettier with every listen.\\" The songs of Come On Come On had the qualities that would come to identify her work: humorous, fast-paced country-rock songs with themes of perseverance, desire, and independence, alternating with slow, introspective ballads that speak to social or relational issues. \\"Passionate Kisses\\", a cover of fellow singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams's 1988 song, was the album's third single. Carpenter's version peaked on the U.S. Country chart at No. 4, and was the first of Carpenter's songs to cross over to mainstream pop and adult contemporary charts, charting at No. 57 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at No. 11 on Adult Contemporary. The sixth single on Come On Come On, \\"He Thinks He'll Keep Her\\", was Carpenter's biggest hit off the album, charting at No. 2 on Billboard's Country chart and at No. 1 on Radio & Records's Country chart. Written by Carpenter and Don Schlitz, the fast-paced song follows a 36-year-old homemaker who leaves her husband, and was inspired by a 1970s series of Geritol commercials in which a man boasts of his wife's seemingly limitless energy and her many accomplishments, then concludes by saying, \\"My wife ... I think I'll keep her.\\" Carpenter said, \\"That line has always stuck with me. It's just such a joke.\\" The single received a Grammy nomination for Record of the Year.

Answer:","completion":"Martin Freeman played Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit film trilogy, and Ian Holm portrayed the character in The Lord of the Rings film series directed by Peter Jackson. Martin Freeman, born on September 8, 1971, is an English actor known for his roles in several television shows, movies, and theater productions. He gained widespread recognition for his portrayal of Tim Canterbury in the UK version of the television series \\"The Office\\". He has also starred in the TV series \\"Sherlock\\" as Dr. John Watson, opposite Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes. Freeman has demonstrated his acting versatility in films like \\"Love Actually\\", \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\", and \\"Black Panther\\". In The Hobbit film trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson and based on the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien, Freeman played the role of young Bilbo Baggins. The trilogy consists of \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" (2012), \\"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\\" (2013), and \\"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\\" (2014). As the main protagonist, Bilbo Baggins is the protagonist embarks on a journey filled with adventure, courage, and self-discovery. On the other hand, Ian Holm, born on September 12, 1931, and passed away on June 19, 2020, was a renowned British actor with a long and illustrious career in film, television, and theater. He is known for his roles in films like \\"Chariots of Fire\\", \\"Alien\\", and \\"The Fifth Element\\". Holm's vast experience and acting prowess made him the perfect choice to play the older Bilbo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings film series, also directed by Peter Jackson and adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien's epic novels. In \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\" (2001), \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" (2002), and \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\" (2003), Holm's portrayal of Bilbo Baggins is critical to the audience's understanding of the character both in his interactions with Frodo Baggins (played by Elijah Wood) and Gandalf the Grey (played by Sir Ian McKellen). Additionally, Ian Holm made a brief appearance as the older Bilbo Baggins in two of the films in The Hobbit trilogy, reconnecting the character to the earlier adventures. In conclusion, two talented actors, Martin Freeman and Ian Holm, portrayed Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's iconic stories. Freeman masterfully captured the essence of a younger Bilbo in The Hobbit trilogy, while Holm's portrayal of an older Bilbo in The Lord of the Rings series brought depth and a sense of history to the character."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ada has collapsed and a doctor claims it is best she not be moved. It turns out to be a diabolical scheme by Elcott to sell off the artwork of Mrs. Herries and everything else of value she owns while holding her and her housemaid Rose captive in their bedrooms. Elcott's accomplices, Mr. and Mrs. Edwards, take over as the butler and maid. Elcott masquerades as the lady's nephew, come to take care of her affairs due to a sudden mental breakdown.

Logic test: Avery rides his bike through two puddles. When he rides his bike through the mud puddle, his bike moves very slowly. When he rides his bike through the rain puddle, his bike speeds up. The bike slows down in the mud puddle because there is (A) less friction. (B) more friction Answer:","completion":"The answer your students should choose is (B) more friction. To explain this in detail, we need to understand the concept of friction and how it influences a bike's movement through different types of puddles. Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion of two surfaces that are in contact with each other. In the context of this test, riding a bike through the puddles involves the interaction between the bike's tires and the surface they are riding over, be it a rain puddle or a mud puddle. When Avery rides his bike through a rain puddle, the interaction between the tires and the wet surface is relatively smoother, resulting in less resistance from friction. The reduced friction occurring due to the water enables the bike to move more easily and therefore, speeds up. On the other hand, when he rides his bike through a mud puddle, the interaction between the bike's tires and the more viscous and irregular surface of the mud creates higher friction. Mud, being thicker than water, causes an increase in resistance, which opposes the motion of the bike and slows it down. In summary, the bike moves slowly through the mud puddle because there is more friction, whereas it speeds up in the rain puddle due to less friction. Therefore, the answer to the logic test is (B) more friction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

When asked Thursday about the presidential contender while returning from a six-day visit to Mexico, he responded, \\"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\\" reports the New York Times. That appears to refer to Trump's promise to build a border wall between Mexico and the US (and make Mexico pay for it). The pope wouldn't weigh in on whether Americans should vote for Trump, though: \\"I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that [about the wall]. We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.\\" Trump responded quickly, notes Politico: \\"For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian and as president I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened.\\" Trump also noted that \\"If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS’ ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all-talk, no-action politicians.\\" He said Mexico must have been talking disparagingly about him and using the pope as a \\"pawn\\" because \\"they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them.\\" He also responded at a South Carolina rally, and made sure to note that \\"I like the pope.\\" In other news, during his news conference on the papal jet, Pope Francis also appeared to suggest Catholic women could use contraception if there is a concern of contracting the Zika virus, CNN reports. But abortion is still totally off the table in such a case, he said. Article:","completion":"The Latest Trump Tussle: Pope Francis on Trump's Christianity In a world where controversies make headlines, one name stands out - Donald Trump. The potential Republican nominee for the President of the United States has taken on numerous influential people and organizations over the past months. The back-and-forth exchanges between Trump and his rivals seem to be a never-ending parade of accusations, rebuttals, and goading. This time, it’s Pope Francis who has taken on the media mogul turned political powerhouse. On Thursday, while returning from his six-day visit to Mexico, Pope Francis was asked about Trump. Offering his thoughts on Trump's Christianity, he stated, \\"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” the New York Times reported. This comment nodding at Trump's highly debated border-wall proposal, which involves the construction of a wall between Mexico and the U.S., with Mexico footing the bill. Despite providing criticism, Pope Francis did not explicitly encourage or discourage the American public from voting for Trump. He went on to say, \\"I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that [about the wall]. We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.\\" As expected from Trump's modus operandi, he did not stay silent for long. He fired back at the Pope's comments through Politico saying, \\"For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian, and as president, I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened.\\" Furthermore, Trump boldly challenged the Pope by saying that if ISIS ever attacked the Vatican, Pope Francis would wish he had been president because it would not have taken place, insinuating that Trump's handling of ISIS would be more effective than the current administration's strategies. Trump continued his rebuttal by suggesting that Mexico must have spoken disparagingly about him and roped Pope Francis into the conversation in an attempt to manipulate him as a \\"pawn.\\" Trump accused Mexico, saying \\"they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them.\\" Remaining true to form, Trump took advantage of the opportunity to address the matter publicly at a rally in South Carolina, where he reiterated his views and managed to slip in that \\"I like the Pope.\\" Simultaneously, in his news conference on the papal jet, Pope Francis offered his opinion on the use of contraception in relation to the Zika virus. The Pope clarified that Catholic women could use contraception to avoid complications due to the virus. However, he stood firm on the Church's outspoken stance against abortion, insisting that it remains completely off the table in such cases. In the midst of a heated political climate, this exchange between two influential figures on opposing ends of the spectrum raises questions, generates debates, and adds yet another headline-grabbing controversy to Trump's portfolio. How this impacts Trump's campaign remains to be seen, as well as whether or not he will continue confronting religious institutions in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:You are given a new situation: While drinking coffee John added some sugar and cream in his coffee. He started to ponder how solutes dissolve in a solvent. To that end, he added solutes in a solvent in six different conditions, case A, case B, case C, case D, case E, and case F. In case A he stirred the solution, but in case B he didn't stir the the solution. In case C he heat the solution up, but in case D he cooled the solution down. In case E he used finely ground solute, but in case F he used cubes of solute. and a hint : When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs Please answer this question : In which case the solute would have larger surface area, case E or case F? A:","completion":"In case E, the solute would have a larger surface area. This is because the solute is finely ground, which increases its overall surface area that comes into contact with the solvent. Case F uses cubes of solute, which have a smaller surface area in comparison to the finely ground solute in case E. Greater surface area allows for faster dissolution as more solute particles are exposed to the solvent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Process: - An owl leaves his nest - The owl flys out into the night - The owl looks down at the ground - The owls keen eyesight allows him to see in the dark - The owls sensitive hearing allows him to locate hidden prey - The owl swoops down - The owl catches a mouse in his talons. suppose there are more predators happens, how will it affect the owls will have less to eat. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in this scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process. When more predators are introduced into the owl's environment, it results in increased competition for the same resources, specifically prey like mice. This increased competition means that there are fewer available prey for the owls, and as a result, the owls will have less to eat. This perturbation is indirect because it does not directly influence any specific step in the process of the owl catching a mouse. Instead, it affects the overall availability of prey in the owl's environment. The process itself - the owl leaving its nest, flying out into the night, locating its prey, swooping down, and catching a mouse in its talons - remains the same. However, the chances of the owl successfully finding and catching a mouse are reduced due to the presence of more predators competing for the same food sources. The net effect of this indirect perturbation is that the owls may need to expend more energy and time to find and catch prey, which could impact their overall health and ability to reproduce. Ultimately, this could lead to changes in the owl population if the increased competition for resources persists over time and affects the survival and reproductive success of the owls."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to English","completion":"Indeed, we are currently discussing how we can intervene to help more countries in the European Union that are facing difficulties. As we know, the European Union (EU) consists of 27 member countries with diverse cultures, economic development levels, and challenges. In recent years, several EU countries have experienced economic and social difficulties, such as high unemployment rates, political instability, and migration crises. To intervene and help these struggling EU countries, several possible measures can be taken, including: 1. Financial aid: The EU could provide financial assistance to countries in need by increasing their budget allocations or granting them low-interest loans. This would help in enhancing infrastructure, creating jobs, and strengthening the overall economy of the recipient countries. 2. Structural reforms: Encouraging and assisting countries to implement structural reforms can significantly help in tackling economic problems. This may include labor market reforms to reduce unemployment, education and training programs to enhance workers' skills, and improvements in the regulatory framework for businesses to promote growth and competitiveness. 3. Social policies: The EU can also support social policies aimed at reducing poverty, inequality, and social exclusion in countries facing difficulties. This may involve funding health, education, and social protection programs to improve citizens' well-being and quality of life. 4. Investment incentives: Promoting and incentivizing investments in struggling countries, both by EU institutions and the private sector, can help boost economic development and growth. This can be achieved through measures such as tax breaks, streamlined regulations, and financial support for innovation and startups. 5. Migration management: Addressing migration-related issues, such as facilitating the integration of refugees and asylum seekers, can help alleviate social and economic pressures on some EU countries. Moreover, promoting fair burden-sharing among all member states and supporting border control measures can further assist in managing migration crises. 6. Strengthening the Eurozone: Ensuring the stability and resilience of the Eurozone is crucial for the economic well-being of all EU countries, particularly those facing difficulties. This can be attained through proper fiscal discipline, economic governance reforms, and coordinated monetary policies. 7. Political dialogue and cooperation: Enhancing political dialogue and cooperation among EU countries can help identify common challenges and develop joint strategies to address them. This includes fostering trust and solidarity between member states, sharing best practices and experiences, and adopting a more cohesive and unified approach in addressing various problems. Overall, the European Union must carefully assess the unique challenges faced by each of its struggling member countries and tailor its intervention measures accordingly. By providing appropriate support, the EU can help these countries overcome their difficulties, promote social and economic cohesion, and strengthen the European project as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: What will Lee want to do next? Possible answers: clean up the mess, make a lot of food for lunch, make a romantic gesture","completion":"Based on the context, it is likely that the next thing Lee will want to do is clean up the mess. This is the most probable next step because they've just finished cooking a large breakfast and usually, after preparing and having a meal, it's necessary to clean up the kitchen and dining area in order to maintain cleanliness and hygiene. This will involve washing the dishes, utensils, and pans used for cooking pancakes and bacon; cleaning the countertop, stove, and other areas where food might have splattered; and throwing away any scraps or empty packaging. Cleaning up promptly after a meal also prevents attracting pests like ants or cockroaches. The idea of making a lot of food for lunch would be a less likely follow-up activity because they've just finished a large breakfast. It would be too soon to immediately start preparing another huge meal, especially if there are still leftovers from breakfast. Most importantly, they would not want to keep their kitchen messy until lunch if they plan to use it again for cooking. As for making a romantic gesture, while it is possible considering that they made a breakfast surprise for their significant other, it's not the most likely next step immediately after finishing breakfast. There's no explicit clue in the context suggestive of an immediately following romantic gesture. However, this could still happen later in the day, perhaps after cleaning up or relaxing for a bit, especially if the breakfast surprise was part of a larger plan for a romantic day or occasion. They might want to present a bouquet of flowers, plan a surprise outing, or perhaps prepare a movie night at home. Finally, remember that Lee’s actions will depend on their personal habits, the dynamics in their relationship with their significant other, and how they generally allocate their time but based on the content given and under usual circumstances, cleaning up the mess from a large, surprise breakfast would be the most probable next step."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The traffic was moving at 5 mph on the freeway where it usually requires at least 60 mph. The road is very slippery. Sometimes the car is out of control, slipping to the other side. I finally managed to drive to the Issaquah. However, I still got stuck in the traffic on an uphill way to my home. Why I lived in the house on the top of the hill? I had no choice but left my car in the road. Fortunately, there was a nice guy coming to help me drive the car to the parking lot so that I would not get a ticket from the policeman. When he first opened my car door and asked me if I needed any help, I thought I saw an angle. No kidding, I was totally frustrated at that moment until I saw the guy. After waiting in the parking lot for almost 3 hours, my husband's cousin finally managed to come to \\"rescue\\" me by his four-wheel drive car and sent me to my in-laws' home because the road to my house was closed. When I got to my bed in the end, it was over midnight. I spent almost 5 hours outside instead of 20 minutes as usual.

It leans towards being negative, as it portrays the subject as not being an optional preference. 2. \\"as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room\\": Comparing the subject to a dentist's waiting room suggests it is dull and uninteresting. Dentist waiting rooms are associated with a lack of visual excitement. This part of the sentence is negative. 3. \\"complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms\\": This segment describes the subject as having calming, but predictable background music and a narrative that follows standard patterns. This can be interpreted as a combination of mildly positive (soothing) and negative (predictable) aspects.

Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.

Q: The sudden burst of spring produce in the market after a long, monotonous winter of cavolo nero and bright oranges is one of the things that constantly reminds me why I love living and eating in Italy. A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn’t such a common sight at the market in Florence. It still isn’t, in that you won’t get them by the crateful like you do fava beans and artichokes, though they’re not particularly difficult to find now. They’re just one of those special things that don’t last long. Blink and you’ll miss them, or come late to the market and they could easily be sold out. It’s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course). If you’ve never tasted agretti before, it’s worth seeking out if you’re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu.

A. underage B. banned C. adult D. rules E. black market The best answer is A:","completion":"The best answer is A. underage. In most cases, someone is not allowed to buy alcohol if they are underage. The legal drinking age varies from country to country, but it is generally considered to be somewhere between 18 and 21 years old. The primary goal of legal drinking age restrictions is to prevent alcohol-related problems such as binge drinking, underage driving under the influence, and alcohol dependency in young people. These age requirements apply not only when purchasing alcohol but also when consuming it in public places and private establishments, like bars and restaurants. Option B, \\"banned,\\" could also be a reason someone is not legally allowed to buy alcohol. However, this is a more specific and rare situation and typically applies to individuals who have been banned from a specific establishment or have had their license revoked due to previous legal issues involving alcohol. In this case, the reason for the ban would primarily be due to the person's previous actions and not their age, making option A still more fitting. Option C, \\"adult,\\" is not a reason for someone to be unable to buy alcohol legally. Being an adult typically signifies that a person has attained the required legal age to drink and purchase alcohol in most countries. Option D, \\"rules,\\" is quite vague and does not provide a concrete reason why someone might not be allowed to buy alcohol. While rules and regulations do play a part in determining the legal drinking age and other alcohol-related restrictions, this answer choice is not as accurate or specific as option A, \\"underage.\\" Option E, \\"black market,\\" refers to the illegal trade of goods and services, and it does not indicate why someone might not be allowed to buy alcohol legally. The black market could be a place where someone who is underage or banned might unlawfully acquire alcohol, but it does not provide a direct reason for their inability to purchase alcohol legally. In conclusion, the most relevant and accurate answer to the question is A. underage, as it directly addresses the primary reason someone may be unable to legally buy alcohol—that is, not having reached the required legal drinking age as established by the local laws."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the region that supports supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp industry? is inside the article: Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds.

The creatures don't live longer than a few minutes but Dr. Ren has been able to create Frankenstein-like mice with heads that are a different colour from their bodies. Now he wants to begin chopping up monkeys in order to get closer to an actual human head transplant. According to the WSJ, which shadowed the surgeon during a 10-hour transplant operation, he is “hoping to create the first head-transplanted primate that can live and breathe on its own, at least for a little while.” Xiaoping Ren Xiaoping Ren has performed head transplants on over 1000 mice Animal rights organisations have blasted the Chinese doctor and his methods. \\"It is deeply disturbing that a researcher has been allowed to subject more than 1,000 mice to these cruel and medically absurd experiments,\\" a spokesperson for Animal Aid told Mirror Online. \\"There is no way in which a surgical procedure that allows a mouse, or even a monkey, to survive for a few minutes is likely to translate into concrete benefits for human patients,\\" they said. \\"Even if the surgery was developed so that mice or primates were kept alive for longer, fundamental differences between species mean there is no guarantee that humans would experience the same results. \\"If individual people want to volunteer to participate in such research, then they are free to make an informed decision, but animals should not be forced to suffer in these pointless and macabre experiments.\\" Experts meanwhile have likewise branded the work ridiculous - citing that human head transplants are controversial and a long way from being medically possible. They could offer a new life for paralysed or quadriplegic patients, but the ethics of the procedure are incredibly complex. Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Centre said the bodies of head transplant patients “would end up being overwhelmed with different pathways and chemistry than they are used to and they’d go crazy.” He added: “It’s not like you can unscrew your head and put it on someone else.” Dr Hunt Batjer, president elect of the American Association for Neurological Surgeons, added: “I would not wish this on anyone. “I would not allow anyone to do it to me as there are a lot of things worse than death.” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Chinese surgeon Xiaoping Ren has performed over 1,000 head transplants on mice and is now looking to proceed with monkeys to get closer to performing a human head transplant.

Malcolm, in an attempt to capture Russian gang member Chirkoff, uses an informant named Canetti to deliver a flash drive to the gang, while Trent attempts to ambush Malcolm on the job.

Answer this question: where do you go to get a patent??","completion":"To get a patent, you must go through a multi-step process that involves research, application submission, and examination by a governmental patent office. Patents are territorial, meaning that you need to register your invention in each country where you want to secure protection for it. I'll explain the process to obtain a patent in the United States, followed by an overview of how to obtain international patents. 1. United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO): In the United States, the process of obtaining a patent is managed by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Here is a step-by-step guide for applying for a patent with the USPTO: A. Conduct a Prior Art Search: Before applying for a patent, you should conduct a thorough search for any existing patents, published patent applications, or other public disclosures that could be similar to your invention. The purpose of this search is to determine if your invention is new and non-obvious compared to existing technology. You can conduct a preliminary search through the USPTO's Patent Database (patft.uspto.gov), as well as other patent offices' databases, such as the European Patent Office and the Japan Patent Office. B. Determine Patent Eligibility: Evaluate whether your invention meets the patent eligibility requirements, which include being novel, non-obvious, and useful. It's important to note that not all inventions can be patented, such as abstract ideas, natural phenomena, and laws of nature. C. Prepare Your Patent Application: A patent application typically includes a specification, which is a detailed description of the invention that enables a person skilled in the field to reproduce the invention; claims, which define the scope of the invention; and drawings, if necessary, to illustrate the concept of the invention. D. File Your Patent Application: Submit your application to the USPTO along with the required filing fees. The USPTO offers two types of applications: a provisional application and a nonprovisional application. A provisional application provides an early filing date and can be less expensive than a nonprovisional application. However, it does not grant patent rights and expires after 12 months, requiring you to file a nonprovisional application to pursue patent protection. A nonprovisional application initiates the formal patent examination process. E. Examination Process: After the patent application is filed, it will be assigned to a patent examiner. The examiner will review the application to determine whether it meets all the legal requirements for patentability. There may be an exchange of correspondence between the applicant and the examiner during the examination process to address any issues that the examiner identifies. This back-and-forth communication is known as patent prosecution. F. Patent Grant: If the examiner concludes that your invention meets the patentability requirements, your patent will be granted. Once granted, the inventor has the exclusive right to make, use, sell, and import the invention in the United States for a specified duration (usually 20 years from the filing date for utility patents). 2. International Patents: If you wish to obtain patent protection in other countries, you can either file separate patent applications in each country or file an international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). The PCT is administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and allows you to file a single international application that can be pursued in up to 153 PCT contracting countries. A. PCT Application Process: The PCT application process typically comprises an international phase and a national phase. During the international phase, a single application is prepared and filed with a Receiving Office (RO), which then forwards the application to the International Searching Authority (ISA) to perform an international search. The ISA issues an international search report, which can help applicants evaluate the patentability of their inventions before entering the national phase in individual countries. B. National Phase: After the international phase, you must enter the national phase in each country where you want to seek protection. This involves filing national applications with each country's respective patent office, paying fees, and undergoing the individual examination processes according to each country's national patent laws. C. European Patent Application: If you want to obtain patent protection in multiple European countries, you can choose to submit a European patent application to the European Patent Office (EPO). After a successful examination and grant of a European patent, you must then validate the granted patent in each European country where you seek protection. In conclusion, the process of obtaining a patent involves conducting thorough research, determining eligibility, preparing and filing an application, and going through the examination process. The specific steps and requirements may vary depending on the country where you are applying for a patent."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Calling his former deputy a \\"liar with extremely bad character,\\" fallen high-flying politician Bo Xilai on Sunday rebutted the testimony of the prosecution's star witness as his increasingly dramatic trial stretched into a fourth day. The former Communist Party chief of the sprawling southwestern metropolis of Chongqing has denied abusing his power -- the third and final charge being heard in court in Jinan, eastern China, long after he was stripped of his posts and expelled from the party. Prosecutors accuse Bo of threatening and improperly firing his former police chief Wang Lijun after learning about a murder investigation involving Bo's wife Gu Kailai, who is currently serving a suspended death sentence for killing British businessman Neil Heywood. On Sunday, Bo insisted that Wang was lying throughout his court appearance, and said his words lacked any credibility or legal standing. Wang took the witness stand Saturday, providing the first opportunity for the two former allies to confront each other since Wang's attempted defection to the United States in early February 2012. Analysis: How, why Chinese politician veered off script. Wang told the court he fled to the U.S. consulate in Chengdu because he feared for his safety following a tense encounter in Bo's office, just one day after Wang told Bo about his wife's suspected involvement in murder. \\"He started verbally assaulting me... and about three minutes later, he walked around the left side of his desk and stood in front me. He suddenly attacked me with his fist, hitting on my left ear -- it was not just a slap,\\" Wang recalled, according to a court transcript. On Sunday, Bo said: \\"He said I didn't just slap him but punched him. I never practiced martial arts -- I don't possess such striking power,\\" according to a transcript released by the Jinan Intermediate People's court. Bo added: \\"After being convicted for abuse of power and defection, he still argued that he didn't defect but engaged in diplomacy in accordance with regulations. \\"All this shows this man has extremely bad character and lies on the spot.\\" The trial was adjourned after the Sunday morning session and will resume Monday morning. During trial, Xilai keeps up his counterattack. The story behind the 'slap' On Saturday, Bo conceded he had made mistakes but denied he broke the law to protect his wife. \\"I have made mistakes. I feel regret and I'm willing to take responsibility,\\" Bo said. \\"But whether or not I've committed a crime is a different issue.\\" \\"I didn't bend the law to protect Gu Kailai,\\" he said. \\"I didn't force Wang Lijun out or force him to defect to the United States.\\" Bo did acknowledge slapping Wang in the face -- a key moment long considered a turning point in the two men's relationship -- during the office confrontation, claiming he believed Wang was trumping up charges against Gu and thus furious at his \\"double-faced\\" deputy who had faked his loyalty to the Bo family. According to a court transcript, Wang said it was more than a slap and that the blow had caused a \\"discharge\\" from his ear. \\"My body shook a little... and I found blood at the corner of my mouth and discharge in my ear,\\" he continued. \\"I wiped the blood off with a tissue, but when he heard me calmly tell him again that he had to face the reality, he threw a glass on the ground while saying 'I'll never accept it.'\\" Wang told prosecutors that Bo's physical violence against him as well as the disappearance of his aides and investigators led to his decision to seek refuge in the U.S. diplomatic mission in Chengdu. When Bo was allowed to question the witness, Wang revealed in an exchange that Gu had told him about her intention to kill a day before the murder. And when Bo asked Wang: \\"Did you think I was forcing you out in an attempt to cover up (my wife's murder) case?\\" Wang replied: \\"Yes.\\" The trial by social media. Embezzlement and corruption charges. Earlier Saturday, Bo kept up his vigorous defense against embezzlement charges and, as he did Friday on corruption charges, and dismissed testimony from his jailed wife as a desperate attempt to reduce her own sentencing. Gu was sentenced last August for killing Heywood in a Chongqing hotel room in November 2011. She gave her testimony to the court via video and said that Bo was well aware of multi-million dollar dealings to fund their and their younger son's jet-setting lifestyle. \\"I have feelings for Gu Kailai,\\" Bo said Saturday morning, after admitting to an extramarital affair. \\"She is a vulnerable woman... and who else could she turn in? That's why all accusations against me originated from her.\\" Prosecutors allege that Bo received five million renminbi (820,000) of public funds from a local urban planning official in Dalian, Liaoning Province, in the early 2000s when he was mayor and later the provincial governor. Bo slammed the allegations as \\"contradictory\\" and denied that he needed to take the money as his wife earned millions of dollars from her five law firms. Under the bribery indictment, prosecutors accuse Bo of using his political posts to secure influence for others. They say that between 2000 and 2012, Bo, Gu and their son, Bo Guagua, received about 22 million renminbi (3.6 million) in bribes from businessmen in Dalian. Bo Guagua hopes father can 'answer his critics' Bo's fall from grace. Bo is a princeling, a term that refers to the children of revolutionary veterans who boast of political connections and influence. His late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Chairman Mao Zedong and the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Over the past three decades, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policy-making body of the Communist Party. A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo -- with the help of Wang -- was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing. Bo's glittering career, in which he drew admirers and detractors for his populist policies, fell apart last year amid a scandal involving murder, corruption and betrayal. Wang's attempted defection precipitated Bo's political demise. After Gu's sentencing last August, Wang was convicted of bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking. He received a 15-year prison sentence. Bo's trial is seen as a potentially concluding chapter in the scandal. His high profile and connections among the nation's ruling elite have made his case -- with its tales of greed and wrongdoing by a top official and his family -- an extremely delicate matter for Chinese authorities. It's taken more than a year, during which time the Communist Party has undergone a major leadership change, to bring him to trial. Many observers had expected proceedings to stick closely to a pre-planned script, seeing the trial's outcome as the result of a political deal struck between Bo and China's top leaders. But as he often did in his political career, Bo has so far stolen the show, mounting a robust attack on the prosecution's case and ridiculing witness testimony. That has left China watchers trying to figure out how far he's veered off script. Journalists from the international news media haven't been allowed inside the courtroom. But the court's official microblog account has delivered updates on developments inside, attracting more than half a million followers on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service. CNN hasn't been able to verify how accurate and comprehensive the court's version of proceedings has been. But many observers have interpreted it as a reasonably close, albeit filtered, account.

Title: Kissing Jessica Stein Movie plot: Twenty-eight-year-old Jessica Stein, a copyeditor living and working in New York City, is plagued by failed blind dates with men, and decides to answer a newspaper's personal advertisement containing a quote from Rilke that she had read and admired earlier. The advertisement has been placed by Helen Cooper, a thirtysomething bisexual art gallerist who is seeking a lesbian relationship to replace her unsatisfying and meaningless sex with men. Given some of the men Jessica is shown to be test-dating at the start of the film, it's no surprise she'd want to fan out her prospects a little. As nervous as Jessica is about dating Helen, she realizes after a surprise kiss that a different experience can be good. Through the early part of their relationship, Jessica finds in Helen everything she'd dreamed of finding in a man. They are compatible, they like many of the same things, and they are caring for one another. Even when Helen gets sickâwhich she says earlier in the film never happens to herâJessica is there to care for her. The only predicament for the relationship is Jessica's nervousness concerning same-sex intimacy. Over the early weeks of their relationship, she and Helen slowly work on building up her confidence in this area by gradually extended make-out sessions. Eventually, they graduate to full intimacy, which is initiated by Jessica during an over night stay at her parents' home in Scarsdale. In spite of Jessica's happiness with Helen, she keeps the relationship secret. Jessica's secrecy means that she has to endure scenes that would not happen had she been open about the two of them. One example occurs during a dinner to celebrate her brother's engagement. Her mother had invited an IBM executive in hopes of setting him up with Jessica. Helen and Jessica later get into a quarrel about Jessica's refusal to inform her family of their relationship, resulting in an apparent breakup. It isn't until later, as her brother's wedding approaches, that her mother figures out that they are dating. Her mother...

I am an avid reader who has read--and enjoyed--nearly every Oprah pick. However, I can't understand how this book was chosen. The first half of the book trudged along, while the second half was completely unbelievable. When I finally realized that Hannah's true \\"secret\\" was that she couldn't read, I thought, \\"So What?\\" I think the main problem was that the characters were so two-dimensional that it was difficult to care about their dilemmas.

Some people believe that they can't help putting on hold that if they stop exercising, their muscles will turn into fat. Here are some more myths: false ideas about being fat and doing weight as they get older, while others I'll never lose weightI come from a fat family Wrong! While we can't change the body type we are bom with, we can't blame our genes for making us fat. There's plenty of evidence that fatness runs in families, and the main reason is that they share the same habits of eating too much and exercising too little. I am fat because I burn calories slowly Wrong! Fatness is not caused by a slow metabolism . In fact, although fat people consume more energy than slim people,they also fail to realize how much they eat! Keeping a diary can help you work out your daily food intake more accurately.

Sentence from a movie review: a shallow rumination Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the sentence from the movie review, which reads \\"a shallow rumination,\\" we can infer that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer. The term \\"shallow\\" suggests that the movie lacked depth or substance, while \\"rumination\\" implies that it may have been an attempt at provoking deeper thought or reflection. Combining these two words, it is evident that the reviewer found the movie's attempt at exploring thought-provoking themes to be superficial and unimpressive. It is important to consider that a single sentence might not fully represent the reviewer’s overall opinion about the movie. A complete movie review usually contains an analysis of different aspects of the film, such as its plot, characters, cinematography, soundtrack, and more. So, while this sentence indicates a negative aspect of the movie, it is possible that the reviewer may have positive opinions about other elements of the film. These could include praising the performance of the actors, enjoying the visual aesthetics, or appreciating the film's attempt to tackle a specific issue, despite its failings in developing a deeper understanding of the subject. However, without further context or information about the movie or the rest of the review, it is difficult to ascertain the reviewer's complete stance on the film. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the reviewer's opinion, it would be beneficial to read the entire review, as this would provide additional insights on the movie from their perspective. In conclusion, based solely on the sentence \\"a shallow rumination,\\" it can be inferred that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer in terms of its depth and substance. However, to gauge the reviewer's overall opinion about the film, it is important to consider the complete review and evaluate the critiques on other aspects of the movie as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: A mother has a rare brain disorder which she claims causes her to take off her clothes in public – and says the condition is 'ruining her life'. Leanne Lyon, 41, has a small non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day, each lasting up to half an hour. She blacks out during the fits - which have a strange and embarrassing side-effect - they often cause her to strip down to her underwear. They also sometimes leave her incontinent, meaning she is at risk of wetting herself publicly. Mrs Lyon says while the condition may seem amusing to onlookers, it is highly debilitating as she cannot hold down a job and struggles to raise her two young children. Leanne Lyon, 41, has a small, non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day. These episodes can cause her to strip off in public, she claims. Mrs Lyon has a hypothalamic hamartoma, which is thought to affect only one in a million people. She says the condition is 'ruining her life' as she hates having seizures in front of her children: Megan, 6 (left) and Kieran, 9 (right) and feels as though she can't always look after them properly. She relies on a carer to take her two children Kieran, nine, and Megan, six, to school and is heavily dependent on her husband David, 43, a shoe salesman. Mrs Lyon, of Northampton, said she doesn't strip every time she has a seizure, but it does happen around twice a month. She said: 'I have no idea what I'm doing during the fits - it's almost like I'm sleep-walking and it's led to some really embarrassing episodes. 'Once, I was shopping in Wilkinsons when I suffered a seizure and I began stripping in the aisles. When I came round, I was in nothing but my underwear.' She added: 'Because I black out during the seizures I can never remember what happened - I simply come round with no clothes on. 'I'm sure it might look funny to some strangers but the condition is ruining my life. 'The same thing happened at a taxi rank. 'It's mortifying and frankly I'm amazed nobody has called the police to report me for indecent exposure.' Mrs Lyon has had seizures since she was four years old. Medics were baffled by her condition until she was diagnosed with hypothalamic hamartoma at the age of 29. The condition is a small, non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, blackouts and memory loss. It is thought to affect only one individual in every one million people. At 17, she had surgery to remove part of her brain and rid her of the tumour. But the procedure, a left temporal lobectomy, only made the condition worse. Now Mrs Lyon has five or more episodes a day. While some last for a few seconds, others can go on for half an hour. When she was 17, Mrs Lyons had a part of her brain removed in order to remove the tumour. But the procedure, a left temporal lobectomy, only made the condition worse. Hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) is a small, non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, behavioural problems, blackouts and memory loss. The condition is thought to affect only one in a million people. HH is often difficult to diagnose and even more difficult to treat. Some individuals can go years with very few symptoms, or ones that are so mild, they are often missed by both parents and medical professionals. However, for most people with HH, the most common symptoms are frequent daily 'gelastic' seizures (seizures which involve spontaneous laughing, giggling or smirking) or 'dacrystic' seizures (which involve crying or grunting). People with HH report behavioural difficulties, and some have been diagnosed with attention deficit behavior (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger’s disorder, depression, paranoid disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some have significant difficulties controlling angry outbursts, aggressive tendencies and many have been described as having oppositional-defiant disorder. These angry outbursts are often referred to as hypothalamic rages. What makes the actions different from a genuine angry ouburst is that the person typically does not make eye contact or the eyes seem vacant, they initially may not be able to hear any commands and they often require time and space to calm down. Sometimes they have no memory of the rage once it is over. These symptoms often start early in life – for some, they become apparent shortly after birth, but are frequently misdiagnosed. They are most commonly treated by surgery or anti-epileptic medicine. Source: Hope for HH. Mrs Lyon said: 'It's terrifying - not to mention dangerous - living like this. 'Once, I got onto a bus during a blackout and when I came round I had no idea where I was. 'I also am often incontinent when I have my seizures, which is excruciating. I had to wear adult nappies for a while. 'I can't go out for a night out with friends because I'm terrified I might have an episode. 'It would be really embarrassing to have to go home early because I wet myself or started stripping at the bar.' Mrs Lyon also suffers from embarrassing episodes at home. She said: 'A few months ago I was folding my kids' washing when I had one of my episodes. 'I don't know what I did while I was having my fit but when I came around I had one leg in a pair of my eight-year-old daughter's knickers. 'I frequently walk from room to room in nothing but my underwear with no idea what's going on.' She added: 'My children are more like carers than carefree kids - they've had to grow up so quickly. 'When I start having a fit I usually start laughing. 'When my son sees me laughing he says \\"Mummy's having one of her turns,\\" and he records it on his phone so I can see what happened. 'It is horrible to watch, you can see I'm not quite right. 'I hate to think that my kids have to watch their mother having seizures multiple times a day. 'My devoted husband is incredibly understanding but my condition puts a constant strain on our marriage. 'To him, it must be like living with three children. 'I don't feel like a normal wife or mother. I need help with the school run because I can't be trusted with the kids alone.' Because of the debilitating condition, Mrs Lyon also struggles to hold down a job. The seizures often leave Mrs Lyon incontinent, and she says they are dangerous. Once she had a seizure and got onto a bus and when she 'woke up' she had no idea where she was. She is pictured undergoing tests in hospital with Vivian Gattoc, who founded the Hope for Hypothalamic Hamartoma charity. She says the condition means her children are 'more like carers than carefree kids'. She said: 'I don't feel like a normal wife or mother. I need help with the school run because I can't be trusted with the kids alone.' She is pictured with daughter Megan, 6, (left) and son Kieran, 9, (right) For a brief period she was employed at a supermarket but left after one of her episodes. She said: 'I have no idea what happened but I could tell my colleagues were scared by me afterwards.' Mrs Lyon's rare condition can be treated using keyhole surgery to destroy the tumor. But the procedure is currently only available in the United States and costs £95,000. Mrs Lyon said: 'I'm desperate to find a way to beat this tumour. 'It would mean the world to me if I could just take my kids to the park without needing constant supervision. 'I'm trying to raise money for the expensive procedure in America – one day, I'll beat this and be seizure free.'

Question: For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me.

Viva la revolución: Mexico City cyclists fight for the right to ride in safety Stand on Mexico City’s grand Paseo de la Reforma boulevard on a Sunday morning and you’ll hear gears whirring, bells ringing and the chatter of voices as 50,000 people cycle, scoot and skate along 35 miles of closed roads. Stop and listen on any other day of the week and all you’ll hear is the roar of 10 lanes of traffic. This sprawling megacity of 21 million is home to 5.5m cars, and that number is growing despite some of the worst traffic jams in the world. Residents spend an average of three hours a day commuting, and car speeds during rush hour have fallen to around 7.5mph (12km/h). Although air quality has improved markedly since the city was named the most polluted in the world in the 1980s, walking or cycling along one of its many multi-lane highways sometimes feels as if you are sucking directly on a car exhaust. For one day every week, though, people on bikes and on foot rule a decent stretch of road, for a few hours at least. The official Muévete en Bici (Move by Bike) event has been going since 2008 but was recently expanded to cover 35 miles (55km) of city streets. It’s not just for cyclists: many others jog with baby strollers, or enjoy free zumba classes, martial arts or Mexican wrestling displays. Some might dismiss the weekly car-free morning as a gimmick, but Reforma is also home to wide, protected cycle lanes along both sides, from the historic centre to the green oasis of Chapultepec park in the west. During rush hour these lanes see a constant stream of cyclists in work clothes, many of them using the Ecobici bike hire system – the fourth largest in the world after Huangzhou, Paris and London. It is used mainly by residents getting around the city, rather than by sightseeing tourists, and 37% of users are women. The city now has around 90 miles (150km) of dedicated bike lanes, and environment minister Tanya Müller last week announced two new protected cycle paths will be built along Revolución and Patriotismo avenues by February. A survey showed 4,000 cyclists a day already brave these high-speed, five-lane highways. Sitting in her modern office overlooking the Zócalo – the historic main square, ringed by a six-lane road – Müller says cycling plays a crucial role in her attempts to make the city more sustainable and helps to fight pollution, congestion and obesity. She has expanded the Ecobici network to more than 6,000 bikes at 444 stations, and users can now access the service using an integrated card that also covers the metro, bus rapid transport (BRT) and trolleybuses. In an effort to include the majority of residents who live on the outskirts of the city, the environment ministry has opened a 24-hour 400-space secure cycle parking facility at Pantitlán near the airport in the east, and another is being built in La Raza in the north. The idea is that people can cycle from home to the hub, take public transport into the centre and then use an Ecobici for the “last mile” to work. Another proposed cycle lane along División del Norte has been stalled for years after protests from the plumbing and building suppliers whose shops line the route who are worried it will damage trade. “The scheme is on hold but it will happen,” promises Müller. Trendy cycling cafes and shops are springing up in cooler parts of town like Condesa and Roma, where the pace of the city is slower and drivers are more used to seeing people on bikes, tending to give them more space. The last time an official survey into cycling was completed eight years ago it showed 1% of journeys across the metropolitan area were made by bike. Unofficial estimates now put that at around 2%. Bernardo Baranda of the ITDP, which works to help developing countries improve their transport systems, was one of a group of cyclists who helped start the grassroots Bicitekas organisation in the late 1990s after he returned from a period studying and working in the Netherlands. Inspired by the efforts of Bogotá mayor Enrique Peñalosa, in 1998 the collective started a weekly Paseo Nocturno, a Critical Mass-style ride where a group of cyclists meet up on a weeknight and take a four-hour trip around some of Mexico City’s busiest roads, staying safe through sheer force of numbers. It was revolutionary at the time but now the city hosts an official Paseo every Sunday and a government-organised night ride once a month on closed roads; last month’s for Day of the Dead attracted a record 95,000 cyclists. There are plenty of unofficial night rides, too, run by groups such as Mujeres en Bici and Paseo de Todos, as well as the original Bicitekas ride. A car can jump a red light in front of a police officer and he won’t do anything – the law is flexible in Mexico City Cycling activists galvanised around protests against the Segundo Piso in 2003 – a second tier to the city’s car-choked multi-lane Periférico ringroad – but it wasn’t until the arrival of Marcelo Ebrard as mayor that things began to change. His original 2007 target of 186 miles of cycle paths has still not been achieved, but he and environment minister Martha Delgado started the official Sunday rides, built the bike lane along Reforma and launched Ecobici. There is a feeling among activists that, while Müller and current mayor Miguel Ángel Mancera are working in the right direction, they are nowhere near as radical. Cycling with Baranda on some of the city’s protected cycle lanes it is soon clear that a bike is a quicker way to get around than a car, especially on journeys under three miles (5km). For the most part, concrete and heavy-duty plastic dividers keep the traffic at bay, although when they are replaced by reflectors in the road in the run-up to a junction some drivers simply swing into the bike lane. I soon learn to be incredibly cautious every time the bike lane passes a side road, as cars from behind will happily pull alongside and try to turn right across your path. Venture away from the cycle lanes and it quickly feels more aggressive. Baranda would like to say cycling here is safe, but last year suffered his first serious accident in two decades when he was overtaken by a truck and a ladder poking out of the side caught him on the back of the head. The driver didn’t stop and Baranda spent a month in a neck brace. He’s now back out on his bike. Around 1,200 people are killed on Mexico City’s roads every year. Of these 60% are pedestrians, but it is not clear how many are cyclists. A third of accidents involve speeding cars. Baranda would like to see more protected bike lanes but is hopeful a new traffic law, about to come into force, will make cycling safer. Speed limits are being cut to 30mph (50km/h) on main roads and 20mph (30km/h) on side streets, cyclists will be allowed to proceed through red lights if the way is clear, and the city government will put the needs of pedestrians first, followed by cyclists, then public transport, cargo and finally private cars and motorbikes. But the tougher traffic laws will only work if the police make them work. “You need consequences for bad driving,” says Baranda. “The police need to enforce the law.” That point is echoed by Agustín Martinez, the president of the Bicitekas collective. “Not everyone is studying traffic law like we are – drivers need to be educated and we need enforcement. A car can jump a red light right in front of a traffic police officer and he won’t do anything – the law is very flexible in Mexico City.” Related: Should cyclists be allowed to run red lights? I ask about a white ghost bike I spotted on the way to the Bicitekas HQ. One of the group explains how a young female cyclist was hit by a car and knocked unconscious. When she got up and her boyfriend started remonstrating with the driver, he drove off with the woman clinging to the bonnet, accelerating and swerving until she fell off. She died of her injuries in hospital. The driver was tracked down by police but, says the activist, was freed after a few well-placed bribes: “When he was caught he said, ‘I have money, I have power, nothing will happen’ – he was right.” Martinez is pleased with the new traffic law but disappointed with what he sees as the lack of recent progress. “We have a lot of friends in the city government now and we thought everything would change,” he says. “But it’s hard, their hands are tied. [The city government] is scared of the car lobby, they defend old ideas like cheap gasoline, they are scared of business and they don’t think about the people that live here. It’s all about money.” There’s no doubt that Mexico City is for the most part still a car-orientated city but it is also clear that cycling is in the ascendancy. “It used to be that people saw cycling here as something eccentric or crazy,” says Baranda. “People thought that if you cycled you must be a tree-hugger or not have enough money to get a car, but that’s changed now – now it’s trendy.” What is your experience of cycling in Mexico City, and how could it be improved?

Hari Singh was equally hesitant about acceding to either India or Pakistan, as either would have provoked adverse reactions in parts of his kingdom. He signed a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan and proposed one with India as well, but announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent. However, his rule was opposed by Sheikh Abdullah, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the National Conference, who demanded his abdication.Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared that it would have to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and the valley itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense fighting flagged with the onset of winter, which made much of the state impassable.

Their slogan is “ideas worth spreading.” But the folks at TED – the Technology Entertainment and Design nonprofit behind the TED Talks, beloved by geeks and others interested in novel new ideas – evidently think that some ideas are better left unspread. At least when the ideas in question challenge the conventional wisdom that rich enterpreneurs are the number one job creators. This past March, millionaire tech investor and entrepreneur Nick Hanauer – one of the early backers of Amazon.com – gave a talk at a TED conference in which, among other things, suggested that middle-class consumers, not rich people, are the real job creators – and that because of this rich people should be paying more in taxes. Though the talk drew applause from conference attendees at the time, TED Talk curator Chris Anderson decided it wasn’t worth sharing with the wider world, and refused to post it on TED’s website. His explanation? The talk was “too political” to be posted during an election year, and that “a lot of business managers and entrepreneurs would feel insulted” by some of Hanauer’s arguments. This seems more than a tad disingenuous, since TED generally doesn’t shy away from controversial ideas, and is sometimes so “political” that it invites actual politicians to talk at its conferences. Naturally, the news that TED wouldn’t be posting this talk — and why — ignited a bit of a firestorm on the web after the National Journal reported it on Wednesday, inspiring posts on sites ranging from Geekwire to the International Business Times to the Daily Kos. Someone even set up a petition on Change.org to demand that TED post the talk. But there was really no need for any petition. This being the age of the Internet, Hanauer’s “banned” talk didn’t remain banned for long. The Atlantic published the entire text of the short talk, complete with slides, on its website, and Anderson himself relented, sort of, and posted the video of the talk — though on YouTube, not on the TED site, where it will no doubt get many times the numbers of views that it would have if it had simply been posted on the TED site in the first place, as Anderson himself acknowledges in a blog post explaining his side of the controversy. Watching the talk, the first thing one notices is just how un-incendiary it all is. Hanauer’s basic thesis – that economic growth is driven to a large extent by consumer demand – is familiar to everyone who’s ever taken Econ 101, or regularly watched business news. Here’s Hanauer’s basic thesis: I have started or helped start, dozens of businesses and initially hired lots of people. But if no one could have afforded to buy what we had to sell, my businesses would all have failed and all those jobs would have evaporated. That’s why I can say with confidence that rich people don’t create jobs, nor do businesses, large or small. What does lead to more employment is a “circle of life” like feedback loop between customers and businesses. And only consumers can set in motion this virtuous cycle of increasing demand and hiring. In this sense, an ordinary middle-class consumer is far more of a job creator than a capitalist like me. Indeed, as Hanauer goes on to point out, even when businesses do well, they try their best to not create new jobs – because more jobs means higher labor costs and lower profits. Anyone who’s ever run a business knows that hiring more people is a capitalist’s course of last resort, something we do only when increasing customer demand requires it. In this sense, calling ourselves job creators isn’t just inaccurate, it’s disingenuous. Again, this isn’t a shocking notion. It’s a central fact of the economy. Indeed, the refusal of profitable businesses to start hiring again in earnest is one of the reasons job creation has been so anemic over the past several years. Of course, Hanauer moves from these less-than-earthshattering theses to draw a conclusion that might offend some rich people and/or Republicans. [O]ur current policies are … upside down. When you have a tax system in which most of the exemptions and the lowest rates benefit the richest, all in the name of job creation, all that happens is that the rich get richer. Since 1980, the share of income for the richest Americans has more than tripled while effective tax rates have declined by close to 50%. If it were true that lower tax rates and more wealth for the wealthy would lead to more job creation, then today we would be drowning in jobs. And yet unemployment and under-employment is at record highs. Whatever your stand on the issue, this is certainly a topic worth debating. You would think that TED would want to be part of the conversation. What was this article about?","completion":"This article talks about a TED Talk given by multi-millionaire Nick Hanauer where he discussed income inequality and his belief that middle-class consumers create jobs, not rich people. The TED Talk curator, Chris Anderson, decided not to post this talk on the TED website because he thought it was too political and might insult some people. However, there was a lot of debate on the internet about this decision, and eventually, the talk was published on The Atlantic website and on YouTube. While some people may not agree with Hanauer's opinions, the article suggests it's an important topic that should be discussed and debated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the sentence \\"In other species, the male and female parts are morphologically separated, developing on different flowers.\\" answer the question \\"How are some male and female parts separated for some species?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"In other species, the male and female parts are morphologically separated, developing on different flowers.\\" does provide an answer to the question, \\"How are some male and female parts separated for some species?\\" though it may not be as comprehensive as it could be. To provide a more detailed and long answer, let's start by understanding the concept of floral reproductive structures. Flowering plants, also known as angiosperms, manifest the reproductive structures within their flowers. The flower's purpose is to facilitate the sexual reproduction process through the fusion of sperm from pollen grains with ovules hosting egg cells. These plants exhibit a wide range of diversity in their morphology and arrangements of reproductive parts. In the given sentence, the male and female parts referred to are the stamens and the carpels respectively. Here, the terms \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" are used to describe the parts responsible for the production of male and female sex cells. The stamen, being the male reproductive organ, consists of an anther that produces and releases pollen, and the filament, which supports the anther. The carpellate structure, or carpel, represents the female reproductive organ of a flower. The carpel features the stigma, which captures pollen, the style, which guides the pollen to the ovary that hosts the ovules, where fertilization may occur. Many plant species feature male and female structures within the same flower, which is called a perfect or bisexual flower (monoecious). It is essential to note that each species comes with morphological adaptations to avoid self-pollination and promote genetic diversity. In contrast, some plants have distinct male and female reproductive structures on separate flowers, leading to separation of the sexes. This condition has two possibilities: 1. Dioecious plants: These are plants that bear separate male and female reproductive structures on individual plants. This means one plant exclusively carries male flowers, while the other plant features female flowers. Examples of such plants include hollies (Ilex spp.) and willows (Salix spp.), among others. 2. Monoecious plants with imperfect or unisexual flowers: In this type of plants, separate male and female flowers develop on the same plant. For instance, in corn (Zea mays), tassels that produce pollen appear at the top of the plant, while the silk, which accepts the pollen to reach ovules, grows in clusters along the stalk. Other examples of monoecious species include cucumbers, watermelons, and oaks. Returning to the context of the sentence provided, the separation of the male and female parts is described as morphologically separated, meaning that the distinction lies in the physical structures or the flowers themselves. This separation occurs as plants have evolved various mechanisms to maximize cross-pollination, reproduction success, and genetic diversity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

LaDainian Tomlinson made history by becoming the fastest running back to reach 100 career TDs by doing it in 89 games, eclipsing the mark set by Emmitt Smith and Jim Brown of 93 games. He also continued his march toward beating Shaun Alexander's single-season TD record by scoring 4 TDs to bring his total to 22, just 5 short of tying Alexander's mark. Philip Rivers had a good day as well, throwing 19 of 26 for 222&#160;yards and two TDs, although he did throw two picks including a 31-yard interception return for a TD by Denver cornerback Darrent Williams. The game started out with Tomlinson running it in from 3 yards out to make it 7-0 San Diego. Denver's Mike Bell ran for two TDs in during the 2nd quarter to make it a 14-7 Denver lead at halftime. After the break, Denver continued the scoring with an Jason Elam's 42-yd field goal and Williams INT return to make it a 24-7 lead for Denver. But just like last week against the Bengals, the Chargers wouldn't say die putting together two scoring drives including a 3-yard run by LT, his 100th TD, and a 51-yd pass to LT by Rivers to cut the lead to 24-21 at the end of the third quarter. Elam helped the Broncos' cause by hitting a 38-yd kick to extend the Broncos' lead to 27-21, but that only lasted until Rivers found Vincent Jackson open at the back of the end zone to put the Chargers up 28-27. On the ensuing Broncos drive, Drayton Florence then intercepted Jake Plummer's 4th and 4 pass to give the Bolts terrific field position that set up a 1-yard run by LT to make it 35-27; it was his 4th TD of the night and 102nd of his career. That left Denver 1:14 to try to tie the game. They started that drive from their 3 and made it all the way to the Chargers 32 in part to a personal foul on Chargers defensive end Igor Olshansky, who was ejected for punching Broncos center Tom Nalen. The Broncos' hopes for overtime ended when Plummer was sacked by Shaun Phillips and time ran out, giving San Diego their first win in Denver in 7 years as well as sole position of first place in the AFC West and improved their record to 8-2. How many yards per complete pass did Philip Rivers gain for this game?","completion":"Philip Rivers completed 19 passes for a total of 222 yards. To find out how many yards per complete pass he gained, we can divide the total yards (222) by the number of passes he completed (19). So, 222 yards ÷ 19 passes = 11.68 yards per complete pass.

However, slow cookers provide the perfect solution for those seeking a hands-off approach to cooking while still maintaining the comfort and warmth of a homemade dish. In this article, we'll walk you through a simple, yet scrumptious slow cooker recipe for beef and cheese pasta that the entire family will love. Gather Your Ingredients: To begin, let's take a look at the essential ingredients necessary for this mouthwatering meal. - 1 large onion, chopped - 1 lb ground beef - 1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes - 1 (15 oz) can tomato sauce - 1 tablespoon dried basil - 1 tablespoon dried oregano - 2 teaspoons garlic powder - Salt and pepper, to taste - 8 oz uncooked pasta (such as rotini, penne, or medium shells) - 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese Now that we have everything we need, it's time to start cooking. Step 1: Cook the Onion and Ground Beef Begin by browning the ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat. Make sure to break up any large pieces of meat during the cooking process. Once the beef has reached a brown color, add the chopped onion to the skillet and continue cooking until the onion becomes tender and translucent. This step not only adds flavor to the meat but also ensures that the onion will be thoroughly cooked before adding it to the slow cooker. Step 2: Transfer to the Slow Cooker After the onion and ground beef are cooked, carefully transfer them to the slow cooker. Be sure to drain any excess grease before proceeding to the next step, as this will result in a lighter, healthier dish. Step 3: Add the Remaining Ingredients Next, add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, dried basil, dried oregano, garlic powder, and salt and pepper to taste. Feel free to adjust the seasoning according to your personal preferences. You may also wish to include additional vegetables such as mushrooms, bell peppers, or zucchini. Stir everything together until well combined. Please note that the pasta and cheese should not be added at this point. They will be incorporated later on in the cooking process. Step 4: Cook on Low or High Cover the slow cooker and set it to cook on low for 5 to 8 hours or high for 3 to 4 hours. This flexibility allows you to tailor the cooking time based on your schedule, ensuring a warm and satisfying meal will be waiting for you and your family when you're ready to eat. Step 5: Add the Pasta and Cheese About 15 minutes before serving, add the uncooked pasta to the slow cooker. Stir the pasta into the sauce, making sure it is fully submerged. It's important to add the pasta near the end of the cooking time to prevent it from becoming overly soft and mushy. When you're just about ready to serve, stir in the 1 1/2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese until it is thoroughly melted and incorporated into the sauce. This creamy addition takes the dish to new heights, providing a rich and indulgent texture that is hard to resist. Serving Suggestions: Serve this hearty beef and cheese pasta alongside a crisp green salad and warm garlic bread for a well-rounded and satisfying meal. This dish is perfect for family gatherings, potlucks, or as a weeknight dinner option. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator and make for a deliciously comforting lunch the next day. Conclusion: With the help of a trusty slow cooker, this beef and cheese pasta recipe offers a fuss-free solution to enjoying a delectable, homemade meal. Its savory flavors and satisfying texture make it an instant favorite among adults and children alike. By following the simple steps outlined above, you're sure to impress your friends and family with this comforting, crowd-pleasing dish."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In the late Cretaceous, approximately 100 million years ago and subsequent to the splitting off from Gondwana of conjoined Madagascar and India, the Indian Plate split from Madagascar. It began moving north, at about 20 centimetres (7.9 in) per year, and is believed to have begun colliding with Asia as early as 55 million years ago, in the Eocene epoch of the Cenozoic. However, some authors suggest that the collision between India and Eurasia occurred much later, around 35 million years ago. If the collision occurred between 55 and 50 Mya, the Indian Plate would have covered a distance of 3,000 to 2,000 kilometres (1,900 to 1,200 mi), moving faster than any other known plate. In 2012, paleomagnetic data from the Greater Himalaya was used to propose two collisions to reconcile the discrepancy between the amount of crustal shortening in the Himalaya (~1300 km) and the amount of convergence between India and Asia (~3600 km). These authors propose a continental fragment of northern Gondwana rifted from India, traveled northward, and initiated the \`\`soft collision'' between the Greater Himalaya and Asia at ~50 Ma. This was followed by the \`\`hard collision'' between India and Asia occurred at ~25 Ma. Subduction of the resulting ocean basin that formed between the Greater Himalayan fragment and India explains the apparent discrepancy between the crustal shortening estimates in the Himalaya and paleomagnetic data from India and Asia.

Q:This article: After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time.

After her vacation in Tahiti, instead of using moisturizer, Angela used butter to treat her dry skin because the","completion":"local residents recommended it. According to them, this unconventional method has been passed down through generations and continues to be a trusted remedy. They believed that butter, particularly when used in its purest form, is incredibly moisturizing. Butter is rich in various essential nutrients, like vitamins A, E, and K. It also has a high-fat content which plays a vital role in hydrating the skin. The omega-3 fatty acids present in it were said to help in reducing inflammation and promote skin health. Angela was informed that the application of butter on the skin would lock in moisture, leaving her skin soft and smooth. It was supposedly more effective than commercial moisturizers which often contain chemicals that can potentially damage the skin. The procedure was explained to Angela in detail. After bathing with warm water which opens the skin pores, she needed to gently pat her skin dry. A thin layer of butter was then applied to her skin while it was still slightly damp to help maximize absorption. After leaving it on for about half an hour, the butter was rinsed off with warm water, followed by a cold rinse to close the skin pores. Using a soft cloth, her skin was again gently patted dry. Residents of Tahiti also suggested using different types of butter, like shea or cocoa, which have beneficial properties specifically for the skin. Shea butter, for instance, has a high concentration of fatty acids and vitamins that can soften the skin. It also has anti-inflammatory and healing properties. Cocoa butter, on the other hand, is rich in natural plant compounds called phytochemicals that can improve blood flow to the skin and slow skin aging. Driven by curiosity and the will to try something unique and natural, Angela decided to give it a try. Surprisingly, after using butter, her skin felt deeply moisturized and regenerated, glowing with a new radiance. Though it might seem bizarre to outsiders, this traditional beauty secret of Tahiti offers a unique perspective. It emphasizes the need for simplicity in skincare regimes by using naturally available ingredients. Angela’s experiment was a direct testament to how these natural materials, like butter, have the potential to replace chemically-infused commercial moisturizers, reinstating the power of nature for skincare. Always remember though that everyone's skin is different. What may work for one person might not work for another. People should always do a patch test when trying a new skin treatment, natural or otherwise. If anyone suffers from specific skin conditions or concerns, they should consult with a dermatologist or a professional health care provider before trying out new treatments. So yes, the sentence among other things might reflect how Angela after her vacation in Tahiti, incorporated the traditional wisdom of the locals in her skincare routine by using butter instead of a moisturizer to treat her dry skin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: From bankers to factory staff, employees in the West face a cold _ of losing their jobs as a global recession starts to bite. For colleagues in the East, the pain is more likely to come through a pay cut. Human resource experts say cultural differences explain why Asian companies try harder to preserve jobs in difficult times, which will prevent unemployment and may help Asian economies survive at a time of slowing exports. The East Asian attitude may also make it easier for companies to recover quickly from the economic downturn since they will not need to rehire or train new staff, but build up a more loyal and devoted group. \\"In the Confucian mindset, the right thing to do is to share the burden, which is the sense of collective responsibility. While in the West, it's more about individual survival,\\" said Michael Benoliel, associate professor of organizational behavior at Singapore Management University (SMU). In contrast, local Western companies from General Motors to Goldman Sachs plan to lay off workers by the thousand, but at the Asian units of Western multinationals or western units of Asian groups, job cuts will probably be less severe. Japan's jobless rate was 4 percent in September, up from 3.8 percent in January, while Hong Kong's was flat at 3.4 percent. But US unemployment is expected to have jumped to 6.3 percent last month from below 5 percent in January.

Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo.

The Hj are known for fostering Zen Buddhism and for leading the successful opposition to the Mongol invasions of Japan. Resentment at Hj rule eventually culminated in the overthrow of the clan and the establishment of the Ashikaga shogunate. - Moronao was an iconoclast with no intention of following tradition, particularly insofar as the Emperor was concerned. On the subject, he once said: What is the use of a King? Why should he live in a Palace? And why should we bow to him? If for some reason a King is needed, let us have one made of wood or metal, and let all the live Kings be banished. The Taiheiki, an epic dedicated to the events of this period, describes the K brothers as avid villains. Moronao in particular is accused of violence, greed and lewdness. Because of this reputation, in the \\"bunraku\\" and \\"kabuki\\" play \\"Kanadehon Chshingura\\", which depicts the vendetta of the 47 Ronin, his name is used to represent Kira Yoshinaka. - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia.

In most of this period, the shoguns were the \\"de facto\\" rulers of the country; although nominally they were appointed by the Emperor as a ceremonial formality.

His conflicts with his father - in - law , Yamana Szen , who resented the power Hosokawa had as Kanrei , were among those that ignited the nin War in 1467 . When the Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa had a son in 1464 , Yamana took this as an opportunity to oppose Hosokawa further , supporting the child as heir to the Shogunate . Hosokawa had always worked closely with the Shogun 's brother Ashikaga Yoshimi , and supported his claim to the shogunate . In 1467 , open war broke out in the capital of Kyoto , between Hosokawa and Yamana , who each commanded roughly 80,000 men .

However, by 1464, he was convinced to join his brother, the shogun, and assist him, putting himself into a position to be the next in the line of succession. The birth of the Shogun's son placed Yoshimi in an awkward situation, making his succession no longer definite, but he remained as Yoshimasa's Deputy. - The was a Japanese samurai clan which was one of the most powerful of the Muromachi period (1336-1467); at its peak, members of the family held the position of Constable (\\"shugo\\") over eleven provinces.

Article: The bowl should be large enough for mixing and tossing the ingredients of the salad. Note that any kind of kale will do - some people prefer lacinato (\\"dino kale\\") or flat leaf kale due to the tendency of curly green kale to be sold a bit more mature and therefore tougher. It also has a grittier texture and relative lack of flavor. Shred the kale leaves by hand or chop them up into small strips. For tougher, more mature kale, you may want to shred or chop into smaller pieces as this will help the dressing to soften the texture. Put the chopped or shredded kale into the bowl. You might start by adding a few tablespoons so as not to \\"over-dress\\" the salad. Remember, it's easy to add more dressing, but it's impossible to remove it! Massage the dressing into the kale. The best way to do this is with your hands (or a friend's hands). Note that you should gently squeeze or squish the kale as you mix in the dressing, as this helps break down the cell walls of the leaves and allows the acid in the dressing to soften things up by breaking down cell walls and fibers. Once you have mixed in all the dressing and massaged all the kale in the bowl, taste a bite to see if it has enough dressing for your liking (remember, we'll be adding a few more ingredients too!). If necessary, add more dressing and repeat the massaging and tasting process until you feel the flavors are balanced and delicious. Because kale leaves are so sturdy, they need a little time for the acid in your dressing (lemon juice or vinegar) to break down the leaves and make them softer.

Write a title for this article: Rays second baseman Will Rhymes collapses in the arms of first base coach George Hendrick after being hit by a pitch. TAMPA BAY RAYS 2, BOSTON RED SOX 1 ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - A scary moment came about in Tampa Bay Wednesday, as second baseman Will Rhymes left the Rays' 2-1 win over Boston Wednesday night in the eighth inning after being hit by a pitch near his right elbow. While standing at first base he gestured that he wanted to come out of the game, took a couple of steps and collapsed into the arms of first base coach George Hendrick. Trainers worked on Rhymes in the coach's box before he was assisted to a utility cart and left the field. As for the game, Jeremy Hellickson pitched six solid innings, Luke Scott had a tiebreaking sacrifice fly, and the Tampa Bay Rays beat Boston 2-1, snapping the Red Sox's five-game winning streak. Hellickson (4-0) allowed one run and five hits en route to winning a career-best sixth consecutive decision, dating to Sept. 4. The right-hander struck out six and walked two. After Jake McGee and Joel Peralta both threw a scoreless inning, Fernando Rodney pitched the ninth for his 12th save. Clay Buchholz (4-2) gave up two runs and six hits over five-plus innings for Boston. Buchholz, who took a grounder off his leg during the sixth, had allowed four or more runs in all seven of his previous starts this season. Buchholz was relieved by Andrew Miller, then Matt Albers and then Franklin Morales, who ended up plunking Rhymes. Announcers speculated that Rhymes might have broken the arm on the pitch, leading to him passing out. However, Rays beat writer Marc Topkin, of the Tampa Bay Times, tweeted that Rhymes is OK: #Rays say x-rays negative on Rhymes, has a bruise, is considered day to day. Matt Joyce opened the sixth with an infield single that went off Buchholz's lower leg. He went to third on a single by Carlos Pena. Andrew Miller replaced Buchholz and gave up Scott's sacrifice fly that put Tampa Bay ahead 2-1. The Rays, winners of four straight, loaded the bases with two outs later in the sixth, but Miller struck out Elliot Johnson on a 3-2 pitch. Tampa Bay took a 1-0 lead in the second when Buchholz was called for a balk on a pickoff move to first with runners on the corners and two outs. Pena, who had a leadoff single, scored on the play. The Red Sox wound up with three balks overall. Daniel Nava's fourth-inning RBI single got Boston even at 1-all. Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine said left-hander Felix Doubront, who was hit on the ear by a ball during batting practice Tuesday, was cleared to make his start Thursday. Meanwhile, Boston left-hander Rich Hill left the field after being struck by a ball in batting practice before Wednesday night's game. The team said Hill is OK. Will Rhymes is worked on by trainers after passing out near first base. (Chris O'Meara/AP)","completion":"\\"Will Rhymes' Frightening Collapse Mid-game Overshadows Tampa Bay Rays' Victory Over Boston Red Sox\\" The shocking event of second baseman Will Rhymes' sudden collapse on the field during Tampa Bay Rays' confronting the Boston Red Sox is documented in this article, with Rhymes being the central narrative while still offering detailed coverage of the game's unfolding and eventual results. The event took place on Wednesday, witnessed in Tampa Bay, where Rhymes ironically led the Rays to a 2-1 victory over Boston, but not quite in the way anyone expected. Rhymes, after being hit by a pitch near his right elbow during his turn at the plate, signaled his inability to continue and took a few steps before falling unconscious into the arms of first base coach George Hendrick. Rhymes received immediate medical attention on-field before being carted off. This unsettling event happened during the eighth inning. Despite the alarming incident, the Rays went on to triumph over the Boston Red Sox, putting a halt to their five-game winning streak. Jeremy Hellickson, the Rays' pitcher, performed outstandingly, giving off six solid innings, whilst Luke Scott contributed with a tiebreaking sacrifice fly. Hellickson's exceptional performance is further highlighted by this being his career-best sixth consecutive decision, his track record beginning September of the previous year. Boston's Clay Buchholz didn't fare as well, permitting two runs and six hits over five-plus innings. Notably, Buchholz had to face a grounder that hit his leg in the sixth, proving this game was more challenging physically for the players than most others. Franklin Morales, sent as relief to Buchholz, ended up being responsible for the pitch that hit Rhymes. While there was initial speculation by the announcers that Rhymes could have broken his arm, leading to the fainting spell, an update by Rays beat writer Marc Topkin cleared up concerns, confirming that Rhymes suffered a bruise at worst and that he is expected to be back in action soon. The match's comprehensive coverage also includes mention of Matt Joyce’s sixth-inning infield hit off Buchholz's leg, which resulted in Joyce advancing to third because of a single by Carlos Pena. Other noteworthy incidents involve Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine's statements providing updates about Felix Doubront and Rich Hill who were hit during practice and their readiness to participate in the match. While the Rays enjoyed their fourth consecutive victory even after Rhymes had to exit the field, the evident show-stealer was the triggering event of Rhymes' on-field collapse, a shocking and rare spectacle, leaving fans concerned for his wellbeing. The provided photograph encapsulates the situation aptly, showing Rhymes being worked on by trainers after his collapse, adding a visual narrative to the dramatic incident."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which tetrapod would live shorter, tetA or tetB? John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory. Hint: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the information provided and following Aristotle's theory, tetA is heavier than tetB and has a longer gestation period. According to the theory, lifespan increases with body mass and gestation period. Therefore, tetA lives longer than tetB.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the company that markets pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring? People have used resources on and around the Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971. William R. Muehlberger was one of the geology instructors.Exploratory drilling for geothermal power occurred near the Mono Craters on the south shore of Mono Lake in 1971.

Can I use 110V 60 hz CFL with 220V 50 Hz? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?

I'll explain each specific situation and then answer the final question. 1. 220V Appliance Plugged Into a 110V Socket: When a 220V appliance is plugged into a 110V socket, the electrical current in the appliance will be half of what it's originally designed for. This can result in one of the following scenarios: a. The appliance may not work at all, as it doesn't receive enough power to function. b. The appliance may operate at a slower pace or reduced performance, as it doesn't have the required energy to perform at its optimum level. c. The appliance may undergo potential damage over a prolonged period of use, as it is consistently forced to function below the expected power level. 2. 110V Appliance Plugged Into a 220V Socket: When a 110V appliance is connected to a 220V socket, the appliance will receive double the electrical current it's designed for. This can lead to several consequences: a. The appliance may get damaged instantly, as the excessive voltage can cause overloading and potentially destroy electronic components or the motor. b. There is an increased risk of electric shock or fire, as excessive heat generated from the overloaded components can damage insulation and wiring. c. If the appliance continues to work, it may do so at a faster rate or with increased performance, potentially causing wear and tear on the components and shortening the lifespan of the appliance. 3. Using a 110V 60 Hz CFL with a 220V 50 Hz: A CFL (compact fluorescent light) designed for 110V 60 Hz is intended to function at lower voltage and a different frequency than a 220V 50 Hz power source. Attempting to use a 110V CFL with a 220V source may cause the following situations: a. Immediate damage to the CFL, as the increased voltage may cause the bulb to burn out, the internal electronics to fail, or the ballast to overheat. b. Reduced performance and potentially flickering, as the frequency difference can affect the operation of the CFL and lead to inconsistent light output. c. Shorter lifespan for the CFL, as operating outside of its designed voltage and frequency parameters can reduce its overall durability. Finally, to answer the question if these two questions are paraphrases of each other, my answer would be: (1). No The two questions are not paraphrases since the first question involves the consequences of plugging different voltage appliances into mismatched sockets, while the second question specifically asks about a 110V 60 Hz CFL being used with a 220V 50 Hz power source. Although they both relate to voltage and frequency discrepancies, the scenarios and exact devices being discussed are different."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 1: Preparing for the hike Before embarking on the journey, Mary carefully studies the map and notes the various waypoints, while Lindsey charges her smartphone and downloads the latest offline map. They also pack their backpacks with essentials like water, food, and first-aid kits, which would ensure their survival in the wilderness. Step 2: Setting off on the hike The two friends set off early in the morning to make the most of daylight. Lindsey keeps her GPS at hand, constantly checking to ensure they're on the right path. Mary, not wanting to be entirely dependent on technology, also consults the physical map periodically, comparing it to the landscape in front of them. Step 3: Navigating the wilderness As the hike progresses, the friends encounter various obstacles and challenges, such as steep inclines, overgrown trails, and occasional wildlife. Lindsey relies on her GPS to help them navigate around such hurdles, while Mary relies on her intuition and familiarity with the natural world. Step 4: Device failure Unexpectedly, Lindsey's smartphone battery begins to drain rapidly, causing her to panic. Knowing that they still have a significant distance to cover, Lindsey becomes increasingly anxious about their predicament. Meanwhile, Mary's calm demeanor and map reading skills shine through, as she confidently takes the lead, using the physical map and a compass to guide them. Step 5: Learning a valuable lesson As the friends trek on, Lindsey starts to pay more attention to Mary's approach. She observes how Mary gauges their location based on landmarks, topography, and the sun's position in the sky. Lindsey realizes the importance of knowing how to read a map, as it provides an invaluable backup in situations where technology fails. Eventually, they reach their destination safely, thanks to Mary's map-reading expertise. Lindsey gratefully acknowledges the importance of the skill and vows to learn it in the future. The two friends share a laugh over the day's adventure and make a pact to practice navigating with a map on their future hikes."},{"prompt":"On the whole, it's not something we parents shout about, but one in four of us does it.Hiring private tutors for our children is now widespread.And this year, as always,the Easter holidays will be peak time for tutor demand. \\"My husband and I tried to tutor her at home,but we found all our knowledge was out of date and we were only confusing Zarreen.We also tried a group revision course but all the children were sitting exams for different boards .

What is the answer?","completion":"The county on the East coast of Ireland that lies between County Dublin and County Louth is County Meath. County Meath, or \\"An Mhí\\" in Irish, is part of the province of Leinster and covers an area of approximately 2,335 square kilometers. With its lush green countryside, it is often called the \\"Royal County\\" as it was historically the seat of the High King of Ireland, the most prestigious and significant role in ancient Ireland. The region is rich in history and heritage, with numerous archeological sites and monuments that showcase the ancient past of the area. One of the most significant sites in County Meath is the Hill of Tara, which served as the political and spiritual center of ancient Ireland. This location is home to numerous monuments dating back to the Neolithic period, such as the Stone of Destiny (Lia Fáil), which is believed to roar when touched by the rightful King of Ireland. The hill is also home to the ancient Mound of the Hostages, dating back to approximately 2500 BC, and the Royal Seat, a set of Iron Age earthworks. Another notable site in County Meath is the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Brú na Bóinne, which comprises three ancient passage tombs – Newgrange, Knowth, and Dowth. These tombs are over 5,000 years old, predating the Egyptian pyramids by several centuries, and showcase the incredible skill and knowledge of the Neolithic people who constructed them. The Newgrange passage tomb is perhaps the most famous of the three, and is renowned for its spectacular winter solstice phenomenon, during which sunlight illuminates the inner chamber for a brief period. In addition to these historical and archeological sites, County Meath has much to offer in terms of natural beauty, leisure activities, and cultural experiences. Tourists can enjoy a variety of outdoor pursuits such as hiking, cycling, horse riding, and golf, as well as taking part in traditional Irish music and dance sessions in local pubs. Overall, County Meath is a significant and fascinating destination for anyone interested in immersing themselves in the history, culture, and beauty of Ireland. As it is nestled between County Dublin and County Louth, visitors have easy access to other important sites and cities in the region, including the vibrant capital city of Dublin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Saliva contains enzymes that help in the digestion process, but it does not directly relate to the removal of salt from the water. The process you described earlier pertaining to the formation of solution caves in limestone is unrelated to the chewing of food and the presence of salt in the water. It is a geological process that occurs due to the action of carbonic acid on calcite present in limestone rocks.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Many of the serious strains of bacterial infections can be prevented with immunizations. Seasonal flu shots and pneumococcal vaccines will likely help reduce ear infections. You and every member of your family should also get a flu vaccination every year. Vaccinating yourself will help keep both you and your family safer from infection. Experts recommend that you use the PCV13 pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for children. Ask your pediatrician for advice. Wash your child's hands, toys and play surfaces frequently to reduce the likelihood of infection. Pacifiers can be vectors for bacteria, including bacteria that causes ear infections. Leakage is more likely to occur in bottle-feeding than it is in breastfeeding, making the transmission of bacteria higher. Breastfeeding also boosts your child’s immune system, helping him or her to fight off infections easier. If bottle-feeding is necessary, place the child in an upright seat so that liquids drip down instead of possibly into their ear. Never give a baby a bottle while s/he is going down for a nap or to sleep at night. Do this both for the sake of preventing ear infections and for general health and safety. Prolonged usage of antibiotics can leave certain bacteria in your body or your child's body resistant to the effects of certain drugs. Only use antibiotics when prescribed by your doctor, or when other options aren't available. These facilities put your child at a 50% greater chance of developing an ear infection due to the common transmission of infections both bacterial and viral. If you cannot avoid sending your child to daycare, teach him or her a few tactics to help avoid the spread of infections such as colds, which can cause ear infections. Teach your child not to put toys or fingers in his or her mouth. S/he should avoid touching the face with his or her hands, especially mucous membrane areas such as the mouth, eyes, and nose. S/he should wash hands after eating and after using the bathroom. Eating a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins helps your body stay strong and healthy. Some research also suggests that \\"good\\" bacteria such as probiotics may help protect your body from infection. Acidophilus is a commonly studied strain of probiotic. You can find it in many yogurts.","completion":"Immunizations play a crucial role in preventing serious strains of bacterial infections. Seasonal flu shots and pneumococcal vaccines are especially important as they can help reduce the risk of ear infections. It is recommended that everyone in a family gets vaccinated annually to ensure overall protection from infections. For children, the PCV13 pneumococcal conjugate vaccination is advised, but consulting a pediatrician for guidance is essential. Maintaining hygiene by regularly washing a child's hands, toys, and play surfaces can also minimize the likelihood of infection. Since pacifiers can be carriers of bacteria, it is important to monitor their use, especially those causing ear infections. Breastfeeding is known to strengthen a child's immune system and offers better protection from infections compared to bottle-feeding. However, if bottle-feeding is necessary, the child should be placed in an upright position to prevent liquids from entering their ears. Always avoid giving a baby a bottle while napping or sleeping at night for both infection prevention and overall health and safety. Prolonged use of antibiotics can lead to drug resistance in bacteria; therefore, consume antibiotics only when prescribed by a doctor or if no other options are available. Daycare facilities may put a child at a greater risk of developing ear infections, so teaching them good hygiene practices like not putting toys or fingers in their mouths and washing hands regularly can help prevent infection spread. Lastly, maintaining a healthy diet that includes fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can contribute to a strong and healthy immune system. Consuming probiotics, such as acidophilus found in many yogurts, may also help in protecting the body from infections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: What is the title of the album whose significant industrial rock influence is noted by Farber, which he likens to \\"the late-80s work of Ministry\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: M.I.A. opted to sing, as opposed to rap, on several tracks on the album, telling Rolling Stone in early 2010 that she wished to produce something different from her previous album, which had \\"more emphasis on production\\". In a January 2010 interview with NME she spoke of being inspired by the film Food, Inc. and described the album as being about \\"exploring our faults and flaws\\" and being proud of them. The closing track, \\"Space\\", which was reportedly recorded using an iPhone app, is a ballad which Mikael Wood, writing in Billboard, described as \\"dreamy\\" and \\"sound[ing] like a Sega Genesis practicing its pillow talk\\". In contrast, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune described \\"Lovalot\\" as sounding \\"like it was recorded in a dank alley, the singer's voice reverberating amid percussion that sounds like doors creaking and rats scurrying across garbage cans\\". \\"XXXO\\" draws its inspiration from M.I.A.'s \\"cheesy pop side\\", and is based on the theme of the creation of a sex symbol. \\"Teqkilla\\" is the only track to address her relationship with Bronfman, through a reference to Seagram, the company owned by his family. \\"It Takes a Muscle\\" is a cover version of a track originally recorded in 1982 by Dutch group Spectral Display, and is performed in a reggae style.The opening track \\"The Message\\", featuring a male lead vocalist, parodies the words of the traditional song \\"Dem Bones\\" to link Google to \\"the government\\". Kitty Empire wrote in The Observer that these conspiratorial government connections to Google and the thoughts of Dzhennet Abdurakhmanova, the Russian teenager who bombed Moscow's tube system in revenge for the death of her husband, were inner-world issues pondered in \\"Lovalot\\" with \\"a mixture of nonsense rhyme, militant posturing and pop-cultural free-flow; her London glottal stop mischievously turns 'I love a lot' into 'I love Allah' \\". Ann Powers in the Los Angeles Times said that \\"M.I.A. turns a call to action into a scared girl's nervous tic. Synths click out a jittery, jagged background. The song doesn't...

This album was released in 2010 and showcased a change in direction from her previous work by incorporating a more diverse range of styles, including the industrial rock influences as mentioned by Farber in his assessment. Along with industrial rock, \\"Maya\\" also incorporates electronic, hip-hop, reggae, and experimental music elements, highlighting M.I.A.'s versatility as a musician."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Dr. Cable is a true gift to the historical field. His courses were difficult, but his amazing story-telling ability shines both in class and in both of his books (conflict of myths and unholy grail).

The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, which makes it a smooth experience for the most part. However, there are a few drawbacks that prevent it from being a top-notch 5-star app. The first issue is the occasional disconnection, forcing me to reconnect the app to the Kodi device manually. This can be quite inconvenient during long streaming sessions. Secondly, some added features, like a search functionality for the media library, would make the app even more useful.
