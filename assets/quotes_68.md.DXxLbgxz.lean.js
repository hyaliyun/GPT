Sunday's game was called off before kick-off after a suspect device - which turned out to be a dummy bomb - was discovered in a toilet. However, some estimates suggested as many as a third of fans did not return for the rescheduled fixture. Fans faced strict security controls in and around the ground before kick-off. Conor McNamara, BBC Radio 5 live's commentator at Old Trafford, said: \\"I'd guess we're two-thirds full. Loads of empty seats here.\\" After Sunday's game was called off, United agreed to refund all tickets and to allow ticket holders from both clubs to watch the rearranged game for free. Bournemouth then offered away fans with valid tickets free coach travel for the 500-mile round trip to the rescheduled fixture. United have the highest average attendance in the Premier League, at 75,000, and it is estimated that their ticket gesture will cost the club about £3m. United went into Sunday's final round of Premier League fixtures with a chance of qualifying for next season's Champions League, but Manchester City's draw at Swansea meant Louis van Gaal's side needed an unlikely 19-goal victory on Tuesday. BBC Sport's Simon Stone at Old Trafford. \\"Manchester United are known for their worldwide support and it is true that fans tend to come from far and wide to games at Old Trafford. \\"Evidently, with the FA Cup final to come on Saturday, many decided, at 48 hours' notice, this was a match too far. \\"United count season ticket holders in their attendance figures whether they are present or not. Officially, since the ground was expanded to its current capacity, their lowest Premier League crowd was 73,401 for the visit of Stoke in January 2011. \\"I can say with absolute certainty that the crowd tonight is below that, although the same could be said for the visits of Aston Villa and Crystal Palace last month, when higher figures were recorded.\\" The Sir Alex Ferguson Stand and the Stretford End were evacuated and sniffer dogs brought in to search the ground, with an \\"operation red code\\" alert issued over the public address system. Supporters who were still in the ground were advised to stay in their seats while the forecourt was cleared of fans who had been in the two evacuated stands. Fans were then advised that, because of the discovery of a suspect package in the north-west quadrant of the ground, the match was \\"abandoned\\" on police advice. A bomb disposal team carried out a controlled explosion at about 16:30 BST, around the same time United players were seen leaving the ground. It emerged later on Sunday that the device, found in a toilet, was left accidentally by a private firm carrying out a training exercise at the ground on Wednesday. Fourteen mock explosive devices were used in Wednesday's exercise. That included the elusive device hidden behind a toilet door, which would have made it visible only from inside the cubicle. Chris Reid, boss of Security Search Management & Solutions Ltd, said he wrongly logged the \\"mock up of a pipe bomb\\" as found. Greater Manchester Mayor and Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd has called for a full inquiry into the \\"fiasco\\". Meanwhile, executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward stressed United and the police \\"would ensure that robust security measures continue to be of the highest priority\\" for the rearranged game.

The original statement is: \\"The man in the blue jeans is trying to kick another man.\\" 2. From this statement, we can identify that there is a man (\\"the man in the blue jeans\\") involved in the action of trying to kick another man. 3. We can remove the specific detail about the blue jeans and generalize the statement, because it doesn't affect the fact that the particular man is trying to kick another man. 4.

Please answer the following question: The golf course at the Aurora Country Club cuts their grass to 2 1/2 inches high. The grass at the Augusta Country Club is cut to 4 inches. Sam likes more of a challenge when playing golf but Jack likes to play on turf where the ball rolls easier. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which Country Club would Jack enjoy playing golf at more, Aurora or Augusta? Hint: Just as there are good-quality grasses for putting greens, there are good-quality grasses for the fairway and rough. The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to \\"take a divot\\" (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot. Answer:","completion":"Jack would enjoy playing golf more at the Aurora Country Club. This is because the grass there is cut to 2 1/2 inches high, which is shorter than the 4 inches at Augusta Country Club. Shorter grass on the fairways makes it easier for the ball to roll, which is what Jack prefers. Additionally, lower grass height generally allows golfers to take a better divot, further contributing to Jack's preference for an easier playing turf."},{"prompt":"- Air goes into the lungs - The lungs remove oxygen from the air - Oxygen diffuses from alveoli in the lungs to the bloodstream - Hemoglobin in red blood cells attaches to the oxygen - Red blood cells carry oxygen all around the body What might be the last step of the process?

The answer to the question: What building the architect and owner of Portland's quarries design and build? is inside the article: Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: You don't need to go out of your way to look ratty, but avoid obviously expensive clothing. Chances are you'll be negotiating over cheap items, and a fancy suit or dress tells the seller you can afford to pay full price. Don't forget to remove flashy jewelry and watches for the same reason. In the last hour or two before they pack up and leave, sellers will be eager to get rid of their remaining merchandise The flip side of arriving late is a smaller selection. For maximum choice (but higher prices), arrive early. If the flea market is seasonal, the time of year can also have an effect on the price. When the flea market has just opened, sellers will have a large inventory from the off-season and may be eager to offload it so they have room to obtain more desirable goods. Once you've found your item, decide to yourself what you're willing to pay for it. Having a clear boundary will prevent you from being convinced to pay more than you are willing. Never reveal this price to the seller! If you do, he has no reason to offer you a lower one. You can try browsing around first to get an idea for how similar items are selling, but there's no guarantee you'll find anything comparable, and the item may be snatched up in the meantime. Most vendors expect haggling, but offering less than 50% the asking price will only offend them. Asking for a 25 to 50% discount is usually considered reasonable as an initial counteroffer at a flea market, although the final price will more likely be 10-25% below the listed one. Saying \\"hmmm\\" or simply pausing before you reply will make you seem less willing to purchase the item. This gives you more bargaining power. Simply remaining silent can cause them to respond with a better offer. This works better if you have the seller's full attention. If you're trying to buy a 1 keychain, the seller might just ignore you and move on to another customer! After a pause, respond with a new offer between your last one and the seller's current offer. Continue to show hesitation until the seller reduces the price below your secret \\"maximum price\\". If the seller won't reduce the price to that amount, try these other tactics: Agree to their last offer on the condition they throw in another item you're interested in for a reduced rate. Have a friend pretend to pull you away or convince you to move on. This may trigger a final offer from the seller. If you don't have a friend handy, simply start walking away for the same effect. Once you try this, though, you won't get a better deal if you walk right back to the stall! Pull out the amount of cash you're offering and show it to the seller to tempt them directly. Don't try this with a large amount of money, or anywhere with a high risk of pickpocketing or mugging.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The Calais - Milltown Border Crossing connects the towns of Calais, Maine and St. Stephen, New Brunswick on the Canada–US border. This crossing is located at the Milltown International Bridge. Various bridges have existed at this location since 1825. Canada built its border crossing station in 1967. The US border station was built in 1938 and is planned to be replaced in 2014. Hypothesis: The US border station is planned to be replaced after the year 2013.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the hypothesis stating that \\"The US border station is planned to be replaced after the year 2013\\" appears to be true. The paragraph specifically mentions that the US border station, which was constructed in 1938, is slated for replacement in the year 2014. To further evaluate the information given in the paragraph, let's break down the key points: 1. The Calais - Milltown Border Crossing connects Calais, Maine, and St. Stephen, New Brunswick, on the Canada–US border. 2. The crossing is located at the Milltown International Bridge. 3. Bridges have been present at this location since 1825. 4. Canada's border crossing station was built in 1967. 5. The US border station was constructed in 1938. 6. The US border station is planned to be replaced in 2014. The last point directly confirms the hypothesis that the US border station is indeed planned to be replaced after the year 2013, specifically in 2014. Although we do not have information about whether the replacement actually took place in 2014 or if there were any revisions to the plan, based solely on the paragraph's content, the hypothesis is consistent with the information provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Drew Brees tried his best to stay out of the deflate-gate controversy, but his performance on Conan Wednesday will undoubtedly be pointed to as evidence of ...something. The New Orleans Saints quarterback was easily able to tell an under-inflated football from one that was within legal rules during a brief demonstration on the show. It isn't clear whether the gag on Conan was staged - but Brees could tell the inflation of two footballs - down to the pounds-per-square-inch. When asked about the deflate-gate scandal, Brees demurred: 'You know what? I have no idea. I know that it seems the NFL has been on this one now for the last few weeks. Drew Brees correctly determined that one football handed to him was 11psi - under-inflated - and other was 13psi -","completion":"within legal limits. The ease with which Brees identified the difference in inflation levels suggests that professional quarterbacks like himself have a keen sense of touch and can recognize inconsistencies in football inflation. While Brees may not have taken a clear stance on the deflate-gate scandal, his demonstration on Conan indicates that the distinction between under-inflated and regulation footballs could be easily discernible to professional players.

While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. Two friends had different diseases. Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection. Which friend received more interferon? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Nigel, the one who was more prone to viral infections and got infected with the HIV virus, likely received more interferon. Interferon is a natural substance produced by the immune system in response to viral infections. Since Nigel's body would detect the presence of the HIV virus, it would increase interferon production to help fight the viral infection. Meanwhile, Manny had a bacterial infection, which typically triggers a different immune response, and doesn't involve high levels of interferon production."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the first quarter, St. Louis trailed early as Panthers QB Jake Delhomme completed a 10-yard TD pass to WR Drew Carter. The Rams would tie the game with QB Marc Bulger completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt. In the second quarter, St. Louis would take the lead with kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 42-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, Wiklins helped the Rams' lead with a 28-yard field goal. However, this was all wiped out as Delhomme completed a 68-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith. In the fourth quarter, Carolina took over for the remainder of the game as kicker John Kasay nailed a 34-yard field goal, Delhomme and Carter hooked up with each other again on a 9-yard TD pass, and Kasay finished the game with 32-yard field goal. The game was notable when offensive tackle Orlando Pace suffered a season-ending injury. This severely hurt the Rams' offense. Answer this question: How many yards shorter was Kasay's average yards of field goals than Wilkins' average yards of field goals?","completion":"To answer this question, we first need to compute the average yards of field goals for both kickers. Jeff Wilkins' field goals: 1. 42 yards 2. 28 yards Total yards = 42 + 28 = 70 yards Average yards for Wilkins = 70 yards / 2 field goals = 35 yards John Kasay's field goals: 1. 34 yards 2. 32 yards Total yards = 34 + 32 = 66 yards Average yards for Kasay = 66 yards / 2 field goals = 33 yards Now, we can find the difference in average yards of field goals between the two kickers. Difference in average yards = Wilkins' average yards - Kasay's average yards = 35 yards - 33 yards = 2 yards So, Kasay's average yards of field goals was 2 yards shorter than Wilkins' average yards of field goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Venezuela, like many other Latin American countries, has a rich history of cultural mixing and diversity. The country's population is a blend of European, indigenous, and African heritages, with indigenous groups being among the first inhabitants of the region. The answer also provides an important context on the size of the indigenous population in Venezuela, by mentioning that they constitute only around 2% of the total population. This information shows that although the indigenous heritage is present in many Venezuelans, the actual size of the indigenous population is relatively small compared to the overall population. This could be a result of various factors, such as historical events, cultural assimilation, and migration patterns throughout the country's history.

Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her.

However, the hypothesis \\"The older teams in the NFC will have to rebuild soon\\" is a broader statement that cannot be fully confirmed due to a lack of detailed information about all the older teams in the National Football Conference (NFC). To analyze the validity of the hypothesis further, we need a comprehensive evaluation of several factors across the entire NFC. A thorough analysis would consider factors such as: 1. Age distribution: Assessing the average age and age distribution of the players in each team, specifically focusing on key skill positions. 2. Team performance: Examining the performance records of these older teams in recent seasons, including their win-loss ratio, divisional and conference standings, as well as playoff appearances. 3. Player contracts and salary cap: Analyzing the financial commitments of the teams, including the distribution of multi-year contracts amongst older players and determining how these contracts may affect the team's rebuilding timeline. 4. Upcoming talent and draft picks: Evaluating the potential of younger players already on the team's roster or players that have been recently drafted/acquired. This evaluation will help determine the team's immediate and future potential. 5. Injury history and player retirement potential: Taking into account the injury history of these older players and their probability of retiring in the next few years, which may expedite the rebuilding process. It is important to conduct a detailed analysis of all those factors in order to establish a more accurate conclusion about whether the older teams in the NFC will indeed have to rebuild soon. The initial premise provides a basic idea about the Washington Football Team and its potential need for restructuring, but the hypothesis requires further supporting evidence to be considered true for the entire National Football Conference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Productivity can be subjective and largely depends on the individual's personal experiences, perspectives, and standards. There are several factors to consider when determining if the five minutes have been productive, such as: 1. Goals and Objectives: Were there specific goals or objectives that were meant to be achieved during the five minutes? If so, were they met or any significant progress was made towards them? 2. Focus and Concentration: Was there enough focus and concentration during the five minutes to work effectively on the task at hand? Distractions can significantly impact productivity, so determining the level of focus can help better assess productivity. 3. Task Difficulty and Complexity: The complexity of the task can impact the amount of progress made within a short time frame. If the task was relatively simple, five minutes might have been enough to complete it or make appreciable progress. However, if the task was more complex, it might be more challenging to determine if the time spent was genuinely productive. 4. Time Management: Was the time spent on the task well-managed, and did it contribute to overall progress on the task? Effective time management is critical for productivity, especially in short periods. 5. Expected Outcomes: What were the expectations for productivity within the five minutes, and did they match the actual outcomes? If the outcomes exceeded expectations, it's likely that the time spent was productive. 6. Quality of Work: Did the quality of the work completed during the five minutes meet the desired standards? High-quality work is usually a reliable indicator of productivity. Ultimately, it is essential to look at the bigger picture of the work being done and consider the varying factors that contribute to productivity. Comparing the actual outcomes to the set expectations and goals can help provide a better assessment of whether or not the five minutes were spent productively.

Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: In papermaking, laidlines and chainlines are both essential components of a sheet of paper, particularly in the case of handmade paper. These lines are an after-effect of the traditional papermaking process, where the paper pulp is placed on a wire mesh mold to drain the water before pressing and drying. Laidlines and chainlines refer to the impressions left on the paper by the wires of the mold, which give it a distinctive pattern. To answer the question, we need to understand the differences between the two types of lines and discuss their density in relation to each other. Laidlines are formed by the closely spaced parallel wires on the mold, which resemble a grid-like pattern. They are usually thinner and more closely spaced than chainlines, giving the appearance of higher density. These lines run parallel to the shorter edge of the paper and are responsible for the ribbed texture associated with laid paper. Chainlines, on the other hand, are created by thicker and more widely spaced wires present on the mold, which are responsible for holding the laidlines together. These lines are characteristically wider and more distinctly visible than laidlines, however, they exhibit lower density due to being farther apart. Chainlines run parallel to the longer edge of the paper and are generally spaced about an inch apart. In conclusion, based on a comparison of their relative spacing, it can be said that laidlines are commonly higher in density as compared to chainlines, due to their closer spacing and thinner appearance on the paper. The combination of both laidlines and chainlines contributes to the unique tactile and visual qualities of traditionally crafted laid paper, thus making it an appealing choice for various artistic applications and historical reproductions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does \\"Morality plays emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished until 1550.\\" correctly answer the question of Which dramatic form was created around 1400?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Morality plays emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished until 1550\\" correctly answers the question of which dramatic form was created around 1400. However, it's important to provide further context and information to better understand the significance and characteristics of morality plays. Morality plays emerged in Europe, particularly in England, as a distinct theatrical genre in the late Middle Ages. They were a form of religious drama that aimed to instruct the audience on moral values and Christian virtues through allegorical stories. These plays developed from the earlier liturgical and mystery play traditions that were closely related to biblical stories. Unlike their predecessors, morality plays focused on the protagonist's inner struggle, presenting allegories that allowed the audiences to recognize the moral dilemmas and relate to the characters' experiences. The primary purpose of morality plays was to convey moral and spiritual lessons through the personification of abstract qualities such as \\"Vice\\" and \\"Virtue.\\" Typically, the protagonist was an ordinary, everyman character who would endure various trials and tribulations and be tempted by vices or sinful behavior. Throughout the play, the protagonist would interact with allegorical characters representing virtues and vices, who acted as influences on the main character's journey toward achieving salvation. One of the most famous and well-known morality plays is \\"The Castle of Perseverance,\\" which dates back to the early 15th century. This play follows the protagonist \\"Mankind\\" through his life, showcasing various moral lures and tests he faces. Another noteworthy morality play is \\"Everyman,\\" which was written by an unknown author in the late 15th century. \\"Everyman\\" is an allegorical tale of the protagonist being summoned to face death and realizing that he must face judgement for his actions. Despite their spiritual themes, morality plays also incorporated elements of humor, spectacle, and popular entertainment, making them accessible to a wider audience. As the Renaissance dawned, morality plays gradually evolved into more secular forms of drama, giving rise to genres like the tragedy, tragicomedy, and the comedy of humors. The emergence of the Elizabethan theater in the late 16th century and playwrights like William Shakespeare marked the decline of the morality play's popularity. In conclusion, the statement accurately answers the question of which dramatic form was created around 1400. Morality plays emerged as a significant theatrical genre in the late Middle Ages, reflecting society's interests and spiritual concerns. They aimed to instruct the audience in moral values and Christian doctrines through allegorical representations, combined with entertaining elements. While morality plays eventually gave way to more secular dramatic genres, their impact on Western theater is still remembered and studied today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is looking at two samples of soil, sample A and sample B. Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples. In which sample less rocks would have chemical reactions, sample A or sample B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"To determine which sample would have less rocks undergoing chemical reactions, we need to consider the factors that affect these reactions. Step 1: Identify the factors affecting chemical reactions in rocks: 1. The presence of water: Chemical reactions in rocks are more likely to occur when water is present as it facilitates the transport of soluble ions. 2. The availability of minerals: Rocks containing more minerals can experience more chemical reactions. 3. Temperature: Higher temperatures can increase the rate of certain chemical reactions in rocks. 4. Time: The longer the rocks have been exposed to weathering conditions, the more chemical reactions they may undergo. Step 2: Compare the factors in sample A (Amazon Rainforest) and sample B (Atacama Desert): 1. Water: Sample A has a high amount of rainfall, while sample B receives very little rainfall. Therefore, sample A has more water for chemical reactions in rocks. 2. Minerals: Both samples may have different minerals, but we do not have enough information to determine which has more available minerals for reactions. 3. Temperature: The Amazon Rainforest has a warm and humid climate, and the Atacama Desert has a hot and dry climate. Both places have high temperatures, so this factor is relatively similar in both samples. 4. Time: Both samples have been exposed to their respective environments for thousands of years, so the time factor is relatively the same. Step 3: Analyze the factors and make a conclusion: The main factor that differentiates sample A and sample B is the presence of water. Sample A (Amazon Rainforest) has a high amount of rainfall, which promotes chemical reactions in rocks. Sample B (Atacama Desert), on the other hand, has very little rainfall, making it less likely for chemical reactions to occur in rocks. The answer to the question is: Less rocks would have chemical reactions in sample B (Atacama Desert)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The simple 'sit' command can be useful in many different situations. Most importantly, it is a great distraction technique for redirecting your dog's attention from an undesirable behavior, such as jumping up. When your dog jumps up on you, turn your back to them while keeping them in your peripheral vision. Ask her to sit and immediately praise her when she does so. If your dog is too excited to notice that you are asking her to sit, ignore her excited behavior until she calms down, and then repeat the command. Again, as soon as she follows your command, give her lots of praise or a special treat to let her know this is the behavior that gets rewarded, not jumping. With this simple command, the goal is to redirect your dog's jumping behavior with a task that should be easy to perform and then rewarded well. Your dog will soon figure out which greetings get her your full attention and which don't. If your dog doesn't know the sit command yet, start teaching her the command along and then try this method. Some dogs exude such extreme excitement when greeting someone that it may be difficult and time consuming to wait for them to calm down for a redirecting sit command. If this sounds like your dog, she may be more inclined to grab a toy and shake it or hold it instead. Keep a special toy by your front door to throw for your dog or give to her when you come home. This will redirect her energy into playing with the toy as opposed to jumping on you or your guests. The key to keeping your dog calm, and therefore exhibit calm behavior, is to also participate in only calm behavior when you come home. Try not to use a high-pitched or loud voice when talking to her. This includes shouting at her when she starts jumping up. This type of vocal tone could encourage more excitement and jumping. Instead of using physical punishment to discourage bad behavior, teach your dog what behaviors get them the most rewards from you. You will have to repeat the actions of her training multiple times before she will get it. Don't get frustrated or upset because this will make her worse. Keep at it and she will eventually catch on Summary:","completion":"The article suggests using the 'sit' command and rewarding calm behavior to redirect a dog's jumping and excited greetings, emphasizing patience and consistency in training."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue to clubs that are relegated from the league in the form of \\"parachute payments\\". Starting with the 2013–14 season, these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons. Though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues (the average Premier League team receives £55 million while the average Football League Championship club receives £2 million), critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not, leading to the common occurrence of teams \\"bouncing back\\" soon after their relegation. For some clubs who have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League, financial problems, including in some cases administration or even liquidation have followed. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have ensued for several clubs unable to cope with the gap. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How does this compare an average Premier League team?","completion":"Imagine you have a group of friends, and some of them get really nice toys from their parents (like the Premier League teams). These friends get about 55 toy tokens. There's another group of friends who don't get as many toy tokens - they only get 2 (like the Football League Championship teams). When a friend with 55 toy tokens has to join the group with only 2 toy tokens, the big kids (Premier League) give him some extra tokens (called \\"parachute payments\\") - about 60 tokens spread over 4 playdates. This is to help him feel better about not having as many tokens as before. But, some people think this is not fair, because it makes the difference between the two groups of friends even bigger. The friends who received parachute payments can sometimes go back to the first group pretty quickly, while the others have a harder time. And sometimes, the friend who got the parachute payments can't handle going from 55 tokens to just a few, and they lose even more tokens - like when a club has financial problems or gets relegated even more. So, comparing an average Premier League team with 55 tokens to a team that gets the parachute payments, you can see that they still have an advantage, but not as much as before. The parachute payments help them for a while, but it doesn't make everything completely fair for all the friends in the second group."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: If you're becoming inebriated and start a fight what would the authorities do? - drunkenness - arrest - fall down - regret - vomit The best answer is Answer:","completion":"The authorities would likely arrest you for drunkenness and starting a fight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. There are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that: 1) The people who made this documentary (including the director and the producer) are Serbs or of Serbian origin, therefore the criteria of neutrality fails. For instance, they mentioned that the diaspora Croats (the so called \\"Ustase\\") played a huge part in the fall of Yugoslavia, but they didn't mention that there were equal Serbian organizations as well (Cetniks)! For you who aren't that familiar with Balkan WW2 history: The Serbian so called \\"Cetniks\\" that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped British paratroops during the war. Well, that's only half the truth. They were also a fascist (Monarch) group who collaborated with the Germans, but then switched side when Hitler started losing the war. It's also ironic that they don't mention the Cetnik leader Mihajlovic in the documentary, a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of villages all over Bosnia and Croatia. But they mentioned a certain Ante Pavelic...Hm...Allow me to be just a little suspicious. 2) Most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown. And I've studied this war for a long time (who is the old British lady!!! She really hasn't made her homework!) and they are not even presented by name, so they could More or less be anybody, maybe someone they took from the street. Who knows. 3) In The documentary they talk about Kosovo and how the Serbs have lived there for ages, and therefore it should belong to Serbia (even though they are a minority). Well, when they mention the Serbian dominated part of Croatia (Krajina) suddenly the Serbs are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long. Fine, but what people don't know is that the largest city in Krajina (Knin) has great historical importance for the Croatian people. It was there where one of the most celebrated Kings of Croatian history (Zvonimir) was crowned, and therefore the city has a historical value for Croatia. The Serbs arrived almost 800 years or so later! But no, the Serbs should have Krajina and Kosovo according to the documentary. Is that fair? To me it looks like double standards of morality from the director. Plus, it is said in the documentary that the Croatian constitution didn't have any laws about minority rights, this is a lie because it was one of the first laws implemented BECAUSE of the fact that Croatia had a huge Serbian minority. 4) The film mentions a radical Croatian Paramilitarian leader called Glavas. Or the Muslim radical Oric. They accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war. Yes, they were radicals, but if you want to talk about radicals, why not also mention the Serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as Seselj and Arkan? The flaws are so many that I just presented a few of them, just so that people get an overview of the documentary. It looks like the people who made this documentary weren't well prepared and didn't have the guts to criticize the Serbs because they were afraid that their Serbian relatives would slap them or something. There aren't that many documentaries out there that are of good quality, but the best so far is \\"The death of Yugoslavia\\" where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed (e.g. Milosevic, Jovic, Bulatovic, Tudman, Izetbegovic, Karadzic etc.) and where you get a whole 5 hour explanation about the fall of Yugoslavia and the war. One other thing. I saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the US gave support to a country (Bosnia) that had connections with Bin Laden during the war. Well, first of all, all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the Bosnian Muslims didn't have an old ethnic identity (previosly they were called \\"Muslim Croats\\") they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people, and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common: Their religion. And they took help from the Mujahedin because no one else would support them. They had to fight the 4:th largest army in Europe! They needed all the help they could get. Nationalism is the best way to unite a people during war. History has shown us that.

During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce. There are two neighboring planets in another solar system. The people of Mandron use many fossil fuels to power things that require electricity. The people of Liptar have found a way to use water as a source of power and they barely use any fossil fuels at all. The habitats of which planet's animals are in more danger? A:","completion":"The habitats of the animals on the planet Mandron are in more danger compared to the planet Liptar. The reason behind this is that the people of Mandron rely heavily on fossil fuels for powering things that require electricity. Burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and climate change. This can lead to the destruction of habitats, putting the planet's animals at a higher risk of extinction. On the other hand, the people of Liptar use water as a source of power and barely use any fossil fuels. By utilizing a cleaner source of energy, they are likely producing fewer greenhouse gases, which reduces their impact on the climate. As a result, the habitats of Liptar's animals are likely to be safer and more stable compared to those on Mandron."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This was used by magistrates to maintain public order. While in Rome, all citizens had a judgement against coercion. This protection was called provocatio (see below).

No. The given question is about understanding what enters the egg during the fertilization process, and the given statement is that sperm nuclei enter the egg. Let's analyze this step-by-step: 1. During fertilization, the sperm comes in contact with the egg. 2. The sperm's head contains the sperm nucleus, which carries the genetic material (half of the chromosomes needed to create a new organism). 3. The sperm penetrates the egg's outer layers and eventually fuses with the egg, allowing the sperm nucleus to enter the egg. 4. The sperm nucleus then fuses with the egg nucleus to create a zygote, which has the full set of chromosomes needed for the new organism to develop. Since the statement specifies that sperm nuclei enter the egg and the flow of electrons is not directly involved in this process, the right answer is (B) No. The process mainly involves the transfer of genetic material (sperm nuclei) rather than a flow of electrons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The store is located in a fictional city in Delaware, and, like its employees, is eclectic and unique. The staff is very much a surrogate family, with Joe as the reluctant and perpetually exasperated but loveable father figure. When his young staff experience problems in their personal lives, he routinely reminds them they can seek him out for advice. The film opens with store manager Joe allowing employee Lucas (Rory Cochrane) his first opportunity to close the store, an opportunity Lucas regards as an honour. While counting the day's receipts in Joe's office, Lucas snoops and discovers that Empire Records is about to be bought and converted into a branch of Music Town, a large national music store with many franchises. In an effort to keep the store independent, Lucas takes the day's cash receipts totaling 9,000 to a casino in Atlantic City in an attempt to quadruple it via gambling. Lucas believes this act will create enough money to allow Joe to save Empire Records. Though initially doubling the money, Lucas soon loses the entire amount in one bet on a dice table. Instead of going home he sleeps on his motorcycle outside the store, where he is found the following morning by opening manager A.J. (Johnny Whitworth) and fellow employee Mark (Ethan Embry).

Here we see a bunch of superb actors we've never heard of before portray folks of different cultures living fairly humdrum lives until their female children want to, and have the potential to, become professional soccer players. The structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful. There is no condescension. Both cultures are seen as modern and valid. (And yes, both are silly, too). One flaw: the Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives but not one child among them. Now, what is this review like? Possible answers: * negative * positive","completion":"The given review tends to be largely positive. The reviewer opens by highlighting the interesting nature of the movie, pointing out that it manages to encapsulate both controversial and gentle aspects within its narrative. This is a positive appraisal as it hints at the movie's successful balance of contrasting elements. The need to establish societal equality among genders, specifically in sports, is appreciated in the review. They praise the movie's ability to confront the prejudices prevalent in most cultures towards female athletes and the physically demanding professions they take up, in a non-aggressive manner. Further, the reviewer applauds the ensemble cast of the movie. They positively note the actors’ performances as 'superb', despite them being relatively unfamiliar faces. This underscores positive casting decisions and the latitude it gives to new talent visibility. The storyline comprising of various cultures and their everyday lives is depicted as ‘humdrum’, emphasizing that the movie moves past stereotypes and depicts the inhabitants of these cultures in a realistic light. This adds to the movie's authenticity, another positive aspect. Acknowledging the movie's portrayal of different cultures without any trace of condescension and respecting their validity in a modern context is another distinctly positive comment. It lauds the movie's objective stance and its successful communication in delivering the cultural nuances. However, the reviewer does add that these cultures also have their silly aspects, maintaining a balanced view. The one drawback according to the reviewer arises from the lack of children at a depicted Hindu wedding ceremony. This is a mild criticism and does not significantly slant the tone into negative territory. Instead, it could be interpreted as constructive feedback, something that's often included in mostly positive reviews. Overall, the review manages to highlight more positive aspects and appreciates the movie for numerous elements including its perfect structure, the portrayal of societal prejudices towards women, authentic representation of cultures, and good performance by the actors. Even the one flaw mentioned does not heavily weigh on the negative side.

However, the sentiment quickly changes and the rest of the review is largely negative. The reviewer criticizes various aspects of the movie, referencing the limited dialogue from Sylvester Stallone's character, the constant expression on Stallone's face, and a \\"stupid love thing\\" in the movie that they found too predictable. This signifies the viewer was disappointed and perhaps expected a lot more from the movie based on their initial enthusiasm. The negative sentiment is further emphasized by the reviewer's decision to fast forward the entire movie and their intent to exchange the movie for something else.

Given the question: I showed up at the address on Columbine's invitation just before eleven; it was a converted warehouse in an industrial zone on the city's north side. Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was.

Let's analyze each statement separately: 1. Billie Jean King defeated Kerry Melville, 6-3, 7-5 In this statement, it is conveyed that Billie Jean King, a professional tennis player, won a match against Kerry Melville, another professional tennis player. The numbers provided (6-3, 7-5) indicate the scores of each set in the match. Tennis matches are typically played in a best-of-three or best-of-five format, with the first player to win two or three sets, respectively, emerging victorious. In this case, the match was a best-of-three format as only two sets are mentioned. Billie Jean King won the first set with a score of 6 to 3 and the second set with a score of 7 to 5. Since Billie Jean King won both sets, she is considered the winner of the match. 2. Bill Kerry Melville Defeated Billie Jean King, 6-3, 7-5 In this statement, while the names \\"Bill\\" and \\"Kerry Melville\\" are mentioned, the intended meaning is quite different. The intended meaning is that Bill Kerry Melville (a combination of Bill and Kerry Melville, two different tennis players) defeated Billie Jean King. However, it is important to note that this sentence is grammatically incorrect and may cause confusion due to the inaccuracy in the names provided. The correct statement for the same meaning would be: Kerry Melville defeated Billie Jean King, 6-3, 7-5. In this corrected statement, it is conveyed that Kerry Melville, a professional tennis player, won a match against Billie Jean King, another professional tennis player. As with the previous statement, the scores provided (6-3, 7-5) indicate the scores of each set in the match. Kerry Melville won the first set with a score of 6 to 3 and the second set with a score of 7 to 5. Since Kerry Melville won both sets, she is considered the winner of the match. In conclusion, the first statement signifies Billie Jean King's victory over Kerry Melville, while the second statement (once corrected) signifies Kerry Melville's victory over Billie Jean King.

The suspects are due to appear together in a federal court on Thursday. Reports from the US and Moscow suggest Washington may opt to deport the 10 in exchange for Russian prisoners. Neither Russian nor US authorities have commented on the reports. The lawyer of a man jailed in Russia for spying for the CIA is reported as saying he is to be traded for a person held in the UK. Anna Stavitskaya, the lawyer for nuclear scientist Igor Sutyagin, told the BBC that Moscow would expel him from Russia in exchange for an unnamed UK detainee. Sutyagin, a nuclear specialist, is serving a 15-year jail sentence after being convicted of passing information to a UK firm allegedly used as a front by the CIA. It remains unclear whether the suspects held in New York are to be involved in any swap, but in a move that fuelled speculation, a top US diplomat met the Russian ambassador to Washington. No details were given of the talks between undersecretary of state for political affairs William Burns, a former US ambassador to Moscow, and Ambassador Sergei Kislyak other than the fact that the issue of spies came up in the meeting, in which they also discussed Iran. 'Next step' In New York on Wednesday, a court unsealed an indictment against the 10 alleged Russian agents and an 11th suspect who went missing after being released on bail in Cyprus.

He said he had spoken to US prosecutors and Russian officials about a speedy resolution to the case. The 10 accused were arrested last month on suspicion of conspiring to work as illegal agents for the Russian government. The crime is less serious than espionage but carries a sentence of up to five years in prison. Nine of the group are also accused of money laundering. Rapid resolution Three of the suspected spies had been due to attend a court hearing in Virginia on Wednesday. But the hearing was postponed and orders were issued to transport them \\"promptly to the Southern District of New York for further proceedings\\". Two others were to be transported from Boston. No reason has been given for the transfer to New York, where the other suspects are in custody. On Wednesday, the New York Times quoted sources close to the case as saying the federal government was seeking a rapid resolution. Meanwhile, the US government said it would appeal against a New York judge's decision to allow one suspect, Vicky Pelaez, to be released on bail. The court will hear arguments in the matter on Friday. 'Illegal agents' In Russia, Sutyagin was quoted as saying that he expected to be put on flights to Vienna, then London, on Thursday. According to his brother, Dmitry, he said he had been told by Russian officials that he would be released and sent to the UK in exchange for an unknown number of spies. The officials met Sutyagin on Monday at a prison in Arkhangelsk, northern Russia, and US officials were at the meeting, the brother said. After Monday's meeting, the prisoner was reportedly moved to Moscow's Lefortovo prison. Sutyagin's lawyer, Ms Stavitskaya, told Reuters that her client had agreed to be swapped \\"as he had no other choice left\\". \\"He knew that otherwise his whole life would be broken but he still insists he is innocent,\\" she said. Russian media quote a member of Sutyagin's family as saying he had seen a list of names of prisoners likely to be swapped by Russia, including Sergei Skripal. Skripal is a Russian military intelligence (GRU) officer convicted of spying for the UK in 2006. What is your reaction to this story? Would a \\"spy swap\\" be a good deal for the US and for Russia? Send us your comments. ||||| In an apparent throwback to the Cold War, Moscow and Washington are discussing a deal to swap 10 of the suspected deep-cover Russian agents arrested last month in the U.S. for prisoners held in Russia, according to people familiar with the talks. Two U.S. officials said talks about a possible plea agreement were continuing. The discussions weren't advanced enough for a deal to be imminent, but prosecutors agreed to postpone some court hearings for the alleged Russian spies while U.S. and Russian diplomats discussed an agreement. Such a deal could result in Russia agreeing to release prisoners, one of the officials said. Officials at the Kremlin and Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service declined to comment Wednesday. The 10 suspects were expected to be arraigned in a federal court in New York Thursday afternoon. The mother and brother of Russian physicist Igor Sutyagin, who was convicted in 2004 of spying for the U.S., said he had signed a deal to be exchanged under the agreement after prison authorities suddenly brought him to Moscow from the prison in Russia's far north, where he has been serving his 15-year sentence. Mr. Sutyagin has previously denied he was a spy; his case has been criticized by human-rights advocates and in some Western capitals as an example of Russia's spy agencies railroading innocent specialists through a compliant court system. Russian security officials reject that. News Hub: Russia Spy-Swap Deal Expected 2:15 Moscow and Washington are discussing a deal to swap the 10 suspected deep-cover Russian agents arrested last month in the U.S. for prisoners held in Russia, people familiar with the talks say. John Bussey and Michael Rothfeld discuss. A swap deal would be the first since the end of the Cold War two decades ago. Before that, Moscow and Washington periodically exchanged captured spies, such as in 1962, when captured U.S. Air Force Pilot F. Gary Powers was swapped for Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. Later, the Soviet government began exchanging dissidents for its agents captured in the West. \\"We're rolling back the clock,\\" said Yuri Ryzhov, a former Russian ambassador and prominent academic who heads a commission that has defended scholars accused of treason. \\"It's the 1970s now.\\" Russia's 11? View Interactive Read more about the spy suspects and allegations against them in the complaints. An exchange deal would help both Moscow and Washington put the uncomfortable spy affair behind them. Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev have invested heavily in the \\"reset\\" in U.S.-Russia relations, seeking to improve ties. The spy arrests, which came just over a day after Mr. Medvedev had left the U.S. after a warm official visit to Washington and California, had threatened to cast a pall over the recovering relationship. U.S. prosecutors in New York on Wednesday unsealed formal charges against all 11 suspects, including one alleged agent who jumped bail in Cyprus last week and remained at large. They were charged not with espionage but with the lesser crime of being a foreign agent without registering, as required. Nine of the suspects were also charged with money laundering, according to the indictment. The indictment contains a brief listing of the allegations the government made previously in its criminal complaint, including alleged money drops, radio transmissions to Moscow spy handlers and a meeting with a U.S. government nuclear researcher who was a spying target. A federal judge on Wednesday granted prosecutors' request to delay the release on bail of Vicky Pelaez, a Spanish-language journalist arrested in Yonkers, N.Y., and believed by prosecutors to be the lone non-Russian national in the alleged spy ring. Ms. Pelaez's attorney, John M. Rodriguez, said the Russian government called his office Tuesday and asked whether he thought his client would be open to the possible swap. He said he told the Russian government that he didn't believe his client would be open to that. A U.S. official familiar with the matter said Ms. Pelaez would likely have to face trial if she didn't agree to be part of the proposed swap. View Full Image Reuters Svetlana Sutyagin, center, mother of Igor Sutyagin, who may be released from prison in Russia as part of a swap with the U.S., with Dmitry Sutyagin, Igor's brother, and lawyer Anna Stavitskaya in Moscow Wednesday. Robert Baum, a lawyer for another of the suspects, Anna Chapman, who was arrested in New York, said he had also been contacted by the Russian government. He said Russian officials had visited Ms. Chapman in jail on Saturday without him present or contacting him. Foreign citizens are legally allowed a visit from consular officials when under arrest. Mr. Baum said Ms. Chapman had initially wanted to fight the charges but was currently facing \\"odious\\" detention. Mr. Baum said he was in discussions with the Russian and U.S. governments about a possible resolution in this case, and that the talks were \\"very sensitive.\\" \\"I feel that our discussions will probably be resolved by tomorrow, one way or another,\\" Mr. Baum said Wednesday. A quick end to the spy affair would help the U.S. avoid what some observers said could be a potentially difficult trial. An exchange would also prevent U.S. law enforcement from having to disclose counterespionage tactics during the discovery process leading up to a trial. Prosecutors alleged the suspects had spent years disguising themselves as Americans with ordinary suburban lives and families to gain entree to the political and business elite. Although they are charged with using fake passports and secret radio communications, the information they are accused of having collected seemed largely available publicly. Some of the suspects bore children while in the U.S. And some of the accused have begun arranging to have family take the children to Russia, according to court documents. The U.S. is unlikely to oppose this. The attorney for alleged Russian spy confirms prisoner swap talks between Washington and the Kremlin. Video Courtesy Fox News. Mr. Sutyagin, the Russian physicist, maintains that the information he was convicted of providing to a British company that was allegedly a front for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was garnered from open sources.The account Mr. Sutyagin, the Russian physicist, gave his relatives was straight out of a spy novel. On Monday, he was working construction as usual at the Kholmogory harsh-regime prison camp when a prison officer came up and told him to pack his things, his mother, Svetlana, told reporters Wednesday. He wasn't told where he was going, but was driven to the airport and flown to Moscow, where he was taken to the Lefortovo prison, a special facility run by one of the KGB's successor agencies, the Federal Security Service. There, the terms of the deal were explained to him by what Mr. Sutyagin said appeared to be a senior official of the Foreign Intelligence Service, who was accompanied by three U.S. officials, he told his mother and brother. The U.S. had chosen the Russians to be released, Mr. Sutyagin was told, according to his relatives, who said the swap would involve equal numbers on each side. \\"He couldn't not sign the document,\\" his mother said. She said he remembered only one other name of those to be exchanged: Sergei Skrypal, a Russian army colonel convicted of spying for the U.K. in 2006. Elena Lebedeva-Romanova, a lawyer for Mr. Skrypal, said she couldn't confirm or deny whether he was part of any deal because she hadn't been in contact with him. \\"I'm extremely surprised,\\" she said. \\"This whole story sounds like a movie.\\" Mr. Sutyagin's mother said officials told him that he would be flown to Vienna to be exchanged on Thursday and go from there to the U.K. They said he would retain his Russian citizenship—a break from Cold War practice when dissidents were exiled—though his lawyer said she was skeptical he would ever be allowed to return to Russia. He was given a white shirt and tie to wear for his passport photo, but not allowed to shave, his lawyer said. Once he had signed the deal, prison officials contacted his relatives for the hastily organized visit that took place early Wednesday. —Anna Masterova and Olga Padorina in Moscow, and David Benoit and Chad Bray in New York contributed to this article.

Q: BACKGROUND Neonatal mortality accounts for almost 40 per cent of under-five child mortality, globally. An understanding of the factors related to neonatal mortality is important to guide the development of focused and evidence-based health interventions to prevent neonatal deaths. This study aimed to identify the determinants of neonatal mortality in Indonesia, for a nationally representative sample of births from 1997 to 2002. METHODS The data source for the analysis was the 2002-2003 Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey from which survival information of 15,952 singleton live-born infants born between 1997 and 2002 was examined. Multilevel logistic regression using a hierarchical approach was performed to analyze the factors associated with neonatal deaths, using community, socio-economic status and proximate determinants. RESULTS At the community level, the odds of neonatal death was significantly higher for infants from East Java (OR = 5.01, p = 0.00), and for North, Central and Southeast Sulawesi and Gorontalo combined (OR = 3.17, p = 0.03) compared to the lowest neonatal mortality regions of Bali, South Sulawesi and Jambi provinces. A progressive reduction in the odds was found as the percentage of deliveries assisted by trained delivery attendants in the cluster increased. The odds of neonatal death were higher for infants born to both mother and father who were employed (OR = 1.84, p = 0.00) and for infants born to father who were unemployed (OR = 2.99, p = 0.02). The odds were also higher for higher rank infants with a short birth interval (OR = 2.82, p = 0.00), male infants (OR = 1.49, p = 0.01), smaller than average-sized infants (OR = 2.80, p = 0.00), and infant's whose mother had a history of delivery complications (OR = 1.81, p = 0.00). Infants receiving any postnatal care were significantly protected from neonatal death (OR = 0.63, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION Public health interventions directed at reducing neonatal death should address community, household and individual level factors which significantly influence neonatal mortality in Indonesia. Low birth weight and short birth interval infants as well as perinatal health services factors, such as the availability of skilled birth attendance and postnatal care utilization should be taken into account when planning the interventions to reduce neonatal mortality in Indonesia.

Write a text based on \\"daylong us post office standoff ends peacefully\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Daylong US Post Office Standoff Ends Peacefully The small suburban community of Pleasantville breathed a sigh of relief as the tense daylong standoff between an armed suspect and local law enforcement at the United States Post Office came to a peaceful resolution. The peaceful outcome, in which nobody involved was harmed, showcased the unwavering dedication of the local law enforcement and the successful implementation of the police's crisis negotiation strategies. The incident began early in the morning on a sunny Tuesday when an armed suspect, later identified as 47-year-old John Doe, entered the bustling Pleasantville Post Office on Elm Street. He demanded hostages and threatened to use his firearm, which led to panicked customers and employees fleeing the facility in fear. Doe subsequently locked himself inside the post office, taking three employees as hostages. Upon receiving an emergency phone call, the Pleasantville Police Department quickly dispatched a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team to the scene, led by Chief of Police Eric Bradford. Bradford, a seasoned veteran with 25 years of service behind him, assumed command and ordered the surrounding area be cordoned off, ensuring the safety of the local residents. The SWAT team quickly moved to surround the perimeter and negotiate a peaceful resolution to the crisis situation. Chief Bradford contacted the suspect via telephone and calmly attempted to establish a rapport. As the hours ticked by, it was discovered that Doe had recently lost his job and was facing eviction from his home. Doe voiced frustration over mounting debts and his inability to find work, pushing him to the edge. Throughout the lengthy negotiation process, the police maintained constant communication with the hostages, ensuring their safety and emotional well-being. Police negotiators made it a top priority to build trust with the suspect and develop an understanding of his mental state. This empathetic approach, coupled with clear communication, eventually led Doe to release the hostages unharmed. As evening approached, the combined efforts of the highly skilled and well-trained negotiators began to show results. After more than ten hours of constant dialogue, the suspect finally agreed to peacefully surrender to the police. As Doe exited the post office, he handed over his firearm to authorities and was immediately taken into custody without further incident. The community of Pleasantville expressed its deepest gratitude towards the law enforcement personnel involved in the operation, who showcased tremendous professionalism and dedication in resolving the situation without bloodshed. Chief Bradford and his team demonstrated the benefits of well-planned negotiation tactics, effective teamwork, and an unwavering commitment to ensuring the safety of those involved. The ordeal has brought the importance of addressing mental health issues in the society to the forefront, highlighting the need for community support systems to prevent such incidents in the future. The Pleasantville Post Office has since resumed its operations, and the three employees taken hostage have been reunited with their families and have received full support from their organization, easing their transition back to normalcy. In conclusion, the daylong standoff at the Pleasantville US Post Office serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of professional crisis response teams and their capacity to secure peaceful resolutions in high-stakes situations."},{"prompt":"- Ocean waves hit land - Ocean water pulls sand off of beaches - Ocean water breaks rocks off of cliffs - Ocean water carries sand and rocks into the ocean What might be the last step of the process?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the water displacement method? How is it used and what are some examples? How can I dissolve a metal like tin, titanium and aluminum in water? Could I use ammonia or is there another method? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Select from: I. no. II. yes.","completion":"I. no. The water displacement method is a technique used in physics and fluid mechanics for measuring the volume of an irregularly shaped object or the amount of fluid that an object displaces when submerged in it. Discovered by the Greek scientist Archimedes in the 3rd century BC, the water displacement method states that when an object is completely submerged in water (or any other fluid), the volume of the liquid displaced is equal to the volume of the object itself. To use the water displacement method, you need a container large enough to hold the object in question and a measuring device, such as a graduated cylinder. Here's the step-by-step process: 1. Fill the container with a known volume of water. 2. Carefully submerge the object in the water, ensuring it is fully submerged. 3. Measure the new water level in the container. 4. Subtract the initial volume of water from the new volume to find the amount of water displaced. 5. The difference between the initial and final volume of water is the volume of the object. Examples of the water displacement method include: - Determining the volume of irregularly shaped objects, such as rocks, gemstones, and sculptures. - Measuring the volume of a liquid when it is difficult to do so directly, such as thick, viscous oils. - Calculating the fluid capacity of containers or tanks with irregular shapes. - Estimating the volume of submerged objects like shipwrecks or sunken artifacts for archaeological research. Dissolving metals like tin, titanium, and aluminum in water is a different topic altogether. Pure water cannot dissolve these metals effectively. However, chemicals can react with metals, and in some cases, this may involve dissolving them into a solution. In the case of ammonia, it forms a complex with aluminum called aluminates. However, it's not effective for dissolving tin or titanium. Here are some other methods for dissolving these metals: 1. Tin: Hydrochloric acid (HCl) or nitric acid (HNO3) can dissolve tin. The reaction of tin with hydrochloric acid is as follows: Sn (s) + 2HCl (aq) → SnCl₂ (aq) + H₂ (g) 2. Titanium: Due to its protective oxide layer, titanium cannot be dissolved easily. Nevertheless, a mixture of hydrofluoric acid (HF) and nitric acid (HNO3) can dissolve titanium. Ti (s) + 6HF (aq) → TiF₆²⁻ (aq) + 2H⁺ (aq) + 3H₂ (g) (Note: Handling hydrofluoric acid is extremely dangerous and should only be done by professionals with proper safety measures in place.) 3. Aluminum: A mixture of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and water can dissolve aluminum. 2Al (s) + 6H₂O (l) + 2NaOH (aq) → 2NaAl(OH)₄ (aq) + 3H₂ (g) In summary, the water displacement method and dissolving metals are not the same topics. The water displacement method is a technique for measuring an object's volume, while dissolving metals involves chemical reactions with various chemicals to form soluble species in solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Poor training, a lack of coordination and an overstretched military are also factors, but a new 76-point plan lays out ways to improve this, Colonel John Bradley, chief of psychiatry at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, told a conference. Bradley said a team of experts spent a year interviewing troops who had attempted suicide, family members and others for the report and plan, presented last month to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who is due to report to Congress in 90 days. “They tell us again and again that we are failing,” Bradley told a symposium on military medicine sponsored by the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and the Henry M. Jackson Foundation. Each branch of the services — the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines — rushed to create a suicide prevention program, but there was no coordination. The report recommends that the defense secretary’s office take over coordination of suicide prevention efforts. On-the-ground prevention training often failed because those running the sessions did not understand their importance, Bradley said. “They are mocked and they are probably harmful,” he said. According to the report, available here 1,100 servicemen and women committed suicide in 2005 to 2009 -- one suicide every day and a half. The Army's suicide rate doubled in that time. About 1.9 million U.S. service men and women have been deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. “We have done all the right things but despite all the things we have done, suicide rates have risen, particularly in the Marines and Army,” said Colonel Charles Hoge of Walter Reed. “A large percentage of our servicemen, our veterans, do not come in to get help,” he added. “It is not just the perception that they will be treated differently or somehow that it will affect their career, but it is also distrust in the system and distrust that mental health professionals can help them,” Hoge added. “They don’t trust us. They believe we speak with forked tongues,” Bradley said. Most of the suicides are among young, white males, the experts said. “Marines are young, they are confident, they are aggressive,” said Lieutenant General Richard Zimmer of the U.S. Marine Corps. “They are the last ones to raise their hand and say they have a problem.” And troops who seek mental health services can lose their security clearances, their weapons and can be taken away from duties vital to their careers, Hoge and Bradley said. When they return home from war, the skills that kept them alive under fire make them dysfunctional in civilian society, Hoge said. “There are messages that the warrior gets when they back here that they are crazy,” he said. In addition, all the services are overstretched, the report said. “The force is out of balance,” Bradley said. “The force is fatigued. Anyone who doesn’t believe that has their eyes closed.” Hoge said physical demands can also affect the mind. Troops often operate on just 3 or 4 hours a sleep a night for extended periods. “They often have pain, chronic pain,” he said. “They have gone through all these events, including concussions. It is clear there are physical changes that happen.” Bradley said the report calls for skills-based training for commanders, troops and their families.","completion":"A claim supported by the given paragraph is that poor training, a lack of coordination, and an overstretched military contribute to the high suicide rates among U.S. servicemen and women, and a 76-point plan has been proposed to improve the situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As a fervent lover of Italian cuisine, I have always been on the lookout for authentic, high-quality dining experiences in my city. Recently, I heard of \\"La Bella Italiano\\" from a friend who raved about their incredible dishes, and last night, I finally had the chance to visit. I can confidently say that this restaurant has exceeded all my expectations and is now my go-to spot for Italian food. Upon entering \\"La Bella Italiano,\\" I was greeted with the warm and inviting fragrance of simmering garlic and fresh herbs, which immediately set the tone for a delightful culinary journey. The entire atmosphere of the restaurant, with its dimly lit interiors, soft background music, and rustic decor pieces, transported me to a cozy Italian village. The staff were incredibly attentive and friendly, making sure to explain every dish in detail and accommodate my dietary preferences. Speaking of the food, it was truly divine. For the appetizer, I decided to try their recommended Caprese salad, which had the most succulent tomatoes I've ever tasted, paired with tender, fresh mozzarella slices and a delightful balsamic reduction. As for the main course, I ordered the Tagliatelle al Ragu, a house-made pasta with a slow-cooked Bolognese sauce that was seasoned to perfection and bursting with rich flavors. The pasta was cooked al dente, giving the ideal combination of spicy, tangy, and sweet flavors. Despite feeling quite full, I couldn't resist trying one of their decadent desserts. I went for the Tiramisu, purely based on the waiter's recommendation, and I'm so glad I did. Every spoonful was a heavenly blend of airy mascarpone cheese, espresso-soaked ladyfingers, and a light dusting of cocoa powder. It was the perfect way to end an exquisite meal. To accompany our dishes, the sommelier recommended a bold, full-bodied Italian red wine from Tuscany, which paired perfectly with the rich flavors in the food. It is clear that \\"La Bella Italiano\\" pays great attention to detail when it comes to selecting its wines, showcasing its dedication to providing a complete and authentic Italian experience. Throughout the meal, the staff continued to impress, attentively refilling water glasses, and checking to ensure we were satisfied with each course. The owner also took the time to chat with us and share more about the restaurant's philosophy and passion for creating Italian dishes that bring families and friends together. To sum up, my experience at \\"La Bella Italiano\\" was nothing short of exceptional. From the warm ambiance and impeccable service to the sumptuous food and carefully curated wine list – everything about the restaurant has left a lasting impression. I wholeheartedly recommend \\"La Bella Italiano\\" to anyone who desires an unforgettable Italian dining experience.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. 37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury nor lend him thy victuals for increase Please fix the punctuation.","completion":"\\"Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.\\" Here is an explanation of how the punctuation was corrected: 1. Separating independent clauses: The sentence contains two independent clauses, which are complete thoughts that can stand alone as separate sentences. They are 'Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury' and 'nor lend him thy victuals for increase.' When two independent clauses are joined in a sentence without a conjunction (e.g., 'and', 'but', 'or', etc.), it is known as a comma splice, which is generally avoided in English. However, in this case, the conjunction 'nor' is present but it is not leading the sentence or clause, so a comma is inserted before 'nor' to separate the two clauses. This rule is applicable when the two independent clauses are closely related, as they are here. 2. Using commas with coordinating conjunctions: In English, when we have two independent clauses connected by one of the seven coordinating conjunctions (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so), a comma should be inserted before the conjunction. In our sentence, the conjunction 'nor' connects two independent clauses. Therefore, a comma is placed before 'nor' to signal the separation. So, after correcting the punctuation, the sentence reads: \\"Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.\\" This makes the sentence more readable and clearly differentiates between the two points being made."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: North Korea has installed new inspection cameras in their nuclear facilities.","completion":"To draw a hypothesis from the context, let's analyze the information provided step-by-step and justify the steps. Step 1: Identify the key points in the given context - North Korea states its intention to restart reactors - Throws out IAEA inspectors - Takes down inspection cameras - Announces withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty - Makes threats of war if UN or US imposes sanctions Step 2: Evaluate the relevance of each point to form a hypothesis - Restarting reactors could be an indicator of a more active nuclear program - Throwing out inspectors and taking down cameras suggest that North Korea is trying to hide their nuclear activities - Withdrawing from the treaty and making threats of war highlight North Korea's defiance of international norms and potential conflicts Step 3: Formulate a hypothesis based on the relevant points Considering the provided context, we observe that North Korea is increasing its nuclear activities and actively hiding them from international inspectors. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would have installed new inspection cameras in their nuclear facilities since this would contradict their actions of removing IAEA inspectors and taking down inspection cameras.

The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years. Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1Â km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who hosted King Edward I at a castle? Brougham Castle (pronounced ) is a medieval building about 2 miles (3.2 km) south-east of Penrith, Cumbria, England. The castle was founded by Robert I de Vieuxpont in the early 13th century. The site, near the confluence of the rivers, Eamont and Lowther, had been chosen by the Romans for a Roman fort called Brocavum. The castle is scheduled as an Ancient Monument, along with the fort, as \\"Brougham Roman fort and Brougham Castle\\".In its earliest form, the castle consisted of a stone keep, with an enclosure protected by an earthen bank and a wooden palisade. When the castle was built, Robert de Vieuxpont was one of the only lords in the region who were loyal to King John. The Vieuxponts were a powerful land-owning family in North West England, who also owned the castles of Appleby and Brough. In 1264, Robert de Vieuxpont's grandson, also named Robert, was declared a traitor, and his property was confiscated by Henry III. Brougham Castle and the other estates were eventually returned to the Vieuxpont family, and stayed in their possession, until 1269, when the estates passed to the Clifford family through marriage. With the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence, in 1296, Brougham became an important military base for Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. He began refortifying the castle: the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger, more impressive stone walls, and a large stone gatehouse was added. The importance of Brougham and Robert Clifford was such that, in 1300, he hosted King Edward I of England at the castle. Robert's son, Roger Clifford, was executed as a traitor, in 1322, and the family estates passed into the possession of King Edward II of England, although they were returned once his son Edward III became king. The region was often at risk from the Scots, and in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked.

But do n't worry , this story has a happy ending . Question: Why is the narrator thinking of Laura Ingalls Wilder ?","completion":"The narrator is thinking of Laura Ingalls Wilder because the situation they are in – having no power and taking a shower by candlelight – is reminiscent of the times depicted in Laura Ingalls Wilder's books. As a child, the narrator was fond of Wilder's stories, which were set in the latter half of the nineteenth century during the westward expansion of the United States. These stories primarily focus on the life of a young girl, Laura Ingalls, and her family as they journey through the pioneering American frontier. The living conditions of the Ingalls family, like many other families of that era, were quite different from the modern, technology-dependent lifestyle we are accustomed to today. They often faced hardships, including a lack of electricity and modern conveniences. As a result, they had to rely on simpler means to carry out daily tasks, such as using natural light or candles after dark. When the narrator has to take a shower by candlelight due to the power outage, it brings them back to their childhood, when they used to role-play as Laura Ingalls while wearing a prairie dress and bonnet. This activity likely allowed the narrator to imagine themselves in similar circumstances to those of the characters in Wilder's books. The affection the narrator had for this fictional world is evident from their reminiscing about their Laura Ingalls Wilder days. Furthermore, comparing their current situation to their childhood memories may allow the narrator to experience a sense of nostalgia, momentarily escaping the inconvenience of the power outage. Engulfed in candlelight, the narrator is transported to a simpler time, one in which they embraced their imagination and could appreciate the romanticism and peacefulness of a bygone era. This connection is only amplified by their confirmation that their story has a happy ending: despite the temporary setback of having no power, the narrator is still able to find value in their experience and enjoy a brief return to their cherished childhood memories."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Very little of Bermuda's original black emigration came from this area. The first blacks to arrive in Bermuda in any numbers were free blacks from Spanish-speaking areas of the West Indies, and most of the remainder were recently enslaved Africans captured from the Spanish and Portuguese. As Spain and Portugal sourced most of their slaves from South-West Africa (the Portuguese through ports in modern-day Angola; the Spanish purchased most of their African slaves from Portuguese traders, and from Arabs whose slave trading was centred in Zanzibar). Genetic studies have consequently shown that the African ancestry of black Bermudians (other than those resulting from recent immigration from the British West Indian islands) is largely from the a band across southern Africa, from Angola to Mozambique, which is similar to what is revealed in Latin America, but distinctly different from the blacks of the West Indies and the United States.

On the Origin of Species: Charles Darwin's grandfather Erasmus Darwin outlined a hypothesis of transmutation of species in the 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.

Orrin Grant Hatch (born March 22, 1934) is an American attorney and politician serving as the senior United States Senator for Utah who has been the President pro tempore of the United States Senate since 2015. Having been a senator since 1977, Hatch is the longest-serving Republican Senator in U.S. history. Hatch served as either the chair or ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1993 to 2005. He previously served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions from 1981 to 1987 and currently serves as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee as well as serving on the board of directors for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Hatch introduced the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act, narrowing the broad authority of the DEA to suspend drug \\"manufacturers, distributors, and dispensers\\". Hatch stated the bill was also written to protect patients from disruptions in the production and delivery of their prescription drugs: \\"The fact that prescription drugs can be abused should not prevent patients from receiving the medications they need. This bill takes a balanced approach to the problem of prescription drug abuse by clarifying penalties for manufacturing or dispensing outside approved procedures while helping to ensure that supply chains to legitimate users remain intact\\". The bill passed the Senate unanimously and Tom Marino passed a version of the bill in the House and was signed by President Barack Obama. Critics of the bill claim the new law fuels the opioid crisis by limiting the DEA's ability to halt production and distribution by predatory drug companies. DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge John J. Mulrooney II wrote in the Marquette Law Review: \\"At a time when, by all accounts, opioid abuse, addiction and deaths were increasing markedly, this new law imposed a dramatic diminution of the agency's authority. It is now all but logically impossible for the DEA to suspend a drug company's operations for failing to comply with federal law.\\" Donald Trump's Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the law \\"dubious\\" and joined 44 state attorneys general calling for \\"repeal or amendment of the law to restore some of the DEA's authority.\\" Jim Geldhof, a former DEA program manager whom spent 43 years with the DEA called the bill \\"outrageous. It basically takes any kind of action DEA was going to do with a distributor or manufacturer as far as an immediate suspension off the table. And then the other part of that really infuriates me is that corrective action plan.\\" Mulrooney compared the corrective action plan to one that would \\"allow bank robbers to round up and return inkstained money and agree not to rob any more banks -- all before any of those wrongdoers actually admit fault and without any consequence that might deter such behavior in the future.\\" Hatch responded to a Washington Post and 60 Minutes investigation into the bill by writing a Washington Post opinion article calling the investigation \\"misleading\\" and asking to \\"leave conspiracy theories to Netflix\\". Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a co-sponsor of the senate bill, also defended the bill: \\"This bill was drafted in consultation with the DEA to offer better guidance for companies working to safely and responsibly supply prescription drugs to pharmacies, and to promote better communication and certainty between companies and regulators.\\" Republican Pat Toomey Pat Toomey expressed doubts that a conspiracy existed, but still suggested amending the bill: \\"I'm a little surprised that it passed unanimously in both houses, was signed by President Obama and got no opposition from the DEA at the time. That's not the way controversial legislation usually ends up, but hey, if there's problems, then we ought to revisit them.\\" Hatch received 177,000 in donations from the drug industry while pushing the bill through and has received 2,178,863 from the Pharmaceuticals/Health Products industry from 1989-2014 according to required filings by the Federal Election Commission.

Write some highlights for the following article: Syrian security forces flooded the restive cities of Daraa and Latakia on Monday, patrolling the streets, protecting government buildings and in at least one case clashing with protesters, according to witnesses. Both cities have been the scene of violent clashes between protesters and security forces in recent days, with at least 37 deaths since last week, according to the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. In Daraa on Monday, forces filed into the city's main square before dawn, tearing down the tents and anti-government signs of about 100 protesters who were staying there overnight, according to one eyewitness. The forces fired shots into the air and turned water cannons on the protesters, the witness said, leading to a clash with hundreds of nearby residents who rushed to the square to defend the demonstrators. The resulting confrontation lasted about 30 minutes, reportedly without injuries or arrests, according to the witness. Another witness said the army was blocking the city on three sides and that security forces, surrounding government buildings and the Al-Omari mosque where some protesters remained, had opened fire. The witness was not aware of any injuries. Syria's state-run news agency said the government denied firing on protesters, calling the allegations \\"completely false.\\" Political dissident Aman Aswad, who is in Daraa, said the city is extremely tense. \\"People are sitting at home scared, watching the updates on TV,\\" he said. In Latakia, another eyewitness said mysterious men in black shirts carrying sophisticated weapons terrorized residents overnight, firing into the air and banging on the doors of homes. \\"We do not understand who these men are but government officials say they are members of a 'foreign group,'\\" the witness said. \\"We all think they are lying about this because every time one of them is captured and handed over to the police he is released.\\" Hundreds of government troops have also filtered into the Latakia and are guarding public buildings and other important sites, the witness said. CNN could not independently confirm the accounts because the Syrian government has yet to grant access to the network. Syria is the latest in a string of Arabic-speaking nations beset with discontent over economic and human rights issues. Syria's discontent is centered Daraa, a southern city in the impoverished country's agricultural region, where security forces and anti-government protesters have sporadically clashed for nearly two weeks. Thousands of protesters marched Friday to the governor's building in Daraa, where they burned pictures of President Bashar al-Assad and toppled a statue of his father, the late President Hafez al-Assad, according to a witness who identified himself only as Adbullah. Aswad, a political dissident, said dozens of people appeared to have been killed or wounded in clashes with security forces during those protests. In Latakia, government blamed \\"armed gangs\\" who seized police weapons on the violence last week that led to the deaths there of 10 security force members and civilians and two gunmen, according to the Syrian state-run news agency, SANA. The agency reported that 200 people, most of them security forces, were wounded by the gangs. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized Syria's government over the violence on the CBS Sunday morning news show \\"Face the Nation.\\" \\"Certainly we deplore the violence in Syria,\\" she said. \\"We call as we have on all of these governments during this period of the Arab awakening, as some have called it, to be responding to their people's needs, not to engage in violence, permit peaceful protests and begin a process of economic and political reform.\\" CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","completion":"1.

Read this and answer the question More commonly, in cases where there are three or more parties, no one party is likely to gain power alone, and parties work with each other to form coalition governments. This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. Political change is often easier with a coalition government than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.[dubious – discuss] If factions in a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals, or even principles, they can be slow to make policy changes, which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans. Still coalition governments struggle, sometimes for years, to change policy and often fail altogether, post World War II France and Italy being prime examples. When one party in a two-party system controls all elective branches, however, policy changes can be both swift and significant. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were beneficiaries of such fortuitous circumstances, as were Republicans as far removed in time as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. Barack Obama briefly had such an advantage between 2009 and 2011.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 139w - 44w = 66w - 406 for w, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. 139w - 44w is on the left side, and they are like terms because they both have w. So, (139 - 44)w = 95w Now, the equation becomes 95w = 66w - 406. Step 2: Eliminate variable terms on one side. Either keep the variable terms on the right-hand side or the left-hand side, based on your preference. We'll move the 66w term to the left-hand side to eliminate it from the right-hand side. To do that, we'll subtract 66w from both sides: 95w - 66w = 66w - 406 - 66w This simplifies to: (95-66)w = -406 29w = -406 Step 3: Isolate w by dividing by the coefficient. The coefficient of w on the left side is 29.

Which element has more electronegativity? A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table. He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy. Hint: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull.

Some scholars note that Tibetan leaders during the Ming frequently engaged in civil war and conducted their own foreign diplomacy with neighboring states such as Nepal.

Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship of the Ming court with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. In hopes of reviving the unique relationship of the earlier Mongol leader Kublai Khan (r. 1260–1294) and his spiritual superior Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280) of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424) made a concerted effort to build a secular and religious alliance with Deshin Shekpa (1384–1415), the Karmapa of the Karma Kagyu school.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Article: Can you believe your eyes? A recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age. Martin Doherty, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland, led the team of scientists. In this experiment, Doherty and his team tested the perception of some people, using pictures of some orange circles. The researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people. The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10, and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25. The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background. One of the circles was larger than the other, and these people were asked to identify the larger one. Four-year-olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time. Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time. Next, both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles, again of different sizes, were surrounded by gray circles. Here's where the trick lies in. In some of the pictures, the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles -- making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle, which was the real larger one. And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles -- so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle. When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures, they weren't fooled -- they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before. Older children and adults, on the other hand, did not do as well. Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one, and adults got it wrong most of the time. As children get older, Doherty said, their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context. In other words, they will begin to process the whole picture at once: the tricky gray circles, as well as the orange circle in the middle. As a result, they're more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick. Question: When asked to find the larger circle, _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"children at 4 got it right about 79 % of the time with gray ones around\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"children at 4 got it right about 79% of the time with gray ones around\\" when asked to find the larger circle in the first set of pictures without the tricky gray circles.

There have been plenty of other attempts to restrict the rights of party members and activists to select candidates by party insiders keen to sew up the selection without members being consulted , super-delegates were created as a watered down response to one of these but the effects are the same . 3. Its simply a violation of basic democratic principles for one vote to be worth more than another .","completion":"Based on the provided pieces of evidence, the claim that can be made is that the Democratic Party's utilization of super-delegates in primary elections undermines their commitment to democratic principles, as it allows for unequal influence and potential manipulation of candidate selection by party insiders. The first piece of evidence critiques the Democratic Party's overall image, claiming poor appearance and a bad message brought on by the party's defense of super-delegates. This points to a perceived hypocrisy within the party, as they should embody and strengthen democratic processes, but instead seemingly compromise them with the super-delegate system. The second piece of evidence highlights the historical context surrounding the establishment of super-delegates. These delegates were introduced as a diluted response to other methods designed to lessen the power of grassroots activists within the party. However, super-delegates still hold disproportionate influence in the candidate selection process, granting more weight to insiders' opinions over the party's general membership. Finally, the third piece of evidence directly addresses the violation of democratic principles due to unequal influence among votes. By holding more power than other voters, super-delegates create a situation where one vote is worth more than another, undermining the foundation of democracy which is built upon ensuring equal representation for all citizens. In conclusion, the claim can be made that the Democratic Party's use of super-delegates is an undemocratic approach that contradicts the party's name and central values. This system perpetuates unequal influence and devalues the input of regular party members, thus jeopardizing the party's commitment to genuine democratic principles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers. Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws. Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - The Grammy Award for Best Rock Song is an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality songs in the rock music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \\"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\\". - Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle, Washington in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the death of Kurt Cobain and the resulting dissolution of his previous band. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters. - There Is Nothing Left to Lose is the third studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, released November 2, 1999. The album marks the first appearance of drummer Taylor Hawkins, and is often seen as a departure from the band's previous work, showcasing a softer, more experimental sound. In a 2006 interview, Dave Grohl states that the album is \\"totally based on melody\\" and that it \\"might be his favorite album that they've ever done.\\" - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 April 5, 1994) was an American musician, artist, songwriter, guitarist and poet. Born in Aberdeen, Washington, Cobain formed the band Nirvana with Krist Novoselic in 1987 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene and grunge genre.

To date, it is the band's only single to reach Platinum status in the US. The song holds the band's highest chart peaks in the U.S. (#18), the UK (#4), and Australia (#5), and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The song won the Kerrang! Award for Best Single. It also topped \\"Billboard\\"'s Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for four weeks and Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart for seven weeks. Following the band's performance at Live Earth, the song again entered the UK charts at #38. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.

The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. - \`\` The Pretender '' is a song by the American alternative rock band Foo Fighters .

It is a double album, with one disc containing heavy rock songs and a second disc with mellower acoustic songs. Frontman Dave Grohl decided to do a diverse blend of songs as he felt that after ten years of existence, the band had to break new ground with their music. The album was recorded at a newly built studio in Northridge, Los Angeles, and featured guests such as John Paul Jones, Norah Jones and Josh Homme. The lyrics deal with both resonating and introspective themes, with a major influence from Grohl's involvement on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. - Independent music (often shortened to indie music or indie) is music produced independently from major commercial record labels or their subsidiaries, a process that may include an autonomous, do-it-yourself approach to recording and publishing. The term \\"indie\\" is sometimes also used to describe a genre (such as indie rock and indie pop); as a genre term, \\"indie\\" may include music that is not independently produced, and most independent music artists do not fall into a single, defined musical style or genre, and usually create music that can be categorized into other genres. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Kerrang! is a UK-based magazine devoted to rock music, currently published by Hamburg based Bauer Media Group. It was first published on 6 June 1981 as a one-off supplement in the \\"Sounds\\" newspaper. Named after the onomatopoeic word that derives from the sound made when playing a power chord on a distorted electric guitar, \\"Kerrang!\\" was initially devoted to the new wave of British heavy metal and the rise of hard rock acts.

On 28 May 1854 a protocol of the Vienna Conference was signed by Austria and Russia. One of the aims of the Russian advance had been to encourage the Orthodox Christian Serbs and Bulgarians living under Ottoman rule to rebel. However, when the Russian troops actually crossed the River Pruth into Moldavia, the Orthodox Christians still showed no interest in rising up against the Turks.:131, 137 Adding to the worries of Nicholas I was the concern that Austria would enter the war against the Russians and attack his armies on the western flank. Indeed, after attempting to mediate a peaceful settlement between Russia and Turkey, the Austrians entered the war on the side of Turkey with an attack against the Russians in the Principalities which threatened to cut off the Russian supply lines. Accordingly, the Russians were forced to raise the siege of Silistra on 23 June 1854, and begin abandoning the Principalities.:185 The lifting of the siege reduced the threat of a Russian advance into Bulgaria.

In the months following Pink Moon's release, Drake became increasingly asocial and distant. He returned to live at his parents' home in Tanworth-in-Arden, and while he resented the regression, he accepted that his illness made it necessary. \\"I don't like it at home,\\" he told his mother, \\"but I can't bear it anywhere else.\\" His return was often difficult for his family; Gabrielle said, \\"good days in my parents' home were good days for Nick, and bad days were bad days for Nick.

At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes. He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: \\"He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone.

Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré explained and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'église éternelle for organ. He married the violinist and composer Claire Delbos also in 1932. Their marriage inspired him to both compose works for her to play (Thème et variations for violin and piano in the year they were married) and to write pieces to celebrate their domestic happiness, including the song cycle Poèmes pour Mi in 1936, which he orchestrated in 1937. Mi was Messiaen's affectionate nickname for his wife. In 1937 their son Pascal was born. The marriage turned to tragedy when Delbos lost her memory after an operation towards the end of World War II. She spent the rest of her life in mental institutions.In 1936, along with André Jolivet, Daniel-Lesur and Yves Baudrier, Messiaen formed the group La jeune France (\\"Young France\\").

Let's break down the components of both the premise and the hypothesis first. Premise: 1. Three children 2. Wearing jackets 3. Looking at the water's edge 4. Observing their reflections in a lake Hypothesis: 1. Funny humans 2. Wearing jackets Now, let's compare the components of the premise and the hypothesis. 1. Three children (Premise) vs. Funny humans (Hypothesis): The premise mentions three children, while the hypothesis states 'funny humans.' Children are indeed humans. However, the term \\"funny\\" is not present in the premise, and there is no evidence suggesting the children are humorously inclined or engaging in funny activities. 2. Wearing jackets (Premise) vs. Wearing jackets (Hypothesis): This element is consistent in both the premise and the hypothesis, as both mention individuals wearing jackets. 3. Looking at the water's edge and observing their reflections in a lake (Premise): This element does not appear in the hypothesis. While this element provides context and describes a specific scenario that the children are engaged in, it does not support or refute the hypothesis. In conclusion, given the current information, we cannot definitively prove the hypothesis \\"Funny humans in jackets\\" true based solely on the premise. Although the children are humans wearing jackets, as stated in the hypothesis, there is no mention of them being 'funny.' The information provided in the premise does not offer sufficient evidence to validate the hypothesis entirely.

Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990. After reading the above, is \\"Sunni\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What religion were the majority of Albanians beforeIslam emerged as the majority religion?\\"?","completion":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"What religion were the majority of Albanians before Islam emerged as the majority religion?\\" is not Sunni. Prior to the emergence of Islam as the majority religion, Albanians were largely Christianized. The historical record indicates that by the late 11th century, they were already fully Christianized. The Christian Albanians were mainly split between the Orthodox Church in the south and the Roman Catholic Church in the north. So, before the majority of Albanians adopted Islam, Christianity was the dominant religion among them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In this example, it is: ['e', 'v', '8279', '5489', '2541', '5965', 'k', '3437', '3277', '2597', '2605', '8979', 'Y', 'b', '5607', '3437', 'y', 'Y', 'i', 'o', 'T', 'Y', 'r', 'K', 'k', '1065', 'c', 'J', 'O', 'j', '2777'] 2.

Now, we need to find the positions of these numerical elements in the list and store them in order. We can use a for loop to iterate through each element, and as we find a numerical element, we store its position (index + 1) in the result.

The answer is:","completion":"Astronaut Klaus-Dietrich Flade and astrophysicist Dirk Frimout are both notable individuals in their respective fields of space exploration and research. By examining their birthdates, we can determine who is older between the two. Klaus-Dietrich Flade is a German astronaut who participated in the Russian-German Euromir-92 space mission. Flade was born on August 23, 1952, in Büdesheim, Germany. Flade's involvement in the space program began in 1983 when he joined the German Aerospace Center (DLR). He was eventually selected as an astronaut candidate and, on March 17, 1992, as part of the Euromir-92 mission, became the fifth German astronaut to go to space. Dirk Frimout is a Belgian astrophysicist and astronaut who became the first Belgian citizen to participate in a space mission. Born on March 21, 1941, in Poperinge, Belgium, Frimout initially pursued a career in physics and electrical engineering. His astrophysics research led him to collaborate with NASA on several occasions during the 1970s and 1980s. Frimout eventually became a payload specialist astronaut and flew on the Space Shuttle Atlantis for the STS-45 mission, which launched on March 24, 1992. Comparing their birthdates, we find that Dirk Frimout was born on March 21, 1941, while Klaus-Dietrich Flade was born on August 23, 1952. With these facts in mind, it is clear that Dirk Frimout is older than Klaus-Dietrich Flade. As of their respective birthdates, Frimout is approximately 11 years and 5 months older than Flade. Both individuals have made significant contributions to the fields of space exploration and research, but it is Dirk Frimout who holds seniority in terms of age."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie plot title: We Were Soldiers Movie plot: A French Army unit is on patrol in pre-Vietnam IndoChina in July 1954 during the First Indochina War. The captain of the patrol curses the land when they see nothing. Then, the unit is suddenly ambushed by hundreds of Vietminh soldiers who kill the officers and, although the unit kills many Vietminh, it is eventually overrun. One Vietminh officer, Nguyen Huu An (Duong Don), hypothesizing that if they take no prisoners the French will eventually stop sending troops, orders the execution of all surviving French soldiers.Eleven years later, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), a dedicated U.S. soldier, is deeply committed to training his troops, who are preparing to be sent to Vietnam. The night before their departure, the unit's officers hold a party to celebrate. Moore learns from a superior officer that his unit will be known as the 1st Battalion / 7th cavalry regiment. He is disquieted because the 7th Cavalry regiment was the unit commanded by General George Custer in the 19th Century when he and his men were slaughtered at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. Moore is also dismayed because President Lyndon B. Johnson has decreed that the war would be fought \\"on the cheap,\\" without declaring it a national emergency. As a result, Moore believes he will be deprived of his oldest, best-trained soldiers (a formal declaration of war would have meant mobilization and extension of the terms of enlistment for volunteer soldiers) - about 25% of his battalion - just prior to shipping out for Vietnam. Before leaving for Vietnam, Moore delivers a touching speech to his unit:\\"Look around you, in the 7th Cavalry,we got a Captain from the Ukraine, another from Puerto Rico, we got Japanese, Chinese, Blacks, Hispanics, Cherokee Indian, Jews and Gentiles, all American.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? While in the shower, rub a piece of lemon or lime over the skin that most likely has deposits of vapors from cooking such as hands, face, and arms. The acidity in lime will help to break down the essential oils that cause the lingering curry smell. Finish by washing with soap and water as usual. Be sure to avoid open cuts or wounds on the skin as this can cause painful stinging or burning. Avoid putting on any of the same clothing articles that were used while cooking, for instance a hat or sweater. You can try using air diffusers, air deodorizing sprays, plug-ins, or scented candles. Also of great use are air fresheners that allow you to spray on fabrics. Spray all items that are in the cooking vicinity until damp, such as the carpet, upholstery, drapes or walls. A combination of many products will work well. Be sure to carefully read instructions on the packaging label to ensure proper use. Put two cups of water in a pot on the stove and bring it to a boil. Add fragrant materials such as Kewra (Screwpine) leaves or vanilla beans/extract, and turn the heat down to a simmer. Allow it to simmer for at least one hour. The smell emitted will mask the lingering curry odor. Screwpine leaves are also known as pandan leaves and can be purchased at the local Asian grocer or specialty grocery store.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is transcendental wild oats about Suggested answer: Sister Hope organizes the only available help, three little girls and a boy, and manages to save the crop. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"To properly assess this answer's validity, it would be best to first provide a detailed overview of the story \\"Transcendental Wild Oats\\" for better understanding and context. \\"Transcendental Wild Oats\\" is a satirical short story written by American author Louisa May Alcott, published in 1873. It is a semi-autobiographical sketch based on Alcott's experiences when her family was a part of the Fruitlands utopian community founded by her father Bronson Alcott and Charles Lane in 1843. This utopian experiment was heavily influenced by Transcendentalism, an intellectual movement emphasizing individualism, self-reliance, and the importance of nature. The story revolves around the journey of a small group of idealistic individuals led by Timon Lion (representing Bronson Alcott) and Abel Lamb (representing Charles Lane), who form a utopian community called \\"Consociate Family.\\" These individuals are determined to create a perfect society distanced from materialism and focused on embracing nature and achieving spiritual fulfillment. In the story, Sister Hope (representing Louisa May Alcott's mother, Abigail May) plays a significant role in maintaining the practical aspects of the community. As the only pragmatic and resourceful member of the family, she is responsible for managing the planting, cooking, and child-rearing tasks while the male members of the group indulge in philosophical discussions and spiritual pursuits. The suggested answer here mainly focuses on the subplot where Sister Hope, along with the help of a few children, saves the crops in the community. While this does touch upon a relevant aspect of the story, it does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the overall plot and the main themes, such as the characters' struggle to balance their personal beliefs and the practical necessities of daily life, and the ultimate failure of the Fruitlands experiment. Therefore, a more suitable and detailed answer to the question \\"What is Transcendental Wild Oats about?\\" would be the following: \\"Transcendental Wild Oats\\" is a satirical story by Louisa May Alcott, based on her family's experience in a utopian community called Fruitlands. The story revolves around a group of idealistic individuals who attempt to establish a perfect society focused on self-reliance, spiritual growth, and harmony with nature. The main character, Sister Hope, symbolizes the practical, grounded force amidst the impractical and idealistic members in this experimental community. By highlighting the challenges faced by the characters, Alcott communicates the impracticality of this utopian vision and the importance of balancing personal beliefs with the demands of everyday life. In conclusion, the suggested answer should not be validated as it does not adequately address the central themes and storyline of \\"Transcendental Wild Oats.\\" The more comprehensive answer provided above would serve as a better representation of the story's content and meaning."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What was the full name of the person whose actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government? is inside the article: The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's..., can you guess it ?

The fighting was followed by death sentences and mass executions. Those who were found carrying weapons at the time of their arrest were shot—including the wounded. On 3 April 1920, Reichspräsident Ebert forbade these summary executions. On 12 April 1920, General von Watter forbade his soldiers from engaging in \\"unlawful behaviour\\".

The brown tree snake is a nonnative species found on the South Pacific island of Guam. The brown tree snake population in Guam is so large that it negatively affects the humans there. Which statement best explains why the brown tree snake has flourished in Guam? Pick the answer from these options","completion":"Unfortunately, I cannot select an answer from a list of provided options as no options are provided in your input. However, I can provide you with a detailed explanation of why brown tree snakes have flourished on the island of Guam. The brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) is native to the Indo-Pacific region, spanning from the west coast of India to Australia. It was accidentally introduced to Guam after World War II when it likely stowed away aboard cargo ships or planes delivering supplies. Since then, the brown tree snake has flourished on the island due to several reasons: 1. Lack of natural predators: In its native range, the brown tree snake faces predation from large reptiles, birds, and mammals. However, on Guam, the snake has few natural predators, allowing it to reproduce and expand its population without significant threats. 2. Abundant prey: The brown tree snake is a generalist predator, meaning that it preys on a wide range of species. Guam had a rich variety of native bird and small mammal populations that were entirely unaccustomed to dealing with snake predators. This provided the brown tree snake with an abundance of resources for both growth and reproduction. 3. Reproduction: The brown tree snake is an efficient breeder, with females capable of laying 4 to 12 eggs per clutch. Additionally, the snake can reproduce throughout the year, enabling rapid population growth. 4. Climbing ability: Brown tree snakes are excellent climbers. This attribute aids them in approaching birds in their nesting areas, which provides a healthy supply of food. Furthermore, their climbing skill allows them to traverse Guam's various habitats easily. 5. Human activity: Guam is home to both military and civilian activities that contribute to the spread of the brown tree snake. Transport of cargo and materials by ship, plane, or land vehicle offers an avenue for the snakes to enter new locations.

How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea? Have we been influenced by something, processed it...

On 4 June 1920, he was created Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killarney. He began to take on more royal duties. He represented his father, and toured coal mines, factories, and railyards. Through such visits he acquired the nickname of the \\"Industrial Prince\\". His stammer, and his embarrassment over it, together with his tendency to shyness, caused him to appear much less impressive than his older brother, Edward.

There, he discovers a series of illegal full-contact Mixed Martial Arts matches dominated by inmate Yuri Boyka. The prison officials arrange these fights and place large side-bets to make a personal profit, often at the expense of the fighters.Once inside, the warden and legal adviser for Chambers state that if he fights Yuri in the ring, he will likely get an expedited appeal and early release. He initially refuses, but after spending time in demeaning physical labor in the prison's sewer system and experiencing firsthand the brutality of the guards, he reluctantly agrees. He is rescued from both forms of humiliation by a crippled inmate, Crot (Eli Danker). Both fighters train hard for the match, though Chambers still relies on his boxing background while Boyka prepares a series of deadly kicks, throws, and grappling combinations designed to humiliate his opponent in the ring. Prior to the fight however, Boyka's friends force George's cellmate, Steven, who is acting as his cornerman, to spike his water with a light sedative during the fight.During the fight, Chambers is somewhat taken by surprise at the flurry and variety of Boyka's attacks, but manages to hold his own through the first round by keeping his distance, staying calm, and dealing out painful punching combinations whenever possible. At the end of the first round, Steven slips the drugged water into Chambers' mouth and he takes a few sips. During the second round, he starts to lose his focus and begins taking more and more punishment until Boyka knocks him out with a devastating flying kick.

Man Cave With a View “For 10 years I was dreaming about it, for five years I was looking for a spot for it, for two years working on it, for another two years building it, and finally here it is,” says Alexandre de Betak, luxuriating in the master bedroom of the house he has created, inside and out, in a small coastal village in the Tramuntana region of Majorca. Like virtually every other room, this one has devastating views of the Mediterranean Sea, oddly curvaceous white plaster walls and a surfeit of unpretentious, quirky design gestures. Consider a pair of shutters set in a rounded expanse — painted olive gray-green, a shade approved by the village’s strict building code — that open to reveal a view of, no, not the orange grove that forms a part of the property, nor the ancient terraces laid out by the Moors a thousand years ago, but a wide-screen TV. But ask de Betak if the undulating surfaces — there’s hardly a right angle in the place — are meant to evoke the spirit of Antoni Gaudí, and he laughs and concedes that the influence is more like Barbapapa, the shape-shifting cartoon character from the 1970s. “I love ’70s organic architecture,” he says. “I am very influenced by the time when I grew up.” Every piece of site-specific furniture, every matte-brass faucet custom ordered from Britain, every faux-vintage ceramic and olive wood light dimmer, has been stage managed by de Betak, 42, a renowned events producer, art director and designer whose work includes fashion shows and extravaganzas for clients from Dior to Rodarte to Tiffany. Among his memorable spectacles was Jennifer Lopez’s fragrance introduction, for which he sent up fireworks spelling out “J.Lo Glow” in the night sky. His company, Bureau Betak, has offices in New York, Paris and Shanghai. The specially commissioned neon sculpture above the stairs featuring bright Chinese characters (its installation, according to witnesses, was no picnic) is an homage to de Betak’s recent flood of Asian commissions. “In a way, this is a house that China built,” he admits. When asked to translate the sign, which is inspired by so-called massage parlors, he laughs and answers, “stone house by the sea.” De Betak’s earliest days in fashion are directly responsible for his romance with the area, which has the charm and expat appeal of Amagansett circa 1960. His first client, the designer Sybilla, brought him here 20 years ago — a time when the village was so underdeveloped that many of the houses had no phone service. (De Betak remembers waiting for hours at the town’s sole phone booth for a call from Donna Karan.) Though it is a tiny outpost — six square miles between mountain and sea; a scant 800 or so people residing in perfectly harmonious homes (thank those tough building codes) — it became a hugely stabilizing force in de Betak’s wildly peripatetic life. “I travel like a maniac, and the only place I stay a month is here. I’ve never accepted a job for August!” he says. “Sometimes I pick up my two boys from school in Paris [the model and actress Audrey Marnay is their mother], and we hop on the last plane to Majorca. Even just for the weekend, it’s a big life changer to come here.” His refuge may be remote, but it’s certainly not intended for solitary contemplation. Today de Betak is hosting a luncheon under a canopy of olive branches for 20-odd visitors, among them many of the local people who worked on the house. Two little guests in glittery tutus (they wear school uniforms during the week, so they break out on Sundays) delight in showing off various amusing aspects of the house: the spigot in the kitchen wall — matte brass, of course — that dispenses wine; the three blob-shaped sleeping cutouts in the children’s room that require scrambling up a white wall, a maneuver that only a particularly dexterous 5-year-old can accomplish. A secret door inside the children’s closet leads to a storage space crammed with what looks like hundreds of baskets of light bulbs. (“I always loved bulbs,” de Betak explains, “and I use light a lot in my shows. In my office in Paris I have 300 bulbs.”) Rows of duffel bags contain almost the entire stock of vintage linen from a military surplus dealer at Paris’s Porte de Clignancourt market. De Betak uses the fabric to create all the cushions and bed linens in the house. “It’s very practical,” he says, and indeed, stacks of beige pillows, saved from predictability by the one-of-a-kind sofas they enhance, are easily tossed in the wash if and when a tipsy guest splashes some spigot-poured wine. De Betak wanted the place to be ecologically sensitive and in tune with the local culture, “but twisted in my way.” So a guest cabin that is nicknamed “Can Pitufo” — or “Smurf House” — has been built around a tree, which had the builders tearing their hair out. “Chop it down!” they pleaded, but de Betak, who strikes one as cheerfully compulsive and happily headstrong, insisted, and now a spa-worthy shower wraps around that natural wonder. The techniques he employs as a master showman served him well in building the house, only now the results are meant to last 200 years rather than 20 minutes: “I rendered everything with mood boards, and then with 3-D drawings of specific ideas.” Which was a good thing, considering that these notions included projects not necessarily familiar to Majorcan craftsmen, like clay ashtrays in the shape of R2-D2 and Darth Vader, and Flintstone-esque iPod docks encased in stone. “There’s so much made of rock here — rock lamps, rock sinks, rock tubs, even a rock TV. Maybe I should do a line of rock accessories?” he suggests, only half-joking. De Betak says he wanted the ambience to be “very minimal but warm,” and though he is not specifically referring to the fact that the compound has surround sound but no air-conditioning, he could be describing the blend of naturalism and witty modernism that is central to the endeavor. “It’s the most fun project I have ever done. I am a perfectionist, but you can’t make it perfect,” he says with a sigh, looking out over the pool with its glistening Nile-green glass tiles — locally sourced — to the sea beyond. “The house was made for life, and it should never be really finished. It’s a good lesson. What in life is ever really finished?” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article details the construction and design journey of Alexandre de Betak's house in Majorca. De Betak, a renowned events producer, art director, and designer, spent almost two decades dreaming of and building this house. The dwelling is conceived in organic shapes, taking cues from 70's architecture and featuring custom-made furnishings, faucets, and light dimmers intended to last for centuries. De Betak emphasized the importance of the location's local culture and ecological sensitivity within his design. Highlight features include a master bedroom with a captivating Mediterranean Sea view, a neon sculpture featuring Chinese characters, and an ecologically sensitive guest cabin built around a tree, he calls \\"Smurf House\\". De Betak made the house quirky yet functional, with inventions such as a kitchen wall spigot dispensing wine.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Captain James Cook (7 November 1728 - 14 February 1779) was a British explorer, navigator, cartographer, and captain in the Royal Navy. Cook made detailed maps of Newfoundland prior to making three voyages to the Pacific Ocean, during which he achieved the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands, and the first recorded circumnavigation of New Zealand. Cook joined the British merchant navy as a teenager and joined the Royal Navy in 1755. He saw action in the Seven Years' War, and subsequently surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the Saint Lawrence River during the siege of Quebec. In 1766, the Admiralty engaged Cook to command a scientific voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The purpose of the voyage was to observe and record the transit of Venus across the Sun for the benefit of a Royal Society inquiry into a means of determining longitude. Cook, at the age of 39, was promoted to lieutenant to grant him sufficient status to take the command. For its part the Royal Society agreed that Cook would receive a one hundred guinea gratuity in addition to his Naval pay. The expedition sailed aboard HMS Endeavour, departing England on 26 August 1768. Cook and his crew rounded Cape Horn and continued westward across the Pacific to arrive at Tahiti on 13 April 1769, where the observations of the Venus Transit were made. However, the result of the observations was not as conclusive or accurate as had been hoped. Once the observations were completed, Cook opened the sealed orders which were additional instructions from the Admiralty for the second part of his voyage: to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated rich southern continent of Terra Australis. Cook then sailed to New Zealand and mapped the complete coastline, making only some minor errors. He then voyaged west, reaching the south-eastern coast of Australia on 19 April 1770, and in doing so his expedition became the first recorded Europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline. On 23 April he made his first recorded direct observation of indigenous Australians at Brush Island near Bawley Point, noting in his journal: \\"...and were so near the Shore as to distinguish several people upon the Sea beach they appear'd to be of a very dark or black Colour but whether this was the real colour of their skins or the C[l]othes they might have on I know not.\\" On 29 April Cook and crew made their first landfall on the mainland of the continent at a place now known as the Kurnell Peninsula. Cook originally christened the area as \\"Stingray Bay\\", but later he crossed this out and named it \\"Botany Bay\\" after the unique specimens retrieved by the botanists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander. It is here that James Cook made first contact with an aboriginal tribe known as the Gweagal. After his departure from Botany Bay he continued northwards. He stopped at Bustard Bay (now known as Seventeen Seventy or 1770) at 8 o'clock on 23 May 1770. On 24 May Cook and Banks and others went ashore. Continuing north, on 11 June a mishap occurred when HMS Endeavour ran aground on a shoal of the Great Barrier Reef, and then \\"nursed into a river mouth on 18 June 1770\\". The ship was badly damaged and his voyage was delayed almost seven weeks while repairs were carried out on the beach (near the docks of modern Cooktown, Queensland, at the mouth of the Endeavour River). The voyage then continued, sailing through Torres Strait and on 22 August Cook landed on Possession Island, where he claimed the entire coastline that he had just explored as British territory. He returned to England via Batavia (modern Jakarta, Indonesia), where many in his crew succumbed to malaria, and then the Cape of Good Hope, arriving at the island of Saint Helena on 12 July 1771. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"This article provides a comprehensive overview of Captain James Cook's life and his significant role in exploring and mapping uncharted territories. Cook was a skilled navigator, cartographer, explorer, and captain in the Royal Navy. Apart from the detailed maps of Newfoundland he created prior to his voyages to the Pacific Ocean, it's fascinating to know that his exploration led to the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of Australia, the Hawaiian Islands, and the circumnavigation of New Zealand. Interesting aspects from the article include the primary scientific purpose of his first Pacific voyage: to observe and record the transit of Venus across the Sun. This mission was designed to benefit the Royal Society's research into determining longitude. Even though the results of the observations were not as accurate as they had hoped, the voyage led to critical exploration and mapping of many new territories. The article also sheds light on Cook's extensive exploration of Australia and New Zealand. Upon reaching the southeastern coast of Australia, his crew became the first recorded Europeans to encounter the eastern coastline. Cook showed careful observance and cultural sensitivity during his first recorded direct observation of indigenous Australians on Brush Island, where he noticed their dark skin but was uncertain if it was their natural color or clothing. Captain Cook's journey also led him to Botany Bay, where he made first contact with the Gweagal tribe of Aboriginal Australians. This region was initially christened as \\"Stingray Bay,\\" but he later changed its name to \\"Botany Bay\\" after the unique plant specimens discovered there by botanists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander. Another intriguing detail narrates Cook's mishap when his ship, HMS Endeavour, ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, requiring nearly seven weeks of reparations on a nearby beach. Ultimately, Cook's voyage culminated in him claiming the entire coastline he explored as British territory on Possession Island. His return journey to England was marked with challenges, such as his crew suffering from malaria in Batavia (modern Jakarta, Indonesia). In summary, the article presents an insightful account of Captain James Cook's life, highlighting his significant contributions to navigational science, cartography, and exploration of uncharted territories. His voyages and discoveries continue to hold great historical importance and have enhanced our understanding of the world."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Why would a company be going public?

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What does Anakin win? Anakin wins the pod race and eventually his freedom. Answer:","completion":"Title: Race to Freedom Step 1: Introduction of Characters and Setting The movie is set on Tatooine, a desert planet under the control of the Hutt crime lords. Anakin Skywalker is a young slave, gifted with mechanical skills and a strong connection to the Force. He lives with his mother, Shmi Skywalker, who is also a slave, and their owner Watto, a greedy merchant who takes advantage of Anakin's talents. Step 2: Anakin's Dream and Discovery Anakin has a dream one night and sees a vision of himself winning a podrace, a deadly and popular sport on Tatooine. Convinced that this dream is a sign, he starts to build his own podracer, using salvaged parts and his mechanical skills, and secretly training for the race. Step 3: Arrival of New Characters Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi Knight, and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi arrive on Tatooine with Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo, seeking help in repairing their damaged spaceship. They are pursued by the Trade Federation, which has blockaded and invaded their planet. Anakin meets them and offers help, recognizing them as potential allies in his quest for freedom. Step 4: Deal with Watto Qui-Gon, aware of Anakin's strength in the Force and his dream of winning the podrace, strikes a deal with Watto. If Anakin wins the race, he and his mother will be granted their freedom; if he loses, Watto will keep their ship. Watto, confident that Anakin's homemade podracer stands no chance against the experienced racers, agrees to the deal. Step 5: Preparing for the Race Anakin and his new friends work together to finalize the podracer, using parts from both the damaged spaceship and Anakin's own creation. Along the way, they face sabotage attempts, threats from rival racers, and the hostile environment of Tatooine. Step 6: The Podrace On the day of the race, Anakin and his podracer face off against formidable opponents, including the reigning champion, Sebulba, who will stop at nothing to win. With the help of his friends, his instincts, and the Force, Anakin races through treacherous terrains and overcomes numerous obstacles to ultimately achieve a stunning victory. Step 7: Aftermath of the Race Anakin wins his freedom, but Watto, angered by his loss, refuses to let Shmi go. Qui-Gon, respecting the deal, takes Anakin with him to become a Jedi, promising that one day he will return to free Shmi. Anakin leaves Tatooine with mixed emotions, embarking on a new journey that will eventually shape the future of the galaxy. Step 8: Foreshadowing the Future As Anakin trains with the Jedi, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan sense both incredible potential and great danger in him, hinting at his eventual transformation into the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Meanwhile, the Trade Federation's invasion of Naboo escalates into a larger conflict, setting the stage for the events that will entwine Anakin, Padmé, and the galaxy's fate in the following films. In conclusion, \\"Race to Freedom\\" is a thrilling and emotional journey centered around Anakin's path to freedom and self-discovery, while also laying the groundwork for the larger Star Wars saga."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Question: \\"What is the organometallic precursor for the Grignard reaction?\\" Context: \\"There are many important organozinc compounds. Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties, synthesis and reactions. Among important applications is the Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester(ROCOCOOR) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X, zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR, the Reformatskii reaction which converts α-halo-esters and aldehydes to β-hydroxy-esters, the Simmons–Smith reaction in which the carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide reacts with alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane, the Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds. The Barbier reaction (1899) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two. In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water. On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, are expensive and difficult to handle. Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc, diethylzinc and diphenylzinc. In one study the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors:\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The organometallic precursor for the Grignard reaction is an organomagnesium halide (RMgX), where R is an alkyl or aryl group, and X is a halogen. Step-by-step analysis: 1. Identify the type of reaction: Based on the context given, we are looking for the organometallic precursor for the Grignard reaction. 2. Understand the Grignard reaction: The Grignard reaction is a fundamental organic reaction that involves the addition of an organomagnesium halide (Grignard reagent) to a carbonyl compound, such as an aldehyde or ketone, to form an alcohol. 3. Identify the organometallic precursor: In the Grignard reaction, the organometallic precursor is the Grignard reagent itself, which is an organomagnesium halide (RMgX), where R is an alkyl or aryl group, and X is a halogen (commonly chlorine, bromine, or iodine). Justification for each step: 1. The mention of the Grignard reaction in the context implies that we need to find the precursor for this specific reaction. 2. The Grignard reaction has widespread applications in organic chemistry and is widely studied; understanding its mechanism helps to identify the precursor. 3. The Grignard reagent is both the starting material and the organometallic precursor for the Grignard reaction, as it is the metal-organic compound that reacts with carbonyl compounds to form alcohols."},{"prompt":"Information: - In science fiction stories or Superhero comics, X-ray vision is the ability to see through physical objects at the discretion of the holder of this superpower.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Choices: - actin - cyclin - keratin - tubulin A: The answer is:","completion":"tubulin. Based on the question, we are looking for a globular protein used in the construction of a hollow tube. Tubulin is a well-known globular protein that plays a key role in constructing the hollow tubes known as microtubules. Microtubules are part of the cell's cytoskeleton, which provides the basic structural framework of cells and helps maintain their shape. They also aid in various cellular processes such as transport, cell division, and cellular movement. Tubulin is a protein dimer, made up of two different subunits: α-tubulin and β-tubulin, which come together in a head-to-tail arrangement to create a linear protofilament. Multiple protofilaments then align laterally, typically in groups of 13, to form the cylindrical microtubule structure. It is important to note that the other options given - actin, cyclin, and keratin - also have valuable roles in the cell, but do not specifically construct hollow tubes: 1. Actin: Actin proteins form microfilaments, which are thin, flexible filaments that are part of the cytoskeleton. However, these filaments are not hollow tubes. Actin plays crucial roles in cell motility, muscle contraction, and in maintaining cell shape and structure. 2. Cyclin: Cyclins are proteins that regulate the cell cycle by binding to cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Though important for controlling cell growth and division, cyclins do not play any role in the formation of hollow tubes. 3. Keratin: Keratins are fibrous structural proteins that constitute key components of hair, nails, and the outer layer of the skin. Keratins form intermediate filaments, another element of the cytoskeleton, which provide mechanical strength and maintain cell shape. However, these filaments are not hollow tubes like microtubules. In conclusion, tubulin is the correct answer to the question, as it is the specific globular protein involved in constructing hollow tubes, namely microtubules, in the cell."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

David Cameron will today plead with Greece’s new far-Left leader to end a standoff over his country’s vast debts. The Prime Minister is due to hold one-on-one talks in Brussels with Alexis Tsipras, whose government is threatening to turn to Russia for help if the Eurozone cuts it adrift. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has sent shockwaves through Europe after declaring that if Athens does not continue its aid programme with tough conditions ‘then that’s it’. ‘We have a programme,’ he added. ‘The programme is either brought properly to an end or there is no programme.’ Scroll down for video Yesterday, the Greek government presented its demands at an emergency meeting of","completion":"Eurozone finance ministers in Brussels. The demands included ending austerity measures, reducing Greece's massive debt burden, and providing financial assistance to revive its struggling economy. These proposals were met with resistance from some Eurozone countries, particularly Germany, which has been the main contributor to Greece's bailout packages since 2010. Berlin insists that Athens must continue with the agreed-upon reforms and fiscal discipline in order to receive further aid. David Cameron's intervention comes at a critical moment, as the standoff between Greece and its international creditors – the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund – continues to escalate, raising concerns about a potential \\"Grexit,\\" or Greek exit from the Eurozone. Mr. Cameron hopes to convince Mr. Tsipras to reach a compromise with the Eurozone nations and to continue with the necessary economic reforms to ensure the stability of Greece and the European currency. The Prime Minister's plea is also driven by concerns about the potential impact of a Grexit on the UK's economy and political landscape. British businesses have significant investments in Greece, and a Greek exit from the Eurozone could lead to financial instability and loss of confidence in the European market. Furthermore, a Grexit could potentially embolden Eurosceptic movements across the continent, including in the UK, where calls for a referendum on EU membership have been gaining traction. Despite these concerns, Alexis Tsipras has remained defiant in the face of pressure from both the Eurozone and the UK, arguing that the austerity measures imposed on his country have led to poverty, unemployment, and a humanitarian crisis. The Greek leader, who was elected earlier this year on an anti-austerity platform, has vowed to reject any deal that does not address the urgent needs of the Greek people and has threatened to turn to other sources of support, like Russia, if Eurozone nations refuse to renegotiate the terms of Greece's debt. In response to the escalating situation, European Union leaders have been exploring possible solutions, including the provision of short-term bridge financing to Greece, which would allow it to meet its immediate debt obligations while negotiations continue. However, this proposal has been met with skepticism from some member states, who argue that it would merely postpone the inevitable reckoning over Greece's future in the Eurozone. As the clock ticks toward an impending deadline, David Cameron's meeting with Alexis Tsipras today may prove to be a pivotal moment in the ongoing Greek debt crisis. If the two leaders can find a common ground and persuade the Eurozone to adopt a more flexible approach to the terms of Greece's financial assistance, it could prevent a disastrous Grexit, secure the future of the European project, and avert a potential crisis for the United Kingdom. However, if their talks fail to produce a consensus, the prospect of a disorderly Greek exit from the Eurozone will loom ever larger, with potentially disastrous consequences for Greece, its European partners, and the global economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You are presented with the question \\"What type of environment is a cacti adapted to?\\" and the following answer choices: - cool - Wet - Dry - arid - Dark - H20 - soil - Cold Now knowing that plants that are adapted to very dry environments are called xerophytes and bromeliads and cacti are xerophytes, choose the best answer. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Dry and arid. Cacti, being xerophytes, are specifically adapted to thrive in environments with little water supply, which typically includes dry and arid regions. These conditions force cacti to develop adaptations that enable them to conserve water and survive in such climates. Some of the prominent adaptations seen in cacti include: 1. Shallow root systems: Cacti have an extensive network of shallow roots that quickly absorb water when it is available. This allows them to capitalize on short bursts of rain or moisture in their environment. 2. Succulent stems: The thick, fleshy stems of cacti act as water storage facilities, allowing them to accumulate water when it is available and use it during extended periods of drought. 3. Reduced leaves: Most cacti have small or no leaves at all, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration – a process by which plants release water into the atmosphere through their leaves. Some cacti have developed spines instead of leaves, which not only helps conserve water but also provides protection from herbivores. 4. CAM photosynthesis: Unlike most plants, cacti use a process called Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis to convert sunlight into energy. This unique method allows cacti to open their stomata (small pores on the surface of the plant) at night when the air is cooler and more humid, which results in less water loss during the process of photosynthesis. 5. Slow growth: Cacti typically have a slow growth rate, which reduces the overall demand for resources, such as water, and allows them to survive in harsh, dry, and arid environments. These adaptations allow cacti to thrive in regions where water is scarce, making \\"dry\\" and \\"arid\\" the correct answer choices for the type of environment to which cacti are best adapted."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to.

By Daily Mail Reporters PUBLISHED: 13:21 EST, 29 November 2012 | UPDATED: 20:36 EST, 30 November 2012 The mother of the lesbian who was brutally beaten by her girlfriend's boyfriend on Thanksgiving said she 'knows in her heart' that his motivation was hatred because her daughter is gay. Kristi Taylor, the mother of Mallory Owens, from Mobile, Alabama, said in a statement released last night: 'I believe that Travis Hawkins Jr's rage against my daughter stemmed from Mallory being Ally's first same sex relationship. His anger towards her was for being gay.' Hawkins was arrested, charged with second-degree assault and released after the viscous beating which took place at his home while the family were eating Thanksgiving dinner. Happy couple: OPTIONS: - Alabama and Hawkins have remained together, despite the violent end to Thanksgiving dinner - Alex Hawkins and Hawkins have remained together, despite the violent end to Thanksgiving dinner - Ally and Hawkins have remained together, despite the violent end to Thanksgiving dinner - Daily Mail Reporters and Hawkins have remained together, despite the violent end to Thanksgiving dinner - Hawkins and Hawkins have remained together, despite the violent end to Thanksgiving dinner - Kristi Taylor and Hawkins have remained together, despite the violent end to Thanksgiving dinner - Mallory and Hawkins have remained together, despite the violent end to Thanksgiving dinner - Mallory Owens and Hawkins have remained together, despite the violent end to Thanksgiving dinner - Mobile and Hawkins have remained together, despite the violent end to Thanksgiving dinner - Thanksgiving and Hawkins have remained together, despite the violent end to Thanksgiving dinner - Travis and Hawkins have remained together, despite the violent end to Thanksgiving dinner - Travis Hawkins Jr and Hawkins have remained together, despite the violent end to Thanksgiving dinner","completion":"Ally and Hawkins have remained together, despite the violent end to Thanksgiving dinner.

Biologists believe that love is fundamentally a biological rather than a cultural construct, because the capacity for love is found in all human cultures and similar behavior is found in some other animals. In humans the purpose of all the desire is to focus attention on the raising of offspring. Children demand an unusual amount of parenting, and two parents are better than one. Love is a signal that both partners are committed, and makes it more likely that this commitment will continue as long as necessary for children to reach independence. But what does science have to say about the notion of love at first sight? In recent years the ability to watch the brain in action has offered a wealth of insight into the mechanics of love. Researchers have shown that when a person falls in love, a dozen different part of brain work together to release chemicals that trigger feelings of euphoria, bonding and excitement. It has also been shown that the unconditional love between a mother and a child is associated with activity in different regions of the brain from those associated with pair-bonding love. Passionate love is rooted in the reward circuitry of the brain--the same area that is active when humans feel a rush from cocaine. In fact, the desire, motivations and withdrawals involved in love have a great deal in common with addiction. Its most intense forms tend to be associated with the early stages of a relationship, which then give way to a calmer attachment form of love one feels with a long term partner. What all this means is that one special person can become chemically rewarding to the brain of another. Love at first sight, then, is only possible if the mechanism for generating long-term attachment can be triggered quickly. There are signs that it can be. One line of evidence is that people are able to decide within a second how attractive they find another person. This decision appears to be related to facial attractiveness, although men may favor women with waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7, no matter what... When a person falls in love, _ . A) he feels as if he were addicted to cocaine B) he will be committed to the beloved as long as necessary C) he will experience a calmer attachment form of love before he feels the extreme love D) he will experience complex feelings brought on by different regions of his brain","completion":"D) When a person falls in love, they will experience complex feelings brought on by different regions of their brain. Love in its various forms engages several parts of the brain, releasing chemicals that trigger diverse feelings, such as euphoria, bonding, and excitement. For instance, passionate love is associated with the reward circuitry of the brain, which is also involved in the rush experienced from cocaine. This suggests that love can be akin to addiction, with intense feelings occurring during the early stages of a relationship. As time goes on, passionate love generally transitions into a calmer attachment form that is linked with long-term partnerships. This type of love is governed by different brain regions compared to those responsible for the bond between a mother and her child. In the context of love at first sight, it seems that the mechanism responsible for generating long-term attachment could be triggered quickly. Rapid judgments about attractiveness can occur within a second, often based on facial attractiveness or specific physical characteristics such as a woman's waist-to-hip ratio, in the case of men. Thus, when a person falls in love, they experience a complex array of feelings stemming from various regions of their brain working together to release different chemicals. This intricate process allows for an individual to feel not only a strong initial attraction but also the potential for long-term connection and attachment to a romantic partner."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The same amount of money goes a lot further in a developing country . 4. The advantage of this provision in developing rather than developed countries is cost . 5. Greece , which has had 124,000 migrants arrive in the first seven months of 2015 , a 750 % rise over the same period in 2014 , is a notable case . 6.

The sentences argue that despite being in developed countries, migrants often face inhumane conditions and poor treatment, as exemplified by the Traiskirchen migrant camp in Austria. In contrast, the same amount of aid money would go further and have a more significant impact in developing countries, making it a more practical solution. The argument also acknowledges that developed countries are dealing with increased numbers of migrants and grappling with austerity measures, which only exacerbates the challenges in providing adequate support for migrants. As a result, ensuring that aid is distributed to migrants in developing countries is a better solution in terms of cost and efficiency, allowing for the provision of safe transportation, access to essential services, and overall better treatment. Additionally, the dramatic increase in the number of migrants arriving in Greece further demonstrates the strain on resources in developed countries and supports the argument for directing aid to where it can have the most extensive impact. Overall, the implied argument suggests that investing in aid for migrants in developing countries is not only more cost-effective, but also more humane and beneficial for the migrants themselves."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? a single surprise","completion":"Determining the sentiment of the sentence \\"a single surprise\\" can be quite ambiguous and less straightforward. Sentiment analysis is often reliant on context and additional information that can provide clues about the subject matter and the emotional tone of the statement. On its own, the phrase \\"a single surprise\\" does not provide sufficient context to conclude whether the sentiment is positive or negative. However, one can analyze each word in the sentence to infer possible sentiments. The word \\"single\\" can be initially considered neutral because it does not convey any particular emotion. It only denotes the quantity or the fact that it is just one surprise we are talking about. The word \\"surprise,\\" on the other hand, can carry both positive and negative connotations, depending on the surrounding context. A surprise can be something delightful, such as receiving an unexpected gift or hearing surprising, good news. In these examples, the sentiment associated with \\"surprise\\" is indeed positive. However, a surprise can also indicate a sense of shock or an unpleasant unexpected event, such as encountering an unexpected problem or receiving upsetting news. In these cases, we would associate \\"surprise\\" with a negative sentiment. Given that the sentiment of the word \\"surprise\\" is dependent on the context, and since the given sentence does not provide additional context, it is not possible to definitively determine the sentiment of the phrase \\"a single surprise\\" without further information. To arrive at a clear conclusion, we would require more details about the nature of the surprise or the circumstances in which the sentence is used.

We didn’t try to get him Medicaid, I’m trying to pay for his insurance. But they automatically enrolled him in Medicaid.” – Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), interview on ABC’s “This Week,” Jan. 5, 2014 This column has been updated. This is an odd story — the saga of how Rand Paul’s oldest son tried to get health insurance via the Kentucky version of Obamacare, and ended up on Medicaid, the federal-state health-care program for the poor. Paul held up the card on television to prove it, saying the system was “a mess.” Our colleagues at PolitiFact beat us to the punch with a comprehensive look at what Paul says happened — and ultimately concluded it was a “he-said-she-said” situation that could not be fully adjudicated. Let’s take a close look, and see if Paul’s story adds up. Rand Paul’s son, William H. Paul, is a 20-year-old full-time student at the University of Kentucky, according to the Lexington Herald Leader. In an appearance on Fox’s “On the Record” on Jan. 8, Paul gave a more detailed version of what he says happened. He explained he was having trouble signing up for the Washington exchange, and eventually discovered it would cost an additional 6,000 to add his son to his policy. (Note: as far as we can tell, no individual policy in the DC SHOP exchange, which is used by members of Congress, for someone as young as Paul’s son costs 500 a month, even at Platinum plan rates.) Paul then said his son could not be signed up online and had to go to the “welfare office” to present his ID to “prove his existence.” According to Paul, “So he got there. He didn’t sign up for anything. And two days later, he got his Medicaid card. So he’s got Medicaid.” (Actually, unless forms were incorrectly filled out, Paul’s son should not qualify for Medicaid because he is listed as a dependent on Paul’s tax return. As a senator, Paul’s 174,000-a-year salary is too high for Medicaid, which in Kentucky is limited to individuals below 138 percent of the federal poverty level.) Paul added that when he went on the Web site of the Kentucky insurance exchange, Kynect, he encountered the same issue: “Sure enough, he does automatically enroll in Medicaid. And there’s a big button about this big on the screen. And there’s a tiny little button that says QHP, which I’m not sure anybody would know what that means, but that’s how you opt out of Medicaid. Otherwise, if you just keep going, you get Medicaid.” Okay, given the problems with the exchanges, some sort of software glitch is entirely possible. But there are some factors that raise questions about Paul’s account. 1. Kentucky, unlike some states that expanded Medicaid, decided not to allow automatic enrollment into Medicaid, according to Gwenda Bond, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services. Instead, you must fill out income and family information, and then the system will decide whether or not you can purchase a health plan but qualify for a subsidy, or whether you qualify for Medicaid. “No one is automatically enrolled in Medicaid unless they apply for it,” she said, adding that she could not comment specifically on individual applications. At the beginning of the process, Bond says, there is an option to go directly to a qualified health plan — that’s apparently the QHP that Paul mentioned — if you think you don’t qualify for subsidies. But as for Paul’s description, “that doesn’t seem like a screen that I am familiar with,” she said. Update: Here’s the opening screen shot. This is the first thing an applicant sees after creating an account on the exchange; it’s clear that you can purchase a plan without payment assistance if you like. There is no “QHP” button. “We tried to keep the language very simple and clear throughout,” Bond said. “Everything is written at a sixth grade reading level, if possible.” The full process after this screen is embedded below. 2. Kynect’s paper application for financial assistance specifically tells the applicant to stop if you are claimed as a dependent. (See question 27.) “Senator Paul and his son were attempting to enroll in a non-Medicaid plan through the exchange Web site,” said Paul spokesman Brian Darling. “They did not fill out this form, nor were they asked to provide household income information online or otherwise.” But Bond says this is impossible, unless a mistake was made: “An application for coverage would need to be completed and submitted before an individual would receive Medicaid coverage.” 3. There is another wrinkle. As a full-time student, Paul’s son is eligible to get insurance through the University of Kentucky, which has an excellent medical center. UK students already pay a mandatory health fee that covers most university services, but the university recommends insurance for procedures not covered by the fee. UnitedHealth Plan charges about 1,900 for an annual plan, or about 150 a month. So why didn’t Paul’s son take that route? “Senator Paul was attempting to use the Kentucky health insurance exchange Web site to explore plan options for his family when his son was automatically enrolled in Medicaid,” Darling said. “He has not made a final determination about health insurance coverage at this time and continues to explore possible options for purchasing coverage.” Update: Kynect provided a series of screen shots that take you through the process. If the option to not seek payment assistance is made on the first screen, then most of the remaining information (especially related to income, etc.) would not be required, because no application would be made to determine eligibility for subsidies or Medicaid. The system is designed to only take applicants through the steps they need to go through based on the initial selection or their answers as they progress through the application. Kynect Screen Shots by Glenn Kessler Like PolitiFact, we find it difficult to reach a firm conclusion at this point, but we certainly have questions. It is certainly a conundrum that what Paul says happened — automatic enrollment into Medicaid without filling out income information — is something that Kynect says is not supposed to happen. Obviously, there could be a software glitch — but at the same time Paul’s son supposedly did not take the key steps needed to enroll, so it’s unclear how the glitch could happen in the first place. Update: The screen shots provided by Kynect cast serious doubt on the details of Paul’s story. We have requested additional comment from Paul’s staff.

I was told to go to the counter and I would be helped as I approached the guy from the back ran back up front and said they do in fact haf the stem in stock. Cost 19.99. Labor 12. Less than half price! The guy at Landis couldn't even offer me any alternatives or suggestions.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. – The United Kingdom is pointing 23 Russian diplomats identified as \\"undeclared intelligence officers\\" to the exit, reports the BBC, giving them a week to pack up and get out after Moscow failed to give an explanation for how the Russian-produced nerve agent Novichok came to be used to poison former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. British Prime Minister Theresa May also uninvited Russia's foreign minister, and announced that no minister or member of the royal family will attend the Russia-hosted Fifa World Cup this year. \\"No one can come to parliament and say: 'I give Russia 24 hours,'\\" a Russian Foreign Ministry rep declared on Tuesday in reference to the deadline, reports the AP. May termed the Russian response one of \\"sarcasm, contempt, and defiance.\\" Meanwhile, the Guardian takes a look at \\"why Putin may have engineered (a) gruesome calling card.\\" Luke Harding and Andrew Roth write that whoever poisoned the Skripals could have opted for a \\"subtler weapon,\\" but instead chose something that would inevitably draw notice and trace back to Russia.

The New York Times looks at a different angle: the fact that this may be the first confirmed use of Novichok. Its recounts a former US defense official's recollection of destroying a Soviet research facility believed to be tied to Novichok nearly two decades ago; it was filled with devices to restrain dogs as they were exposed to the poison. He believed 1,000 dogs had been killed during the tests.

This is happening because a former spy named Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with a very dangerous chemical called Novichok. The British government thinks Russia is responsible for this because they made this chemical a long time ago. Now, the leaders of the United Kingdom are very upset and won't let their important government members or royal family members go to a big soccer competition in Russia called the Fifa World Cup. People are trying to figure out why Russia might have done this and some think it could be to make their own people feel like everyone is against them or to scare away rich Russians living in London.

Please answer the following question: For the past few weeks I have been talking about the merits of the Mediterranean Diet. However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Background: Baker was born into a staunch Methodist family, the youngest son of Birmingham Gas Department's chief accountant, Charles Frederick Baker and Millie Baker. His early schooling was at King Edwards Grammar School. His elder brothers, Leonard and Norman studied law, and he had a sister, Edna who was the oldest of them all. In his teens Baker began to question what religion meant to him and decided to become a Quaker, since it was closer to what he believed in. Context: While at Pithoragarh, Baker found his English construction education to be inadequate for the types of issues and materials he was faced with: termites and the yearly monsoon, as well as laterite, cow dung, and mud walls, respectively, Baker had no choice but to observe and learn from the methods and practices of vernacular architecture. He soon learned that the indigenous architecture and methods of these places were in fact the only viable means to deal with local problems. Inspired by his discoveries (which he modestly admitted were 'discoveries' only for him, and mere common knowledge to those who developed the practices he observed), he realized that unlike the Modernist architectural movement that was gaining popularity at the time denouncing all that was old just because it was old didn't make sense. Baker adopted local craftsmanship, traditional techniques and materials but then combined it with modern design principles and technology wherever it made sense to do so. This prudent adoption of modern technology helped local architecture retain its cultural identity and kept costs low due to the use of local materials. It also revived the local economy due to the use of local labour for both construction of the buildings and for manufacture of construction materials such as brick and lime surkhi. Baker built several schools, chapels and hospitals in the hills. Eventually, as word spread of his cost-effective buildings more clients from the plains started to contact Baker. One of the early clients was Welthy Fisher, who sought to set up a 'Literacy Village' in which she intended to use puppetry, music and art as teaching methods to help illiterate and newly-literate adults add to their skills. An ageing woman who risked her health to visit Laurie, she refused to leave until she received plans for the village. More and more hospital commissions were received as medical professionals realised that the surroundings for their patients were as much a part of the healing process as any other form of treatment, and that Baker seemed the only architect who cared enough to become familiarised with how to build what made Indian patients comfortable with those surroundings. His presence would also soon be required on-site at Ms. Fisher's \\"Village,\\" and he became well known for his constant presence on the construction sites of all his projects, often finalising designs through hand-drawn instructions to masons and labourers on how to achieve certain design solutions. Question: how did he do the brick walls? Answer:","completion":"To construct the brick walls, Laurie Baker followed a step-by-step process, utilizing his understanding of local craftsmanship and traditional techniques. He combined these methods with modern design principles and technology where it made sense. Here's how he did the brick walls: 1. Selection of materials: Baker chose locally sourced bricks for the construction, which ensured low costs and supported the local economy. 2. Wall foundation: He began by preparing the foundation, ensuring that it was strong enough to support the brick walls. This involved digging a trench, filling it with gravel or stones, and compacting it to provide a stable base. 3. Mortar preparation: Baker prepared the mortar using a mix of locally available materials such as lime, sand, and water. He carefully chose the proportions to create a strong bond between the bricks. 4. Bricklaying: Layer by layer, Baker laid the bricks in a specific pattern, ensuring there was a strong bond between them. He used traditional techniques like interlocking and overlapping the bricks to achieve better structural integrity. 5. Reinforcement: Where necessary, Baker incorporated modern reinforcement techniques, such as using steel bars or beams, to provide additional support to the brick walls. 6. Wall openings: For windows and doors, Baker created openings in the brick walls, ensuring proper lintels were in place to bear the load without compromising the structural integrity of the wall. 7. Finishing: Once the brick walls were complete, they were finished with a plaster made from locally available materials like cow dung, mud, and laterite. This not only provided an aesthetically pleasing finish but also added to the durability of the walls. 8. Inspection and supervision: Throughout the entire construction process, Baker was actively involved on-site, often providing hand-drawn instructions to masons and laborers on how to achieve specific design solutions. His constant presence ensured the quality of the work and adherence to his design principles."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

(Associated Press) Jean McCann,left, and Melba Underbakke, executive director, Coalition for Civil Freedom, hold a banner outside the Federal Courthouse in Orlando, Fla., during opening statements Wednesday, March 14, 2018 in the trial of Noor Salman. Salman went on trial Wednesday in Orlando. The 31-year-old is accused... (Associated Press) ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — The Orlando nightclub shooter intended to attack Disney World's shopping and entertainment complex by hiding a gun in a stroller but became spooked by police and instead chose the gay club as his target, prosecutors said Wednesday. Prosecutors revealed those details during their closing arguments in the trial of Noor Salman, the widow of Pulse nightclub shooter Omar Mateen. Salman, 31, is accused of helping her husband in the attack that killed 49 people in 2016. She is charged with obstruction and providing material support to a terrorist organization and faces up to life in prison if convicted. \\"The defendant's steps don't have to equal to her husband,\\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Sweeney told jurors. Defense attorneys described Salman as a simple woman with a low IQ who was abused by her husband, and who didn't know of his plans because he concealed much of his life from her. Attorney Charles Swift said there was no way Salman knew that Mateen would attack Pulse because he didn't know he would attack the nightclub until that evening — after he went to the complex Disney Springs. \\"It's a horrible, random, senseless killing by a monster,\\" Swift said. \\"But it wasn't preplanned. The importance to this case is that if he didn't know, she couldn't know.\\" Jurors were expected to begin deliberations later Wednesday. He said Salman's confession was coerced and she signed it because she was tired and feared losing her young son. The statement said in part that \\"the last two years, Omar talked to me about Jihad.\\" Swift said Salman wasn't an extremist, and thus not capable of such a discussion. \\"She still looks at Hello Kitty and romance novels,\\" he said. Prosecutors said Salman and Mateen had visited Disney in the days before the attack. Sweeney showed surveillance video of the Disney Springs complex that captured Mateen walking near the House of Blues club in the hours before the Pulse attack. In it, he looks behind him at police officers standing nearby before deciding to leave. \\"He had to choose a new target,\\" she said. Sweeney said Salman \\"knowingly engaged in misleading conduct\\" when she spoke to the FBI in the hours after the attack. Prosecutors said she claimed her husband didn't use the internet in their home, but he did. She also told investigators that Mateen had deactivated his Facebook account in 2013, but investigators found that he had an account up until the month of the shooting and was friends with his wife. She said her husband only had one gun when he had three, and that he wasn't radicalized even though prosecutors said he spent time watching beheading videos and looking at Islamic State group sites. Mateen, who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, was killed by police in the hours after the Pulse shooting. Sweeney also said that Mateen had bought a baby stroller and doll at Walmart on June 11 — the day before the attack — and had a plan to hide a gun in the stroller while going to Disney. Swift took the jury through the hours of Salman's life before the attack. She called a friend and her uncle in California, saying that she was coming to visit and that Mateen would be joining them. She talked with her in-laws, ate at Applebee's and texted Mateen. He didn't respond. She later went on Facebook, read a book and then texted Mateen again. \\"You know you work tomorrow,\\" she wrote. He responded: \\"You know what happened?\\" She wrote, \\"What happened?\\" Then he sent his last text: \\"I love you babe.\\" Swift said: \\"One person knows what's happened in this, and one person doesn't.\\" ||||| Jurors in the Noor Salman case now must decide whether the wife of Pulse gunman Omar Mateen was a willing participant in planning the massacre or a simple-minded spouse from whom Mateen kept his plot a secret. The 12-member jury started its deliberations at 1:42 p.m. Wednesday and was sent home for the night about 5 p.m. Jurors will resume their work Thursday. They can deliberate as long as needed to decide whether Salman, 31, is guilty of obstruction of justice and of aiding and abetting Mateen in providing of material support to a foreign terror organization, the Islamic State. During closing arguments, Salman’s attorneys argued Mateen had no reason to involve his wife in his plan to carry out mass murder June 12, 2016. “Why would he tell her?” defense attorney Charles Swift said. “I cannot think of an earthly reason for it. I cannot think of one. What could she help him with?” Swift and fellow defense attorney Linda Moreno repeated the same advice for the jury who will decide Salman’s fate: “Use your common sense.” “Why would Omar Mateen confide in Noor, a woman he clearly had no respect for?” Moreno asked. “She was not his peer, she was not his partner, and she was not his confidante.” Jury to begin delibration in the trial of Noor Salman, the widow of Pulse gunman Omar Mateen. Jury to begin delibration in the trial of Noor Salman, the widow of Pulse gunman Omar Mateen. SEE MORE VIDEOS Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Sweeney told Salman’s jury that the government does not have to prove that Salman was an extremist like her husband or knew where he planned to strike. “The defendant was not the person who pulled the trigger in the Pulse nightclub, but what she did was serve as a green light for him to commit this attack,” Sweeney said. Sweeney also countered the defense attorneys’ argument that Salman is “simple.” “She’s not stupid,” Sweeney said, noting that Salman has an associate’s degree and speaks both English and Arabic. “She does not have to be his equal in the attack, and in fact she is not,” Sweeney said. Sweeney said Pulse — where Mateen shot and killed 49 people and wounded dozens more in a bloody rampage — was not his intended target. Initially, the prosecution said, he hoped to strike at Disney Springs, a shopping, dining and entertainment complex at Walt Disney World Resort. Surveillance footage from hours before the attack shows him walking around near the House of Blues restaurant. Sweeney’s argument echoed cellphone evidence that was disclosed publicly by her defense on the eve of Salman’s trial; it placed Mateen at Disney Springs, near Epcot; and at EVE Orlando, another downtown-area club, in the hours leading up to his attack at Pulse. But Sweeney added a new detail: She showed the jury photos of a baby stroller and doll that were found in a search of the vehicle Mateen drove to Pulse after the attack. Mateen initially planned to his conceal his long gun in the stroller in order to get it into Disney Springs, Sweeney argued.

Prosecutors argue Mateen initially planned to smuggle a gun into Disney Springs inside the stroller. This evidence photo shows a stroller near a van gunman Omar Mateen drove to Pulse. Prosecutors argue Mateen initially planned to smuggle a gun into Disney Springs inside the stroller. (Evidence photo/ U.S. Attorney's Office) The stroller, she noted, was more fit for an infant than for Mateen’s then-3-year-old son. Salman’s defense seized on the admission that Mateen did not know until soon before the attack where he would strike: \\"That doesn't make it less tragic. Not in any way, shape or form. It's a horrible, random, senseless killing by a monster. But it wasn't pre-planned,\\" Swift said. \\"And if he didn't know, she couldn't know,\\" Swift argued. Six alternate jurors who also sat throughout the trial were sent home as deliberations began. They were told not to read, watch or listen to news in case a juror has an emergency before a verdict is reached. Dozens of witnesses testified over eight days. Salman chose to not testify in her own defense. She spoke to the court for the first time Wednesday — leaning into the microphone on the defense table and saying “yes” when the judge asked her whether it was her decision not to testify. To prove Salman aided and abetted Mateen, prosecutors had to show jurors that Salman knew of her husband’s plan and helped him prepare. They have pointed to Salman’s statements to FBI agents in the hours after the attack, in which agents say she confessed. According to FBI Special Agent Ricardo Enriquez, Salman described being with her husband as he drove around Pulse for 20 minutes during a family trip on June 8, 2016, and talked about attacking a club. But according to experts for both sides, neither Salman nor Mateen had ever been to Pulse.

Romulus's father Orestes rules Rome but is not Emperor himself. On the day before the coronation, Odoacer, commander of the barbarian Goths allied with Rome, demands a third of Italy from Orestes, but is rebuffed. The same day, Romulus meets the general of the Nova Invicta Legion, Aurelianus Caius Antonius, called \\"Aurelius\\". The night after Romulus is crowned, Rome is attacked by the Goths. Most of Aurelius's men, pledged to protect the emperor, are killed, though Aurelius is only stunned and left for dead. Orestes and his wife are killed by Odoacer's lieutenant Wulfila, who captures Romulus. The next day, Odoacer, now ruler of the Western Empire, plans to have Romulus killed. However, Ambrosinus convinces Odoacer to spare the boy. Instead, Romulus is exiled to Capri along with Ambrosinus, guarded by Wulfila and his men. His prison is a villa constructed more than four centuries earlier by the emperor Tiberius. With Ambrosinus's help, Romulus discovers a hidden chamber within the villa. He comes across a statue of Caesar holding the fabled sword, forged by a Chalybian smith after his military campaigns in Britain. Writing near the statue's feet proclaims the sword was made for \\"he who is destined to rule\\". This is interpreted as a prophecy by various characters, and Romulus keeps the weapon.

The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive. - IBM PC compatible computers are those similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, able to run the same software and support the same expansion cards as those. Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a \\"clean room design\\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS. - x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. - The PlayStation 2 (abbreviated as PS2) is a home video game console that was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the successor to the PlayStation, and is the second installment in the PlayStation lineup of consoles. It was released on March 4, 2000 in Japan, October 26, 2000 in North America, November 24, 2000 in Europe, and November 17, 2000 in Australia.

Problem:Passage: In 1979, the locomotive was renumbered \\"1881\\", painted black with silver stripes, and leased to a Hollywood company for use in the filming of the horror movie Terror Train (1979), starring Jamie Lee Curtis. In 1980, the locomotive was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s. The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers. The number 1293 was also restored to the engine. In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton. Ohio Central Railroad System purchased it in 1996, and it underwent a 13-month restoration. As of July 2010, Ohio Central Railroad has lost control of most of its holdings, but former owner, Jerry Joe Jacobson, maintained a collection of vintage equipment including CPR 1293 and her sister, CRP 1278, which is also a veteran of Steamtown, U.S.A. operational locomotives. No. 1293 is still operational as of October 2011.Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1278, like her sister, CPR 1293, was also built by Canadian Locomotive Company in 1948, and is a type 4-6-2, class G5d light-weight \\"Pacific\\" locomotive. It was purchased by Blount in May 1965, and renumbered 127. Blount had planned to renumber all three of the series 1200 CRP locomotives in his collection from 1246, 1278, and 1293 to 124, 127 and 129 respectively, but 1278 was the only one of the three that underwent the change. The new number remained on the locomotive from 1966 until 1973, when its former number was restored. The locomotive was leased to the Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan from 1970 to 1971. After some repair work, the locomotive was returned to Bellows Falls where it served on excursion runs. After moving to Scranton, CPR 1278 was traded to the Gettysburg Steam Railroad in Pennsylvania.

While waiting for the next river boat out, she spars with hardworking big game hunter Victor Marswell (Clark Gable), who (initially) pegs her as a certain disreputable type. When the river boat returns, it brings Donald Nordley (Donald Sinden) and his wife Linda (Grace Kelly). The Nordleys wish to go on safari to film gorillas. Marswell declines to guide them. Honey Bear rejoins the group after the steamer runs aground. Tensions run high between the two women when Linda is also attracted to Marswell. Marswell agrees to take the Nordleys into gorilla country, taking Honey Bear halfway to join the District Commissioner, who can then escort her back to civilization. However, they find the commissioner badly wounded by recently belligerent natives. With reinforcements days away, the small party narrowly escapes, taking the mortally wounded commissioner with them.

Householders in Benfleet, Essex, received the news that they would no longer be receiving mail on Saturday - in the post. The notification letters said the uneven road surfaces presented an 'unacceptable risk' and this was their last delivery. Royal Mail bosses are worried that postmen could fall off their bikes. Non-delivery: Postmen in Essex have been ordered to boycott homes on 'unmade roads', such as Catherine Road (pictured) because of health and safety fears. The move means some residents must make a return journey of almost an hour to collect their post from the sorting office. Doreen and Meredith Chatterton, aged 88 and 89, of Catherine Road in Benfleet are among those who have been told that the post they received on Saturday was their last. Mrs Chatterton said: 'Royal Mail has said it's not delivering any mail at all to the unmade roads, and there's quite a lot in this area. 'We all had the letter from Royal Mail on Saturday and it starts now so we didn't even get any warning.' The letter stated there had been 'on several occasions a number of near miss accidents' which prompted a health and safety review that found an 'unacceptable risk' for delivery to homes on unmade roads. But the couple have lived on the road since 1969 and said it had never been a problem before. Mrs Chatterton said: 'What they could do is park in Clarence Road and walk a couple of minutes down the footpath. That's how they used to deliver the mail in the old days.' Mrs Chatterton said they would now be forced to travel 25 minutes each way to the sorting office to collect their post. She said: 'We don't want to be doing that every day, especially with winter coming.' Lack of vans? The move means some residents must now make a return journey of almost an hour to collect their post from the sorting office. John Baxter, 66, who also lives on Catherine Road, said: 'The letter arrived on Saturday and said this is your last post. All of a sudden they've brought in these changes overnight. 'It's got to be a cost-cutting measure and taking vans off the route and someone's going to lose their job.' Sheila Stainer has lived in Thundersley Park Road for 30 years and said she will struggle to get to the sorting office because of a spinal disability. She said: 'The roads are not made up because we're on greenbelt, but I've never known one person to fall off their bike or slip on the road. 'They've done it without consultation from everyone or anyone.' Mel South, 60, of Wensley Road has already submitted an initial stage one appeal against the ban. In his appeal letter, he wrote: 'I am a trained manager in both health and safety and the preparation of risk assessments so I am aware that you must have an accident record log which I request site of. 'Should you not be able to re-instate deliveries this will be essential at future stages, especially if the residents enlist professional help.' Royal Mail has three months to respond to the initial appeal, before it can move to stage two and three appeals. Residents in Bower Road and Rhoda Road have also been affected. Royal Mail spokeswoman Sally Hopkins said the decision to suspend deliveries is a temporary measure. She said: 'We have reluctantly decided to temporarily suspend deliveries to a number of addresses in a particular part of Benfleet. 'This is because the private, unpaved roads in the area are in a poor state of repair. 'That poor state of repair has meant some of our vehicles have been damaged and there have been some near accidents for our postmen and women. 'It is the responsibility of the residents to ensure that private roads are fit for purpose and do not constitute a safety risk. This is far from being a trivial matter and we will not compromise on the safety of our colleagues or the roadworthiness of our vehicles.'

So a couple of weeks ago I was lucky enough to be invited to The Body Shop® blogger event at my local store in Coppergate, York.

The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up. Then everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: What would we do without humour? How would we enjoy speaking with others if we did not use humour to invite a smile or a laugh? And how would we manage in times when we feel sad and lonely? Using humour we lighten up each day, and we find common ground with others. We build healthy relationships with others by knowing what to say and what to do. When our use of humour is successful, we build trust and cooperation. We discover that we are not alone, we learn to accept our mistakes, and we look for the good in others and in ourselves. Most importantly, we create common ground, as humour is an essential skill needed to communicate well with others. A few well-chosen words get the attention of others and make a serious point without their getting defensive . Whether we prefer to be the centre of attention or to be shy and quiet, humour can be adjusted to suit our personality. However, when we lose our sense of humour, we often get critical or defensive, and we blame others or ourselves for what was said, and how it was said. To ensure that our humour is welcomed by others, we need to combine our humour with speaking clearly and listening effectively. Have you ever noticed that successful individuals often use self-depreciating humour to humble themselves, without putting themselves down? These individuals understand that every person has strengths and weaknesses and that self-depreciating humour invites others to feel more confident and equal. In this way, humour is the shortest distance between two people. Humour is the spice of life, as it brings happiness, numbs pain and it makes us speak and listen well. Question: With a sense of humour, _ . Answer:","completion":"With a sense of humour, we are able to lighten up each day, find common ground with others, build healthy relationships, establish trust and cooperation, communicate effectively, and create an environment where everyone feels more confident and equal.

The familiar Grumman LLVs now in service were built between 1987 and 1994. Upkeep for the aging vehicles has become a huge drain on USPS resources, and with the trucks only getting around 10 miles to the gallon, the service spent almost 540 million on fuel alone in the last fiscal year, reports the Wall Street Journal; the paper notes that General Motors is among those chasing a contract for 180,000 \\"next-generation\\" vehicles expected to be worth around 5 billion. In a blog post, the USPS describes fleet replacement as an opportunity to include modern safety and environmental features in its vehicles, as well as to address the huge growth in package delivery with new vehicle designs that \\"could address the challenges of larger and irregularly shaped items.\\" But the Journal notes it's still unclear where the cash-strapped Postal Service is going to find 5 billion for a new fleet of vehicles when it has already reached its 15 billion credit limit with the Treasury and lost more than 5 billion in the last fiscal year.

These trucks were made between 1987 and 1994, and because they are so old, it costs a lot of money to keep them working properly. These trucks also don't save gas very well, so USPS had to spend a lot of money on fuel last year. Now, USPS wants to get new, better trucks that are friendlier to the environment and can help deliver more packages. They will need about 180,000 new vehicles, which might cost around 5 billion. Some big companies, like General Motors, are trying to make these new trucks for USPS. The new trucks will have better safety features and will be able to carry more packages, especially the ones that are bigger and have weird shapes. However, USPS is having trouble finding the money to pay for all these new trucks because they are already in a lot of debt and they don't have much money left to spend. In short, the US Postal Service wants to replace their old, costly trucks with new, efficient ones that can carry more packages and help them save money in the long run.

Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair. During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents who live on Long Island. Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis is also having problems in his marriage. He is concerned that he is being unfair to Heather, his mistress, the same woman Mickey left, by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly (Amanda Peet), suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she has Mickey and their father, Frank, confront him about it. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful. Meanwhile, Francis' arrogance leads him to take potshots at his brother for the apparent lack of forward progression in his life with his wife, while Francis argues with Heather about her own sexual infidelity with a much older man referred to as \\"Papa\\".

They serve as the primary means of identification and play a crucial role in various domino games. In a standard set of dominoes, known as a double-six set, there are 28 tiles, each with a unique combination of pips ranging from zero (blank) to six. The tiles are typically rectangular in shape and divided into two squares by a line or ridge in the middle. Each square can contain from zero to six pips, which are usually arranged in a pattern similar to the face of a die. The number of pips on each half of the domino is used to determine the tile's value and to make plays in various domino games. For instance, in one popular game called \\"Draw Dominoes,\\" players aim to connect the tiles end-to-end by matching the number of pips on the adjacent halves. Some common domino terms, derived from the use of pips, are: 1. Double: A domino tile where both halves display the same number of pips. For example, a double-six has six pips on each half. 2. Suit: The collection of tiles that share the same number of pips on one half, e.g., all tiles with three pips on one end belong to the \\"threes suit.\\" 3. Spinner: In some domino games, an opening double, often placed perpendicular to other tiles, can be played off on all four edges, creating additional branches of play. It is worth noting that domino sets can vary in size and the range of pips, catering to different regional preferences and gameplay styles. For example, the double-nine set consists of 55 tiles, with pips ranging from zero to nine, while the double-twelve set has 91 tiles and pips from zero to twelve. Regardless of the variations, the primary purpose of the pips remains constant: to identify the numerical value of the domino and facilitate gameplay."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The information covered includes Native Americans, the city of Auburn in Alabama, and the capital city, Washington, D.C. 1. Native Americans in the United States: Native Americans, also known as American Indians or the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, are the original inhabitants of the United States before the arrival of European settlers. With a complex and rich history that stretches tens of thousands of years, Native Americans have played a crucial role in shaping the nation's cultural and historical legacy. The Native American population is represented through a diverse group of tribes, each with unique languages, beliefs, and practices. Some well-known tribes include the Navajo, Sioux, Cherokee, and Apache. It is worth noting that the circumstances facing these groups can vary significantly depending on factors such as geographical location, political affiliations, and social conditions. Native Americans continue to make vast contributions to American society through art, music, literature, and other cultural expressions. 2. Auburn, Alabama in the United States: Auburn is a city located in the southeastern state of Alabama within the United States.

Established in 1856, Auburn University is a public research institution and is the largest employer in the city. The university's impact on the local economy is considerable, with numerous businesses and services catering to the student population and university staff. The city of Auburn has earned a reputation for offering a high quality of life with a mix of recreational, cultural, and educational opportunities. The city is also known for its beautiful landscapes, tree-lined streets, and mild climate. 3. Washington, D.C. - Capital of the United States: Washington, D.C., formally known as the District of Columbia, is the capital city of the United States. Established by the U.S. Constitution in 1790, the city was chosen as the country's capital due to its strategic location along the Potomac River between the states of Maryland and Virginia. It was named after George Washington, the first President of the United States. Washington, D.C. is unique as it does not belong to any state and is governed by a special federal district status, with Congress holding ultimate authority over the city's affairs. The city is home to numerous iconic landmarks, including the White House (the official residence and workplace of the U.S. President), the U.S. Capitol (the seat of the legislative branch), and the Supreme Court (the highest court in the nation). Washington, D.C. also hosts various museums, historical monuments, and cultural institutions, such as the Smithsonian Institution, the National Gallery of Art, and many national memorials. As the political epicenter of the United States, Washington, D.C. carries significant national and international importance. Diplomatic missions, federal agencies, and non-governmental organizations are also based in the city, making it a hub for policy-making, international relations, and cultural exchange. In summary, this data provides a glimpse into the diverse and complex fabric of the United States, highlighting the Native American population, the city of Auburn in Alabama, and the nation's capital, Washington, D.C.

What's the mystery behind Tanjore temples? Choices: --no; --yes;","completion":"--no; Though both questions relate to mysteries surrounding temples in India, they refer to two different temples with different mysteries. 1. What is the real mystery behind Padmanabhaswamy Temple's seventh vault? Padmanabhaswamy Temple is a Hindu temple located in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. This temple is famous for its enormous wealth, and it holds a significant place among the devotees. The temple has a series of vaults, and among them, vault B or the seventh vault has generated the most curiosity. It is believed that this vault contains a vast treasure, which could be the largest in human history. The mystery behind the seventh vault is the question of whether it should be opened or not. According to traditional beliefs and folklore, opening the vault could invite disasters and bad luck not only to the temple but also to the whole region. This has made some people argue that the vault should be left alone. However, others believe that opening the vault could help uncover invaluable historical and cultural artifacts that could be preserved for future generations. There have been legal issues surrounding the opening of the temple's vaults. The Supreme Court of India had ordered an inventory of the temple's treasures in 2011 but later decided against opening the seventh vault. Thus, the mystery remains as to what is inside the vault and what secrets it may hold. 2. What's the mystery behind Tanjore temples? Tanjore is a city in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, known for its rich history and the famous Brihadeeswarar Temple, also known as the Big Temple. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and was built during the Chola dynasty by the king Raja Raja Chola I in the 11th century. The mystery behind the Tanjore temples mainly revolves around the Brihadeeswarar Temple. One of the major factors contributing to this mystery is the temple's architecture and construction methods. The temple has a 216-feet tall vimana (the tower above the sanctum sanctorum), and the apex or the capstone of the vimana weighs around 80 tons. The mystery lies in how the builders managed to lift the colossal capstone to the top of the vimana. Some theories suggest the use of an inclined plane or a helical structure constructed around the tower to lift the capstone, but it remains a puzzle to modern engineers. Additionally, the temple's walls are adorned with beautiful and intricate artwork and sculpture, which display an exceptional level of craftsmanship. The temple was built using granite, which is not commonly found in the surrounding area. This raises questions about the transportation of materials for its construction. In conclusion, even though both questions revolve around mysteries in Indian temples, they pertain to two different temples and the unique mysteries associated with them. The mystery in Padmanabhaswamy Temple revolves around the unopened seventh vault, whereas the mystery in Tanjore's Brihadeeswarar Temple concerns architectural and construction enigmas."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer:","completion":"In the movie Havoc, the upper class gang members live in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, a wealthy and upscale area in Los Angeles, California. They are characterized as white upper-class teenagers who are drawn to the \\"gangsta\\" lifestyle and involved in various illegal activities. The main characters include Allison (Anne Hathaway), her boyfriend Toby (Mike Vogel), and their friends Emily (Bijou Phillips) and Sam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). They live in lavish homes and are depicted as being somewhat disconnected from their wealthy backgrounds, instead seeking excitement and adventure in the grittier parts of the city. As the story unfolds, their lives intersect with those of a Latino gang led by Hector (Freddy Rodriguez), who they initially encounter while trying to buy marijuana in East LA. This sets off a chain of events that reveal the fragility and vulnerability of the upper-class gang members as they are exposed to the harsh realities of life in the lower-income neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Throughout the movie, the characters' lives are explored in various settings that provide more insight into their social backgrounds. For example, Allison's interaction with her father (Michael Biehn) at his workplace reveals the strained relationship she shares with her parents and the desire to break free from her privileged upbringing. Similarly, the party scenes at Eric's (Matt O'Leary) house and the motel reveal the characters' indulgence in drugs, alcohol, and risky behavior, all of which are stark contrasts to their seemingly comfortable lives in the Pacific Palisades. In conclusion, the movie Havoc presents a group of upper class gang members living in the affluent neighborhood of Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles. Despite their privileged backgrounds, these characters are drawn to a dangerous and chaotic lifestyle, which ultimately leads them to cross paths with members of a Latino gang from a different Los Angeles neighborhood. These interactions serve to expose the glaring disparities between the two worlds and highlight the consequences of engaging in risky and reckless behavior."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Stooges are artists (Moe is a sculptor, Larry is a music composer, and Curly is a painter) living in Paris. When the landlord comes after the overdue rent, the boys skip out and wind up accidentally joining the French Foreign Legion that they confuse with the American Legion. Posted to the desert, their assignment is to guard Captain Gorgonzola from the natives. When the captain is kidnapped, the boys are given a chance to bring him back alive. The Stooges make their way to the town where the captain was taken, all disguised as Santa Claus (complete with a sleigh and a reindeer). Despite the disguise not working, they are able to quickly knock out a guard who confronted them and make their way further into town. Ultimately, they find their captain held by a sheik trying to offer him expensive jewelry and a harem of beautiful women in exchange for the Legion's ammunition. The trio are forced to disguise themselves again as part of the harem and use an opportunity during a dance to render the sheik and his head bodyguard unconscious.

With Dellen Millard and Mark Smich facing charges of first-degree murder, the nation had anxiously waited for the trial to begin. As Sharlene recounted the harrowing details of her husband’s disappearance, she not only displayed immense strength and resilience but also set the tone for the testimonies that would follow. Sharlene's Heartbreaking Testimony On February 1, 2016, the courtroom was filled with anticipation as Sharlene was called to the stand. With quiet determination, she recounted the final moments she had spent with her husband before he left their home in Ancaster, Ontario, to show his truck to potential buyers. Expecting his quick return, she had no idea that it would be the last interaction she would ever have with him. Sharlene's testimony brought the horrifying details of Tim's kidnapping and murder to light. She revealed how her husband had been contacted by two men interested in purchasing his Dodge Ram 3500 pickup truck, which he had listed for sale online. Eager to sell his truck, Tim agreed to meet the potential buyers at his home on May 6, 2013. The men arrived in what appeared to be a test drive, and Tim took them on a short drive around the block. Despite Sharlene's uneasiness, she waved goodbye, expecting her husband to return soon. However, as the minutes turned into hours, her concern for Tim's safety only grew. Sharlene began making desperate calls to friends and family members, begging them to help search for her husband. The Hamilton police were notified, and a widespread investigation was launched. Their worst fears were confirmed when Tim's body was found burned beyond recognition in Millard's Waterloo property. The Emotional Impact As Sharlene provided her crucial testimony, the courtroom seemed to be holding its collective breath. Her words painted a vivid and heart-wrenching picture of the Bosma family's ordeal, showing the immeasurable toll that the tragedy had taken on her and her young daughter. The intensity of her grief was palpable, and her account of the events leading up to her husband's death moved many in the gallery to tears. Sharlene's testimony not only played a vital role in the trial's progression but also sent a powerful message of resilience and determination to seek justice for Tim. Her presence in the courtroom and willingness to relive painful memories demonstrated an unwavering commitment to ensuring that her husband's murderers would be held accountable for their actions. The Verdict and Beyond The trial that had captured national attention culminated in the conviction of both Dellen Millard and Mark Smich on June 17, 2016. The pair were found guilty of first-degree murder, with both receiving life sentences without parole eligibility for 25 years. As the verdict was read, Sharlene's composure and strength in the face of immense adversity inspired many, turning her into a symbol of hope for others seeking justice in similar circumstances. While nothing can bring Tim Bosma back, Sharlene's testimony as the first witness was instrumental in providing crucial details to secure convictions for his murder. As the trial reached its conclusion, the resilience and fortitude displayed by Sharlene Bosma will forever be remembered as an integral part of the Canadian legal history. In the years since the trial, Sharlene has continued her quest for justice by advocating for victim's rights and raising awareness of the potential dangers of online transactions. Through her strength and determination, she has proven that no tragedy is insurmountable and serves as an inspiration to others facing similar challenges."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Spiderland received widespread critical acclaim from music critics, including Spin, NME, and The Village Voice. In a contemporary review for Melody Maker, Steve Albini, producer of Slint's 1989 album Tweez, gave the album ten stars and called it \\"a majestic album, sublime and strange, made more brilliant by its simplicity and quiet grace.\\" Albini found its unadorned production impeccable and said that it vividly captures McMahan and Pajo's playing so well that their guitars \\"seem to hover in space directly past the listener's nose\\", while \\"the incredibly precise-yet-instinctive drumming has the same range and wallop it would in your living room.\\" Select noted that the band's popularity in the college circuit was \\"probably due to the college circuit celebrity status of their drummer – Shannon Doughton, aka Britt Walford, the only male member of the 'all-female' indie supergroup The Breeders\\".

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: In what year did the titular counselor abandon his civil servant career? ? Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant.

But in September 1984, Maria is shot and killed, and Rob claims she was murdered by a robber while he was changing a flat tire. When the police commence their investigations, however, they discover unsettling truths about the Marshalls: Rob has secretly accumulated an enormous debt and has secured a second mortgage of 100,000 in Maria's name, and is having an affair with a married neighbor, Felice Richmond (Robin Strasser). Maria had known of the affair, and had considered divorce but decided to work on their marriage shortly before she was killed. Felice gives the police a statement that Rob wanted to get rid of his wife to collect on her life insurance, and he immediately becomes the prime suspect. At first, Rob's friends and sons support him. But they begin to notice that he does not seem to be in mourning over Maria's death, and Rob's best friend Sal (Joe Spano) is angry that he is more interested in building a future with Felice. Rob is advised by his lawyer not to contact Felice because it could influence his image; this troubles Rob, who is deeply in love with her. Meanwhile, the police have expanded their list of suspects to include Andrew Meyers (Jake Dengel), a Louisiana shop clerk who had contact with Rob concerning his financial problems, and Arnie Eggers, a rumored hitman. As all evidence seems to point to Rob, Felice breaks off their relationship, which leads him to unsuccessfully attempt suicide in a motel. By this point, Chris admits for the first time that he suspects his father might in fact be guilty. Roby and John are both shocked to hear this, strongly believing in their father's innocence.

They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm.

The Bengals scored three times in the first half. Wide receiver Kelley Washington caught a 22-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Carson Palmer, and wide receiver Chad Johnson caught an 8-yard touchdown pass from Palmer, in the first quarter. Kicker Shayne Graham added three more points in the second quarter with a 37-yard field goal. Phil Dawson put the Browns' only points on the board in the first quarter with a 30-yard field goal.

Jarmusch was born January 22, 1953, in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, the middle of three children of middle-class suburbanites. His mother, of German and Irish descent, had been a reviewer of film and theatre for the Akron Beacon Journal before marrying his father, a businessman of Czech and German descent who worked for the B.F. Goodrich Company. She introduced Jarmusch to the world of cinema by leaving him at a local cinema to watch matinee double features such as Attack of the Crab Monsters and Creature From the Black Lagoon while she ran errands. The first adult film he recalls seeing was the 1958 cult classic Thunder Road, the violence and darkness of which left an impression on the seven-year-old Jarmusch. Jarmusch's final year university project was completed in 1980 as Permanent Vacation, his first feature film. It had its premiere at the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg (formerly known as Filmweek Mannheim) and won the Josef von Sternberg Award. It was made on a shoestring budget of around 12,000 in misdirected scholarship funds and shot by cinematographer Tom DiCillo on 16 mm film. The 75 minute quasi-autobiographical feature follows an adolescent drifter (Chris Parker) as he wanders around downtown Manhattan. The film was not released theatrically, and did not attract the sort of adulation from critics that greeted his later work. The Washington Post staff writer Hal Hinson would disparagingly comment in an aside during a review of Jarmusch's Mystery Train (1989) that in the director's debut, \\"the only talent he demonstrated was for collecting egregiously untalented actors\\". The bleak and unrefined Permanent Vacation is nevertheless one of the director's most personal films, and established many of the hallmarks he would exhibit in his later work, including derelict urban settings, chance encounters, and a wry sensibility. Jarmusch's first major film, Stranger Than Paradise, was produced on a budget of approximately 125,000 and released in 1984 to much critical acclaim. A deadpan comedy recounting a strange journey of three disillusioned youths from New York through Cleveland to Florida, the film broke many conventions of traditional Hollywood filmmaking. It was awarded the Camera d'Or at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival as well as the 1985 National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film, and became a landmark work in modern independent film. In 1986, Jarmusch wrote and directed Down by Law, starring musicians John Lurie and Tom Waits, and Italian comic actor Roberto Benigni (his introduction to American audiences) as three convicts who escape from a New Orleans jailhouse. Shot like the director's previous efforts in black and white, this constructivist neo-noir was Jarmusch's first collaboration with Dutch cinematographer Robby Muller, who had been known for his work with Wenders. His next two films each experimented with parallel narratives: Mystery Train (1989) told three successive stories set on the same night in and around a small Memphis hotel, and Night on Earth (1991) involved five cab drivers and their passengers on rides in five different world cities, beginning at sundown in Los Angeles and ending at sunrise in Helsinki. Less bleak and somber than Jarmusch's earlier work, Mystery Train nevertheless retained the director's askance conception of America. He wrote Night on Earth in about a week, out of frustration at the collapse of the production of another film he had written and the desire to visit and collaborate with friends such as Benigni, Gena Rowlands, Winona Ryder and Isaach de Bankole. As a result of his early work, Jarmusch became an influential representative of the trend of the American road movie. Not intended to appeal to mainstream filmgoers, these early Jarmusch films were embraced by art house audiences, gaining a small but dedicated American following and cult status in Europe and Japan. Each of the four films had its premiere at the New York Film Festival, while Mystery Train was in competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. Jarmusch's distinctive aesthetic and auteur status fomented a critical backlash at the close of this early period, however; though reviewers praised the charm and adroitness of Mystery Train and Night On Earth, the director was increasingly charged with repetitiveness and risk-aversion. A film appearance in 1989 as a used car dealer in the cult comedy Leningrad Cowboys Go America further solidified his interest and participation in the road movie genre. In 1991 Jarmusch appeared as himself in Episode One of John Lurie's cult television series Fishing With John. In 1995, Jarmusch released Dead Man, a period film set in the 19th century American West starring Johnny Depp and Gary Farmer. Produced at a cost of almost 9 million with a high-profile cast including John Hurt, Gabriel Byrne and, in his final role, Robert Mitchum, the film marked a significant departure for the director from his previous features. Earnest in tone in comparison to its self-consciously hip and ironic predecessors, Dead Man was thematically expansive and of an often violent and progressively more surreal character. The film was shot in black and white by Robby Muller, and features a score composed and performed by Neil Young, for whom Jarmusch subsequently filmed the tour documentary Year of the Horse, released to tepid reviews in 1997. Though ill-received by mainstream American reviewers, Dead Man found much favor internationally and among critics, many of whom lauded it as a visionary masterpiece. It has been hailed as one of the few films made by a Caucasian that presents an authentic Native American culture and character, and Jarmusch stands by it as such, though it has attracted both praise and castigation for its portrayal of the American West, violence, and especially Native Americans. Following artistic success and critical acclaim in the American independent film community, he achieved mainstream recognition with his far-East philosophical crime film Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, shot in Jersey City and starring Forest Whitaker as a young inner-city man who has found purpose for his life by unyieldingly conforming it to the Hagakure, an 18th-century philosophy text and training manual for samurai, becoming, as directed, a terrifyingly deadly hit-man for a local mob boss to whom he may owe a debt, and who then betrays him. The soundtrack was supplied by RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, which blends into the director's \\"aesthetics of sampling\\". The film was unique among other things for the number of books important to and discussed by its characters, most of them listed bibliographically as part of the end credits. The film is also considered to be a homage to Le Samourai, a 1967 French New Wave film by auteur Jean-Pierre Melville, which starred renowned French actor Alain Delon in a strikingly similar role and narrative.","completion":"This text is about the American independent film director, Jim Jarmusch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rachel always vacuumed the carpet instead of Katrina so","completion":"Rachel always vacuumed the carpet instead of Katrina, so that she could maintain the specific standards of cleanliness that she desired. She had an innate love for cleanliness and order, something that had evolved into a borderline obsession over time. Rachel would meticulously go over each and every inch of the carpet, making sure it was free from dust, pet hair, and any other particle that had dared to invade her pristine sanctuary. Katrina, on the other hand, was more relaxed when it came to cleaning. Her motto in life had always been, \\"a little bit of dirt never hurt anyone.\\" In her view, obsessing over cleanliness was an unnecessary waste of time that could be better spent doing more enjoyable activities. This difference in attitude and approach to housekeeping had caused numerous arguments between the two friends, who had decided to live together to cut down on living expenses. The compromise they ultimately agreed upon was for Rachel to be solely responsible for vacuuming the carpets. It was a task she took great pleasure in, as it provided her with an immediate and tangible sense of accomplishment. In return, Katrina took on responsibilities that Rachel was less interested in – such as washing the dishes, doing the laundry, and taking out the trash. Rachel had a very particular vacuuming routine, which she followed diligently. She would begin by making sure all loose items were removed from the floor, then she would methodically vacuum the carpet in a back-and-forth motion, overlapping the vacuum lines to ensure that no spot was left untouched. Once the entire carpet had been vacuumed, she would carefully inspect the surface for any visible debris that had been missed, a testament to her extreme attention to detail. The powerful but quiet hum of the vacuum cleaner provided her with a kind of therapeutic background noise that allowed Rachel to enter a zen-like state of mind, where her thoughts would drift aimlessly, sometimes to fond memories of her childhood or deep reflections about her life's goals and aspirations. This simple, mundane task held a form of meditation for her, and she genuinely cherished the time she spent vacuuming. While others might have found Rachel's obsession with vacuuming the carpet to be quirky or excessive, it was a part of who she was, and she had learned to accept and even embrace it. It had become a form of self-care, a way for Rachel to de-stress from the pressures of daily life and reconnect with her inner self. Katrina, on the other hand, began to understand Rachel's unique relationship with vacuuming, and over time, she had come to appreciate her friend's commitment to cleanliness. She too had found a kind of solace in performing her share of the household chores, realizing that a sense of order and tidiness could, in fact, create a more harmonious living environment for them both. Ultimately, Rachel's vacuuming of the carpet was more than just a matter of maintaining a clean space — it represented the very essence of her being, and the simple, mundane act of pushing that vacuum cleaner back and forth across the surface of the carpet provided her with a source of balance and inner peace that was essential to her well-being. In the end, it allowed her and Katrina to live together harmoniously, each accepting and respecting the other's unique approach to life and finding surprising common ground."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: After what meal did the passengers experience food poisoning? Title: Airplane! Movie plot: Ex-fighter pilot and taxi driver Ted Striker (Robert Hays) became traumatized during an unnamed war, leading to a pathological fear of flying. As a result, he is unable to hold a responsible job. His wartime girlfriend, Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty), now a flight attendant, leaves him. Striker nervously boards a Boeing 707 (Trans American Flight 209) from Los Angeles to Chicago on which she is serving, hoping to win her back, but she rebuffs him. After dinner is served, many of the passengers fall ill, and fellow passenger Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) deduces that the passengers have contracted food poisoning from the fish. The cockpit crew, including pilot Clarence Oveur (Peter Graves) and co-pilot Roger Murdock (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), have also been affected, leaving no one to fly the plane. Elaine contacts the Chicago control tower for help, and is instructed by tower supervisor Steve McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) to activate the plane's autopilot, a large inflatable pilot doll (listed as \\"Otto\\" in the end credits), which will get them to Chicago, but will not be able to land the plane. Rumack convinces Striker to fly the plane, though Striker feels unable to handle the pressure and the unfamiliar aircraft. McCroskey knows that he must get someone else to help take the plane down and calls Rex Kramer (Robert Stack), Striker's commanding officer in the war. Despite their hostile relationship, he is the best choice to instruct Striker. As the plane nears Chicago, Striker is overcome by stress and manages to land the plane only after a pep talk from Dr. Rumack. With Kramer's advice, Striker is able to land the plane safely with only minor injuries to some passengers. Striker's courage rekindles Elaine's love for him, and the two share a kiss. \\"Otto\\" takes off in the evacuated plane after inflating a female companion.

What is the best way to: How can I make pretty placemats from paper?","completion":"To make pretty placemats from paper, follow this step-by-step guide: 1. Choose the right paper: The first step is to select a paper that is sturdy and visually appealing. Cardstock, watercolor paper, or scrapbooking paper are all great options for this project. Choose a design or pattern that complements your table setting and the overall theme of your event. 2. Determine the size: Standard placemat sizes are 12 x 18 inches or 14 x 20 inches, but you can make yours larger or smaller to fit your table space or for personal preference. Measure and cut your chosen paper to the desired size and shape. 3. Add decoration: Now that your paper is cut, it's time to add your creativity to the placemat. There are numerous ways to personalize them, including: - Stamping: Use rubber stamps and ink pads to add designs or messages to your placemats. - Stenciling: Create or buy stencils to apply patterns with paint, markers, or colored pencils. - Drawing or painting: If you're artistically inclined, draw or paint a custom design directly onto the paper. - Collaging: Cut out various shapes or images from other paper materials, such as magazines or colorful scrap paper, and arrange and adhere them onto your placemats. 4. Protect your placemats: Since paper placemats can easily be damaged by spills or moisture, it's a good idea to protect them with a layer of clear adhesive paper, contact paper, or laminate them. Carefully apply the protective layer, making sure to avoid creases and bubbles. 5. Trim the edges: Once your placemats are decorated and protected, trim any excess material from the edges. If desired, you can also make decorative edges using scissors with specialty blades, such as scalloped or zigzag designs. 6. Complete your table setting: With your pretty paper placemats finished, it's time to set your table and add coordinated tableware and decor. Pair your new placemats with coordinating table runners, centerpieces, napkins, and other decorative items for a polished look. Remember, the key to making pretty paper placemats is to let your creativity shine and to pay attention to detail. With the right materials, design, and protective layer, you can create unique and beautiful table settings for any occasion."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Information: - History.

The leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries, which include the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, have recently highlighted the importance of unity in combating terrorism. This emphasis on cooperative efforts demonstrates the shared understanding that terrorism is a global issue and requires international coordination and cooperation to effectively address the threat. Terrorism continues to be a significant concern worldwide, with extremist groups such as ISIS and al-Qaeda persistently attempting to spread their ideology and commit acts of violence against innocent civilians. The effects of terrorism are far-reaching, with the potential to destabilize political and economic systems and inflict significant trauma on affected communities and nations. The G7 leaders' call for unity in the fight against terrorism underscores the need for collaborative efforts among governments, intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and military forces across the globe. By working together, these entities can share vital information, resources, and expertise to develop comprehensive strategies to identify, apprehend, and dismantle terrorist networks and prevent future attacks. A united front against terrorism also allows for the development of shared policies, guidelines, and best practices that can strengthen individual nations' capabilities and resilience against terror threats. Such cooperation can be particularly vital for countries with weaker security infrastructure or limited experience in countering terrorism threats, enabling them to benefit from the knowledge and resources of their more experienced counterparts. Collaborative efforts against terrorism on the international stage can manifest in various forms, such as joint military operations, intelligence sharing, fundraising efforts for victims, and the establishment of multilateral forums for discussion and policy coordination. By actively participating in such efforts, the G7 countries can demonstrate their leadership and commitment to addressing the global challenge of terrorism. In addition to fostering collaboration among the G7 countries, the call for unity can also serve as an inspiration for other nations around the world to join forces against terrorism.

An inquest heard Mr Glanville told police he feared for his life after Mr Gallagher had smashed his way into the house with a baseball bat. The coroner recorded an open verdict into Mr Gallagher's death. Last year, prosecutors said they would be taking no further action against Mr Glanville and gardener Paul Pumfrett - who had both previously been arrested as part of a murder investigation - due to insufficient evidence. Mr Glanville worked for Aurora Fashions, owner of high street brands Oasis, Coast, Warehouse and Karen Millen until 2013. During the hearing at Chelmsford Coroner's Court, former Essex Police detective Marina Erikson said there was \\"uncertainty\\" over the reasons behind the events. On 30 July 2015, Mr Gallagher, 46, called 999 to report a fire at his wooden house in Viva Place, Blind Lane, claiming someone had poured petrol on his roof. Several phone calls followed, the detective said, before a final call was made in which Mr Gallagher asked for an ambulance. Two other voices were heard in the background, one of which said: \\"You're going to need more than that, mate.\\" Paramedics found him bleeding on the patio outside Mr Glanville's farmhouse in nearby Sudburys Farm Road. Mr Glanville and Mr Pumfrett said Mr Gallagher had run towards the house, claiming he was being followed, carrying a baseball bat before breaking a patio window and going inside. They admitted having a \\"tussle\\" with Mr Gallagher while they tried to disarm him as they \\"feared for their own lives\\" and wanted to protect the property. Former Det Ch Insp Erikson said questions remained over the level of force used and whether Mr Gallagher had fallen down the solid oak stairs. He died in hospital from head injuries a week later. Experts were unable to say exactly how the injury had occurred. Toxicology tests suggested he had used cocaine in the hours before his death.

The coroner concluded with an open verdict, meaning the cause of Gallagher's death remains undetermined. Both Glanville and Paul Pumfrett, who were formerly arrested in connection with a murder investigation regarding this event, were not further prosecuted due to insufficient evidence. In the events leading to his death, on 30 July 2015, Gallagher had called emergency services to report a fire at his house, and followed it up with multiple calls before a final one where he requested an ambulance.

Glanville and Pumfrett testified that Gallagher had rushed towards their house carrying a baseball bat, breaking a patio window to gain entry, and mentioning that he was being pursued. They admitted to having a physical altercation with Gallagher as they attempted to disarm him out of fear for their lives and the intent of protecting their property. Questions lingered regarding the extent of force applied in the incident and whether Gallagher might have sustained his fatal head injury by falling down a flight of solid oak stairs. Medical professionals could not accurately determine the exact cause of the injury. Toxicology results suggested he had ingested cocaine hours prior to his death.

Can you tell me the answer to what are the three main cereal crops in the world??","completion":"Certainly! The three main cereal crops in the world are wheat, rice, and maize (corn). These crops are the staples of human diets in many regions and play a significant role in global food security by providing essential energy, nutrients, and calories for billions of people. 1. Wheat: Wheat is a cereal grain that originated in the Near East, specifically the region that today encompasses modern-day Turkey and the Levant. Over time, wheat spread across the globe and became a staple for a large percentage of the world's population. It is used as a primary ingredient in many food items such as bread, pasta, crackers, and pastries. Wheat has high nutritional value, providing carbohydrates, fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals necessary for a balanced diet. Globally, wheat is the primary cereal crop in temperate regions, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. Major wheat-producing countries include China, India, the United States, Russia, and several countries across Europe, which all contribute significantly to global wheat production. Annually, worldwide production of wheat exceeds 750 million tons. 2. Rice: Rice is a cereal grain that originates from Asia, where it has been cultivated for more than 5,000 years. Today, rice is a staple food for billions of people, particularly those living in Asia and Africa. It is the main source of nutrition and energy for nearly half of the world's population. Rice comes in multiple varieties, with the most popular types being long-grain, short-grain, and sticky rice. Each type has different culinary uses, such as long-grain rice being ideal for dishes like fried rice, while short-grain or sticky rice is preferable for sushi or desserts. Rice provides essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. Major rice-producing countries include China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Vietnam, among others. Global rice production is estimated to be around 500 million tons annually. 3. Maize (Corn): Maize, also known as corn, is a cereal grain that was first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico more than 10,000 years ago. It has since spread across the world, becoming a staple food in many parts of the globe, particularly in the Americas and parts of Africa. Maize is a versatile crop that can be consumed in various forms, including corn-on-the-cob, cornmeal, and popcorn. It also serves as the main ingredient for many dishes, such as tortillas, cornbread, and grits. Apart from food consumption, maize is widely utilized in the production of livestock feed, biofuels, and industrial products like biodegradable plastics and adhesives. In addition to its culinary and commercial uses, maize is a significant source of vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, and carbohydrates. The United States is the largest global producer of maize, followed by China, Brazil, Argentina, and Ukraine. The annual global production of maize is estimated to be around 1 billion tons. In summary, wheat, rice, and maize are the three main cereal crops in the world, each serving as primary staples in the diets of billions of people. They play a crucial role in global food security and contribute significantly to the worldwide agricultural economy.

Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations. Hill town had two large forests nearby. Lake forest had trees that were in a symbiotic relationship with a large variety of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These fungi were less prevalent in Brook forest. Which forest had fewer AM fungi which reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Brook forest had fewer arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi that reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. Step 1: Identify the information given about each forest. - Lake forest: Trees have a symbiotic relationship with a large variety of AM fungi. - Brook forest: AM fungi are less prevalent here. Step 2: Relate the information about environmental conditions to the prevalence of AM fungi. - AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations. This is because plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi, and the fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these conditions. Step 3: Determine which forest has fewer AM fungi reallocating resources to intraradical hyphae. - Since Brook forest has fewer AM fungi, it is likely experiencing higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations. Consequently, the AM fungi present in Brook forest would reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae more than those in Lake forest, so Brook forest has fewer AM fungi reallocating resources to intraradical hyphae."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

LONDON An antibiotic-resistant \\"superbug\\" strain of typhoid fever has spread globally, driven by a single family of the bacteria, called H58, according to the findings of a large international study. The research, involving some 74 scientists in almost two dozen countries, is one of the most comprehensive sets of genetic data on a human infectious agent and paints a worrying scene of an \\"ever-increasing public health threat\\", they said. Typhoid is contracted by drinking or eating contaminated matter and symptoms include nausea, fever, abdominal pain and pink spots on the chest. Untreated, the disease can lead to complications in the gut and head, which may prove fatal in up to 20 percent of patients. Vaccines are available -- although, due to limited cost effectiveness, not widely used in poorer countries -- and regular strains of the infection can be treated with antibiotic drugs. However, this study found that the H58 \\"superbug\\" version, which is resistant to multiple types of antibiotics, is now becoming dominant. \\"H58 is displacing other typhoid strains, completely transforming the genetic architecture of the disease and creating a previously under appreciated and on-going epidemic,\\" the researchers said in a statement about their findings. Vanessa Wong of Britain's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, who was part of the international team, said that since typhoid affects around 30 million people a year, robust and detailed good global surveillance is critical to trying to contain it. The research team, whose work was published in the journal Nature Genetics on Monday, sequenced the genomes of 1,832 samples of Salmonella Typhi bacteria that were collected from 63 countries between 1992 and 2013. They found 47 percent were from the H58 strain. DON'T MISS THESE OTHER STORIES ON REUTERS.COM Hundreds of refugees arrive in Malaysia and Indonesia after Thai crackdown Why NSA surveillance is worse than you’ve ever imagined The team found that H58 emerged in South Asia 25 to 30 years ago and spread to Southeast Asia, Western Asia, East and South Africa and Fiji. They also found evidence of a recent and unreported wave of H58 transmission in many countries in Africa, which may represent an ongoing epidemic. Kathryn Holt, a scientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia who worked on the study, said multidrug resistant typhoid is caused by the bacteria picking up new resistance genes as disease strains mix and pass from person to person. Resistance \\"has been coming and going since the 1970s\\", she said, but in the H58 strain, the resistance genes are becoming a stable part of the genome \\"which means multiple antibiotic resistant typhoid is here to stay\\". (Editing by Crispian Balmer/Hugh Lawson) ||||| An antibiotic-resistant strain of the bacteria that causes typhoid fever has spread to many countries and reached epidemic levels in Africa, a new study warns. The strain, H58, emerged in South Asia between 25 and 30 years ago and has slowly grown to become one of the predominant forms of the bacteria Salmonella Typhi, said study author Vanessa Wong, a microbiologist at the University of Cambridge in England. \\"This multidrug-resistant strain, H58, is resistant to a number of first-line antibiotics used to treat the disease and is continuing to evolve and acquire new mutations to newer drugs,\\" Wong said. Typhoid presents no direct threat to people living in the United States, where clean water supplies and good sanitation prevent exposure to the bacteria, said Dr. Henry Chambers, chief of infectious diseases at San Francisco General Hospital and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. But travelers headed to typhoid-ridden parts of Africa and Asia should make sure they receive a vaccination before heading there, Chambers added. Dr. Wanda Filer, president-elect of the American Academy of Family Physicians, agreed. \\"We recommend that people who are traveling to parts of the world where [typhoid] is endemic get the typhoid vaccine,\\" Filer said, adding that the vaccine is 50 percent to 80 percent effective against all strains of typhoid, even those that have become antibiotic-resistant. Typhoid fever affects between 20 million and 30 million people around the globe each year, the researchers said. Symptoms include a high, sustained fever, weakness, stomach pains, headache and loss of appetite. As many as 20 percent of patients may die from complications associated with typhoid infection, which can last for weeks or months without proper treatment, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People contract typhoid when they eat food or drink beverages that have been contaminated with the bacteria, according to the CDC. Someone infected with S. Typhi can pass it on by handling food or drinks. Or, water used for drinking or washing food might become contaminated with sewage containing the bacteria. In this study, a multinational team of researchers used genetic sequencing to track the spread of antibiotic-resistant typhoid. The research team found that the H58 strain has displaced other typhoid fever strains that have endured for decades or even centuries. H58 was identified in nearly half of more than 1,800 bacteria samples collected from 63 countries between 1992 and 2013. After the H58 strain emerged in South Asia more than two decades ago, it spread to Southeast Asia, Western Asia, East and South Africa and Fiji, the researchers reported. They also found evidence of a recent and unreported wave of H58 transmission in multiple countries in Africa, which may represent an ongoing epidemic. Tactics used to fight typhoid in these countries appear to have led to increased antibiotic resistance, Wong said. \\"Vaccinations are not currently in widespread use in typhoid-endemic countries,\\" she said. \\"Instead, antibiotics are commonly used as a preventive measure. As a consequence, there is a rise in antibiotic resistance to many pathogens and in particular a resurgence of multidrug-resistant typhoid has been observed in some areas, including parts of Africa.\\" Their findings were published online May 11 in the journal Nature Genetics. Americans who travel to a country that has typhoid should get vaccinated and then monitor their temperature in the weeks following their return home, he said. If they do develop a fever, they should tell their doctor about their travels. \\"It would be important to tell your doctor that you've been to one of those areas, because then certain antibiotics you would normally use would not be effective,\\" he said. \\"There already are guidelines to use antibiotics that work against the more drug-resistant strains.\\" ||||| Image copyright CDC/ Melissa Brower/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Antibiotic-resistant typhoid is spreading across Africa and Asia and poses a major global health threat, warn experts. Researchers from the Wellcome Trust, who have been tracking the hard-to-treat infection, say it is replacing regular typhoid in many countries. They analysed bacterial samples from 63 countries - nearly half were impervious to standard antibiotic treatments. Over-reliance on these drugs is to blame, they say in Nature Genetics. Increasingly, doctors now need to use other, more expensive and less readily available antibiotics to treat typhoid fever - a disease that kills around 200,000 people each year. Creeping resistance The Wellcome Trust work is the largest snapshot of what is happening globally to typhoid resistance. It shows the problem is widespread. In many parts of Asia and Africa, where typhoid is endemic, a multidrug-resistant strain of typhoid called H58 has displaced other typhoid strains that have been around for centuries. Of the 63 countries the researchers looked at, 21 had H58. Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Typhoid growing in the lab Dr Kathryn Holt, from the University of Melbourne and one of the study authors, said H58 was gaining a firm foothold. \\"Multidrug-resistant typhoid has been coming and going since the 1970s and is caused by the bacteria picking up novel antimicrobial resistance genes, which are usually lost when we switch to a new drug. \\"In H58, these genes are becoming a stable part of the genome, which means multiple-antibiotic resistant typhoid is here to stay.\\" The researchers say the global creep of H58 needs urgent international attention. A third of the world's population is at risk of getting typhoid. It is caused by the highly contagious bacterium Salmonella typhi, spread from person to person by food and water that is contaminated with traces of infected faeces or urine. Improved water, sanitation and hygiene could dramatically cut the number of infections, but the investment needed to do this may be our of reach for many developing countries. There are vaccines against typhoid, but they are not available in all parts of the world, nor are they 100% protective. A spokeswoman for the World Health Organization said: \\"Limiting the inappropriate use of antibiotics is part of the solution, and surveillance systems to identify antibiotic-resistant bacteria need to be improved to identify hotspots and intensify prevention and control measures.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A \\"superbug\\" strain of typhoid fever called H58 has spread around the world, and it is very difficult to treat because it is resistant to antibiotics. Typhoid is a sickness that people can get from eating or drinking things that have tiny harmful bacteria. When people get typhoid, they can feel nauseous, have a fever, stomach pain, and pink spots on the chest. There is a vaccine to help protect people from regular typhoid, but the H58 strain is stronger and harder to fight. H58 started in South Asia and has now spread to Africa, Asia, and Fiji. This is a big problem because typhoid affects around 30 million people each year. People must be careful when traveling to certain parts of the world, and should get a vaccine to protect themselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Infection One of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases. Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence, distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness. The human strains of Ebola virus, for example, incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after. As a result, the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone. Also, this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye. Thus, the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging. As a result of the above features, the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area. In contrast, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system. As a result, many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease. Also, the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances, increasing the likelihood of an epidemic.

He is currently special assistant to the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association. Over his 22-year career, he played for six teams: the San Diego Padres, New York Yankees, California Angels, Toronto Blue Jays, Minnesota Twins, and Cleveland Indians. He had the winning hit in the 1992 World Series with the Blue Jays over the Atlanta Braves. Context: Winfield was born the same day Bobby Thomson hit his pennant-winning home run for the New York Giants, known as \\"the shot heard 'round the world\\". He grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota. His parents divorced when he was three years old, leaving him and his older brother Stephen to be raised by their mother, Arline, and a large extended family of aunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins. The Winfield brothers honed their athletic skills in St. Paul's Oxford playground, where coach Bill Peterson was one of the first to take the young Winfield under his wing. Winfield did not become a formidable 6'6\\" athlete until his senior year of high school. He earned a full baseball scholarship to the University of Minnesota in 1969, where he starred in baseball and basketball for the Golden Gophers. His college baseball coach was former MLB player Dick Siebert. His basketball coach was Bill Musselman, who was later a head coach in the American Basketball Association and National Basketball Association and who later referred to Winfield as the best rebounder he ever coached. Winfield's 1972 Minnesota team won a Big Ten basketball championship, the school's first in 53 years. During the 1972 season, he also was involved in a brawl when Minnesota played Ohio State. Winfield also played for the Alaska Goldpanners for two seasons (1971-72) and was the MVP in 1972. In 1973, he was named All-American and voted MVP of the College World Series--as a pitcher. Following college, Winfield was drafted by four teams in three different sports. The San Diego Padres selected him as a pitcher with the fourth overall pick in the MLB draft and both the Atlanta Hawks (NBA) and the Utah Stars (ABA) drafted him. Though he never played college football, the Minnesota Vikings selected Winfield in the 17th round of the NFL draft. He is one of six players ever to be drafted by three professional sports (the others being George Carter, Jo Jo White, Noel Jenke, Mickey McCarty and Dave Logan) and one of three athletes along with Carter and McCarty to be drafted by four leagues.

His best-known discoveries are the enzyme lysozyme in 1923 and the world's first antibiotic substance benzylpenicillin (Penicillin G) from the mould Penicillium notatum in 1928, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 with Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain. He wrote many articles on bacteriology, immunology, and chemotherapy. Fleming was knighted for his scientific achievements in 1944. When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionise all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did. By 1927, Fleming had been investigating the properties of staphylococci. He was already well-known from his earlier work, and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher, but his laboratory was often untidy. On 3 September 1928, Fleming returned to his laboratory having spent August on holiday with his family. Before leaving, he had stacked all his cultures of staphylococci on a bench in a corner of his laboratory. On returning, Fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus, and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed, whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal, famously remarking \\"That's funny\\". Fleming showed the contaminated culture to his former assistant Merlin Price, who reminded him, \\"That's how you discovered lysozyme.\\" Fleming grew the mould in a pure culture and found that it produced a substance that killed a number of disease-causing bacteria. He identified the mould as being from the Penicillium genus, and, after some months of calling it \\"mould juice\\", named the substance it released penicillin on 7 March 1929. The laboratory in which Fleming discovered and tested penicillin is preserved as the Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum in St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington. He investigated its positive anti-bacterial effect on many organisms, and noticed that it affected bacteria such as staphylococci and many other Gram-positive pathogens that cause scarlet fever, pneumonia, meningitis and diphtheria, but not typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever, which are caused by Gram-negative bacteria, for which he was seeking a cure at the time. It also affected Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhoea, although this bacterium is Gram-negative. Fleming published his discovery in 1929, in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology, but little attention was paid to his article. Fleming continued his investigations, but found that cultivating penicillium was quite difficult, and that after having grown the mould, it was even more difficult to isolate the antibiotic agent. Fleming's impression was that because of the problem of producing it in quantity, and because its action appeared to be rather slow, penicillin would not be important in treating infection. Fleming also became convinced that penicillin would not last long enough in the human body (in vivo) to kill bacteria effectively. Many clinical tests were inconclusive, probably because it had been used as a surface antiseptic. In the 1930s, Fleming's trials occasionally showed more promise, and he continued, until 1940, to try to interest a chemist skilled enough to further refine usable penicillin. Fleming finally abandoned penicillin, and not long after he did, Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford took up researching and mass-producing it, with funds from the U.S. and British governments. They started mass production after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. By D-Day in 1944, enough penicillin had been produced to treat all the wounded in the Allied forces.

Palmer is sceptical but links up with Johnny Vulkan (Paul Hubschmid), an old German friend and former criminal associate, who now runs the Berlin station for British intelligence. Palmer makes a rendezvous with Stok in the Soviet zone of the divided city and finds him eccentric and likeable. Stok asks for the defection to be managed by Otto Kreutzman, a West German criminal who has organised a number of recent escapes. When Palmer returns to the western sector he meets a model who calls herself Samantha Steel (Eva Renzi), with whom he spends the night. Suspicious at the forward manner in which she approached him, he has his police contacts establish her identity the following day and arranges for a criminal to burgle her apartment, where several different false passports are discovered. Meanwhile, Palmer arranges a deal with Kreutzman to bring Stok across the wall for Â£20,000. Palmer then returns to London to report. Ross is convinced that Stok's defection is genuine and dismisses Palmer's suspicions that the model he met in Berlin was a spy. Ross gives full authorisation for Palmer to return to Berlin to complete the deal, with documents and money provided by a man at Intelligence headquarters named Hallam (Hugh Burden).

Write an article that answers the following question: Which happened first, Hal al-Assad sending troops into Lebanon, or the cease-fire agreement?","completion":"Title: Which Came First, Hal al-Assad Sending Troops into Lebanon, or the Cease-fire Agreement? Introduction The Middle Eastern political landscape has been shaped by various events and milestone decisions throughout history. Two significant instances in focus are Hal al-Assad's decision to send troops into Lebanon and the cease-fire agreement that came later. This article will analyze the timeline of these events and provide a clear answer to which event happened first and how it impacted the subsequent developments in the region. Background To set the stage, it is essential to provide a brief understanding of the background leading up to these events. Hal al-Assad, the former president of Syria, was involved in Lebanon's internal politics during the 1970s and beyond. At that time, Lebanon was plunged into a devastating civil war, powered by religious and political divisions amongst its population. The conflict led to the involvement of various regional and international actors, including Syria. Hal al-Assad Sends Troops into Lebanon In response to these developments and to increase its influence in the region, Hal al-Assad made the decision to send Syrian troops into Lebanon. This military involvement occurred in 1976, when Syrian forces entered Lebanese territory. The move was initially justified as a means to restore stability and order in war-torn Lebanon, following a request from Lebanese President Suleiman Franjieh. However, this intervention resulted in a long-term presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon, which lasted until 2005. During their deployment, Syrian forces played a crucial role in the conflict, shaping not only the course of the Lebanese Civil War but also deeply impacting the relations between the two countries for decades. The Cease-fire Agreement Even though various cease-fire agreements took place throughout the Lebanese Civil War, the agreement that marked the end of the conflict and led to the eventual withdrawal of foreign forces, including Syria, was the Taif Agreement. The Taif Agreement was signed in October 1989, effectively bringing an end to the Lebanese Civil War, which had lasted for 15 years. Under the terms of the Agreement, Lebanon was to regain its full sovereignty, and foreign forces were to gradually withdraw. While the Taif Agreement marked the official end of the civil war, it took until 2005 for Syrian forces to completely withdraw due to various political and military reasons. Conclusion Considering the chronology of these events, it is evident that Hal al-Assad's decision to send Syrian troops into Lebanon in 1976 happened first, followed by the signing of the Taif Agreement in 1989. Understanding the timeline and context behind these significant events is crucial to gain insight into the complexities of Middle Eastern politics and the intricate relationships between the countries in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Lifetime's TV-movie about late singer Aaliyah received widespread disdain on Twitter. Fans critiqued the casting, which they felt was all wrong. Aaliyah's family gave no support to the movie. Article:","completion":"Title: Producers Defend Controversial Aaliyah Biopic Against Fans' Social Media Wrath Following the release of Lifetime's TV-movie depicting the life of the late singer, Aaliyah, the producers have found themselves in the position of defending their creation. The film attracted widespread disdain, particularly on the popular social media platform, Twitter, where fans vociferously critiqued the movie, particularly the casting decisions. Firstly, the film sparked controversy due to its casting selections, speculated to be incorrect by a large community of fans. These fans have taken to Twitter en masse to express their dissatisfaction, criticizing the fact that they felt the chosen actors and actresses did not represent the real-life counterparts faithfully or accurately. For fans of Aaliyah, casting plays an indispensable role in biographical projects - it serves as a bridge between the viewers and the person whose story is being told. If the actors do not resonate with the audience's perception of the real characters, it can lead to discontentment, as evident in this case. Secondly, an adding factor to the controversy has been the lack of support from Aaliyah's family. Family endorsements often provide a sort of legitimacy to biographical works, offering fans reassurance that the portrayed story is true to real events. With Aaliyah's family choosing not to support the lifetime's movie, it left a feeling of void for many fans, intensifying the skepticism about the movie's credibility. Facing the inflaming narrative on social media and devoid of familial backing, the producers have stood tall in the face of criticism. They have publically defended their work, acknowledging that while some fans may not agree with their casting choices, they felt they selected the best options available to bring the late singer's story to life. They further expressed regret over the lack of family support, but firmly believed in the overall quality and accuracy of their narrative. Indeed, creating biographical films is a delicate task, fraught with the responsibility of representing the life of the person authentically while also providing an entertaining art piece for audiences. The movie about Aaliyah has certainly navigated the choppy waters of this challenge, culminating in a product ready to face the critique of fans - a true testament to the bravery and resilience of its producers. In encapsulation, the controversy over the film is a clear indicator of the passion and dedication Aaliyah's fans still possess for her. Despite all the criticism, the producers hope that the essence of Aaliyah's story, encapsulated within their film, touches the hearts of the fans and respects the memory of the cherished singer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How to test a refrigerator ptc relay Expose the back of the fridge to get access to the motor. Make sure the appliance is unplugged. Find the fridge compressor and remove the plastic case that houses the starting circuitry.","completion":"After ensuring that the refrigerator is unplugged and you have successfully located the compressor and removed the plastic case housing the starting circuitry, the most logical next step in testing the PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) relay involves following these steps: 1. Locate the PTC relay: The PTC relay is generally a small, black or white box connected to the side of the compressor with wires coming out of it. It may also have a capacitor directly attached, depending on the make and model of the refrigerator. 2. Disconnect the PTC relay and capacitor (if present): Carefully remove the relay and attached capacitor (if present) from the compressor terminals by gently pulling on the relay. Do not use excessive force, as you may cause damage to the components or the compressor. 3. Check the relay for damage or burnt marks: Visually inspect the PTC relay for any signs of damage, such as burnt marks, cracks, or other visible issues. If any are present, this could indicate that the relay is faulty and needs to be replaced. 4. Test the relay with a multimeter: Set your multimeter to the lowest ohm setting (or use the audible continuity setting if it is available). Place one probe on each of the relay's terminals, and observe the reading on the multimeter or listen for a continuous beep or tone. A good PTC relay should have a reading of zero or close to it, or you will hear a continuous tone if your multimeter has an audible continuity setting. If you receive a different reading or there is no tone, the relay is likely faulty. 5. Test the capacitor (if present): If there is a capacitor connected to the PTC relay, test it as well. Set your multimeter to the microfarad setting (µF), then place the probes on the capacitor's terminals. You should receive a reading that matches or is close to the listed value on the capacitor. If the reading is significantly different, the capacitor may need to be replaced. 6. Replace the faulty component(s): If your tests indicate that the PTC relay and/or capacitor has failed, you will need to replace the faulty component(s) with a compatible replacement part. Be sure to consult the refrigerator's owner's manual or consult with a certified technician if you are unsure about the correct part to purchase. 7. Reassemble the refrigerator: After replacing the faulty component(s), reconnect the PTC relay and the capacitor (if present) to the compressor terminals. Secure the plastic case housing back onto the starting circuitry of the refrigerator to keep the components protected. 8. Test the refrigerator: Plug the refrigerator back in and monitor its performance. Ideally, the compressor should now function properly and the refrigerator should return to normal operation. If the issue persists, consult with a professional technician to further diagnose and resolve the problem. In conclusion, testing a refrigerator's PTC relay requires a systematic approach to identifying and resolving any potential issues. By following the steps outlined above, you can not only test the PTC relay but also the capacitor (if applicable), helping to ensure that your refrigerator operates efficiently and effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update. The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis. It makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis. It makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengths or weakens the hypothesis, respectively. Premise: PersonX returns to work Hypothesis: As a result, PersonX feels dedicated Update: PersonX finished maternity leave A:","completion":"'strengthener' The definition states that a strengthener makes the hypothesis more believable. In this case, the hypothesis is that PersonX feels dedicated because they returned to work. The update, which is that PersonX finished maternity leave, adds to this belief. This is because maternity leave is often seen as a major life event, and the decision to return to work after such a leave could suggest a strong dedication to one's work. This reasoning aligns with the definition of a strengthener, therefore the answer is 'strengthener'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The earthquake uncovers the Luna Temple, built by Alexander the Great to house his most prized treasures. Among these treasures is a glowing orb with a pattern resembling a code etched into it. Lara finds this orb, as well as a strange medallion; but both are stolen by the crime lord Chen Lo (Simon Yam). Lara (Angelina Jolie) only just manages to escape as a subsequent earthquake causes the Luna Temple to collapse, while her two companions are killed by Chen's men. Lara is tasked by MI6 to find Pandora's Box, an object from ancient legends that supposedly contains a deadly plague, before Nobel Prize-winning scientist turned bio-terrorist Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds) can get his hands on it. The key to finding the box, which is hidden in the mysterious Cradle of Life, is a magical luminous sphere that serves as a map, the one stolen by Chen Lo in Santorini, who plans to sell the sphere to Reiss. To help her track down Chen Lo and the ball, Lara recruits an old lover, Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a former mercenary and Royal Marine, who was in prison in the Republic of Kazakhstan.Among the action sequences that take place during this time are Lara and Terry's entry into China, a fight scene in suburban Shanghai, and a leap off the then-under-construction International Finance Centre skyscraper in Hong Kong, using special winged flight-suits that Terry had arranged for, landing on a ship out in the Kowloon Bay after taking the Orb from Reiss.

OPTIONS: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no.","completion":"A) Yes. Based on the premise, \\"American Pie strives to out-gross-out its predecessors and does so handily,\\" it appears that the hypothesis, \\"The creators of American Pie wanted it to be one of the grossest movies ever,\\" is true. This conclusion can be reached by analyzing the statements given for understanding the intentions of the creators. The statement suggests that the movie aims at outdoing its predecessors in terms of grossness, which implies that gross-out humor is a critical element of the film. The use of the word \\"strives\\" indicates that there is a consistent effort put in by the creators to make it a more shocking and outrageous experience for the viewers in comparison to other movies in the genre. Additionally, the phrase \\"does so handily\\" confirms that the movie has succeeded in surpassing the level of gross-out content of its predecessors, which indicates deliberate attempts by the creators. This intention of creating more substantial gross-out comedy scenes can be attributed to the genre's popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The American Pie series, belonging to the teen comedy genre, has always been known for its crude and offensive humor, which is intended to evoke both laughter and discomfort. Achieving a higher degree of grossness would make it stand out among its contemporaries in the genre and would be a conscious marketing choice by the creators to cater to that particular target audience. Thus, it seems evident that the creators of American Pie were well aware of the kind of impact they aimed to achieve through the movie and intentionally aspired for it to be one of the grossest movies ever made."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: It's a Wonderful Life Context: This movie is about a divine intervention by a guardian angel, to help a man in distress. It opens with a a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up. They are receiving prayers from mortals, like \\"Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy\\". George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges. The first incident that Clarence sees is that, at age 12, George saved his younger brother Harry's (Todd Karns) life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond. George lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water. Shortly after that, while working part-time in Mr. Gower's (H.B. Warner) drug store, he prevents a mistake in a prescription from fatally poisoning someone. The two little girls in George's life at that point are Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame), who seem to be competing for his notice.George's father (Samuel S. Hinds), with a small staff including Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), run a small Building and Loan company that finances mortgages for the people of Bedford Falls.

Answer the following question: Barbara and Jane are two students. They both like meteorology. Barbara studies the formation of the ozone layer, while Jane studies about the stratosphere. Which student learned more about temperature inversion? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Jane is the student who learned more about temperature inversion. To fully understand this, let us delve into both of the students' areas of interest and how they relate to temperature inversion. Barbara studies the formation of the ozone layer. The ozone layer is a region of the Earth's stratosphere that contains a high concentration of ozone (O3) molecules. This layer plays a crucial role in absorbing the majority of the Sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, thus protecting life on Earth from its harmful effects. The ozone layer is mainly found between altitudes of 10 to 50 kilometers (6 to 30 miles) above the Earth's surface and reaches its maximum concentration around 20 to 25 kilometers (12 to 15 miles) above the surface. While the formation of the ozone layer involves various chemical reactions and processes, including temperature, it does not focus specifically on temperature inversion. On the other hand, Jane studies the stratosphere, which is the second layer of Earth's atmosphere, located above the troposphere and below the mesosphere. The stratosphere extends from approximately 10 to 50 kilometers (6 to 30 miles) above the Earth's surface. One of the key features of the stratosphere is the temperature inversion that occurs within it. Temperature inversion involves a reversal of the typical temperature profile in the atmosphere, where temperature increases with altitude, rather than decreasing, as it does in the troposphere. This temperature inversion in the stratosphere is primarily due to the presence and distribution of ozone, which absorbs the Sun's UV radiation and warms the surrounding air. This warming effect creates a distinct temperature gradient, with warmer temperatures in the upper layers of the stratosphere and cooler temperatures in the lower stratosphere, near its boundary with the troposphere. This temperature inversion has significant implications for atmospheric circulation and weather patterns and can, for example, create a stable barrier that prevents the vertical mixing of air between the troposphere and the stratosphere. In conclusion, while Barbara's research on the formation of the ozone layer contributes to a broader understanding of atmospheric processes, it is Jane's study of the stratosphere that directly involves learning about temperature inversion. Therefore, Jane is the student who learned more about temperature inversion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What follows is a list of some of these untruths and some tips to help you do your best at your next interview. Myth 1: The aim of interviewing is to obtain (means \\"get\\") a job offer. Only half true. The real aim of an interview is to obtain the job you want. That often means rejecting job offers you don't want! So before you please an employer, be sure you want the job. Myth 2: Always please the interviewer Not true. Try to please yourself. Of course, don't be hostile--nobody wants to hire someone disagreeable. But there is plainly a muddle ground between being too ingratiating and being hostile. Myth 3: Try to control the interview Nobody \\"controls\\" an interview. When someone tries to control us, we resent it. When we try to control others, they resent us. Remember you can't control what an employer thinks of you, just as he can't control what you think of him. So he is ready to give and take when being interviewed; never control the interview. Myth 4: Never interrupt the interviewer Study the style of the effective conversationalists: they interrupt and are interrupted! An exciting conversation always makes us feel free--free to interrupt, to disagree, to agree enthusiastically. Just _ Try being yourself for a change. Employers will either like or dislike you, but at least you'll have made an impression. Leaving an employer indifferent is the worst impression you can make.

Cantilever bridge: A cantilever bridge is a type of bridge that uses cantilevers or extended horizontal structures for support. This type of bridge usually consists of two spans extending outwards from the supporting piers and meeting in the center to form the complete bridge. 2. Ferry: A ferry is a vessel specifically designed to transport passengers, vehicles, and/or cargo across a body of water. Ferries are an essential mode of transportation in many cities and coastal areas around the world, providing convenient access across rivers, bays, and straits. 3. Steam train: A steam train is a type of railway locomotive that uses a steam engine for propulsion. Steam trains were widely used during the 19th and early 20th centuries and played an essential role in the industrial revolution. Nowadays, steam trains are mostly used for heritage railways and tourist attractions, as modern trains employ more efficient forms of power like diesel and electricity. 4. Late period: The term \\"late period\\" in the context of this sentence could refer to either a time period or a stage of development. If referring to a time period, it might indicate the latter years of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century when steam trains and cantilever bridges were prevalent.

Article: YULEE, Fla. -- Investigators in the Jacksonville area say they have evidence to believe a mom who vanished on Mother's Day is no longer alive. Authorities have arrested a fellow stylist at the salon where the mother works after they say was seen driving her car. Joleen Jensen Cummings, 34, was last seen leaving work May 12 at Tangles in Yulee, Florida, CBS affiliate WJAX-TV reported, and didn't show up the next day to pick up her children from her ex-husband in Hilliard for a Mother's Day visit. Nassau County Sheriff Bill Leeper said Tuesday that investigators have since obtained evidence \\"which leads us to believe Joleen is not alive.\\" He wouldn't detail the evidence. He said Cummings' car was found abandoned last Tuesday at a Yulee Home Depot. Surveillance footage showed someone parking the vehicle, sitting inside for a few minutes and then get out. They identified the person as a co-worker at Tangles, Julie Sybert -- who worked with Cummings at the salon the last day she was seen alive. But investigators say they later discovered Sybert had given her employer an assumed name, and determined Sybert's real name to be Kimberly Kessler. Kessler, of Pennsylvania, allegedly gave her employers at the salon a bogus address. Investigators found her living out of her car in St. John's County on May 16. They found Kessler had been using a fake Social Security number, and she's since been charged by the FBI with possession of a counterfeit passport. She's been charged in Nassau County with grand theft auto for allegedly stealing Cummings' car, and is considered a suspect in her disappearance, Leeper said. Prior to Cummings' disappearance, Leeper said they responded to Cummings' home after a neighbor reported a loud argument and things being broken. When deputies arrived, Cummings told them her former boyfriend Jason Gee was at the house and wanted to stay, but she told him to leave. Gee had a warrant out for his arrest on a probation violation, and he avoided deputies who were searching for him to ask him about Cummings' disappearance, Leeper said. He was found May 15 in a home in Hilliard, hiding under some cardboard boxes, and was arrested on the outstanding warrant. Detectives have searched the salon for information about her disappearance. The salon has been closed since Cummings was reported missing. Deputies were asking anyone who had an appointment at the salon or stopped by the area May 12 to call detectives. Leeper said investigators are continuing to search for Cummings, but \\"she could be anywhere.\\" He said investigators are continuing to gather evidence and additional charges are expected. The sheriff's office is asking anyone who has seen or had any contact with Kessler, also known as Jennifer Sybert, or her vehicle or has any information to contact them at 904-548-4005 or contact First Coast Crime Stoppers at 1-866-845-TIPS (8477). ||||| Anne Johnson stood near Sheriff Bill Leeper Tuesday as he said the words many had feared about her 34-year-old daughter, Joleen Rebecca Cummings, missing since May 12. \\"We have obtained evidence that we are not releasing at this time which leads us to believe that Joleen is not alive,\\" Leeper said as Johnson bowed her head behind him. Cummings never made it to her Mother's Day birthday celebration with her three children. A salon co-worker was seen on security video abandoning Cummings' Ford Expedition days later in Yulee, the sheriff said. Now Kimberly Lee Kessler, who was going by the fake name of Jennifer Syberts, is charged with stealing her vehicle and is a suspect in her disappearance. Johnson pleaded for any scrap of information that could lead investigators to \\"bring my daughter home,\\" saying her family are all heartbroken and want closure. \\"I need you, the news, the public, to help law enforcement agencies be their ears and eyes,\\" Johnson said, beginning to cry. \\"... I beg you as a mother to please keep coming forward with any information that you have, no matter how small.\\" Cummings, officially reported missing May 14, was last seen leaving her job at 5 p.m. May 12 at the Tangles Hair Salon in Fernandina Beach, according to the Sheriff's Office. She was supposed to meet her former husband in Hilliard on May 13 to pick up their children but never showed up. Deputies tried to call her phone, but it went straight to voicemail, investigators said. Leeper said the last person who reported seeing Cummings was Kessler, who had worked at the salon for about a month. But when investigators tried to talk to with her May 14, she never came to work. Her address also was bogus, he added. On May 15 Cummings' SUV was found in the Home Depot parking lot in Yulee, but there was no sign of her, Leeper said. Surveillance video showed that vehicle being parked just after 1 a.m. May 13, and Leeper said they had hoped Cummings was driving it. \\"Who do you think it was — the Tangles hair stylist, who was supposedly the last person to see Joleen,\\" Leeper said, holding up Kessler's image. Kessler, who turned 50 May 9, was found late May 16 sleeping in her Kia Soul at an Interstate 95 rest stop in St. Johns County, Leeper said. A former resident of Butler, Pa., she remains behind bars on 500,000 bail, according to Nassau County jail records. Along with a fake ID, Leeper said she was using a false Social Security number and also faces a federal charge of possession of a counterfeit passport. Kessler was listed as missing under suspicious circumstances in 2004 from Butler, Pa., according to a Pennsylvania State Police flyer. The Pennsylvania Missing Persons Facebook page announced her arrest Tuesday afternoon. Meanwhile, detectives are working with the FBI and Sheriff's Offices in Duval and St. Johns counties to learn more about Kessler and Cummings. He said Kessler was known to frequent Yulee, Jacksonville's Bartram Park area and St. Johns County. \\"We will continue to search for Joleen, but she could be anywhere,\\" Leeper said. Anyone with information on Cummings or Kessler can call the Nassau County Sheriff's Office at (904) 548-4005 or First Coast Crime Stoppers at (866) 845-8477 (TIPS). Dan Scanlan: (904) 359-4549 ||||| YULEE, Fla. - Nassau County deputies who have been searching for a missing mother who disappeared over a week ago have reason to believe she is not alive and have a suspect in custody, Sheriff Bill Leeper announced Tuesday afternoon. The foreboding update came just hours before a Tuesday evening vigil organized by Joleen Cummings' friends and loved ones. Leeper declined to say what evidence investigators had found that led them to believe Cummings is no longer alive, but said that a woman, 50-year-old Jennifer Sybert, was arrested Tuesday morning and is considered a suspect in Cummings' disappearance. UNCUT: Sheriff Bill Leeper says missing woman likely 'not alive' RELATED: Missing woman's mother makes emotional plea Sybert, whose real name is Kimberly Kessler, is charged with car theft and is being held on 500,000 bond. Leeper said she was the last person to see Cummings, who was reported missing May 14 after she did not show up the day before to pick up her three children from her ex-husband. The 34-year-old mother was last seen leaving work at Tangles Hair Salon on State Road 200 on May 12. According to the arrest warrant affidavit, Cummings' phone was last used on an outgoing call midafternoon May 12. Deputies showed up at the salon May 14, so they could talk to Sybert, a fellow stylist, but investigators said that when Sybert pulled in and learned a deputy was asking questions, she left without going inside and called the owner to say she was leaving town. The next day, Cummings' SUV was found parked outside a Home Depot, and surveillance video nearby shows Sybert parking the car around 1:17 a.m. Sunday and getting out of the driver's seat, but there's no sign of Cummings. The affidavit states surveillance video then shows Sybert walking to the Gate gas station in the same shopping center, where she called a taxi to take her back to Tangles. As investigators continued following leads in the search for Cummings, they also began looking for Sybert, Leeper said. They found Sybert and her black Kia Soul on May 16 at a rest area on I-95 northbound in St. Johns County on Wednesday, parked between two semi trucks. She had apparently been living in her car and moving it around, Leeper said. According to the affidavit, Sybert admitted she hadn't gotten Cummings' permission to drive her SUV. Based on the surveillance video showing her driving Cummings' SUV, Sybert was charged with grand theft auto, Leeper said. Mug shots from her arrest show visible cuts around one of her eyes and a scratch on her hand. Timeline May 12: Cummings leaves work at Tangles hair salon. It's the last time she was seen. May 13: Mother’s Day and Cummings' 34th birthday. She doesn’t show up to pick up her three kids in Hilliard from her ex-husband; based on surveillance video, Sybert had parked Cummings' SUV near a Yulee Home Depot around 1:17 a.m. that morning. There's no sign of Cummings in the video. May 14: Cummings' mother reports her missing to the Sheriff's Office. Deputies visit Cummings' salon, and when Sybert learns they're asking questions, she calls the owner to say she's leaving town. May 15: Cummings' 2006 beige Ford Expedition is found near the Home Depot parking lot. May 16: Investigators find Sybert in her black Kia Soul at an I-95 rest area in St. Johns County, and she's charged with stealing Cummings' car. May 22: Sheriff announces investigators have reason to believe Cummings is \\"not alive,\\" but declines to say why. Sybert, who has been using a fake Social Security number, has since been charged by the FBI with a federal offense of possession of a counterfeit passport, Leeper said. She had only been working at the salon for about a month. News4Jax found a missing persons flyer for a Kimberly Kessler, who disappeared \\"under suspicious circumstances\\" from Butler County, Pennsylvania, in 2004. Leeper confirmed she is the same woman who is now in custody in Nassau County under the name Jennifer Sybert. Leeper also confirmed to News4Jax that Sybert stole the identity of a 13-year-old girl who was killed in a car crash in Germany and was buried in Pennsylvania. Investigators said they are looking for any information on Sybert, who was known to frequent the Fernandina Beach and Yulee areas, along with St. Johns County and Bartram Park in Jacksonville. Sybert is due for arraignment in Nassau County court June 7. Five days before Cummings went missing, deputies were called to a domestic dispute involving her ex-boyfriend at her home. The ex, Jason Gee, was arrested on a probation violation May 15. Leeper told News4Jax News4Jax on Tuesday that Gee is still considered a person of interest. Gee has not been charged in Cummings' disappearance.

In this verse, Saul (later known as Paul) is speaking. He starts with the phrase, \\"I verily thought with myself,\\" which means he genuinely believed in his heart. The next part of the verse, \\"That I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth,\\" reveals Saul's mindset at the time. During that period, Saul was not a follower of Jesus Christ. Instead, he was essentially His adversary, pursuing and persecicuting anyone who claimed to be a follower of Jesus. This verse, spoken by Saul himself, illustrates his deeply held belief that he was doing the right thing by opposing the followers of Jesus. However, there is a notable transformation in Saul story later on. Paul, after a divine encounter with Jesus, underwent a drastic change and became one of His most dedicated followers. So, this verse has a regenerative theme intrinsic to it that encapsulates transformation, repentance, forgiveness, and redemption as Saul transitions from a persecutor to a firm believer of the very faith he once opposed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pharmaceutical industry By the 1890s the profound effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.

I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest.

Politico reports the port of entry was reopened Sunday evening, but President Trump made clear Monday morning he doesn't want to admit the asylum-seeking migrants still waiting for entry—and he issued a warning to Mexico on what he might do to keep any more people from entering. \\"Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries,\\" he tweeted. \\"Do it by plane, do it by bus, do it anyway you want, but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A.,\\" he continued. \\"We will close the Border permanently if need be. Congress, fund the WALL!\\" Politico notes the president has offered no evidence there are criminals en masse among the migrant groups. A deal was said to be in the works between the US and Mexico on having those seeking US asylum wait in Mexico while their cases are being processed, but USA Today reports on \\"conflicting statements\\" from Mexico's incoming interior minister, Olga Sanchez Cordero. In a Washington Post story on Saturday, Sanchez Cordero said that \\"for now, we have agreed to this policy of Remain in Mexico.\\" Later, however, she noted: \\"There is no agreement of any sort between the incoming Mexican government and the US government.\\" (More on what happened at the border Sunday here.)","completion":"Once upon a time, on a Sunday, there was a big chaos at the US-Mexico border.

But that day, the people in charge of the border, called Customs and Border Protection, stopped letting people through. They did this because some people tried to cross the border by climbing over a fence. The US agents at the border tried to control the situation, so they shot tear gas at the people near the border. Tear gas makes people cry and feel uncomfortable, so they want to move away. After a while, the port of entry was opened again on the same Sunday evening, but the leader of the United States, President Trump, was not happy. He still didn't want to let people from other countries, who were waiting to ask for a special permission called asylum, come into the United States. President Trump wrote a message on the internet, called a tweet, saying that Mexico should send these people back to their countries by plane, bus, or any way possible. He also said that many of these people are criminals, but he didn't have any proof to show it. He warned that he might close the border forever if needed and asked for money to build a big wall. Some people said there was a deal between the US and Mexico to make people wait in Mexico while their asylum cases were being processed. But later, a Mexican lady named Olga Sanchez Cordero said there was no agreement between the two countries.

From time to time, you may feel depressed and frustrated. When depression strikes, you have to take measures to fight it. One of the strangest ways to fight depression is to eat salt, scientists have found. Salt acts as a natural anti-depressant , researchers say. While too much can lead to high blood pressure and heart disease, not enough can cause \\"psychological depressions\\", a study has reported. The study, by researchers at the University of Iowa in the US, discovered that when rats are _ in salt, they don't do activities they normally enjoy. The recommended daily salt intake for an adult is four grams, although experts say the body needs only half as much. However, most adults in the developed world consume around ten grams a day, mainly because their diets contain high salt amounts. Today, 77 percent of US salt intake comes from processed and restaurant foods, like frozen dinners and fast food. The minerals in salt are required by the body--in small quantities--to help move liquid in and out of cells. But too much can cause diseases, for example high blood pressure. Today scientists are finding that salt is an addictive substance--almost like a drug. One sign of addiction is using a substance even when it's known to be harmful. Many people are told to eat less salt due to health concerns, but they have trouble doing so because they like the taste and find low-salt foods tasteless. Humans have a long history of eating salt. In the Stone Age, people didn't need to find salt, because they hunted most of their food, and ate a lot of red meat, which has plenty of salt in it. But when people began to farm, about 10,000 BC, they started to eat mainly grains like rice and wheat, and very little meat. Then they had to find another way to get salt. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Which of the following statements is true according to the article about the connection between salt and depression? A) Consuming no salt at all is ideal for maintaining mental health. B) Eating too much salt can lead to heart disease and high blood pressure, while not consuming enough can cause psychological depressions.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Italian Cities Vie for Culture Capital Status RAVENNA, Italy â After six years of planning, and countless brainstorming sessions with citizens and institutions, Ravenna was ready on Thursday to face the panel of experts called on to decide which Italian city will be the European Capital of Culture in 2019. Over the course of the past week, delegations from 21 Italian cities were called to Rome to try to convince the panel of 13 experts that their city is the most cultural of them all. The European Capital of Culture initiative began 28 years ago to highlight the Continentâs rich diversity, while strengthening the ties that link different cultures and traditions throughout Europe, and, hopefully, transforming the chosen cities into tourist magnets. More than 40 cities have been singled out since the program began. Since 2011, two capitals from different European countries have been chosen. Italy and Bulgaria will host the initiative in 2019, and each will choose a city to represent it. Besides offering a yearlong program of events emphasizing the cityâs hidden strengths (in Ravenna, organizers want to plump up the fact that Dante, usually associated with Florence, is buried there), the initiative is often seen as an opportunity to regenerate a townâs image. To be considered for the preselection, candidate cities had to submit an application by Sept. 20, which gave an overview of scheduled events for the year and detailed frameworks for budgets and management of the event. A short list of cities, likely five or six, will be announced Friday evening, Italian officials said. Those cities will be asked to submit more detailed applications taking into account recommendations by the panel. A winner is expected to be declared in 2015. Italy has an unusually high number of candidates this year. By comparison, Marseille ultimately muscled out seven other French cities to become the capital for 2013 while only three cities in the Czech Republic vied to be the capital in 2015. The glut is not surprising in a country where the notion of âcampanilismoâ â denoting a proud attachment to oneâs hometown â runs deep. Several of the cities now competing for the title can even boast of having once been the capitals of sundry duchies, principalities, maritime republics, or, in the case of Ravenna, the Western Roman Empire. But the desire to be named a cultural capital is about more than local pride. As the economy suffers, candidates are also attracted by the potential financial benefits that the title can bring. Studies and estimates suggest that there is a return of 5 euros to 10 euros for every euro invested in a European Capital of Culture. Liverpool, a capital in 2008, is often given as an example. Studies showed that tourism rose 34 percent and the event generated millions in revenue. âBeing a capital of culture is an accelerator of a process and a catalyzer for resourcesâ that can transform a city, said Alberto Cassani, the coordinator of Ravennaâs organizing committee. In Italy, the competition is steep. Ravennaâs boast of making the Unesco World Heritage List â the town has eight Early Christian churches and monuments with mosaics â will not hold much sway with the selection panel. Nearly two-thirds of the other cities vying for the title, which include Lecce, Syracuse and Mantua, can make the same claim. For LâAquila, the central Italian city devastated by an earthquake in 2009, organizers think that becoming the capital of culture would give a much-needed boost to the cityâs reconstruction, which is struggling to take off. In Palermo, winning the competition is seen as a way of dealing a fresh blow to the Mafia. Matera, the city of stone dwellings in the Basilicata region perhaps best known to film audiences as the set for Mel Gibsonâs âThe Passion of the Christ,â is plugging itself as a southern success story. âItâs important for Italy to show that it is possible to recover pride in the growth of the south,â said Paolo Verri, the director of the organizing committee there. A city like Pisa, also in the running, âhas always been extraordinary,â whereas Matera has overcome extreme poverty in the last century, he said. âSymbolically it would be an important victory.â This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of Â the Mel Â Gibson movie.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I picked up this Sporf in Amsterdam Schipol airport. A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

Even though a cooler is meant to keep everything cold, you can also use it to keep hot foods hot. Double-layer aluminum foil around the interior of the cooler. The aluminum will hold the heat inside your cooler. Lay out a large piece of aluminum foil on your counter and set your hot container onto it. Make sure your food is piping hot as you wrap the foil around it. Use a few pieces of foil to cover the container completely. Use an oven mitt as you wrap the foil so you don't burn yourself. Set the container in the middle of the cooler. The heat from the container will transfer through the aluminum foil and keep the entire cooler warm. Fill new cotton socks halfway with uncooked rice. Once you have the rice inside the sock, tie a simple knot on top so none of it spills out. Use a string to tie the socks for added security. Dried beans will also work similarly. Use the regular settings on your microwave. Once they are finished, they will be nice and warm and they will hold heat for a while. Fill in the large spaces on each side of your food container. This will add more heat to the cooler and help your food stay at a reasonable temperature. Use clean towels so your food doesn't move around while you transport it. Make sure the towels are tight against your food so they insulate the heat inside. Fill a rubber hot water bottle with boiling water. It's easiest to pour the water into the bottle from a kettle or a pot with a spout. Place the hot water bottle on top of the cooler for one final heating element to keep your food warm. Seal the lid of the cooler tight after you add the water bottle so no heat can escape. The temperature of the cooler will start to drop over time. Carry a food thermometer with you to check on the temperature of your food to make sure it is above 140 °F (60 °C).

What is the answer?","completion":"The first Disney theme park opened in the Californian city of Anaheim. This park, called Disneyland, officially opened its doors on July 17, 1955. Situated in Orange County, just south of Los Angeles, Disneyland was the brainchild of Walt Disney himself. He envisioned a place where both children and adults could have fun experiences and immerse themselves in the magic of Disney. Disneyland was originally conceived as a modest-sized amusement park to be built near the Walt Disney Productions studio in Burbank. However, as the idea grew, so did the need for a larger space. After considering various locations and conducting market research, Walt and his team settled on a 160-acre orange grove site in Anaheim. This area was chosen due to its proximity to the Los Angeles metropolitan area and its accessibility via the Santa Ana Freeway. To bring his vision to life, Walt created WED Enterprises (now known as Walt Disney Imagineering) and assembled a team of talented designers, engineers, and artists. As construction began on Disneyland, the project was kept under wraps, with its development called \\"Project X.\\" It took one year and 17 million to complete the park, which was considered a significant investment at the time. Opening day was dubbed \\"Black Sunday\\" due to the numerous problems faced by the park, such as overcrowded conditions, lack of sufficient drinking water, and attraction malfunctions. However, despite the initial setbacks, Disneyland went on to become a highly successful and beloved destination. Today, Disneyland comprises several themed lands, such as Main Street, U.S.A.; Adventureland; Frontierland; Fantasyland; Tomorrowland; New Orleans Square; Critter Country; and Mickey's Toontown. Over the years, the park has undergone numerous expansions and additions, including the opening of Disney California Adventure Park in 2001, which is situated adjacent to Disneyland. As the original Disney theme park, Disneyland has inevitably influenced the design and creation of subsequent parks around the world, such as Walt Disney World in Florida, Tokyo Disney Resort in Japan, Disneyland Paris in France, and Hong Kong Disneyland in China, as well as the upcoming Shanghai Disney Resort. Each park embraces Walt Disney's initial concept of a magical, immersive experience that brings joy and wonder to people of all ages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Apollo When Zeus struck down Apollo's son Asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting Hippolytus from the dead (transgressing Themis by stealing Hades's subjects), Apollo in revenge killed the Cyclopes, who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus. Apollo would have been banished to Tartarus forever for this, but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labor, due to the intercession of his mother, Leto. During this time he served as shepherd for King Admetus of Pherae in Thessaly. Admetus treated Apollo well, and, in return, the god conferred great benefits on Admetus. Q: Why did Zeus strike down Asclepius with a lightning bolt?","completion":"Zeus struck down Asclepius with a lightning bolt because Asclepius transgressed the natural law, which was overseen by the Titaness Themis. He did this by resurrecting Hippolytus from the dead, thereby stealing subjects from Hades, the god of the Underworld. In the ancient Greek understanding, such an action was considered an affront to the natural order of the world, as death was supposed to be final and irreversible by mortal or demi-mortal beings like Asclepius. Consequently, Zeus, as the king of the gods and enforcer of divine law and the order of things, had to take punitive action against Asclepius, resulting in him being struck down by a lightning bolt. Apollo took vengeance for his son's death by killing the Cyclopes since they were the ones who had fashioned Zeus's lightning bolts. As a result, there was internal strife among the gods with gods taking sides. To punish Apollo for killing the Cyclopes, and to maintain peace amongst the gods, Zeus wanted to banish Apollo to Tartarus. However, Leto, Apollo's mother, intervened and pleaded on her son's behalf and so Zeus lessened the punishment to a year of hard labour. Consequently, Apollo was made to serve King Admetus, a mortal king in Thessaly, as a shepherd as part of his punishment. King Admetus, fortunately, treated Apollo well and honoured him, subsequently receiving much favour and blessings from Apollo when his punishment was completed. Overall, these mythic episodes underscore the interplay of power, hierarchy, divine law, and respect for the natural order within the ancient Greek pantheon, with Zeus' authority and rule often being contested and yet inexorable as he maintains the balance and order among gods, demi-gods, and mortals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how do I determine size needed for german world war 2 helmet Suggested answer: The Imperial German Army began to replace the traditional boiled-leather Pickelhaube (spiked combat helmet ) with the Stahlhelm during World War I in 1916. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"No, the suggested answer does not provide relevant information to answer the original question. To determine the size needed for a German World War II helmet, you should follow these steps: 1. Measure your head circumference: Use a flexible measuring tape to measure the circumference of your head. To ensure accuracy, wrap the measuring tape around your head, just above your eyebrows and covering the widest part of the back of your head. 2. Refer to the Stahlhelm sizing chart: The German military used a standard Stahlhelm sizing chart, which assigned shell sizes based on head circumference measurements. The chart is as follows: - Size 60: Head circumference of 53-54 cm - Size 62: Head circumference of 55-56 cm - Size 64: Head circumference of 57-58 cm - Size 66: Head circumference of 59-60 cm - Size 68: Head circumference of 61-62 cm 3. Choose the appropriate shell size according to your head circumference. Note that original German World War II helmets were designed with a two-part system – an outer steel shell and an inner leather or fabric liner. The liner was adjustable, allowing for some customization in fit. 4. Test the fit: If possible, try on the helmet to ensure that it fits comfortably and securely on your head. The inner liner should be snug but not too tight, and the chinstrap should be fastened securely to keep the helmet in place. Please note that if you're looking for a reproduction helmet, the size distribution may vary slightly from the original sizing, but the method of determining the size needed would be similar. Make sure to refer to the manufacturer's sizing chart if available."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

That means avoiding extravagance and settling for the basics. You don't have to deprive yourself to live modestly - you just have to value function and practicality over luxurious status symbols. Drive a car that is safe, comfortable, and works well. Don't choose a car for its flashiness or status value. Buy or rent a home that is sturdy, comfortable, and in a safe neighborhood. If you only need two bedrooms then don't rent or buy a place with three bedrooms. Find out the average cost to purchase a home in your area and try to work within that price range (if it fits your budget). One easy way to live a more modest lifestyle is to buy items that are used or discounted instead of paying full price. This can help you save on the basics when you're at the store. Look for items on sale, discount, or clearance when you're at a retail store. You can also check thrift stores for gently-used items available at a fraction of the cost of new items. Gently-used items are often in like-new condition. You can find these at thrift stores, consignment shops, and pawn shops. Many clothing stores put out-of-season garments on clearance. These can typically be purchased at a very low cost. Check stores that are going out of business, as they often have good deals to move products out the door. Living modestly and humbly means emphasizing your values ahead of the opinions of others. Don't trouble yourself wondering whether others are impressed with you or with your possessions. Instead, focus on living a meaningful and upstanding life.","completion":"Living a modest lifestyle involves living within your means by prioritizing function and practicality over luxury and status symbols.

Furious Mrs Cutting, who has been left to look after her four sons, who were aged between five and 11 at the time, heard the news of his rectal cancer in 2007 - just weeks after Mr Goodhead had completd the London Marathon. The IT expert, originally from Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, had visited the doctor two years earlier at The Stanstead Surgery, in Essex, near his new home in Suffolk. Lawyers for his widow told London's High Court Dr Islam, on his first day in the job, carried out nothing more than a 'simple visual examination' and failed to thoroughly investigate the problems. Dr Islam denies any responsibility for the death, and his legal team insist Mr Goodhead 'would have died in any event' even with specialist treatment from 2005. Robert Seabrook QC, representing Mrs Cutting, told the court Mr Goodhead had left the surgery believing he had nothing worse than piles. He said: 'He left the surgery believing that his diagnosis was certain, non-serious, and that no further medical input was necessary.

Q: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors.

Context: Following a major road victory against the Colts, the Patriots returned home to face another tough team in the Detroit Lions. The Patriots re-signed last season's star LeGarrette Blount who had been released by the Steelers earlier that week after leaving a game early. On the opening possession of the game Matthew Stafford hit Golden Tate for gains of 24 and 17 yards en route to the Patriots 34, but could only settle for a Matt Prater 48-yard field goal. Later, midway through the first quarter, the Patriots raced 64 yards in 9 plays scoring on Brady's 4-yard touchdown pass to Tim Wright. The Lions replied on their very next possession, driving 78 yards to the Patriots 2-yard line, but the Patriots and their elite red zone defense did their thing and Prater added a 20-yard field goal. It was all Patriots for the rest of the half. Danny Amendola returned the ensuing kickoff 81 yards to the Detroit 22. A 16-yard pass to LaFell and a 3-yard encroachment penalty to Ndamukong Suh moved the ball to the 3-yard line. On the very next play Blount added a 3-yard rushing touchdown, increasing the lead to 14-6. The Lions were able to drive to the Patriots 39, but were forced to punt. Taking over at their own 7, the Patriots methodically moved 93 yards in 13 plays, culminating with Brady find Wright again, for an 8-yard touchdown pass, increasing their lead to 21-6. The Lions drove to the Patriots 35 on the ensuing possession, but Prater missed a 53-yard field goal. Taking over at their own 43, the Patriots needed just four plays to reach the Lions 17 and Gostkowski closed out the half with a 35-yard field goal as they went into the locker room up 24-6. The Patriots took the opening kickoff of the half 70 yards down to the Lions 10-yard line trying to bury Detroit, but on 1st down Tom Brady was intercepted by James Ihedigbo. Like almost every possession on the day, the Lions did nothing and punted after five plays. The Patriots proceeded to march 50 yards to the Lions 25 and Gostkowski added a 43-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 27-6. After both teams swapped three-and-outs the Lions advanced to the Patriots 31, but once again settled for a Matt Prater field goal, making the score 27-9 early in the fourth quarter. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Lions reached the Patriots 25, but turned the ball over on downs after Stafford slid short 1-yard short of the first down on 4th-and-10. After making the Patriots punt, Stafford was intercepted by Logan Ryan. Starting at their own 34, the Patriots marched 66 yards in 9 plays, with LeGarrette Blount finished off the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. The Lions looked liked a team that was mentally unprepared and lackluster early on with their offense struggling to score in the red zone and made horrific mistakes. At the end of the game, controversy brewed when a defensive lineman slapped the head of Patriots long snapper Danny Aiken, who ended up missing the Chargers game with a concussion, in the head that led to a personal foul penalty and a first down. The Patriots promptly scored on the next play with a 3-yard Blount touchdown, which angered Lions center Dominic Raiola. Raiola later took out his frustration on Patriots defensive lineman Zach Moore by punching him in the back of the helmet. Tom Brady was 38 of 53 for 349 yards 2 TDs (both to Tim Wright) and 1 INTs. LeGarrette Blount added 78 yard on 12 carries and two TDs in his return. Matthew Stafford struggled going only 18 of 46 for 264 yards 0 TDs and 1 INTs. Joique Bell added only 48 yards on 19 carries. Another reason the Lions couldn't get going, Darrelle Revis locked down vaunted receiver Calvin Johson holding him to just 4 catches for 58 yards and 0 TDs. With the win, the Patriots improved to 9-2, not only running their winning streak to 7 games, but also making it the 14th straight winning season for the Patriots.

She was struggling to make ends meet while working on her second novel, a satire about cultural divides in a [fictional African country] when she was approached by London's The Independent newspaper to write a column as herself about single life in London. Fielding rejected this idea as too embarrassing and exposing and offered instead to create an imaginary, exaggerated, comic character. Writing anonymously, she felt able to be honest about the preoccupations of single women in their thirties. It quickly acquired a following, her identity was revealed and her publishers asked her to replace her novel about the Caribbean by a novel on Bridget Jones's Diary. The hardback was published in 1996 to good reviews but modest sales. The paperback, published in 1997, went straight to the top of the best-seller chart, stayed there for over six months and went on to become a worldwide best-seller. Fielding continued her columns in The Independent, and then The Daily Telegraph until 1997, publishing a second Bridget novel Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason in November 1999. The film of Bridget Jones's Diary was released in 2001 and its sequel in 2004. Fielding contributed the further adventures of Bridget Jones for The Independent from 2005.

Question: Information: - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Vitis vinifera (common grape vine) is a species of \\"Vitis\\", native to the Mediterranean region, central Europe, and southwestern Asia, from Morocco and Portugal north to southern Germany and east to northern Iran. There are currently between 5,000 and 10,000 varieties of \\"Vitis vinifera\\" grapes though only a few are of commercial significance for wine and table grape production. - Rockpile AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Sonoma County , California , northwest of the town of Healdsburg . Established on February 28 , 2002 , Rockpile AVA was Sonoma County 's twelfth designated wine appellation . The wine region consists of approximately 15,400 acres ( 62 km2 ) in northwestern Sonoma County . All of the AVA has an elevation in excess of 800 feet ( 244 m ) above sea level . Eleven vineyards are currently located within the AVA and there are approximately 160 acres ( 1 km2 ) of planted wine grapes . - Vitis labrusca (fox grape) is a species of grapevines belonging to the \\"Vitis\\" genus in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The vines are native to eastern North America and are the source of many grape cultivars, including Catawba, Concord, Delaware, Isabella, Niagara, and many hybrid grape varieties such as Agawam, Alexander and Onaka. Among the characteristics of this vine species in contrast to the European wine grape \\"Vitis vinifera\\" are its \\"slip-skin\\" that allows the skin of the grape berries to easily slip off when squeezed, instead of crushing the pulp, and the presence of tendrils on every node of the cane. Another contrast with European \\"vinifera\\" is the characteristic \\"foxy\\" musk of \\"V. labrusca\\", best known to most people through the Concord grape. This musk is not related to the mammalian fox, but rather to the earthy, redolent aromas characteristic of the grapes that were known by early American settlers in the New World. The term \\"foxy\\" became a sort of catchall for the wine tasting descriptors used for these American wines that were distinct from the familiar flavors of the European viniferous wines. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.

Q:- He air we breathe contains oxygen and other gases - Once in the lungs, oxygen is moved into the bloodstream and carried through your body - At each cell in your body, oxygen is exchanged for a waste gas called carbon dioxide - Your bloodstream then carries this waste gas back to the lungs where it is removed from the blood stream and then exhaled What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"The last step of the process is exhaling the waste gas, carbon dioxide, out of the lungs and into the atmosphere. This step is essential because it helps maintain the balance of gases in the body and prevents the buildup of carbon dioxide, which can be toxic. Justification: After oxygen and other gases are inhaled, oxygen is transported through the bloodstream and utilized by cells for their metabolic processes. In exchange, cells produce carbon dioxide as a waste product. The bloodstream carries this carbon dioxide back to the lungs. Once in the lungs, the waste gas diffuses from the blood and into the air sacs (alveoli). Then, through the act of exhaling, carbon dioxide is expelled from the body, completing the respiratory process.

The performance of the emulation can be inconsistent, as some games exhibit graphical glitches and stuttering audio. Even with the app's built-in menu system to adjust settings, I haven't been able to resolve all of these issues on my device. Another drawback is the lack of a proper save state system, which limits my ability to save the progress in my games on the fly without relying on the original game's save feature, if available. Moreover, I've encountered compatibility problems with certain games, rendering them unplayable on the app. While I understand that emulators may have limitations in terms of fully supporting all games, it can be frustrating when a favorite game of mine doesn't work as expected. In conclusion, the Reicast Emulator app gets a 3-star rating from me due to its user-friendly interface and a reasonable variety of supported games. However, the inconsistent performance, lack of proper save states, and compatibility issues prevent it from being a truly exceptional emulator app. I hope future updates can address these shortcomings and elevate the app to a higher level of quality and enjoyment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"Why did Kai do this?\\", is \\"give up and hide\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"No, \\"give up and hide\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Kai do this?\\" based on the given context. In the situation described, Kai took active steps to address his concerns after his initial protest was ignored. Instead of giving up, Kai pursued a more formal route by petitioning the committee for redress, which indicates that he was persistent and determined to make his voice heard. Understanding why Kai chose to petition the committee for redress requires an examination of his motivations and the available courses of action: 1. Motivations: There could be a few reasons why Kai felt the need to take further action: a. Importance of the issue: Kai may have been deeply affected or passionate about the issue he was protesting, which drove him to continue his efforts even when he encountered resistance or indifference. b. Sense of injustice: Kai might have felt wronged by the lack of response to his initial protest and decided to take further action to rectify the situation. c. Desire for change: Kai might have believed that change was necessary and petitioning the committee was the next logical step to achieve that change. 2. Available courses of action: After his initial protest fell on deaf ears, Kai had several possible options to choose from: a. Give up and hide: Kai could have chosen to withdraw from the situation, accepting defeat and letting the issue go unresolved. However, this response contradicts what actually happened, as he pursued the matter further. b. Escalate the issue: Kai chose to escalate the issue by petitioning the committee for redress, showing that he was not ready to give up on his concerns. c. Seek support: Another possible course of action for Kai could have been to gather support from others who shared his views on the issue, joining forces to amplify their collective voice. Although this option is not mentioned in the context, it demonstrates that there were more proactive alternatives to \\"give up and hide.\\" Therefore, \\"give up and hide\\" is not a valid answer to why Kai petitioned the committee for redress, as it does not accurately reflect his persistence and determination in addressing his concerns. Instead, a more appropriate answer would emphasize Kai's desire to seek justice and enact change, despite facing initial rejection from those around him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, let's look at the part with the x's. We have 41*x and -13*x. We can think of x's as toys. So we have 41 toys and we take away 13 toys. To figure out how many toys we have left, we can subtract: 41 - 13 = 28. So we have 28 toys or 28*x. Now our equation looks like this: 28*x = -28. To find out what one x (or one toy) is, we can divide the -28 by the 28 toys we have now. So we do -28 divided by 28. -28 / 28 = -1. So, x (or a single toy) equals -1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A man from a big city with a new cart and a beautiful pair of horses was driving along a country road . He did not give much attention to where he was going.

Andy Murray has been handed a relatively benign opening to his Wimbledon title defence with the draw proving more favourable than it initially looked twelve months ago. The 27 year-old Scot was handed a first round against Belgian David Goffin, the world number 104 who might be mistaken for being the member of a boy band. He is a talented ball striker but has made his biggest career impression on clay. Murray is in the same half as Novak Djokovic, who pulled out of an exhibition match to rest his troublesome wrist on Thursday, with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal on the other side. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Andy Murray practising volleys at Wimbledon on court 4. Champion: Andy Murray will start the defence of his Wimbledon title against Belgian David Goffin. The defending champion could have a major headache in the quarter finals where he might play last Sunday’s Aegon champion Grigor Dimitrov or the relentless Spanish scrapper David Ferrer. Murray’s first expected seed in the third round is Spanish baseliner Roberto Bautista Agut, although it couldbe the in-form German Tobias Kamke instead. His scheduled fourth round opponent could be tough, the big-serving South African Kevin Anderson but overall it could have come out worse. But he has managed to avoid some of the more nasty floating players in the early round, and may be pleased to have avoided his perennial semi-final nemesis Rafael Nadal before the final. Of course there is much to happen before then and the Spaniard, who flopped in last year’s first round, has an opener this time against Slovak Martin Klizan. Nadal has the nastiest looking draw of the KBig Four' with a possible second round against his 2012 conqueror Lukas Rosoi and maybe a meeting after that with the massive serving Croatian Ivo Karlovic. Focused: Rafael Nadal, who crashed out in last year's first round, will rake on Slovak Martin Klizan.

Federer has a potentially nasty second round against the athletic Frenchman Julien Benetteau, who has caused him problems at Wimbledon before. Manchester’s Dan Smetihurst, one of four men in the draw making their Wimbledon debut, will play American giant John Isner. James Ward has a tough match against Russian number one Mikhail Youznhy while Dan Evans takes on another Russian, Andrey Kuznetsov. In the women’s draw the two favourites, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, could face each other in the quarter finals in what is a tough looking top half of the draw.

Then, when the sun is setting, make sure to lock them up in their coop for the night. When locking the chickens up, make sure to count them so they’re all in the coop. Chickens will learn that their coop is home, and eventually settle inside the coop every night when it is time to go in. This will save you the trouble of rounding the chickens up. However, if you’re still having some trouble getting the chickens inside of their coop, throw some treats inside. The chickens should have access to their coop at all times during the day, but the coop should stay locked during the night. Chickens will come in and out of their coop to lay eggs, eat and drink (if the feeder and drinker is in the coop), and get away from the heat or the cold. Happy hens will, on average, lay 1 egg apiece every day. You should collect the eggs every morning or afternoon to make sure you are receiving a fresh supply. During the heat of summer, you should collect the eggs twice a day. You should collect the eggs in a basket, box or some sort of container. If you drop an egg, make sure to clean up the mess! daily. Cleaning your chickens’ coop is very important, as it prevents pests (such as mites) and diseases. The chickens’ bedding must be replaced daily, and you must also clean the whole chicken coop from time to time—weekly, for instance. The more chickens you have, the more often you’ll need to fully clean the coop. Put on some gloves and a mask and dispose of all the bedding, sweep the floor of the housing, hose the housing down, clean out the nest boxes, rinse the feeders and drinkers, and clean the perches. Do your daily routine and feed them, refill their drinker, collect eggs, etc. Then observe them and see if there is a change in appearance or behavior to make sure the chickens are healthy. Panting, cloudy eyes, sluggishness, low alertness, huddling, bald spots, a reduction in egg production, and decreased eating or drinking are all potential signs of illnesses. If you come across any of these, you should contact your vet. If one of your chickens has a bleeding wound, separate it immediately to stop the other chickens from pecking at the wound. Isolate the chicken until healed, and then return it back to its coop. Dust bathing is a way your chickens clean themselves, and it also prevents parasites such as mites or lice from infesting your chickens. If your chickens are free-range, they might have access to sufficient dirt already. if necessary. If you’re preparing your chickens for a show, or if they’re just very dirty at the time, consider bathing them. While you’re at it, clean the coop as well! Grab a big enough tub, a mild soap, and a cup or sponge. While you're bathing them you might also trim their beaks and nails, and clip their wings too.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of proper care and management of chickens to ensure their health and happiness. It provides a series of recommendations on how to maintain the coop and address potential issues that may arise. Firstly, it is essential to let the chickens roam outside during the day and securely lock them in the coop at night to keep them safe. Over time, chickens will learn to associate their coop as their home, making it easier for them to return to it when needed. If they have difficulty going inside, using treats as a lure can be helpful. Chickens should always have access to their coop during the day when necessary. Monitoring and collecting eggs daily, or even twice a day during hot summers, is essential to maintain a fresh supply. When collecting eggs, use a basket, box, or container to avoid accidentally dropping them and to ensure easy clean-up if one breaks. Routinely cleaning the chickens' coop is crucial as it keeps the environment free from pests and diseases. Regular tasks include replacing the bedding daily, weekly sweeping of the housing floor, rinsing feeders and nest boxes, and thoroughly cleaning perches. When cleaning the coop, wear protective gloves and a mask to maintain personal hygiene. Observing the chickens' overall appearance and behavior is critical to detecting early signs of illness. Some indicators of potential health issues include panting, cloudy eyes, sluggishness, low alertness, huddling, bald spots, decreased egg production, and reduced eating or drinking. If any of these signs are present, consulting a veterinarian is necessary. Separating injured or bleeding chickens from the flock is vital as it prevents other chickens from exacerbating the wound and allows the injured chicken to heal. Dust bathing is an essential self-cleaning method for chickens that also helps prevent parasite infestations. Providing the chickens with sufficient dirt for dust bathing is crucial, especially if they are free-range. Bathing the chickens may be necessary if they are participating in a show or are excessively dirty. This is a good time to trim their beaks and nails and clip their wings while ensuring that the coop remains clean. In summary, proper care and attention to the chickens' needs will result in happy and healthy hens that produce a consistent supply of eggs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Swedish golfer Henrik Stenson carded a solid 69 in the opening round of the WGC-CA Championship but it was his highly unusual recovery shot on the 12th on the Blue Monster course at Doral which raised more than a few eyebrows. Stenson did not leave much to the imagination with his Doral antics. Stenson stripped down to the bare essentials -- a pair of white boxer shorts -- before wading into the mud to hack out his ball after an wayward tee shot. The watching galleries could hardly believe their eyes as the tall Swede peeled off his clothes. \\"Shirt, trousers, socks, shoes, hat, the lot was off,\\" he told the Press Association. \\"Because of the mud I couldn't really afford to play in any of my clothes as they would have been a real mess down the last six or so holes so I had no option,\\" Stenson explained. After getting the ball back on to the fairway, Stenson eventually made a one-over par bogey on the hole when he could have dropped at least two shots by taking a drop. \\"If you are saving a shot, that has to be worth taking your shirt and trousers,\\" he added.

Some of the most unusual effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-arising Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250 BC-125 BC) in modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan and the Greco-Indian Kingdom (180 BC - 10 CE) in modern Afghanistan and India. There on the newly formed Silk Road Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian, and especially Buddhist culture. The resulting syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of Greco-Buddhist art. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China, Sri Lanka, and the Mediterranean (Greco-Buddhist monasticism). The first figural portrayals of the Buddha, previously avoided by Buddhists, appeared at this time; they were modeled on Greek statues of Apollo. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion: the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, and some Mahayana ceremonial practices (burning incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks. One Greek king, Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization extended to the sciences, where ideas from Greek astronomy filtered eastward and had profoundly influenced Indian astronomy by the early centuries AD. For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern-day Afghanistan while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets was adopted in India and eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a flat and circular earth.

Read this: The gender of God may be viewed as either a literal or an allegorical aspect of a deity who, in classical western philosophy, transcends bodily form. Polytheistic religions commonly attribute to each of the gods a gender, allowing each to interact with any of the others, and perhaps with humans, sexually. In most monotheistic religions, God has no counterpart with which to relate sexually. Thus, in classical western philosophy the gender of this one-and-only deity is most likely to be an analogical statement of how humans and God address, and relate to, each other. Namely, God is seen as begetter of the world and revelation which corresponds to the active (as opposed to the receptive) role in sexual intercourse.

East region had an alpine landscape, was situated in the mountains. North region was flat and located at sea level. But I can use this background: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate. What is an answer for this question: Which region didn't have a colder climate? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the East region experienced an alpine climate due to its higher elevation and mountainous landscape. The North region, on the other hand, was flat and located at sea level. The alpine climate is characterized by colder temperatures, with a lapse rate of 10°C per km (5.5°F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Given this background, it is the North region that didn't have a colder climate. The North region's climate would have been influenced by its flat landscape and its proximity to the sea level, which would typically result in milder temperatures compared to the alpine climate experienced in the East region. This is because the air temperature tends to decrease as we move to higher elevations due to the expansion of air and other local factors such as proximity to oceans can also play a role in modifying the climate. In this case, the East region's alpine climate would experience lower temperatures than the North region due to the differences in elevation and landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Between 4 and 7 June 1942, only six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea, the United States Navy under Admirals Chester Nimitz, Frank Jack Fletcher, and Raymond A. Spruance decisively defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto, Chuichi Nagumo, and Nobutake Kondo near Midway Atoll, inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable. Military historian John Keegan called it \\"the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare.\\" - Yamamoto held several important posts in the Imperial Japanese Navy, and undertook many of its changes and reorganizations, especially its development of naval aviation. He was the commander-in-chief during the decisive early years of the Pacific War and so was responsible for major battles such as Pearl Harbor and Midway. He died when American codebreakers identified his flight plans and his plane was shot down. His death was a major blow to Japanese military morale during World War II. - Midway Atoll (also called Midway Island and Midway Islands; Hawaiian: \\"Pihemanu Kauihelani\\") is a atoll in the North Pacific Ocean at . As its name suggests, Midway is roughly equidistant between North America and Asia. Midway Atoll is an unorganized, unincorporated territory of the United States. Midway continues to be the only island in the Hawaiian archipelago that is not part of the state of Hawaii. Unlike the other Hawaiian islands, Midway observes Samoa Time (i.e., eleven hours behind Coordinated Universal Time), which is one hour behind the time in the state of Hawaii. For statistical purposes, Midway is grouped as one of the United States Minor Outlying Islands. The Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, encompassing of land and water (mostly water) in the surrounding area, is administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The refuge and most of its surrounding area are part of the larger Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument. - The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the country's seven uniformed services. The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. This has happened twice, in 1917, during World War I, and in 1941, during World War II. - The Battle of the Coral Sea, fought during 48 May 1942, was a major naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II between the Imperial Japanese Navy and naval and air forces from the United States and Australia. The battle was the first action in which aircraft carriers engaged each other, as well as the first in which neither side's ships sighted or fired directly upon the other. - The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN; Kyjitai: Shinjitai: \\"\\" or \\"Nippon Kaigun\\", \\"Navy of the Greater Japanese Empire\\") was the navy of the Empire of Japan from 1868 until 1945, when it was dissolved following Japan's defeat and surrender in World War II. It was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff and the Ministry of the Navy, both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan as supreme commander of the army and the navy. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) was formed after the dissolution of the IJN. - The attack on Pearl Harbor, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor, the Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, and Operation Z during planning, was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II. - Pearl Harbor is a lagoon harbor on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, west of Honolulu. Much of the harbor and surrounding lands is a United States Navy deep-water naval base. It is also the headquarters of the United States Pacific Fleet. The U.S. government first obtained exclusive use of the inlet and the right to maintain a repair and coaling station for ships here in 1887. The attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on December 7, 1941 was the immediate cause of the United States' entry into World War II. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service . - A Naval Aviator is a commissioned officer or warrant officer qualified as a pilot in the United States Navy, United States Marine Corps or United States Coast Guard. - Raymond Ames Spruance (July 3, 1886 December 13, 1969) was a United States Navy admiral in World War II. - Sir John Desmond Patrick Keegan (15 May 1934 2 August 2012) was a British military historian, lecturer, writer and journalist. He was the author of many published works on the nature of combat between the 14th and 21st centuries concerning land, air, maritime, and intelligence warfare, as well as the psychology of battle. - Frank Jack Fletcher (April 29, 1885 April 25, 1973) was an admiral in the United States Navy during World War II. Fletcher was the operational commander at the pivotal Battles of Coral Sea and of Midway. As a lieutenant, Fletcher was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in battle at Veracruz. He was the nephew of Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher, who was also awarded the Medal of Honor for actions at Veracruz. - Ensign Don T.

She has blue shoelaces that look flimsy and green shoelaces that look more bulky. Which shoelaces would be more likely to snap? (A) the blue shoelaces (B) the green shoelaces. What is the most sensical answer between \\"blue shoelaces\\" and \\"green shoelaces\\"? Answer:","completion":"The most sensical answer between \\"blue shoelaces\\" and \\"green shoelaces\\" would be (A) the blue shoelaces. Before we delve into the reasons behind choosing the blue shoelaces, it is important to understand the context of the short story. Dana is looking for shoelaces for her running shoes and wants to ensure that they won't break. In this scenario, two options are presented: blue shoelaces that appear flimsy and green shoelaces that look more bulky. Now let's analyze each of the options: (A) The blue shoelaces: From the description, we can infer that the blue shoelaces might not be very sturdy because they look flimsy. A flimsy shoelace would likely be made of thinner material and may not be as strong or durable as a bulkier one. Such shoelaces might not be able to withstand the constant stress and pressures resulting from running, and therefore, could have a higher tendency to snap or wear out. (B) The green shoelaces: On the other hand, the green shoelaces appear to be a more robust and bulkier option. Bulkier shoelaces typically have a more reinforced structure, leading to a stronger and more durable product. The likelihood of these shoelaces snapping or wearing out over time will generally be lower, making them a more reliable choice for Dana's purpose, which is running. Having considered the properties of both options, the blue shoelaces appear more likely to snap, due to their flimsy appearance and potentially weaker material composition. It seems more reasonable to conclude that the green shoelaces would be a better choice for Dana, as their bulkier appearance suggests a more durable and reliable product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist.

The news that shock jock Howard Stern is jumping from free AM/FM radio to pay satellite radio has brought instant attention to the young medium. What best summarizes the content of the above article? Choose your answer from: (1). World; (2). Sports; (3). Business; (4). Science/Tech;","completion":"(3). Business; The news about renowned radio personality Howard Stern transitioning from free AM/FM radio to a subscription-based satellite radio has brought immediate attention to the budding industry of satellite radio. This development has significant implications for the business of radio broadcasting, particularly regarding changes in revenue models—moving from an advertising-based model, which is common for traditional AM/FM broadcasting, to a subscription-based model favored by satellite radio. In addition to the shift in revenue streams, Howard Stern's transition also affects competition within the broadcasting industry. As a highly popular and influential figure in radio, his move might attract more listeners to satellite radio, thereby challenging the dominance of traditional radio. This could potentially lead to an increased competitive environment between AM/FM and satellite radio, possibly triggering a shift in listener preferences and changes in the radio industry's structure. Meanwhile, Howard Stern's move can also impact business negotiations and contracts involving radio hosts, broadcasters, and satellite radio companies. Given Stern's influence and the significant media attention his decision to switch mediums has garnered, it is likely that his contract terms could set a precedent for other radio personalities considering a similar transition. Also, the fact that the news has brought quick attention to satellite radio speaks to the business's potential marketing and public relations effects. While the satellite radio industry is relatively young, notable transitions like Stern's can significantly boost its name recognition and credibility among consumers, potentially driving subscriptions and revenue growth. In all these aspects, the news about Howard Stern's move from free AM/FM radio to pay satellite radio prominently involves business-related issues, including revenue models, industry competition, contract negotiations, and marketing strategies. Thus, a narrative best fitting the domain of \\"Business.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Jason is an average guy who goes to work each day, lives in an apartment, exercises sometimes, goes out and drinks some weekends and just generally enjoys life. Brad, however, has chosen to live in a dark cave that has no windows. He lives in a cave that has almost no light except for some candles he lights from time to time. If he needs food or supplies, he pays someone to go get them, and they slide them through a hole that can open in the steel door at the entrance of the cave. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day? Hint: Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock . This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. Answer:","completion":"Jason is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day. His exposure to natural light and daily routines, such as going to work and exercising, help regulate his circadian rhythms. In contrast, Brad's living situation in a dark cave with minimal light exposure may disrupt his biological clock, making it less likely for him to maintain regular daily routines, including meal times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Groove recordings, first designed in the final quarter of the 19th century, held a predominant position for nearly a century—withstanding competition from reel-to-reel tape, the 8-track cartridge, and the compact cassette. In 1988, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in unit sales. Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles. First the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns. Retailers, fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they knew would sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes. Record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining the availability of the format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format's decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs, which were more profitable for the record companies. Now answer this question: What was a major cause of declined vinyl sales?","completion":"A major cause of the decline in vinyl sales can be attributed to the changes in return policies implemented by major label distributors between 1988 and 1991. Retailers had initially relied on the ability to return and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles to maintain their inventory. However, distributors began charging retailers more for new products if they returned unsold vinyl, eventually stopping the provision of any credit at all for returns. As a result, retailers became hesitant to order unproven or less popular titles, fearing they would be stuck with unsold inventory.

Moreover, record companies also contributed to the decline of vinyl sales by deleting many vinyl titles from production and distribution, which led to the closure of pressing plants and undermined the availability of vinyl records in the market. This reduction in availability, combined with the focus on CDs and cassettes, played a significant role in the rapid decline of vinyl sales.

Cancer Bats are a Canadian hardcore punk band from Toronto, Ontario. They have released five studio albums and six extended plays. The band is composed of vocalist Liam Cormier, guitarist Scott Middleton, drummer Mike Peters and bassist Jaye R. Schwarzer. Cancer Bats take a wide variety of influences from heavy metal subgenres and fuse them into hardcore and punk rock, and also include elements of Southern rock. Bass player Andrew McCracken left to concentrate on his design company Doublenaut. His spot was filled in by Jason Bailey (former member of Figure Four and Shattered Realm) for most of 2007. However, Bailey was then replaced by Jaye R. Schwarzer (formerly of Left Behind, Hope to Die, Minesweeper, and Kover) as he wanted to focus on being a graphic designer; he still designs artworks for Cancer Bats and remains friends with Liam Cormier. The band released their second studio album called Hail Destroyer on April 22, 2008. The album features guest vocals by Wade MacNeil of Alexisonfire and Black Lungs, Tim McIlrath of Rise Against and Ben Kowalewicz of Billy Talent. The release was held at the Mod Club in downtown Toronto with Liam Cormier not only singing for Cancer Bats, but also performing drums for Black Lungs. On May 17, 2008, Cancer Bats were put on the cover of Kerrang!, a publication which gave their album Hail Destroyer a KKKKK review (highest possible) as well as a 5k Live review on their headlining UK tour. Cancer Bats were also nominated for 2008 Album of the Year for the 2008 Kerrang! awards. Cancer Bats have performed at the Download Festival in 2007, Groezrock 2007 and at both Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2007 and 2008. In the summer of 2008, the band did an extensive summer and autumn tour with Bullet for My Valentine, Black Tide and Bleeding Through, as part of the No Fear music tour across North America. Also in 2008, they were a support act for Welsh band Funeral for a Friend during their tour of Britain and northern Europe.

Cancer Bats is a unique band that combines different music styles like heavy metal, punk rock, and Southern rock.

Write an article based on this summary: Do not squeeze or pop a deep pimple with a “head. Use a honey-baking soda exfoliant. Try an oatmeal exfoliant. Apply a sugar-olive oil exfoliant. Use a sea salt exfoliant. Article:","completion":"Title: Optimal Methods for Handling a Deep Pimple Managing skin conditions, particularly deep pimples, can be both uncomfortable and frustrating. You may have heard of the age-old adage, 'Do not squeeze or pop a deep pimple with a head.' So, what should be the correct modus operandi? It is optimal to use natural remedies that can gently and effectively deal with such skin issues. Here, we'll explore such tactics, including using a honey-baking soda exfoliant, oatmeal exfoliant, sugar-olive oil exfoliant, and a sea salt exfoliant. Tempting as it may be, it is crucial not to squeeze or try to pop a deep pimple with a head. Such actions can lead to serious consequences, including skin inflammation, scars, and even infections. Dermatologists suggest that popping pimples pushes the bacteria further into the skin, leading to an increased risk of these complications. Now, knowing this, the next question that arises is - how should we manage these painful, stubborn zits then? Let's dive into the alternative effective methods for resolving this issue. One great alternative is using a honey-baking soda exfoliant. The antibacterial properties found in honey, coupled with the coarse texture of baking soda, helps unclog the pores and eliminate excess sebum, the prime cause of pimples. Incorporating this exfoliant into your skincare routine can help manage and even prevent the development of deep pimples. Another effective method to reduce the frequency and apparent size of deep pimples is to use an oatmeal exfoliant. Oatmeal is known for its soothing properties and can help reduce redness and inflammation resulting from deep pimples. By combining oatmeal with warm water, a gentle and effective exfoliant can be created that can remove dead skin cells and minimize the presence of pimples. If soothing isn’t your sole requirement and you need something for nourishment too, try a sugar-olive oil exfoliant. This exfoliant is a perfect blend of sugar’s abrasive texture that can help remove dead skin and sebum, and olive oil’s antioxidant-rich compounds can nourish the skin. This combination creates an environment in the pores that’s not conducive for the growth of acne-causing bacteria and hence, preventing the formation of deep pimples. Last but not least, a sea salt exfoliant can also effectively manage the deep pimple issue. Sea salt has been esteemed for its antibacterial and exfoliating properties for ages. The small granules of salt not only scrub away the dead skin and excess sebum but also disrupt the bacterial milieu leading to a decrease in the frequency of deep pimples. In conclusion, eradicating deep pimples necessitates a gentle approach rather than aggressive popping or squeezing. A variety of natural exfoliants like honey-baking soda, oatmeal, sugar-olive oil, and sea salt can be game-changers in your fight against those stubborn pimples. Remember, skincare is a journey, and patience is key. Trust in the process and give your skin the care and time it needs to heal."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

A Purveyor of Brie, Prosciutto and Anthems Thirty minutes before Stinky Bklyn opens for business, its proprietor strolls the floor singing in a powerhouse tenor to Parmigiano-Reggiano and hickory-smoked Benton’s bacon. He is not being a ham. Patrick Watson is getting his pipes in shape to sing the national anthem at the Barclays Center, where he is better known as the supplier of Stinky Brown Butter Rice Krispy Treats and the crumbled blue cheese topping on the Nathan’s Famous hot dogs sold at the concession stand. Mr. Watson, 38, is a trained opera singer but has not sung before an audience since 2006, the year he and his wife opened Stinky Bklyn, their specialty cheese shop, on Smith Street in Carroll Gardens. He has never publicly performed “The Star-Spangled Banner.” On Monday, before the second-to-last Brooklyn Nets game of the season, the cheesemonger will face upward of 15,000 sports fans. “I’ll be ready,” he said. Confidence has never been an issue for Mr. Watson. He can sell a Massenet aria. He can sell 1,000 pounds of cheese a week. But he says he has never been particularly good at selling himself. “I’m a terrible self-promoter, and maybe that’s why I didn’t go further with opera,” he said. Mr. Watson’s voice, rich as a triple-cream Brillat-Savarin, has a wide range. But that proved an obstacle, he said. “Out of the gates I was too loud,” he said. “I couldn’t find the right teacher. They’d hear me sing and say, ‘Stop it, you’re not supposed to sing like that in your 20s.’ They’d try to dial me back into some sort of lyrical Mozart thing, telling me I had to wait until I was in my 30s to sing the big, dramatic roles.” After graduating from McGill University’s opera program, Mr. Watson, who grew up on Cape Cod, occasionally sang at the Metropolitan Opera (Pavarotti, he says, once told him to never give up) while supporting himself as a waiter and sommelier at top Manhattan restaurants like Gotham Bar and Grill, and Lupa. At the latter, he met Michele Pravda, a fellow server and singer. They married, and in 2004 they opened Carroll Gardens’ first boutique wine shop, Smith and Vine. Time for auditioning and performing dwindled as the couple followed up with Stinky Bklyn, a wine bar called the JakeWalk and two children. Mr. Watson’s singing became more or less consigned to blow-the-roof-off renditions of “Happy Birthday” and serenading his son and daughter with Puccini at bath time despite their complaints of “It’s too loud, Daddy.” “My neighbor must have a stock of earplugs,” he said. But Mr. Watson’s volume did not pose a problem for Petra Pope, a senior vice president for event marketing for the Brooklyn Nets, who heard his audition tape. When the Barclays arena opened in September, Ms. Pope had 44 national anthem spots to fill for the season and received about 150 recorded submissions, performed by everyone from violinists to school choirs to soloists. Some, she said, were not listenable. “It’s a very hard song to sing,” Ms. Pope said. “As soon as I heard Patrick I said yes instantly, it’s so beautiful.” “I had a little inside track,” Mr. Watson joked, explaining that a contact he had made at the arena offered to pass his tape to Ms. Pope. Practicing scales and phrasing is Mr. Watson’s main preparation for the big night. He has been trying to assist customers silently, in order to protect his vocal cords (though when he does reel off the names of cheeses, his French, Italian and Spanish pronunciations are impeccable, thanks to his operatic training). Rather than look back on what might have been, Mr. Watson keeps his focus forward. “I hope they’ll ask me back for the playoffs,” he said. “Michele and I could sing a duet.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1.

Mr. Watson has faced several obstacles in his singing career, including being told he was too loud and needed to wait until he was older to sing dramatic roles. However, his talent impressed Petra Pope, a senior vice president for event marketing for the Brooklyn Nets, who heard his audition tape and chose him to perform the national anthem. 3.

Lauer said Kathie Lee's return reminded him of that time in \\"The Godfather III\\" when Michael Corleone said, \\"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.\\" Yeah, it's just like that. \\"I'm eight years older, 10 pounds heavier, and a half-inch shorter, and just in time for HD television,\\" the 54-year-old Gifford told Lauer, who had been lined up along with Meredith Vieira, Ann Curry and the rest of the \\"Today\\" on-air talent on the world's longest couch so as to be on-screen when the news was broken. Wonderful, sanctimonious Kathie Lee, who never met a bad situation she couldn't make 10 times worse. Remember her fabulous clothing line that, it turned out, was being churned out in sweatshops? Her husband, former NFL player and sports commentator Frank Gifford, appeared at one of the factories trying to dole out cash to the workers as Kathie Lee turned herself into an anti-sweatshop crusader. Remember Frank's close encounter with a flight attendant in a hotel room, punching a cannonball-size hole in Kathie Lee's flawless marriage? She announced Frank had earned forgiveness, and a supermarket tabloid was accused of having paid the flight attendant to lure poor, naive Frank into the tryst. Eight years ago, when Gifford announced she was exiting \\"Live,\\" she said it was because she no longer felt \\"comfortable sharing the ordinary, innocent, everyday details of my family life, only to watch the tabloid media turn them into harmful, misleading and libelous stories.\\" Yesterday, on \\"Today,\\" it took under three minutes for her to bring up her son, Cody -- who, it seems like, just yesterday successfully \\"pottied\\" in the bidet of Donald Trump's private jet. Golly, how we've missed Cody. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the announcement of Kathie Lee Gifford's return to television as a co-host on the \\"Today\\" show, eight years after leaving \\"Live With Regis & Kathie Lee.\\" The announcement was made by Matt Lauer, and the article discusses Kathie Lee's past controversies, such as her clothing line being produced in sweatshops and her husband's infidelity.

By 1935, both sisters are movie actors, but Blanche has achieved stardom, while Janeâs films have flopped, leading Jane to drink heavily. One night, returning from a party, one of the sisters gets out of the car to open the gate leading up to the house, while the other attempts to run her over. The resulting accident leaves Blanche paralyzed. In 1962, a wheelchair-bound Blanche (Joan Crawford) and a bitter, irritable Jane (Bette Davis) are living together in Blanche's mansion. Because she is wheelchair-bound, Blanche rarely leaves her bedroom on the second floor and becomes close with her cleaning woman, Elvira (Maidie Norman). Elvira believes that Jane is exhibiting symptoms of mental illness and becomes concerned for Blanche's well-being, but Blanche defends her sister. Later, when Blanche informs Jane she may be selling the house, Jane's mental health begins to deteriorate further. During an argument, she removes the telephone from Blanche's bedroom, cutting Blanche off from the outside world. Later, Jane begins denying Blanche food, killing her pet parakeet and serving it to her on a platter. Later, when Jane leaves the house to put an advertisement in the paper, Blanche tries to get the attention of her neighbor, Mrs. Bates (Anna Lee), by writing a note pleading for help and throwing it out her bedroom window. Jane returns in time to notice the note and prevents Mrs. Bates from seeing it. When Jane reads the note, the two sisters quarrel again. The next time Elvira comes to clean the house, Jane initially pays her and gives her the day off, but when Elvira returns later on, Jane abruptly fires her and sends her away. Meanwhile, Edwin Flagg (Victor Buono) sees Jane's newspaper advertisement for a piano player and arrives at the mansion, where he is officially hired by Jane to help her in her delusional plan to regain her childhood stardom.

President Donald Trump meets with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday. Photo: Evan Vucci/Associated Press Breaking News... WASHINGTON—The European Union delegation meeting with President Donald Trump Wednesday agreed to some concessions in an effort to avoid a trade war with the U.S., according to a European official in the room. The official said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his top trade official Cecilia Malmström agreed to work with the U.S. administration to lower industrial tariffs on both sides, increase LNG exports and soy beans to Europe, and align regulatory standards to allow for medical devices to have better market access in Europe, the official said. Both delegations were still fine tuning language in a common statement on car tariffs, the official said. A joint news conference between Mr. Trump and Mr. Juncker was hastily being organized as the meeting was coming to an end. (more to come) Previously... WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump slammed critics of his trade policies on Wednesday, warning they are undermining his negotiating position while American farmers are being “ripped off.” Mr. Trump’s remarks, aimed at critics he didn’t name, came hours ahead of a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in which trade tensions between the U.S. and the European bloc are expected to dominate. The Europeans come to Washington with potential auto tariffs weighing heavily on their minds. Last week, Mr. Trump threatened “tremendous retribution” if his meeting with the EU officials doesn’t lead to what he considers to be a fair auto-trade deal. In the Oval Office Wednesday, Mr. Trump leaned over and tapped Mr. Juncker’s hand while describing him as a “very smart and a very tough man” who represents the European member states well. “Over the years, the United States has lost hundreds of billions of dollars to the European Union and we just want it to be a level playing field for our farmers, our manufacturers, for everybody,” Mr. Trump added. “We are close partners, allies, not enemies, we have to work together,” Mr. Juncker said. Mr. Trump didn’t respond to questions on whether he will impose auto tariffs but said that “the United States would be very pleased” to create a trade partnership where there are no tariffs, no barriers and no subsidies. Mr. Trump is also scheduled to meet with lawmakers on Wednesday to discuss his administration’s proposed plan to offer 12 billion in aid to farmers hardest hit by retaliatory tariffs imposed by U.S. trading partners. Many lawmakers expressed skepticism that the plan would yield long-term prosperity for American farmers. Mr. Trump insisted on Wednesday that the domestic political pushback accomplishes nothing but delays and hinders his ability to negotiate a deal. “When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation, it will only take longer to make a deal, and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity,” he said. “Negotiations are going really well, be cool. The end result will be worth it!” Related Video WSJ's Gerald F. Seib looks at the trade deal between Japan and the EU, and explains how President Trump’s trade policy might drive other countries to form their own agreements. Photo: Martin Bureau/Press Pool He wrote, “Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off?” U.S. trading partners are retaliating against Mr. Trump’s decision to order tariffs on imports including metals, clothing and electronics from a broad range of countries, including China, Mexico, Canada and European Union member states. The retaliatory tariffs have already been felt across America’s Farm Belt. China, a huge market for U.S. agricultural exports, has applied tariffs on 34 billion worth of U.S. goods, including soybeans and pork. Canada, Mexico and the EU have also hit back with tariffs of their own. “China is targeting our farmers, who they know I love & respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S.,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter Wednesday. “They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. We were being nice - until now!” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue wrote on Twitter late Tuesday that the farm aid package “is clear statement that other nations can’t bully our agricultural producers to force the U.S. to cave in to unfair trade practices & retaliatory tactics.” On Tuesday, many lawmakers from Mr. Trump’s own Republican party criticized the announcement that his administration would offer farmers a one-time aid package, describing it as a bailout lacking any long-term solutions. Republican lawmakers from farm states said they expected to meet Wednesday with Mr. Trump to discuss a pending farm bill and farm aid. Some Republicans are jittery about the potential for political repercussions heading into the November midterm elections. “The action that I’d like to see is resolving this tariff fight and moving forward with trade opportunities, ” said Sen. Cory Gardner (R., Colo.), who chairs the Senate Republican campaign arm for the Senate Republicans. Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow said Wednesday morning on CBS, “Nobody is really thrilled about this. We’re just trying to protect American agriculture from some of the unfair trading practices.” Ahead of Mr. Trump’s meeting, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem met with lawmakers, seeking insights about how to approach Mr. Trump. Republican lawmakers, who have been hoping to persuade Mr. Trump to step back from the brink, said they urged her to reach an agreement to lower tariffs. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said he and the trade commissioner discussed “how we can come to an agreement to lower tariffs and trade barriers, avoiding the escalation of trade tensions.” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) encouraged her to work with the president to strengthen the trans-Atlantic partnership, including through the reduction of tariffs, a spokeswoman said. While Mr. Trump’s aggressive trade policies with China have been celebrated by members of both the major political parties, his decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico have been met with more skepticism. The Trump administration justifies the move on the grounds of national security and a growing trade deficit—arguments those countries dismiss as farcical. Mr. Trump repeatedly complains that the EU imposes 10% tariffs on auto imports, compared with 2.5% imposed by the U.S. He declines to mention the 25% tariffs the U.S. imposes on light trucks, versus the 10% rate in Europe. Mr. Trump recently described the EU as “a foe” on trade. —Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article. ||||| Traders Michael Milano, center, and Robert Oswald, right, work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Wednesday, July 25, 2018.

Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. \\"Jerusalem,\\" he mumbled. \\"Towers - golden. Gates of pearl. Crystal waters.\\" Then he panted heavily. \\"Hush, sire,\\" she whispered. \\"Rest easy.\\" The Kings wife: - was not in the room - was beautiful - not enough information - was also tall Answer:","completion":"From the given passage, we understand that Countess Nicolette de Gobignon is attending to the King in his final moments. The room is crowded with people, including the King's family and courtiers, making it uncomfortably hot and stuffy. However, there is no explicit mention of the King's wife being present in the room. Instead, we only know that she, along with the King's mother, grieves for him but is too distracted to alleviate his suffering effectively.

The 1997 TNM staging system for prostatic carcinoma and the 2002 revision thereof classified prostatic carcinoma with bladder neck involvement classified as pT4 disease. This classification is based on the belief that tumors that invade surrounding structures are more aggressive and warrant higher staging than tumors that do not invade surrounding structures. Recent reports in the literature suggested that microscopic involvement of the bladder neck does not carry independent prognostic significance. Therefore, resection specimens with bladder neck involvement should not be classified as pT4. The current study prospectively examined the prognostic significance of bladder neck involvement by prostatic carcinoma.', 'The authors analyzed the totally embedded and whole-mounted radical prostatectomy specimens from 364 consecutive patients. The mean patient age was 66 years (range, 41-77 years). The bladder neck, which had been coned from the specimen, was cut in a perpendicular fashion. Involvement of the bladder neck was defined as the presence of neoplastic cells within the smooth muscle bundles of the coned bladder neck. The data were prospectively collected. Bladder neck involvement was analyzed in relation to age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, prostate weight, Gleason score, final pathologic classification, tumor volume, surgical margin status, the presence of high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasm, multifocality, seminal vesicle invasion, extraprostatic extension, perineural invasion, and PSA recurrence.', 'Bladder neck involvement was found in 22 (6%) of 364 patients. Univariate results indicated that bladder neck involvement versus no bladder neck involvement was significantly associated with preoperative PSA (P < 0.001), higher pathologic classification (P < 0.001), larger tumor volume (P < 0.001), extraprostatic extension (P < 0.001), positive surgical margins (P < 0.001), and PSA recurrence (P = 0.003). In a multivariate logistic regression model controlling for pathologic classification, Gleason score, and surgical margin status, bladder neck involvement was an independent predictor of PSA recurrence (P = 0.04). The adjusted odds ratio for bladder neck involvement was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-10.03). A:","completion":"Part #1: Construct a question based on the information present in the passage. Usage: \\"What relationship does bladder neck involvement have with preoperative PSA levels in prostatic carcinoma patients?\\" This question is based on the information provided in the passage, which states that bladder neck involvement is significantly associated with preoperative PSA levels. Part #2: The question should be unambiguous. Usage: As shown, the question is unambiguous because it clearly asks about the relationship between bladder neck involvement and preoperative PSA levels. Part #3: The question should be answerable from the passage. Usage: The question can be answered from the passage, as it states: \\"Univariate results indicated that bladder neck involvement versus no bladder neck involvement was significantly associated with preoperative PSA (P < 0.001)...\\" Part #4: The answer to the question should be unique. Usage: In this case, the answer is unique because there is only one mention of the relationship between bladder neck involvement and preoperative PSA levels in the passage. Part #5: The answer should use text phrases from the passage. Usage: The answer using text phrases from the passage would be: \\"Bladder neck involvement is significantly associated with preoperative PSA levels (P < 0.001).\\" Part #6: The question should not be answerable without understanding the passage. Usage: The question meets this criterion because it requires an understanding of the passage to know the relationship between bladder neck involvement and preoperative PSA levels. Part #7: The question should not use the same words or phrases from the passage. Usage: The question avoids using the same words or phrases from the passage by asking \\"What relationship does bladder neck involvement have with preoperative PSA levels in prostatic carcinoma patients?\\" instead of directly quoting the phrase \\"significantly associated with preoperative PSA levels.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Everyone argues with those they feel close to. The strongest relationships involve partners who argue, but do so with resolution in mind. If you don't argue at all, it's a bad sign. If even the simplest arguments turn into week-long drama-fests, it's also a bad sign. When couples don't fight, it usually means that one or both people are not being entirely honest. When needs, desires, and difficulties are not voiced, they are not addressed, and the relationship remains weakened. Healthy arguments are free of violence in all its forms: verbal and physical. The fights are fair, and no one tries to manipulate the other party. The two of you should be able to laugh with each other and at each other. There should be room for seriousness in a serious relationship, of course, but you also need to balance that out with a healthy dose of humor. The teasing that goes on between you two should be gentle and playful, though. If one person routinely breaks into tears, you're doing something wrong. If the two of you need constant chatter and excitement to make your relationship work, it could be a sign that your relationship won't work, or it may just mean that your relationship is still too new to predict the future. Enjoying the mundane means wanting to learn the little details about your partner's past and present life. Enjoying the ordinary also means feeling content to sit in and spend a quiet evening together. It's natural to crave excitement from time to time, but you need to be able to enjoy your partner's presence during the dull times, as well. The two of you should connect in little ways and big ways. Look for shared interests and similar quirks. Also ask yourself if the two of you share similar priorities and goals. If the two of you have different goals, your lives will naturally move in different directions. For example, if you want to settle down, marry, and have children, but your partner wants to explore the world and has no interest in raising kids, the things you want out of life may simply be too different to make things work. Hobbies and everyday interests are less important than goals, but still worth paying attention to. Having one or two shared interests will make it easier for you to spend time together. The more unusual or obscure those interests are, the better. A strong relationship is built around respect and commitment. You need to be able to respect your partner, but you also need a partner who will respect you in equal amounts. Respect leads to everything else a healthy relationship requires: commitment, trust, communication, and general satisfaction. Without respect, none of these other qualities can take root. Think about past conversations the two of you had concerning the future. When the topic comes up, both of you should feel comfortable discussing it, and both of you should be able to picture the other as a part of your own future. Your talks about the future don't always need to be serious. If it's still early in your relationship, you might casually of the things you should do together \\"next month\\" or \\"next year.\\" As your commitment grows, however, the two of you should be able to talk about your long-term future and the rest of your lives. Your significant other should be the one person you want to share everything with. “Everything” means just about everything—exciting news, fears, that great new coffee shop you found, and so on. Ask yourself how often you stumble upon interesting things you want to share with your partner later on. The more often this happens, the more deeply rooted that person is in your mind. A deep connection signifies a deeper level of commitment. More significantly, honesty needs to feel natural for both of you. If you find yourself keeping secrets or know that your partner routinely hides information from you, that's a bad sign. While a committed relationship definitely runs deeper than mere physical attraction, good chemistry is also important. Fireworks do not need to go off every time your eyes meet, but there should at least be an occasional spark. Physical intimacy and emotional intimacy are closely related. You need both to balance out a romantic relationship. \\" Both of you should have a greater interest in working through things together than working through them separately. You may need to put the welfare of the relationship above your own individual desires from time to time, and you both should be okay with doing so when the situation really calls for it. The first \\"we\\" thoughts are usually positive. The mind shifts from \\"what am I doing this weekend?\\" to \\"what are we doing this weekend?\\" Eventually, though, your \\"we\\" thoughts need to shift to more serious matters. For instance, if you're offered a new job in a different location, you should be just as interested in how it will affect your future as a couple instead of only thinking of how it will affect your future as an individual. Ask yourself how much time you spend being together and how much time the two of you spend talking about how things or and how they should be. Being able to live in the “now” is important if you want to stay together in the future. Of course, you need to be able to address issues and desires as they come up. If these problems preoccupy you too often, though, it's a signal that things don't flow naturally between the two of you.","completion":"This article talks about how the strongest relationships have healthy arguments, honesty, humor, shared interests, respect, commitment, and good communication, and how it's important to enjoy each other's company in both exciting and ordinary times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - Halberstadt is a town in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, the capital of Harz district. Located north of the Harz mountain range, it is known for its old town centre that was severely damaged in World War II and rebuilt in the following decades. - Israel Jacobson ( October 17 , 1768 , Halberstadt -- September 14 , 1828 , Berlin ) was a German - Jewish philanthropist and communal organiser . While he lacked a systematic religious approach , he is considered one of the heralds of Reform Judaism . - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\".

EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Reform Judaism (also known as Liberal Judaism or Progressive Judaism) is a major Jewish denomination which emphasizes the evolving nature of the religion, the superiority of its ethical aspects to the ceremonial ones, and a belief in a continuous revelation not centered on the theophany at Mount Sinai. It is characterized by a lesser stress on ritual and personal observance, regarding Jewish Law as of basically non-binding nature, and great openness to external influences and progressive values. The origins of Reform Judaism lay in 19th-century Germany, where its early principles were formulated by Rabbi Abraham Geiger and his associates. Its greatest center today is in North America. - Abraham Geiger (24 May 181023 October 1874) was a German rabbi and scholar, considered the founding father of Reform Judaism. Emphasizing its constant development along history and universalist traits, Geiger sought to reformulate received forms and design what he regarded as a religion compliant with modern times. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states.

Question: What is Nguyen Huu An's position in the military? Title: We Were Soldiers Movie plot: A French unit on patrol in Vietnam in 1954, during the final year of the First Indochina War, is ambushed by Viet Minh forces, probably the Battle of Mang Yang Pass. Viet Minh commander Nguyen Huu An orders his soldiers to \\"kill all they send, and they will stop coming\\". Eleven years later, the U.S. is fighting the Vietnam War. U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) is chosen to train and lead a battalion. After arriving in Vietnam, he learns that an American base has been attacked, and is ordered to take his 400 men after the enemy and eliminate the North Vietnamese attackers, despite the fact that intelligence has no idea of the number of enemy troops. As the haunting lament \\"Sgt. MacKenzie\\" plays, Moore leads a newly created air cavalry unit into the Ia Drang Valley. After landing in the \\"Valley of Death\\", the soldiers learn that the location they were sent to is actually the base camp for a veteran North Vietnamese army division of 4,000 men. Upon arrival in the area with a platoon of soldiers, 2nd Lt. Henry Herrick spots an enemy scout, runs after him, and orders reluctant soldiers to follow. The North Vietnamese scout lures them into an ambush, resulting in several men being killed, including Lt. Herrick and his subordinates. The surviving platoon members are surrounded with no chance of retreat. Sgt. Savage assumes command, calls in artillery, and uses the cover of night to keep the Vietnamese from overrunning their small defensive position. Meanwhile, with helicopters constantly dropping off units, Lt. Col. Moore manages to secure weak points before the North Vietnamese can take advantage of them. On the second day, despite being trapped and desperately outnumbered, the main U.S. force manages to hold off the North Vietnamese with artillery, mortars, and helicopter airlifts of supplies and reinforcements. Eventually, North Vietnamese commander Nguyen Huu An orders a large-scale attack on the American position. At the point of being overrun by the enemy and with no options left, Moore...

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: It is obvious that television brings us not only advantages but also disadvantages . At first, television is both a convenient channel of amusement, and a ly cheap one. If we have a TV set in the family, we are not necessary to go to the cinema or theatre to enjoy programme with expensive tickets. All that they have to do is press a button with a finger, and they can watch all the programmes they like, such as TV talk shows , movies, opera and so on. But some people think of it as a danger. When we watch TV, we don't need to do anything . We do not even have to leave our sofa because we have a remote control in our hand. We don't need to make any judgment or statement about it. We are totally passive and don't use our head to think hard about some matters. As we all know, television keeps us informed about world events--including all the events in society, science and politics .We can get a good idea of the most remote countries and the strangest customs in their country. Of course the radio performs this service too, but the effect of the programme is not better than on the television. Everything we enjoy on the television is much more vivid and realistic. However, in turn there is a great danger. Usually we cannot resist the television screen, because it has a great harm for us. We have been so accustomed to enjoying the screen, so dependent on its pictures. But when our TV sets are out of order, we are surprised to find that we have much more time to do things. And at this time we actually begin to have a talk to each other again. It is really worth thinking. Of course the arguments about the advantages and disadvantages of television are on the go.We can not simply say television itself is good or bad. The truth is that how we use it determines its true value to our society. Question: According to the passage , whether TV is good or not depends on _ .

There are several indicators in the text that suggest this conclusion: 1. Use of soy milk: Choosing soy milk instead of regular dairy milk is common among those who follow a vegan or plant-based lifestyle. Vegans refrain from consuming animal products, which includes dairy milk. Soy milk, made from soybeans, is a popular dairy alternative and is often used in vegan recipes. 2. Agar agar powder: Agar agar is a gelatin substitute that comes from red algae and is often used in vegan or plant-based recipes. Gelatin, which is derived from animal collagen, is not considered vegan, so agar agar is a suitable alternative for those who avoid animal products. 3. Dairy-free yogurt: The text refers to a \\"yogurt bowl.\\" Since regular yogurt is made from dairy milk, one can assume that the person is using a dairy-free or plant-based yogurt in this recipe. This is another indication of a vegan or plant-based lifestyle. 4. Mention of a cooled shell: The mention of pouring the filling into a cooled shell could also suggest that the person is following a plant-based lifestyle. Vegan or plant-based pie shells may be made without the use of animal-based ingredients such as butter or lard. In conclusion, based on the choice of ingredients, methods and, the nature of the recipe, it can be inferred that the person engaged in this activity might follow a vegan or plant-based lifestyle. They are opting for non-animal alternatives for milk, yogurt, and gelatin, which are traditionally animal-based ingredients.

Make this proper case","completion":"Cross stitching on white pearl Aida fabric with a thread count of 4.4 per centimeter (or 11 threads per inch) can create a beautifully detailed and intricate design. To ensure the best results, follow the steps below using a black and white counted pattern: 1. Gather materials: Before beginning, ensure you have the necessary materials at hand. These may include: a. White pearl Aida fabric with 4.4 threads per centimeter (11 threads per inch) b. Embroidery floss in the colors required by your pattern c. Cross stitch needle d. Embroidery hoop or frame (optional, but helpful to maintain fabric tension) e. Scissors f. Black and white counted cross stitch pattern 2. Prepare the fabric: To prevent fraying, carefully serge or sew the edges of your Aida fabric. If using an embroidery hoop or frame, secure the fabric within it, ensuring it's taut and evenly tensioned. 3. Find the center: Fold the Aida fabric in half lengthwise and then in half widthwise, gently creasing the fabric at the corners to locate the center. This step is crucial, as you will begin stitching from this central point outward to ensure your design remains centered. 4. Thread the needle: Cut a length of embroidery floss (approximately 45-60cm) and separate the strands as needed, according to your pattern's specifications. Most patterns call for two strands of floss. Thread the required number of strands through the eye of your cross stitch needle, leaving a tail of about 2.5 cm. There's no need to knot the tail end. 5. Begin stitching: Referring to the black and white counted pattern, identify the center and match it with the center of your fabric. Begin stitching by bringing the needle up through the fabric from the back, leaving the tail end at the rear. As you make more stitches, the tail will become secured in place. Proceed with stitching in the direction indicated by your pattern, counting the squares on both the fabric and pattern for precise placement. 6. Cross your stitches: Work the stitches in rows, completing a series of half stitches (diagonal) in one direction before going back to finish the cross with the other diagonal half. 7. Follow the pattern: Continue to reference the black and white pattern as you stitch, ensuring that you accurately count each square and place stitches according to the design. Periodically check your work against the pattern to confirm correct placement and maintain consistency. 8. Finish off: When you complete a section of a particular color, or when you're nearing the end of a cut length of floss, you'll need to secure the thread at the back of your work. To do this, pass the needle through the back of several nearby stitches without piercing the fabric, and then trim any excess floss. 9. Frame or finish your project: Once the entire pattern is stitched, gently hand wash or spot clean the fabric if necessary. Press the completed piece from the back, and either frame it, make it into a pillow, or use it in any other way you desire. By following these steps and carefully adhering to the black and white counted cross stitch pattern, you can create a stunning work of hand-stitched art on white pearl Aida fabric with 4.4 threads per centimeter (11 threads per inch).

We fantasize about what it will be like when we reach the long-awaited goal .We work very hard to realize this dream. Then, at last, we find ourselves there. But we often gain back what we have lost. Even so, we continue to believe that next time it will be different. Next time, we will keep it off. Next time, being thin will finally fulfill its promise of everlasting happiness, self-worth, and, of course, love. It took me a long time to realize that there was something more for me to learn about beauty. Beauty standards vary with culture. In Samoa a woman is not considered attractive unless she weighs more than 200 pounds. More importantly, if it's happiness that we want, why not put our energy there rather than on the size of our body? Why not look inside? Many of us strive hard to change our body, but in vain. We have to find a way to live comfortably inside our body and make friends with and cherish ourselves. When we change our attitudes towards ourselves, the whole world changes. The passage tries to stress the importance of _ . A) body size B) different beauty standards C) culture difference D) attitudes towards life Answer:","completion":"D) attitudes towards life"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Not since Caligula have I considered turning off the movie half-way through....but then with this one, I was only 15 minutes in when I considered. Unfortunately, I did make it all the way through. Make sure that you do not. It's not that Cradle of Fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual. It's that it's not any of those things, yet it so desperately wants to be all of them. Instead, it's boring, trite, ordinary, predictable, and unexceptionally poorly executed (shot on video, high school special effects, no sense of even basic visual storytelling, dialog barely audible...not that it's worth hearing, though). This movie is proof for the argument that even the straight-to-video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere. Would you say this review is positive or negative? Choose your answer from: - negative - positive","completion":"This review is undoubtedly negative. The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction and disappointment with the movie \\"Cradle of Fear\\" on multiple levels. They criticize it for its lack of excitement, predictability, poor execution, and overall low quality. The statement at the end serves as a strong indicator of the negative tone, as it implies that even straight-to-video distributors should have higher standards than releasing such a movie. Their experience watching the movie was so unpleasant that they wished they had turned it off halfway through, like they had once done with \\"Caligula.\\" They warn others not to waste their time with \\"Cradle of Fear,\\" making it clear that they find the film to be severely lacking in any redeeming qualities. Furthermore, the review emphasizes the movie's failed attempts at shock value, gore, fear, and sexuality, pointing out that it does not achieve any of these intended effects. The technical aspects, such as visual storytelling, special effects, and audio quality, are also deemed unsatisfactory. The reviewer mentions feeling bored and disengaged while watching, which is the opposite of what a successful and engaging movie should accomplish. Hence, based on the numerous negatively-charged words and phrases used throughout the review, the overall tone can be accurately described as negative. It is evident that the reviewer would not recommend \\"Cradle of Fear\\" to others and expresses their frustration with how poorly it was executed and its inability to evoke the intended emotions and reactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It had been organised by blogger Indigo Rosee, in collaboration with the store. The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up. Then everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products. They’re truly luxurious, I recently reviewed the new Firming Ritual collection recently and absolutely loved it. I then had a look round some of the offers that the store was promoting, a lot of the Shower Gels and Body Butters were on sale (I just LOVE The Body Shop® Body Butters) and there were lots of gift sets too. It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are. I also spent a lot of time looking at the 2017 beauty advent calendars. This year The Body Shop® are offering 3 different advent calendars starting from just £45. The larger calendars included some full size products too which I thought was great. There’s also going to be a Countdown to New Year calendar priced at just £50 which I thought was a great fun idea.

Summarize this article: At a winding-up hearing at the High Court, Orient owner Francesco Becchetti has been given until 12 June to pay off debts or sell the club. The League Two side were the subject of a winding-up petition brought by HM Revenue & Customs over unpaid taxes. Those debts have now been paid, but money is owed to four other creditors. Chief executive Alessandro Angelieri gave the court a statement saying Becchetti would invest £1m to pay off remaining debts in eight to 10 weeks. Adam Michaelson, legal adviser to the Leyton Orient Fans' Trust, told BBC Radio London: \\"It leaves the club in a state of significant uncertainty and frankly mortal danger. \\"In respect of a potential sale, we would call upon Mr Becchetti now to look to sell the club at the earliest possible opportunity and make good on the promise that he's made.\\" In January, Becchetti said he would be willing to consider selling the struggling League Two side, which he bought in 2014. The club's latest set of accounts, from the year ending 30 June 2015, showed the club had debts of £5,512,449 - more than the value of the club's assets of £5.5m. Analysis - Phil Parry, BBC Radio London So, with a sword of Damocles still swinging over their heads, Orient will have to battle on. Mathematically they still have a chance to avoid relegation, although form would suggest that is unlikely. They have eight games left, are seven points from safety and have picked up just three points from the last 24 available. Off the pitch, with outstanding bills yet to be paid, operations at Brisbane Road may be difficult. For example, a company which provides matchday stewards is on the list of creditors, and perhaps the remaining matchday programmes may not return to full size. As we wait to see if the extra £1m investment promised in court materialises, fans will continue to make preparations for all eventualities. The Fans' Trust has already raised more than £100,000 and are planning to keep Leyton Orient alive in some guise, including a possible 'phoenix club'. Meanwhile, all eyes will be peeled to see if talk of a buy-out comes to fruition.","completion":"Leyton Orient football club's owner Francesco Becchetti has until 12 June to pay off debts or sell the club following a winding-up hearing that was held at the High Court.

The premise is very intersting and I'm a fan of Rufus Sewell. The only thing scary about this film was how boring it was. The director lingers way too long on scenes with no dialogue and random images. Possibly to make up for the total lack of story or characters to care about. I kept waiting for the film to pick-up and do something that made sense. One thing that would have made sense is for the lead male character to leave his crazy, pouty-mouthed wife in the jungle to talk to the trees. But alas, we're expected to believe that a pampered European couple could wander aimlessly through the jungles of Southwast Asia without running into anything worse than a pack of children with pointy sticks. Yes, the imagery was intriguing but I could have gotten that from a documentary film about Burma which would have been more interesting. However, a bowl of cereal would have been more interesting.

It was principally the widespread introduction of a single feature, the pointed arch, which was to bring about the change that separates Gothic from Romanesque. The technological change permitted a stylistic change which broke the tradition of massive masonry and solid walls penetrated by small openings, replacing it with a style where light appears to triumph over substance. With its use came the development of many other architectural devices, previously put to the test in scattered buildings and then called into service to meet the structural, aesthetic and ideological needs of the new style. These include the flying buttresses, pinnacles and traceried windows which typify Gothic ecclesiastical architecture. But while pointed arch is so strongly associated with the Gothic style, it was first used in Western architecture in buildings that were in other ways clearly Romanesque, notably Durham Cathedral in the north of England, Monreale Cathedral and Cathedral of Cefalù in Sicily, Autun Cathedral in France.

More work (that they didn't charge us for, but I don't believe was really done) and they PROMISE the car is better than new.

Question: suppose more evaporation happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER weathering occurring. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less Step 1: Identify how the process of weathering works in the given context. In this context, water gets into cracks in rocks and eventually freezes into ice, causing the cracks to expand and rocks to split into smaller pieces over time. This is an example of freeze-thaw weathering. Step 2: Understand the concept of evaporation. Evaporation is the process of liquid water turning into water vapor, which eventually gets removed from the surface. Step 3: Evaluate the impact of more evaporation on the weathering process. If more evaporation occurs, there will be less liquid water available to seep into the cracks in rocks. As a result, the formation of ice within those cracks will be reduced. Step 4: Determine the effect of decreased ice formation on the weathering process. Since ice formation is essential in causing the expansion of cracks and splitting of rocks, less ice formation due to increased evaporation will likely result in less weathering occurring. Based on these steps, the correct answer is B: less weathering will occur due to increased evaporation."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Context: Taylor lied and told Alex they were going out of town to avoid going to Alex's party.

Background: Zelda Fitzgerald (nee Sayre; July 24, 1900 - March 10, 1948) was an American socialite, novelist, painter and wife of author F. Scott Fitzgerald. Born in Montgomery, Alabama, she was noted for her beauty and high spirits, and was dubbed by her husband as \\"the first American Flapper\\". She and Scott became emblems of the Jazz Age, for which they are still celebrated. The immediate success of Scott's first novel This Side of Paradise (1920) brought them into contact with high society, but their marriage was plagued by wild drinking, infidelity and bitter recriminations. Context: Zelda first met the future novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald in July 1918, when he had volunteered for the army, and was stationed at Camp Sheridan, outside Montgomery. Scott began to call her daily, and came into Montgomery on his free days. He talked of his plans to be famous, and sent her a chapter of a book he was writing. He was so taken by Zelda that he redrafted the character of Rosalind Connage in This Side of Paradise to resemble her. He wrote, \\"all criticism of Rosalind ends in her beauty,\\" and told Zelda that \\"the heroine does resemble you in more ways than four.\\" Zelda was more than a mere muse, however--after she showed Scott her personal diary, he used verbatim excerpts from it in his novel. At the conclusion of This Side of Paradise, the soliloquy of the protagonist Amory Blaine in the cemetery, for example, is taken directly from her journal. Gloria Patch, in The Beautiful and the Damned, is also known to be a permutation of the \\"subjects of statement\\" that appear in Zelda's letters. F. Scott Fitzgerald was known to appreciate and take from Zelda's letters, even at one point borrowing her diary while he was writing This Side of Paradise. In 1918, Scott showed her diary to his friend Peevie Parrot who then shared it with George Jean Nathan. There was allegedly discussion between the men of publishing it under the name of \\"The Diary of a Popular Girl\\". Zelda's letters stand out for their \\"spontaneous turn of phrase and lyrical style\\" and tendency to use dashes, visually similar to the poems by Emily Dickinson, and experimental grammar. According to Nancy Milford, Scott and Zelda's first encounter was at a country club dance in Montgomery, which Scott fictionalised in his novel, The Great Gatsby, when he describes Jay Gatsby's first encounter with Daisy Buchanan, although he transposed the location in the novel to a train station. Scott was not the only man courting Zelda, and the competition only drove Scott to want her more. In the ledger that he meticulously maintained throughout his life, Scott noted in 1918, on September 7, that he had fallen in love. Ultimately, she would do the same. Her biographer Nancy Milford wrote, \\"Scott had appealed to something in Zelda which no one before him had perceived: a romantic sense of self-importance which was kindred to his own.\\" Their courtship was briefly interrupted in October when he was summoned north. He expected to be sent to France, but was instead assigned to Camp Mills, Long Island. While he was there, the Armistice with Germany was signed. He then returned to the base near Montgomery, and by December they were inseparable. Scott would later describe their behavior as \\"sexual recklessness.\\" On February 14, 1919, he was discharged from the military and went north to establish himself in New York City. They wrote frequently, and by March 1920, Scott had sent Zelda his mother's ring, and the two had become engaged. Many of Zelda's friends and members of her family were wary of the relationship, as they did not approve of Scott's excessive drinking, and Zelda's Episcopalian family did not like the fact that he was a Catholic. Question: Did they marry? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald got married. After getting engaged in March 1920, they eventually got married on April 3, 1920 in New York City."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Taliban-held U.S. soldier released in exchange for Afghan detainees Bergdahl, 28, who had been held captive nearly five years, broke down in tears. His release was secured after the Obama administration, working through Qatari government intermediaries, agreed to free five high-profile Afghan inmates held by the U.S. military in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The influential commanders, including the former head of the Taliban’s army, were loaded onto a U.S. military aircraft bound for Qatar after U.S. officials got confirmation that Bergdahl had been freed. Bergdahl’s “safety and health were both in jeopardy,” and officials had to act quickly to obtain his release, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Sunday, according to the Associated Press. President Obama hailed Bergdahl’s recovery as a triumph of years of high-wire diplomatic efforts that reached a breakthrough in the waning months of the U.S. combat mission there. “He wasn’t forgotten by his country,” Obama said Saturday evening in the Rose Garden, standing alongside Bergdahl’s parents, Robert and Jani. “The United States of America does not ever leave our men and women in uniform behind.” His father, who grew a long beard in a gesture of solidarity with his son, said a few words to him in Pashto, the language spoken in southern Afghanistan, saying that he understood his son is having trouble speaking English. “I am your father, Bowe,” Robert Bergdahl said. “I look forward to continuing the recovery of our son which will be a considerable task for our family.” While leaders across the political spectrum expressed relief at the news, prominent Republican lawmakers chided the White House for skirting a legal requirement to notify them about the planned release of Guantanamo inmates. Some criticized the president for breaking with longtime U.S. policy against negotiating with militant groups. “This fundamental shift in U.S. policy signals to terrorists around the world a greater incentive to take US hostages,” Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. The AP reported Hagel, who was traveling to Afghanistan to meet with U.S. troops, as saying that the action was not relayed to Congress because of its urgency. He said intelligence indicated that Bergdahl’s “health was deteriorating.” Bergdahl’s release at 10:30 a.m. in Khost province, which borders Pakistan, capped a week of intense, secret negotiations conducted through the Qataris. A team of dozens of Special Operations forces took custody of Bergdahl from a group of 18 Taliban fighters. The rare encounter on the battlefield between warriors who have spent years killing one another lasted just a few minutes and was peaceful, U.S. officials said. Bergdahl walked onto the aircraft, U.S. officials said, suggesting he is in relatively stable health. Officials said it was too early to know anything definitive about the mental state of a soldier who bewildered his comrades after he walked off base in volatile Paktika province on June 30, 2009. Officials at the Pentagon, who had grown concerned that the end of the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan at the end of the year would dim the prospect of getting Bergdahl back alive, rejoiced. “It is our ethos that we never leave a fallen comrade,” Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a statement. “Today we have back in our ranks the only remaining captured soldier from our conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Welcome home Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.” There was no indication that the soldier would face any reprimand for the circumstances under which he was taken, which led some of his comrades to call him a deserter. While it is unclear whether he will remain on active duty, a senior U.S. military official said the Army plans to promote Bergdahl to staff sergeant next month. “I can’t imagine there would be repercussions,” said the official, who was among several who would speak about the case only on the condition of anonymity. Defense officials said they were working to get Bergdahl to the United States as soon as possible. After passing through Bagram air base in Afghanistan, Bergdahl was en route to the U.S military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, according to Pentagon officials traveling with Hagel. They said his first U.S. stop would likely be the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, where after a thorough medical screening he will likely be debriefed by intelligence officials. The released inmates include Mullah Mohammad Fazl, a former Taliban deputy defense minister. U.S. officials said that under a memorandum of understanding signed by Washington and Doha, the men will be subject to a year-long travel ban in Qatar. They declined to offer more details about any restrictions the men would face but expressed confidence that their release would not put Americans in harm’s way. “The United States has coordinated closely with Qatar to ensure that security measures are in place and the national security of the United States will not be compromised,” Hagel said in a statement from Singapore, where he was attending a security conference. “Sgt. Bergdahl’s return is a powerful reminder of the enduring, sacred commitment our nation makes to all those who serve in uniform.” Hagel informed members of Congress on Saturday about the prisoner swap deal. The administration is required by law to notify Congress about its intention to release Guantanamo detainees 30 days in advance. “Due to a near-term opportunity to save Sergeant Bergdahl’s life, we moved as quickly as possible,” a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to explain the timing of the congressional notification. “The administration determined that given these unique and exigent circumstances, such a transfer should go forward notwithstanding the notice requirement” in the law. The Obama administration began seriously exploring the possibility of negotiating Bergdahl’s release in late 2011, when secret talks between U.S. diplomats and members of the Taliban appeared to be gaining traction. The talks, part of a broader effort to explore a negotiated end of a conflict that had only become deadlier as the White House approved a surge of 30,000 troops in 2009, collapsed in March 2012 when the Taliban suspended them, arguing that the United States was not acting in good faith. Last summer, when the Taliban was allowed to open a political office in the Qatari capital, American officials grew hopeful that prisoner swap negotiations could resume. The effort foundered just hours after the office formally opened after the Afghan government protested that the Taliban had been given de-facto diplomatic status. Unexpectedly, representatives of the Taliban conveyed to U.S. officials last fall that they were once again amenable to discussing the release of Bergdahl, but set as a condition that they would only deal with Washington through intermediaries, American officials said. U.S. officials received a video of Bergdahl last fall after they had demanded proof that he remained alive. Unlike past videos of the captive, the one released last year was delivered privately, rather than through the Taliban’s media operatives. It showed the soldier looking “very gaunt, haggard,” a U.S. military official who has seen clips said. In a departure of its former negotiating stance, the administration sought to enhance the American offer of a prisoner exchange by proposing to release the five men simultaneously. Taliban representatives had objected to the previous proposed plan, under which the inmates would be turned over in stages in an effort to test whether the Taliban and the Qatari intermediaries could guarantee that the men would not return to militancy. A statement issued Saturday by the Taliban said the men would be residing with their families in Qatar, a tiny, wealthy Gulf emirate. U.S. officials said they had no indication that the Taliban was open to more substantive talks but expressed hope that the swap would build trust. “We continue to hope there will be a decision by the Taliban to move forward to initiate a political dialogue with the Afghan government, and it is our hope that the events leading to Sergeant Bergdahl’s return could potentially open the door for broader discussions with the Taliban by building confidence that the two sides can negotiate honestly with each other,” a senior administration official said. The Obama administration has sought to keep Bergdahl’s profile relatively low over the years, fearing that widespread publicity of his plight would boost his value in the eyes of the Taliban and strengthen the group’s negotiating hand. For a period, White House officials asked that several U.S. newspapers refrain from publishing his name in the context of peace talks. As his hopes dimmed, Bergdahl’s father sought to personally secure his son’s release by learning Pashto and attempting to contact the Taliban online. Bergdahl’s parents had traveled to Washington for a Memorial Day event and stayed in town for a few days to attend meetings with senior U.S. officials. They were in Washington when Obama called them Saturday morning to deliver the news, U.S. officials said. “We were so joyful and relieved when President Obama called us today to give us the news that Bowe is finally coming home!” Bergdahl’s parents said in a statement. “We cannot wait to wrap our arms around our only son. Today, we are ecstatic!” In Bergdahl’s home town of Hailey, Idaho, there was jubilation Saturday. Residents had been planning a June 28 concert to call attention to his plight. They were expecting up to 7,000 people to attend, and singer Carole King was going to perform for free. The concert will go on, said organizer Stefanie O’Neill, but it is now going to be “the biggest welcome-home party the country has ever seen.” Kim Harrison, who said she was listed as Bergdahl’s godmother in his military records, said, “I’m excited, I’m kind of numb, and I hope that they take it easy on him when he gets back.” She said she knows Bergdahl as the precocious teenager who took ballet with her daughter and came to spend hours at the Harrison house in Ketchum, Idaho, reading poetry and studying philosophy. She described Bergdahl as a sensitive young man who “questioned everything” and who went to Afghanistan because he wanted to help people. “Now the only thing I can think of worth talking about is protecting him from people criticizing him and trying to find a negative source of why he left in the first place,” she said. Karen DeYoung, traveling in Asia with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and Anne Gearan, Julie Tate and Stephanie McCrummen in Washington contributed to this report.","completion":"A US soldier named Bergdahl was held by the Taliban for five years.

Answer this question: What is Ischemia or infarction??","completion":"Ischemia and infarction are medical conditions related to the blood supply in the body. They are often discussed in the context of cardiovascular disease, but can affect various organs and tissues. Here is a detailed explanation of each term: Ischemia: Ischemia occurs when there is a reduced blood supply to a part of the body. Blood carries vital nutrients and oxygen that cells need to function. When blood flow is restricted or blocked for any reason, it can lead to inadequate oxygen and nutrient delivery, causing the cells in the affected area to become starved and dysfunctional. Some common causes of ischemia include: 1. Atherosclerosis: Fatty deposits called plaques narrow the arteries, reducing blood flow. 2. Blood clots: Clots can block blood vessels and hinder the blood flow. 3. Vasospasm: Constriction of blood vessels, which can lead to a temporary decrease in blood supply. 4. Compression of blood vessels: Injuries or tumors may compress blood vessels, restricting blood flow. Ischemia can affect various organs, including the heart (myocardial ischemia or angina), brain (cerebral ischemia or stroke), intestines (intestinal ischemia), and limbs (peripheral artery disease). Symptoms can vary depending on the affected organ, and the severity and duration of ischemia. Treatment usually involves restoring blood flow, adopting healthy lifestyle choices, and managing contributing risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Infarction: Infarction refers to the death of tissue resulting from prolonged ischemia. When blood supply to a tissue is insufficient for an extended period, the affected cells are unable to receive adequate oxygen and nutrients, eventually leading to cell death or necrosis. An infarct is the region of dead tissue caused by the ischemic event. The most common types of infarction include: 1. Myocardial infarction (heart attack): Infarction of heart muscle cells due to blocked coronary arteries. 2. Cerebral infarction (stroke): Infarction of brain cells, often caused by a blood clot or atherosclerosis in the cerebral arteries. 3. Renal infarction: Infarction of the kidney, which can result from a clot, atherosclerosis, or other causes of decreased blood flow to the kidney. 4. Pulmonary infarction: Infarction of the lung tissue, usually as a result of a blood clot blocking a pulmonary artery. Treatment for infarction depends on the location and severity of the tissue death. Immediate interventions to restore blood flow and prevent further damage are crucial. Specific treatments may include medications to dissolve clots, anticoagulants, pain relief, supplementary oxygen, surgery, or other specialized therapies. Like ischemia, it's essential to adopt lifestyle changes and address underlying risk factors to prevent infarctions from recurring."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Women, Race & Class Angela Y Davis PS7.99 Analysing the differences and similarities between the experiences of black and white women, Davis casts new light on the struggle for human rights. The Words to Say it (an autobiographical novel) Marie Cardinal translated by Pat Goodheart PS7.99 Marie Cardinal's groundbreaking book was the first and remains the complete book about the personal experience of psychoanalysis . It reveals her traumatic childhood and institutionalisation , followed by her escape to the cul-de-sac where her analyst lived. There, for many years, she made the journey towards recovery through Freudian psychoanalysis. A worldwide bestseller, translated into eighteen languages, it remains one of the most highly-praised books of our age. Jade Millie Murray PS4.99 Jade Wilson is smart, young, black and ambitious. And she's just been given the chance of a lifetime - a try-out for the Commonwealth Games swimming team. Jade lives with her mum, Jojo, a successful business woman. Jojo is overprotective of Jade, but she has her reasons. As a young model with a wonderful career ahead of her, she fell pregnant with Jade, and, much as she loves her daughter, she's determined not to let anything get in the way of Jade's success. So when Jade starts dating Dicey, there is hell to pay. Will Jade survive her Mum's constant nagging ? And what if she were to get pregnant - would she, could she, do the same as Jojo and give up her career? As things start hotting up with Dicey, Jade is faced with some very tough choices... . The book is very popular with people all over the world. Question: Which of the following can prove the book The Words to Say it is very successful ?

Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the site for which the responsible Trust warden has chosen to leave the patch of scorched earth rather than seeding it over?, what is it ?

Gage (1823-1860) was an American railroad construction foreman remembered for his improbable[B1]:19 survival of an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head, destroying much of his brain's left frontal lobe, and for that injury's reported effects on his personality and behavior over the remaining 12 years of his life--effects sufficiently profound (for a time at least) that friends saw him as \\"no longer Gage\\". [H]:14 Long known as the \\"American Crowbar Case\\"--once termed \\"the case which more than all others is calculated to excite our wonder, impair the value of prognosis, and even to subvert our physiological doctrines\\" --Phineas Gage influenced 19th-century discussion about the mind and brain, particularly debate on cerebral localization, [M]:ch7-9[B] and was perhaps the first case to suggest the brain's role in determining personality, and that damage to specific parts of the brain might induce specific personality changes. [M]:1,378[M2]:C :1347 :56 Context: Despite his own optimism, Gage's convalescence was long, difficult, and uneven. Though recognizing his mother and uncle (summoned from Lebanon, New Hampshire, 30 miles away)[H]:12[M]:30 on the morning after the accident, on the second day he \\"lost control of his mind, and became decidedly delirious\\". By the fourth day, he was again \\"rational ... knows his friends\\", and after a week's further improvement Harlow entertained, for the first time, the thought \\"that it was possible for Gage to recover ... This improvement, however, was of short duration.\\" Beginning 12 days after the accident,[M]:53 Gage was semi-comatose, \\"seldom speaking unless spoken to, and then answering only in monosyllables\\", and on the 13th day Harlow noted, \\"Failing strength ... coma deepened; the globe of the left eye became more protuberant, with [\\"fungus\\"--deteriorated, infected tissue][M]:61,283 pushing out rapidly from the internal canthus [as well as] from the wounded brain, and coming out at the top of the head.\\" By the 14th day, \\"The exhalations from the mouth and head [are] horribly fetid. Comatose, but will answer in monosyllables if aroused. Will not take nourishment unless strongly urged. The friends and attendants are in hourly expectancy of his death, and have his coffin and clothes in readiness.\\" Galvanized, Harlow \\"cut off the fungi which were sprouting out from the top of the brain and filling the opening, and made free application of caustic [i.e. crystalline silver nitrate][M]:54[H1]:392 to them. With a scalpel I laid open the [frontalis muscle, from the exit wound to the top of the nose][H1]:392 and immediately there were discharged eight ounces [250 ml] of ill-conditioned pus, with blood, and excessively fetid.\\" (\\"Gage was lucky to encounter Dr. Harlow when he did\\", wrote Barker. \\"Few doctors in 1848 would have had the experience with cerebral abscess with which Harlow left [Jefferson Medical College] and which probably saved Gage's life.\\" [B]:679-80 See SS Factors favoring Gage's survival, below.) On the 24th day, Gage \\"succeeded in raising himself up, and took one step to his chair\\". One month later, he was walking \\"up and down stairs, and about the house, into the piazza\\", and while Harlow was absent for a week Gage was \\"in the street every day except Sunday\\", his desire to return to his family in New Hampshire being \\"uncontrollable by his friends ... he went without an overcoat and with thin boots; got wet feet and a chill\\". He soon developed a fever, but by mid-November he was \\"feeling better in every respect ... walking about the house again\\". Harlow's prognosis at this point: Gage \\"appears to be in a way of recovering, if he can be controlled\\". Question: Did he fully recover?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Phineas Gage did not fully recover. Although he survived the accident and could walk and talk, his personality changed a lot because of the damage to his brain.

Review: An old vaudeville team of Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) were one of the best known but they broke up hating each other. Over 20 years later they agree to get together for a TV special...but find out they STILL hate each other. Willy's nephew/agent (Richard Benjamin) tries to get them to work together. A big hit in its day and it won George Burns an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I (somewhat) liked it. It was written by Neil Simon so its non-stop one-liners. Some of it was funny but making jokes of Willy and Al's senility was NOT. Also I never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way. Also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly. All that aside this was fun. Burns is just great tossing off one-liners with ease and even Matthau was good matching him. Their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie. Also Benjamin is very good as Willy's nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other. For me it's worth seeing for Burns alone. This jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had ANOTHER hit with \\"Oh God\\". So, this is good. Just good--not great. Matthau's character really makes this hard to love.

Dido's \\"Thank You\\" was released in 1998 as part of her debut album, \\"No Angel.\\" The song became a massive hit and received critical acclaim. Eminem's decision to sample the song was significant in several ways. Firstly, it demonstrated Eminem's ability to appreciate and incorporate various music styles into his work. While Eminem is primarily a hip-hop artist, Dido's music is more closely associated with pop and trip-hop genres. Her song's inclusion in \\"Stan\\" bridged the gap between these styles and expanded the appeal of the track to a wider audience. Secondly, the sampling of \\"Thank You\\" helped to anchor the narrative of \\"Stan\\" and provided an emotional backdrop to Eminem's verses. Dido's haunting vocals and the song's somber tone convey a sense of vulnerability, isolation, and longing, further highlighting the plight of Stan in Eminem's storytelling. Furthermore, Eminem's use of \\"Thank You\\" resulted in increased exposure for Dido and her music. The unlikely collaboration between the two artists led to a surge in Dido's popularity, and the success of \\"Stan\\" brought her work to the attention of a larger global audience. Dido and Eminem even performed \\"Stan\\" together at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. The duo's performance during the award show was widely discussed and analyzed, as the controversial nature of Eminem's lyrics had attracted criticism from several quarters. Nonetheless, the live rendition of \\"Stan\\" was generally well received and was later remembered as a defining moment in the careers of both artists. In conclusion, Eminem's single \\"Stan\\" sampled Dido's \\"Thank You,\\" and their collaboration serves as a notable example of cross-genre music-making. The use of \\"Thank You\\" in \\"Stan\\" not only enhanced the song's narrative and emotional depth, but it also helped propel Dido to international fame."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Collard greens. These were the foods Chris Ross grew up on in rural Kentucky. \\"One of the earliest food memories I have is my grandfather making hamburgers ... my grandmother frying potatoes,\\" he says. \\"Of course, in those days, everything was fried in lard.\\" Ross still enjoys those foods, despite having lost -- and kept off -- more than 100 pounds. He doesn't make substitutions or skip the bun. His weight loss secret isn't really a secret at all. He simply eats less. Ross, the executive chef at Bristol Catering in Louisville, Kentucky, started gaining weight after high school while working in restaurants, first as a waiter, then as a cook. At the time, he was studying law enforcement in college, but in between classes, he came home to watch the Food Network. \\"I just got consumed,\\" he says. He didn't really notice that he had gained 20 or 30 pounds over his freshman year. He ignored the signs when his clothes stopped fitting. Later, when an overweight friend at work mentioned their similarities, he was confused. \\"I never saw it,\\" Ross says. \\"It's a weird realization when you're gaining weight. You think, you're getting older. Maybe it's normal.\\" Then in late 2004, Ross stepped on a scale for the first time in years. The scale, which only went up to 300 pounds, refused to register his weight. That was bad. When he finally found another scale to tell him the truth, it was worse. The 6-foot-2-inch chef was 327 pounds. \\"To realize that you're not just obese, but morbidly obese, it was pretty tough on the mental psyche.\\" Ross started looking at his daily habits a little closer. He switched from regular Coke to Coke Zero and lost 10 pounds over a couple months. Then he picked up a book -- \\"French Women Don't Get Fat\\" by Mireille Guiliano -- that he saw Oprah Winfrey discussing on her show. As a chef, he'd always had a love for Paris. If anything could motivate him, this was it. The book talked about eating smaller portions, drinking water and walking everywhere. So Ross started doing the same. He tried to drink eight glasses of water every day, and he made an effort to walk for at least an hour before or after work. Take upwave's challenge: Drink more water! The book's tips helped him drop another 20 pounds. But it wasn't enough. After reading about a New Orleans chef who had lost weight, Ross decided to conduct an experiment.

Question: How long has it been since Jurassic Park was overrun by cloned dinosaurs? Title: The Lost World: Jurassic Park Movie plot: Four years after Jurassic Park was overrun by cloned dinosaurs on the Central American island of Isla Nublar, a young girl named Cathy Bowman wanders around on nearby Isla Sorna during a family vacation, and survives an attack by a swarm of Compsognathus. Her parents file a lawsuit against the genetics company InGen, now headed by John Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow, who plans to use Isla Sorna to relieve the company of financial losses. Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm meets Hammond at his mansion. Hammond explains that Isla Sorna, abandoned years earlier during a hurricane, is where InGen created their dinosaurs before moving them to Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar. Hammond hopes to stop InGen by sending a team to Isla Sorna to document the dinosaurs, to help rally public support against human interference on the island. After learning that his girlfriend, paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding, is part of the team and is already on the island, Ian agrees to go to Isla Sorna, but only to retrieve her. Ian meets his teammates, Eddie Carr, an equipment specialist and engineer, and Nick Van Owen, a video documentarian. After arriving on the island, they locate Sarah and discover that Ian's daughter, Kelly, had stowed away in a trailer being used as a mobile base. They then watch as an InGen team of mercenaries, hunters and paleontologists led by Ludlow arrive to capture several dinosaurs. Meanwhile, team leader Roland Tembo hopes to capture a male Tyrannosaurus by luring it to the cries of its injured infant. That night, Ian's team sneak into the InGen camp and learn the captured dinosaurs will be brought to a newly proposed theme park in San Diego. This prompts Nick and Sarah to free the caged dinosaurs, wreaking havoc upon the camp. Nick also frees the infant T. rex and takes it to the trailer to mend its broken leg. After securing Kelly with Eddie, Ian realizes the infant's parents are searching for it and rushes to the trailer. As soon as Ian arrives, the infant's parents emerge on both sides of the trailer.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve Pink Floyd? ? Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. He later told The Sunday Times: \\"Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him.\\" In 2013, Waters said he had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the...

Context: Detroit's protracted decline has resulted in severe urban decay and thousands of empty buildings around the city. Some parts of Detroit are so sparsely populated that the city has difficulty providing municipal services. The city has considered various solutions, such as demolishing abandoned homes and buildings; removing street lighting from large portions of the city; and encouraging the small population in certain areas to move to more populated locations. While some have estimated 20,000 stray dogs roam the city, studies have shown the true number to be around 1,000-3,000. Roughly half of the owners of Detroit's 305,000 properties failed to pay their 2011 tax bills, resulting in about 246 million in taxes and fees going uncollected, nearly half of which was due to Detroit; the rest of the money would have been earmarked for Wayne County, Detroit Public Schools, and the library system.

News article: Officers continue scouring patch of scrubland including concealed shaft, as others use micro-cameras to inspect drains Detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have opened manholes and begun searching drains in the Portuguese holiday resort where she went missing in 2007. A team of British and Portuguese police officers lifted off three manhole covers and used a micro-camera on a long stick to search the underground sewerage system in Praia da Luz on Thursday. The manholes are around s metres (20ft) from a grave-like hole discovered on Wednesday by officers using ground penetrating radar. Around two dozen journalists, holidaymakers and residents looked on as the work was carried out on a road that borders the six-hectare (15-acre) area of scrubland where the search began on Monday. Officers continued scouring the patch of overgrown land on Thursday, using two springer spaniels that helped in the search for the murdered Welsh schoolgirl April Jones. More details have emerged about two key search sites that have become the focus of the investigation over the past three days. Police search land and undergrowth in the Portuguese resort. Photograph: Virgilio Rodrigues/Barcroft Medi One of the sites is a concealed shaft in the ground discovered by detectives beneath a sheet of corrugated iron. Forensic officers wearing protective clothing and face masks examined the site for several hours on Wednesday, erecting a white tent to shield their work from the media. Portuguese newspapers reported on Thursday that this site was a disused storage box where children used to play. The shaft, measuring around 150cm x 90cm (5ft x 3ft), was covered by mounds of earth and a corrugated iron sheet, which is thought to have concealed the hole for years. Another key area of interest for detectives was the grave-like hole, where officers used ground-penetrating radar before erecting a white tent and carrying out digging work. Under the headline \\"False grave deceives geo-radar\\", the newspaper Correia da Manhã reported that a site \\"with characteristics similar to a grave\\" was discovered but officers later concluded that it was \\"not compatible with that of a body\\". Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, the Scotland Yard officer leading the operation, spent about an hour at this site with British officers and Faro's Polícia Judiciária director, Mota Carmo, on Wednesday. Redwood and his team of British investigators arrived at the search site at 9.30am on Thursday, declining to speak to journalists as his accreditation was checked by armed Portuguese police officers guarding the perimeter of the site. Scotland Yard has formally applied to extend the ground-level searches into next week. The operation was initially expected to end on Friday but progress has been slow in the meticulous search a short distance from where the then three-year-old girl was last seen. The work is being delayed by a need to clear the sites using strimmers and chainsaws. Madeleine's parents, Kate, 46, and Gerry, 45, are being kept informed of developments in the first ground-level search since those conducted immediately after their daughter's disappearance on a family holiday in May 2007. ||||| Madeleine McCann police focus search on patch of land Please turn on JavaScript.

Continue reading the main story Related Stories Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have focused their efforts on a patch of land on the third day of a fresh search in Praia da Luz. Officers also began using ground-penetrating radar equipment, which looks for signs of disturbed earth. Met Police said requests to search two other sites had been granted, and has also asked to extend the current search of scrubland by an extra seven days. Madeleine was three when she went missing in Portugal in 2007. British and Portuguese officers have continued a search of 15 acres of cordoned-off scrubland at the Algarve resort. All search efforts on Wednesday have now finished. The day's main search activity took place within two white tents which were erected on the scrubland, and forensic officers wearing blue overalls and face masks were seen walking in and out of them. The BBC understands that the tents were put up over a hole in the ground - possibly a disused well - and officers were seen filling buckets with earth, which were then placed into a wheelbarrow. No radar equipment was used near these tents. Earlier in the day, officers in Metropolitan Police uniforms were driven to a separate part of the cordoned-off area, where they were joined by Portuguese police and local forestry workers with strimmers. The radar equipment is used to search for signs of disturbed earth The two white tents were put up on the scrubland in Praia da Luz on Wednesday The tents are believed to have been set up over a hole in the ground and forensic officers have been at the scene A man in plain clothes wheeled the radar equipment onto a section of ground that had earlier been cleared. Officers from the Met and South Wales Police were also working with sniffer dogs and using spades to help sift through the undergrowth. They were being overseen by the Met's Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood, the senior officer investigating the case. At the scene Forensic officers have been seen filling buckets with earth By Lauren Turner The painstaking search of a site in the resort of Praia da Luz has been continuing, with a forensics officer joining the police team on Wednesday. Work seems to have been concentrated in one particular area, with police going back and forth to a section of land at the perimeter of the site. Two tents have been erected here - it is unclear if that is to prevent the media from seeing what is being done or to provide shade. While the police can't be seen from the beach, which is packed with holidaymakers enjoying the Algarve sun, everyone here seems all too aware of the investigation. Christina, a 35-year-old from Bournemouth on holiday with family and friends, said: \\"We walked down here last night and it was quite scary seeing so many police around. \\"The atmosphere here feels a bit flat because of what's happening. When you're on holiday you don't want to see police around but it's completely understandable.\\" Her friend Suzi, 34, said: \\"It's a bit of a shame because it's a lovely place and this does seem to have had an effect on the economy and on the people here. \\"But if that was your child, you would want everything possible to be done.\\" Several people the BBC spoke to had not known, before arriving at the resort, that it was the place where Madeleine McCann was last seen. Josie, 29, from Exeter, on holiday with her partner and one-year-old son, said: \\"It brings it home to you, being here - it makes it feel more real. \\"We didn't realise when we booked that this was the place. It wasn't until I saw my dad I knew because he told me. I don't know if we would have come here otherwise. \\"But police have to do what they have to do. We all want the best for the family.\\" Officers have encountered difficult terrain in the search area Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Portuguese police sources told the BBC the search might be extended if there was a significant find. Officers are believed to have been surprised by the difficulty of the terrain, while the police also need to consider the disruption to local residents. On Wednesday morning, the national Portuguese newspaper, Correio da Manha, reported that there would be a search of the sewage network around the Ocean Club, where the McCann family was staying when Madeleine disappeared. Officers were expected to use cameras linked to fibre-optic cables, the paper said. It also reported that the bones of cows and pigs had been unearthed by the search on Tuesday. A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said there would be no running commentary on the operation. Two sniffer dogs have been provided by South Wales Police for the search. The Met launched a fresh investigation into Madeleine's disappearance last July, codenamed Operation Grange. In March, they said they were seeking an intruder who sexually abused five girls in Portugal between 2004 and 2006. Detectives said the attacks had happened in holiday villas occupied by UK families in the Algarve.

Write a title for this article: GREEN BAY Wis.—It is 2015. The world has all the technology you could ever dream of. Human knowledge is growing faster than ever. And still, no one has any idea what a “catch” in the NFL is. On Sunday, a classic game at Lambeau Field unfolded as the Green Bay Packers beat the Dallas Cowboys 26-21 to reach the NFC Championship. The game had plenty of highlights—Aaron Rodgers hit Richard Rodgers for a 13-yard touchdown with 9:10 left, which turned out to be the decisive score—but when history remembers this game, it will be for the time America collectively watched an amazing football play and came away thinking: What the heck? The Cowboys faced a fourth-and-2 on the Packers’ 32 yard-line with 4:42 remaining in the fourth quarter—trailing by five points. Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo heaved up a bomb for star receiver Dez Bryant, who had favorable one-on-one coverage. Bryant jumped over the defensive back, Sam Shields, and “caught” the ball falling down to the ground at about the 1-yard line. The ball popped up out of Bryant’s hands when he hit the ground, but that was originally seen as an afterthought. Then something crazy happened: After the Packers challenged the play, referee Gene Steratore ruled the pass incomplete after viewing the replay. The call was correct—by NFL rule, it wasn’t a catch. Dean Blandino, the NFL’s vice president of officiating, said that because Bryant was going to the ground, he must hold onto the ball “throughout the entire process of contracting the ground. He didn’t so it is incomplete.” Sunday was the day that America learned what hard-core football fans already know: That the NFL has made understanding what is and is not a catch one of the most complicated endeavors in sports. The rules of a simple catch read like a rental car contract. There are officially too many rules in football. The NFL’s stance on the matter first became clear in 2010, when Detroit Lions receiver Calvin Johnson looked to have caught a crucial touchdown pass in a game against the Chicago Bears. But the ball hit the ground during the “process” and it was ruled incomplete. “Everyone knows the Calvin Johnson rule,” Aaron Rodgers said Sunday. “I remember watching that film [of Johnson] and saying ‘How the heck is that not a catch?’” Many Cowboys said after the defeat that the game wasn’t about the officials. They had their chances, even leading in the fourth quarter. “It looked to me that he had three feet down and what they describe to us all the time, is a move common to the game,” said Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett. “Dez reached out for the goal line like he’s done so many times, it’s a signature play for him. He maintained possession of it throughout in my opinion, but let me make it really clear: This game wasn’t about officiating.” Still, the NFL faces a bit of a crisis now. Yes, they love controversy, it gets eyeballs and Internet clicks. Everyone will be talking about this all week, then tune in to next week’s games. But that is part of the problem. For the second time in two weeks, everyone is talking about the officials. Last week in Dallas, a controversial pass interference call initially called against Dallas was canceled by the referees, helping the Cowboys beat the Lions. There are a few problems here. The first is that the catch rule is simply too complicated. If you were playing pickup football you would be laughed out of the backyard if you tried to pull this rule out. The second, most general problem, is the “All-Star Crew” rule, in which regular-season officiating crews are broken up for the playoffs, meaning many referees aren’t familiar with the ones they are paired with in the postseason. This leads to some wild outcomes—there were some questionable calls outside of the Bryant “catch.” For instance, in the first half, a reception by Cowboys tight end Jason Witten was spotted about 2 yards from where it should have been. The unfortunate part is that the “catch,” overshadows Rodgers’s performance—he looked unable to move in the first half due to a calf injury yet orchestrated a near-perfect second half to propel his team to victory. The Packers will face the Seattle Seahawks next week for a spot in the Super Bowl. Here’s the question the NFL’s referees must ask themselves: What will we be talking about after that one?

Just as the killer is about to find her, Erica is overcome with fear and shoots through the aisles and kills him. On another night, two street thugs harass and threaten passengers in a subway car. The passengers all leave at the next stop except Erica. When the thugs, amazed that she wasn't threatened enough to leave, take it as a challenge and threaten her with a knife, Erica shoots them both dead. Another night, she attempts to save a prostitute by threatening the brutal pimp with her pistol.

Write a title for this article: Forty-one convicts are still on the run after two prison breaks in the past week in the north-eastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco. On Wednesday night, 53 prisoners escaped from the Barreto Campelo penitentiary after explosives were used to blow a hole in an outer wall. The prison is located on the island of Itamaracá, around 50km north of the state capital, Recife. By Saturday afternoon, the authorities had succeeded in capturing 13 of the prisoners, when a group of 40 inmates broke out of the Frei Damião de Bozzano jail, part of the Curado prison complex in the western suburbs of Recife, using a similar method. Dramatic CCTV footage shows the men escaping following the explosion of a device planted outside the jail walls. Thirty-six of the inmates have now been captured. Two men were killed during the escape following a shootout with police, a third was hospitalised, and another remains on the run. Investigations are currently underway into how the prisoners managed to escape. Following the latest jail break, the public prosecutor of the state of Pernambuco, Marcellus Ugiette, called for the closure of the Curado complex, arguing that the incident shows the authorities had no control either inside or outside of its prison units. The governor of Pernambuco, Paulo Câmera, acknowledged that the complex had “failings” but said that the state has no money to pay for new prisons. “It’s necessary to keep the prison running and to guarantee the security of the people who live around it,” he said. Escape attempts are frequent in Pernambuco, which has most overcrowded prison system in Brazil. Facilities designed for 10,500 inmates hold around 32,000 people, according to a 2015 Human Rights Watch study. 59% of detainees are awaiting trial and are held with convicted prisoners, in violation of Brazilian law.","completion":"Explosive Prison Breaks Expose Overcrowding and Security Issues in Pernambuco, Brazil"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Una giornata particolare is a film which has made brilliant use of closed spaces.It is in these dull,empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and boisterous outbursts of Ettore Scola's two leading characters.Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives.It is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will take sides with characters close to them.All men would really feel sorry for Sophia Loren's character.All women would surely cry their hearts out at Marcello Mastroianni's existential plight.Disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues of this somber,poignant film.Most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities.Una giornata particolare cannot be termed as a pro gay film although it has been nicely depicted that a homosexual chap mixes well with women.This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has crafted a fairly good mix of fact and fiction.His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed destinies of ordinary Italian folks.A word about the courageous personnage played magnificently by great Marcello Mastroianni.He acts as a real man who does not beg for pity.He happily accepts his fate and readies himself to face the worst time of his short yet meaningful life.A true masterpiece of cinema !!!

The killer finds his first victim in a local prostitute who, after refusing advances from a cab driver, gets thrown out of the cab. A baglady watches from a distance as the killer plunges the knife into the hooker and drags her back into the water. The next morning, a tour boat on the canal collides with the body of the prostitute, who has been hung on one of the small bridges. As the tourists scream, the body drags on the top of the boat until an opening shows her bloodied body and face. Assigned to the case is detective Eric Visser, a hard-boiled detective who is raising his 13-year-old daughter Anneke after a split from his ex. He spends an hour in a bath, comes home late from work, and tends to drink now and again. Nevertheless, Eric is praised as one of the best detectives on the force. His partner, Vermeer, meets Eric at the site where the body was found with fellow cop Potter attempting to get through to the baglady, who tells Eric that it was a monster who killed the prostitute and that it came out of the water.

(1). negative; (2). positive;","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet can be interpreted as (1). negative. The author of the tweet is describing the heat in Savannah as \\"nearly oppressive\\" and mentions a heat index near 110. These expressions indicate that the temperature is uncomfortably high, making it more likely for the tweet to be conveying a negative sentiment. Although the tweet does not contain any overtly negative language, the adjectives and context used can be considered unfavorable. The phrase \\"nearly oppressive heat\\" conjures an image of an uncomfortable and stifling atmosphere, where day-to-day activities become difficult due to the extreme temperature. Additionally, a heat index of 110 suggests that the weather conditions are not only hot, but also humid, which can amplify feelings of discomfort and unease. Furthermore, the use of ellipses (\\"...\\") after stating the high heat index could imply a sense of frustration or exhaustion due to the hot weather, further reinforcing the negative sentiment. In general, people often associate extreme heat with a decrease in overall well-being, as it can lead to various heat-related health risks, such as dehydration, heatstroke, and heat exhaustion. While it is important to acknowledge there may be some subjectivity in sentiment analysis, and some individuals might perceive this tweet differently, the overall sentiment in the context of the given information leans closer to negative.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: One of the symptoms of a full bladder (and bowels) is lower abdominal pressure and tightness, which can feel uncomfortable or ticklish if touched, palpated or probed by a doctor during a medical exam. Having to go to the bathroom urgently can also make you very anxious or nervous, which can heighten ticklishness. Therefore, empty your bladder (and bowels) before heading to your scheduled medical exam. Avoiding caffeine, a diuretic that triggers frequent urination, for a few hours prior to the exam is also beneficial in this regard. Going to the bathroom prior to a gynecological exam is especially important because the bladder and urethra may be pressed upon directly. Being too cold causes shivering, which is your body's method of warming itself up. However, while you're chilly and shivering, your muscles are either contracting or at least under more tension, which can trigger ticklishness when touched, poked or prodded more easily. Thus, dress appropriately for your medical exam and plan for the office being a little too cool. If the office is exceptionally cool, ask the doctor or nurse if the temperature can be turned up for your exam. If you have to wear an examination gown or robe, ask the doctor what you can leave on to remain warm — such as your socks, underwear, undershirt, etc. While your doctor is palpating various parts of your body to figure out what's wrong with you, distract your brain a little by rubbing or lightly pinching another part of your body, such as your hand. Distracting your brain by giving it different sensations to process is an effective tool to help reduce pain, sensitivities and even ticklishness. While your brain is focused on processing the rubbing or pinching sensation that you're creating, it will have trouble registering the doctor's touch (palpation) as ticklish. Even just rubbing your fingers together might be helpful, or scratching the side of your leg. Apply enough pressure to your skin that it's not lightly ticklish, but not too much to cause pain.","completion":"When your bladder and bowels are full, your tummy feels tight and ticklish. This can make you feel nervous during a check-up with a doctor. To avoid this, go to the bathroom before your appointment and don't drink things like coffee that make you pee a lot. Also, being too cold can make you shiver and feel ticklish when the doctor touches you. So, wear warm clothes and ask if you can keep some on during the check-up. To feel less ticklish, try pinching or rubbing another part of your body while the doctor checks you. This can help your brain focus on something else and not feel so ticklish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I have a new situation: David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored. But I can use this background: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. What is an answer for this question: Would the reactants concentration increase or decrease in case A than in case B?","completion":"To answer the question, we need to examine how the concentration of reactants would change in Cases A and B by applying Le Châtelier's principle. Case A: In this case, the forward reaction is favored. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentration of products increases, and the concentration of reactants decreases. Case B: In this case, the reverse reaction is favored. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentration of products decreases, and the concentration of reactants increases. Now we can compare the reactants' concentration in case A and case B: In case A, the reactants' concentration decreased due to the forward reaction being favored. In case B, the reactants' concentration increased because the reverse reaction was favored.

We ordered the Tom Ka soup with tofu instead of chicken, and the Pad See-ew with soft tofu, and the veggie rolls (to go). The veggie rolls were tasty and larger than we're used to, which was a nice surprise. The Tom Ka soup was a little more sour than we're used to, but overall still tasty. However, it was almost 11 which we felt was about double what it should have cost. The Pad See-ew was the most disappointing part of the meal. The flavor was fine, nothing special but not bad. However, it was pretty dry and sticky, like you'd expect from a cheap college Thai take-out joint. Overall nothing really stood out. We had high hopes since the meals were on the pricey end for take-out, but we've had far better Thai for half the price. We'll keep looking for a better Thai place to become our local go-to! How would this review be described in terms of sentiment? Select from the following. * negative. * positive.","completion":"This review can be described as having a negative sentiment. While the reviewer mentioned some positive aspects such as the veggie rolls being larger than expected and the Tom Ka soup being tasty, their overall experience was disappointing especially due to the high prices and the unsatisfactory Pad See-ew. The mentioned disappointment, dryness, and sticky texture of the dish contribute to the negative sentiment. Additionally, the reviewer explicitly states that they will keep looking for a better Thai place, further emphasizing the negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Timon and Pumbaa watch the original film in a theater, Timon decides to fast-forward to his scenes. Pumbaa's protest over this eventually prompts Timon to share his backstory (going way back, to before the beginning of the first movie). Timon is a social outcast in his meerkat colony on the outskirts of the Pride Lands due to frequently messing things up by accident. Though he is unconditionally supported by his mother Ma, Timon dreams for more in life than his colony's bleak existence hiding from predators. One day, he is assigned as a sentry, but his daydreaming nearly leads to the near-death of his Uncle Max by hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. This becomes the last straw for the colony, prompting Timon to leave to find a better life. He meets Rafiki, who teaches him about \\"Hakuna Matata\\" and advises him to \\"look beyond what you see\\". Timon takes the advice literally and observes Pride Rock in the distance. Believing Pride Rock to be his paradise home, Timon ventures there and encounters Pumbaa on his way. The two quickly form a bond and Pumbaa accompanies Timon. The pair arrive at Pride Rock during the presentation of Simba to the Pride Lands' animals. As they make their way through the crowd of onlookers, Pumbaa explosively passes gas, causing nearby animals to faint but prompting animals further away to bow to Simba. Following this, Timon and Pumbaa make multiple attempts to set up homes throughout the Pride Lands, but wind up being forced away every time after witnessing several events from the original film, such as Simba singing \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\", Mufasa's fight with the Hyenas, and Scar's conspiring with the hyenas. Eventually, the pair are caught in the wildebeest stampede that killed Mufasa in the original film, and are thrown off a waterfall. Exhausted, Timon decides to give up, until Pumbaa discovers a luxurious green jungle. The pair finally settle there with the philosophy of \\"Hakuna Matata\\".

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming","completion":"To assess the sentiment of the movie review sentence, \\"like locusts in a horde, these things will keep coming,\\" let's break down the different aspects of the statement and analyze its intended meaning. The phrase \\"like locusts in a horde\\" is a simile comparing the subject (assumed to be an aspect or element of the movie) to locusts in a horde. Locusts are often viewed as harmful insects that swarm in large numbers, causing destruction to crops and other vegetation. When locusts gather in a horde, they can have a significantly negative environmental impact. The comparison emphasizes the overwhelming, unavoidable, and potentially destructive nature of the subject discussed in the review. The second half of the sentence, \\"these things will keep coming,\\" reinforces the idea that the subject of the review is recurrent and persistent. This implies that the reviewer perceives this aspect of the movie as repetitive or tedious. Taking into account the aforementioned analysis, the sentiment of the movie review sentence is primarily negative. By employing a simile using locusts, the reviewer conveys an unfavorable view of a particular element of the movie, emphasizing its overwhelming and destructive nature. Additionally, the indication that \\"these things will keep coming\\" implies dissatisfaction with the movie's repetitiveness, further supporting the negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This suggests that Prudie shares some level of agreement with the person's suspicion about the speech's authenticity. Step 2: Break down the hypothesis The hypothesis states that Prudie was \\"pretty sure\\" that the speech was inauthentic.

The female bees (worker bees and queens) are the only ones that can sting, and their stinger is a modified ovipositor. The queen bee has a barbed but smoother stinger and can, if need be, sting skin-bearing creatures multiple times, but the queen does not leave the hive under normal conditions. Her sting is not for defense of the hive; she only uses it for dispatching rival queens, ideally before they can emerge from their cells.

Go Vegan World said the advert did not state or imply that calves were separated from their mothers prior to the 12 to 24 hours recommended by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

Context: Coming off their home win over the Cowboys, the Giants flew to Lincoln Financial Field for a Week 10 NFC East duel with the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday Night Football. In the first quarter, New York trailed early as Eagles WR DeSean Jackson got a 9-yard TD run. The Giants responded with QB Eli Manning completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR Plaxico Burress, along with kicker John Carney getting a 27-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Giants increased their lead as Manning completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Kevin Boss. Philadelphia responded with QB Donovan McNabb completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Jason Avant. New York answered right back as Carney got a 26-yard field goal. The Eagles would close out the half as kicker David Akers got a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Philadelphia took the lead as McNabb completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR Hank Baskett. The Giants replied with RB Brandon Jacobs getting a 3-yard TD run. New York increased their lead as Carney nailed a 28-yard field goal, along with Jacobs getting another 3-yard TD run (with a failed 2-point conversion). The Eagles tried to come back as McNabb completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Curtis. Big Blue's defense managed to prevent any possible comeback, preserving the lead. Question: Which player caught a touchdown for the most yards in the first quarter? Answer:","completion":"The player who caught a touchdown for the most yards in the first quarter was Plaxico Burress. This came about through a 17-yard TD pass from QB Eli Manning. Even though the Eagles' WR DeSean Jackson also scored a touchdown in the first quarter, his was a 9-yard TD run, which is shorter compared to Burress's 17-yard catch. Consequently, among the players who scored touchdowns in the first quarter - DeSean Jackson for the Eagles and Plaxico Burress for the Giants - Burress had the most yards with his 17-yard touchdown. It's important to note that in football, yards are a critical measure of advancement and a higher number of yards typically indicates a more significant play. So, in this scenario, Burress's 17-yard TD catch stands as the longest touchdown in the first quarter of this Week 10 NFC East duel between the Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],j={key:0},q={key:1};function E(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",R,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
