Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information: - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Nuclear Assault is an American thrash metal band from New York City, formed after bassist Dan Lilker left Anthrax in 1984. After releasing five full-length albums and touring relentlessly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Nuclear Assault split up in 1995. They briefly reunited in 1997 and again in 2002, and are still active today. - Dimmu Borgir (or or ) is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1993. The name is derived from Dimmuborgir, a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means \\"dark cities\\" or \\"dark castles/fortresses\\" in Icelandic, Faroese and Old Norse. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; guitarist Silenoz and vocalist Shagrath are the only original members who still remain with guitarist Galder being a longstanding member. - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal. - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk. - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - Metal Blade Records is a heavy metal record label founded by Brian Slagel in 1982. The U.S. corporate office for Metal Blade is located in Agoura Hills, California. It also has offices in Germany, Japan, Canada, and the UK. The label is distributed in the U.S. by RED Distribution, and in Canada by Sony Music Entertainment. It was distributed by Warner Bros. Records in the United States from 1988 to 1993. - ( Pitch.Black.Effects ) is the fifth and final studio album by the extreme metal band Callenish Circle . - Callenish Circle was an extreme metal band from the Netherlands. They recorded three of their albums for Metal Blade Records, and broke up in February 2007. In the early 2000s things were going well for the band. In 2002 they toured with God Dethroned, played at the Dutch version of Ozzfest and the German Party San Open Air, and opened for Dimmu Borgir. Their fourth album was released by Metal Blade in 2003; to support it they played that year's Wacken Open Air and Summer Breeze festivals in Germany, and in October they were part of the Bonded By Metal Over Europe-tour, headlined by Exodus, Nuclear Assault, and Agent Steel. In 2006 they toured Mexico (cited by the band as the high point of their career), before they decided to break up in 2007. - Wacken Open Air (W:O:A) is a summer open-air heavy metal music festival. It takes place annually in the small village of Wacken in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany. With 80,000 festival visitors, and including personnel a total of roughly 86,000 attendees in 2011, it attracts various kinds of metal and hard rock music fans. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the Spanish-speaking artist whose record was the first to be certified gold in Brazil and Taiwan? Romance was released internationally on 19 November 1991, and sold over 400,000 copies in its first 10 days. In Mexico it was certified octuple platinum by the Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON) for shipping two million copies, the country's all-time third-bestselling album (only Juan Gabriel and José José has sold more copies with Recuerdos, Vol. II and 20 Triunfadoras respectively). In the United States, Romance debuted at number ten on the Billboard Latin Pop Albums chart for the week of 14 December 1991, and reached number one four weeks later. The record topped the chart for 32 consecutive weeks when it was displaced by Jon Secada's eponymous album on the week of 22 August 1992, ending 1992 and 1993 as the bestselling Latin pop album of the year in the country. It was the first record by a Spanish-speaking artist to be certified gold in Brazil and Taiwan, and the first gold certification by a non-crossover Latin artist in the United States (later certified platinum in the U.S. by the RIAA for shipments of one million copies). In South America, Romance was certified platinum in Colombia and Venezuela, gold in Paraguay and double platinum in Peru. In Argentina the album was certified 16× platinum for sales of over one million copies, the bestselling record by a non-Argentine artist. It received a diamond award from the Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers (CAPIF), and was certified quadruple platinum in Chile and double platinum in Spain. As of 2013, Romance had sold over seven million copies worldwide and is Miguel's bestselling record. Answer:","completion":"The name of the Spanish-speaking artist whose record was the first to be certified gold in Brazil and Taiwan is not directly mentioned in the paragraph. However, based on the description of the album Romance and its achievements, we can infer that the artist being referred to is Luis Miguel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was built to reinforce a weak point in the defences of the castle?, using the article: The current entrance in the north-east occupies the approximate location of the main gatehouse constructed by Gundulf and then rebuilt during 1249–1250. It was pulled down in the 1870s when the enclosure was converted into a municipal garden. An engraving from 1735 by the Buck brothers gives some indication of the gatehouse's form: the gate was an archway between two towers projecting from the curtain wall. It was reached by a stone causeway across a ditch, rather than a drawbridge. A tower containing a postern gate was located in the north-west corner of the enclosure, built at the close of the 14th century to guard the bridge over the Medway. The tower and postern no longer stands, but 19th-century antiquary and engineer G. T. Clark made some notes on the structure while it was still standing and commented that it had mechanisms to lift supplies for the castle from the river. The western part of the stone outer wall, a stretch facing the river, dates from when Gundulf built the first wall enclosing the castle. In the 19th century a revetment was added to strengthen the decaying wall. Like the keep, it was constructed using Kentish Ragstone. This part of Gundulf's wall was 4.5 feet (1.4 m) thick at the base, narrowing to 2 feet (0.61 m) at the top; it rose to a height of around 22 feet (6.7 m). Four embrasures were added to this part of the wall in the 13th century, although the builders imitated Norman design. At the northern end of the 12th-century stretch of western wall are the remains of a building, probably a hall, dating from the 13th century. Although no longer standing, it is known it had a vaulted undercroft.In the south Gundulf's wall survived into the modern period, although has now been dismantled. The current wall is a 19th-century replacement. At the eastern end of this wall, near the southern corner of the castle, is a two-storey rounded tower 30 feet (9.1 m) in diameter dating from the early 13th century. It was built to fill the breach in the curtain wall caused when John's army besieged..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"A two-storey rounded tower was built in the early 13th century to reinforce a weak point in the defences of the castle.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here are some concepts: cloud, sky, stalk What is a sentence about these concepts?","completion":"Certainly, here is a detailed response creating a scenario that involves the concepts of cloud, sky, and stalk in a sentence. The term 'cloud' generally refers to a visible mass of condensed water vapor floating in the atmosphere, typically high above the ground. It’s a large collection of very tiny droplets of water or ice crystals that form on dust particles. The droplets or particles are so small, in fact, that they can float in the air. All air contains water, but near the ground, it's usually in the form of an invisible gas called water vapor. However, as you move higher in the atmosphere, temperatures drop and the water vapor starts to condense around particles of dust, forming clouds. Sky is the region of the atmosphere and outer space seen from the earth. The sky appears to be blue because air molecules scatter sunlight in all directions and blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels in smaller, shorter waves. This particular property of the atmosphere effectively diffuses the sunlight and colors the sky in different shades during different times of the day. On the other hand, a stalk refers to the main stem of a plant, or the slender attachment of some other plant parts such as a leaf or fruit. In a broader context, stalks serve as conduits, supplying water, nutrients, and sugars between different parts of the plant. Linking these concepts together, here is a sentence that encapsulates all three: \\"Gazing up towards the azure sky speckled with fluffy clouds, the farmer noticed how the stalks of his tall corn plants seemed to yearn for the heavens, their leaves rustling gently with the kiss of the passing breeze, engaged in a perpetual dance driven by the elements that surround them.\\" In this sentence, the sky and the cloud bring in the atmospheric elements, perhaps hinting at a forecast, an impending change in weather, or just the appreciation of a beautiful day. The stalk gives us the earthy, grounded element, bringing us back down from our skyward gaze to appreciate the result of nature’s growth and the farmer's hard work, thus combining the agrarian and the meteorological in a poetic blend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Sesame Street presents Follow That Bird Movie plot: The members of the Feathered Friends' Board of Birds (consisting of the Madame Chairbird, a sparrow, a turkey, a puffin, a robin, and an owl) discuss their situation about Big Bird and hope that they can find a bird family to put him with. The group's social worker Miss Finch (performed by Cheryl Wagner and voiced by Sally Kellerman) is sent to Sesame Street to find Big Bird a worthy bird family and bring him to the selected family. After leaving Sesame Street, New York City, New York, Miss Finch brings Big Bird to the fictional town of Oceanview, Illinois to live with a family of dodos. The dodos all think very poorly of non birds, even saying he should have a bird as a best friend instead of Mr. Snuffleupagus (who is currently watching over Big Bird's nest). This causes him much distress. When Big Bird runs away from his new home and ends up on the news, Miss Finch tells Kermit the Frog that she will reclaim him. His friends back on Sesame Street also see the news and band together to find him before Miss Finch does. In a Volkswagen Beetle is the group of Gordon, Olivia, Linda, and Cookie Monster. Count von Count departs in his Countmobile. Ernie and Bert go out to search in an airplane. Grover flies as Super Grover (later falling into the Volkswagen). Maria, much to her dismay, has to ride with Oscar the Grouch, Telly Monster, and Homer Honker in Oscar's Sloppy Jalopy. They all head out across America in search for their beloved Big Bird. Oscar, however, decides to go his own route wanting to have some fun, which greatly annoys Maria and Telly. Big Bird has various adventures in his attempt to get home. First, he hitches a ride with a turkey truck driver (Waylon Jennings) who tells him not to give up trying to get to his goal. He then meets two kids named Ruthie and Floyd (Alyson Court and Benjamin Barrett) at a farm and stays with them for a while. He ends up having to leave because of Miss Finch's arrival.

Answer:","completion":"Big Bird's friends are sad for several reasons throughout the movie \\"Sesame Street presents Follow That Bird.\\" 1. Big Bird's Relocation: Initially, Big Bird's friends feel sad because they learn that he is being relocated to live with a bird family chosen by the Feathered Friends' Board of Birds and their social worker, Miss Finch. They are concerned about how this change will affect Big Bird, as he has to leave his home and friends on Sesame Street. 2. Adapting to a new family: Big Bird struggles to adapt to his new family, the Dodos, who think poorly of non-birds and even suggest that he should have a bird best friend instead of Mr. Snuffleupagus. This causes distress to Big Bird and his friends back on Sesame Street, who worry about his well-being and happiness in his new environment. 3. Big Bird goes missing: After running away from the Dodo family, Big Bird goes missing, and his disappearance is featured on the news. His friends from Sesame Street feel even sadder and more concerned for his safety. They fear that Miss Finch will reclaim him and take him away from Sesame Street again. 4. The search for Big Bird: Each of Big Bird's friends embarks on a journey to find him before Miss Finch does. While they are determined to bring him back, they are saddened by his absence and worry about potential dangers he may face during his adventures. 5. Big Bird's emotional struggle: Throughout the movie, Big Bird experiences various challenges and emotional turmoil, like feeling lonely without his friends from Sesame Street and having to face multiple obstacles in his attempt to return home. This creates a sense of sadness among his friends, as they empathize with his struggles. In summary, Big Bird's friends are sad due to his relocation, the challenges he experiences while adapting to his new family, his disappearance after running away, and the emotional struggles he undergoes during his journey back to Sesame Street. Their concern for his well-being and their desire to reunite with him magnify their feelings of sadness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

After NBC News suspended anchor Brian Williams for erroneously claiming that he was nearly shot down in a helicopter while covering the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly went on a tear. On his television show, the top-rated cable news anchor declared that the American press isn’t “half as responsible as the men who forged the nation.” He bemoaned the supposed culture of deception within the liberal media, and he proclaimed that the Williams controversy should prompt questioning of other “distortions” by left-leaning outlets. Yet for years, O’Reilly has recounted dramatic stories about his own war reporting that don’t withstand scrutiny—even claiming he acted heroically in a war zone that he apparently never set foot in. O’Reilly has repeatedly told his audience that he was a war correspondent during the Falklands war and that he experienced combat during that 1982 conflict between the United Kingdom* and Argentina. He has often invoked this experience to emphasize that he understands war as only someone who has witnessed it could. As he once put it, “I’ve been there. That’s really what separates me from most of these other bloviators. I bloviate, but I bloviate about stuff I’ve seen. They bloviate about stuff that they haven’t.” Fox News and O’Reilly did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Here are instances when O’Reilly touted his time as a war correspondent during the Falklands conflict: In his 2001 book, The No Spin Zone: Confrontations With the Powerful and Famous in America, O’Reilly stated, “You know that I am not easily shocked. I’ve reported on the ground in active war zones from El Salvador to the Falklands.” Conservative journalist Tucker Carlson, in a 2003 book, described how O’Reilly answered a question during a Washington panel discussion about media coverage of the Afghanistan war: “Rather than simply answer the question, O’Reilly began by trying to establish his own bona fides as a war correspondent. ‘I’ve covered wars, okay? I’ve been there. The Falklands, Northern Ireland, the Middle East. I’ve almost been killed three times, okay.'” In a 2004 column about US soldiers fighting in Iraq, O’Reilly noted, “Having survived a combat situation in Argentina during the Falklands war, I know that life-and-death decisions are made in a flash.” In 2008, he took a shot at journalist Bill Moyers, saying, “I missed Moyers in the war zones of [the] Falkland conflict in Argentina, the Middle East, and Northern Ireland. I looked for Bill, but I didn’t see him.” In April 2013, while discussing the Boston Marathon bombing, O’Reilly shared a heroic tale of his exploits in the Falklands war: I was in a situation one time, in a war zone in Argentina, in the Falklands, where my photographer got run down and then hit his head and was bleeding from the ear on the concrete. And the army was chasing us. I had to make a decision. And I dragged him off, you know, but at the same time, I’m looking around and trying to do my job, but I figure I had to get this guy out of there because that was more important. Yet his own account of his time in Argentina in his 2001 book, The No Spin Zone, contains no references to O’Reilly experiencing or covering any combat during the Falklands war. In the book, which in part chronicles his troubled stint as a CBS News reporter, O’Reilly reports that he arrived in Buenos Aires soon before the Argentine junta surrendered to the British, ending the 10-week war over control of two territories far off the coast of Argentina. There is nothing in this memoir indicating that O’Reilly witnessed the fighting between British and Argentine military forces—or that he got anywhere close to the Falkland Islands, which are 300 miles off Argentina’s shore and about 1,200 miles south of Buenos Aires. “Nobody from CBS got to the Falklands,” says Bob Schieffer. “For us, you were a thousand miles from where the fighting was. So we had some great meals.” Given the remote location of the war zone—which included the British territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, more than 1,400 miles offshore—few reporters were able to witness and report on the combat that claimed the lives of about 900 Argentine and British troops. The government in London only allowed about 30 British journalists to accompany its military forces. As Caroline Wyatt, the BBC’s defense correspondent, recently noted, “It was a war in which a small group of correspondents and crews sailing with the Royal Navy were almost entirely dependent upon the military—not only for access to the conflict, but also for the means of reporting it back to the UK.” And Robert Fox, one of the embedded British reporters, recalled, “We were, in all, a party of about 32-34 accredited journalists, photographers, television crew members. We were all white, male, and British. There was no embedded reporter from Europe, the Commonwealth or the US (though they tried hard enough), let alone from Latin America.” American reporters were not on the ground in this distant war zone. “Nobody got to the war zone during the Falklands war,” Susan Zirinsky, a longtime CBS News producer who helped manage the network’s coverage of the war from Buenos Aires, tells Mother Jones. She does not remember what O’Reilly did during his time in Argentina. But she notes that the military junta kept US reporters from reaching the islands: “You weren’t allowed on by the Argentinians. No CBS person got there.” That’s how Bob Schieffer, who was CBS News’ lead correspondent covering the Falklands war, recalls it: “Nobody from CBS got to the Falklands. I came close. We’d been trying to get somebody down there. It was impossible.” He notes that NBC News reporter Robin Lloyd was the only American network correspondent to reach the islands. “I remember because I got my butt scooped on that,” Schieffer says. “He got out there and we were all trying to get there.” (Lloyd tells Mother Jones that he managed to convince the Argentine military to let him visit Port Stanley, the capital of the Falkland Islands, but he spent only a day there—and this was weeks before the British forces arrived and the fighting began.) Schieffer adds, “For us, you were a thousand miles from where the fighting was. So we had some great meals.” O’Reilly did see some action in Argentina—just not war action. He writes in The No Spin Zone that shortly after he hit Buenos Aires—where CBS News had set up a large bureau in the Sheraton hotel—thousands of Argentines took to the streets, angry at the military junta for having yielded to the Brits. As he tells it in his book, O’Reilly, then 32 years old, raced to cover the event: “A major riot ensued and many were killed. I was right in the middle of it and nearly died of a heart attack when a soldier, standing about ten feet away, pointed his automatic weapon directly at my head.” A television cameraman was trampled, journalists were banged up, and O’Reilly and others were teargassed. “After a couple of hours of this pandemonium,” he recalls, “I managed to make it back to the Sheraton with the best news footage I have ever seen. This was major violence up close and personal, and it was an important international story.” The rest of the book’s section on this episode is a resentful recounting of how O’Reilly was “big-footed” when CBS used his best-ever footage in a news report that featured Schieffer, not him. “I got the hell out of Argentina fast, landed in Miami, and raised a major ruckus at the CBS offices there,” O’Reilly writes. Soon he “parted company” with CBS and took an anchor/reporter job in Boston. Schieffer notes that he and other CBS reporters also covered the protest, and that per common practice, all the footage gathered that day was pooled together for the report filed by the Buenos Aires bureau. The protest O’Reilly covered in Buenos Aires was not combat. It occurred more than a thousand miles from the war zone—after the fighting was over. O’Reilly’s account of the protest in Buenos Aires is at odds with news reports from the time—including the report from his own bureau. The CBS Evening News that night aired about a minute of video of the protest, apparently including some of the footage that O’Reilly and his camera team had obtained. It showed angry Argentines yelling and denouncing the junta that had lost the war. The only act of violence in the spot was a man throwing a punch against the car of a Canadian news crew. On the segment, Schieffer reported, “There were arrests throughout the day. The police threatened to use tear gas at one point. Several North American television crews were jostled…An ABC camera team’s car was stoned before the crew escaped.” The CBS report said nothing about people being killed. It does not match O’Reilly’s dramatic characterization of the event in his book; the video on the broadcast did not depict “major violence up close and personal.” Dispatches on the protest filed by reporters from the New York Times, the Miami Herald, and UPI note that thousands did take to the street, setting fires, breaking store windows, and that riot police did battle with protesters who threw rocks and sticks. They say tear gas was deployed; police clubbed people with nightsticks and fired rubber bullets; reporters were assaulted by demonstrators and by police; and a photojournalist was wounded in the legs by gunfire. But these media accounts did not report, as O’Reilly claims, that there were fatalities. The New York Times noted, “Several demonstrators were reported to have been injured, along with at least two reporters.” During a 2009 interview with a television station in the Hamptons, O’Reilly talked about reporting on the Buenos Aires protest, which he claimed other CBS journalists were too fearful to cover: “I was out there pretty much by myself because the other CBS news correspondents were hiding in the hotel.” (“We were all out with our camera crews that day to cover the protest,” Schieffer says. “I’d been out there with a crew too.”) O’Reilly noted that soldiers “were just gunning these people down, shooting them down in the streets” with “real bullets.” And he told of rescuing his South American cameraman, who had been trampled by the crowd: “The camera went flying. I saved the tape because it was unbelievable tape. But I dragged him off the street because he was bleeding from the ear and had hit his head on the concrete…The sound man is trying to save the camera…And then the army comes running down and the guy points the M-16. And I’m going, ‘Periodista, no dispare,’ which means, ‘Journalist, don’t shoot.’ And I said, ‘Por favor.’ Please don’t shoot…Then the guy lowered his gun and went away.” The protest in Buenos Aires was not combat. Nor was it part of the Falklands war. It happened more than a thousand miles from the war—after the fighting was over. Yet O’Reilly has referred to his work in Argentina—and his rescue of his cameraman—as occurring in a “war zone.” And he once told a viewer who caught his show in Argentina, “Tell everybody down there I covered the Falklands war. They’ll remember.” O’Reilly has frequently represented himself as a combat-hardened journalist—he has visited US troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and reported from those countries—and he has referred to his assignment in Argentina to bolster this impression. On his television show in 1999, O’Reilly responded to a letter from a retired Air Force colonel, who said he had flown 123 missions over Vietnam and who criticized O’Reilly for supporting military action in Kosovo, by citing his Falklands war days: “Hey, Colonel, did you ever have a hostile point an M-16 at your head from 10 yards away? That happened to me while I was covering the Falklands war.” In his 2013 book Keep It Pithy, he writes, “I’ve seen soldiers gun down unarmed civilians in Latin America.” During his radio show on January 13, 2005, he declared, “I’ve been in combat. I’ve seen it. I’ve been close to it.” When a caller questioned him about this, O’Reilly shot back: “I was in the middle of a couple of firefights in South and Central America.” O’Reilly did not specify where these firefights occurred—in The No Spin Zone, the only South America assignment he writes about is his trip to Argentina—and then he hung up on the caller. In The No Spin Zone, O’Reilly does write vividly about an assignment that took him to El Salvador during the country’s civil war shortly after CBS News hired him as a correspondent in 1981. As O’Reilly recalls in the book, he and his crew drove for a full day to reach Morazán province, “a dangerous place,” and headed to a small village called Meanguera, where, a Salvadoran captain claimed, guerrillas had wiped out the town. “Nobody in his right mind would go into the guerilla-controlled area,” O’Reilly writes. But he did, and he notes he found a horrific scene: “The place was leveled to the ground and fires were still smoldering. But even though the carnage was obviously recent, we saw no one live or dead. There was absolutely nobody around who could tell us what happened. I quickly did a stand-up amid the rubble and we got the hell out of there.” He does not mention being in any firefight. O’Reilly’s account of his El Salvador mission is inconsistent with the report he filed for CBS News, which aired on May 20, 1982—shortly before he was dispatched to Buenos Aires. “These days Salvadoran soldiers appear to be doing more singing than fighting,” O’Reilly said in the opening narration, pointing out that not much combat was under way in the country at that time. O’Reilly noted that the defense ministry claimed it had succeeded in “scattering the rebel forces, leaving government troops in control of most of the country.” He reported that a military helicopter had taken him and his crew on a tour of areas formerly held by the rebels. (This fact was not included in the account in The No Spin Zone.) From the air, O’Reilly and his team saw houses destroyed and dead animals “but no signs of insurgent forces.” As part of the same 90-second story, O’Reilly reported from Meanguera, saying rebels had been driven out of the hamlet by the Salvadoran military after intense fighting. But this was not a wiped-out village of the dead. His own footage, which was recently posted by The Nation, showed residents walking about and only one or two burned-down structures. O’Reilly’s CBS report gave no indication that he had experienced any combat on this assignment in El Salvador. When O’Reilly was excoriating Brian Williams last week for telling a war-related whopper, he said of his Fox television show, “We’ve made some mistakes in the past but very few…We take great pains to present you with information that can be verified.” And he asserted, “Reporting comes with a big responsibility, the Founding Fathers made that point very clearly. They said to us, ‘We’ll give you freedom. We’ll protect you from government intrusion. But, in return, you, the press, must be honest.'” Research assistance: Sam Brodey ||||| Looking for news you can trust? Subscribe to our free newsletters. On Thursday, Mother Jones published an article by Daniel Schulman and me documenting how Fox News host Bill O’Reilly has mischaracterized his wartime reporting experience. It noted that he has repeatedly stated that during his short stint as a CBS correspondent in the 1980s, he was in the “war zone” during the Falklands war between the United Kingdom and Argentina in 1982. He once claimed he had heroically rescued his cameraman in “a war zone in Argentina, in the Falklands,” while being chased by army soldiers. Yet no American journalist reached the war zone in the Falkland Islands during this conflict. O’Reilly and his colleagues covered the war from Buenos Aires, which was 1,200 miles from the fighting. O’Reilly responded to the story by launching a slew of personal invective. He did not respond to the details of the story. Instead, he called me a “liar,” a “left-wing assassin,” and a “despicable guttersnipe.” He said that I deserve “to be in the kill zone.” (You can read one of my responses here.) And in his show-opening “Talking Points memo” monologue on Friday evening, he continued the name-calling. In a way, it’s impossible to win a debate with O’Reilly because he is not bound by reality. In response to the article, he told Fox News’ media reporter, Howard Kurtz, “Nobody was on the Falklands and I never said I was on the island, ever.” Yet our article included video of O’Reilly saying in 2013, “I was in a situation one time, in a war zone in Argentina, in the Falklands, where my photographer got run down and then hit his head and was bleeding from the ear on the concrete. And the army was chasing us.” Note the words “war zone” and “in the Falklands.” Part of our article examined his depiction of a protest in Buenos Aires after the Argentine junta surrendered to the British. O’Reilly covered that event, and in a 2001 book, he wrote, “A major riot ensued and many were killed.” He has called it a “combat situation.” In a 2009 interview, he recalled how soldiers “were just gunning these people down, shooting them down in the streets” with “real bullets.” Yet no media reports of the event that we found referred to such dramatic violence or any fatalities. Not even the CBS News report on the protest that O’Reilly contributed to mentioned soldiers shooting and killing civilians. Erik Wemple, a media critic at the Washington Post, has examined this part of our article in detail. He, too, found that there were no news reports matching O’Reilly’s description—and that this was not “combat.” He concluded that this “appears to be a a Brian Williams-level embellishment.” (Wemple is married to a Mother Jones reporter. You can watch this Washington Post video and decide if his assessment is fair.) Another part of the story concerned O’Reilly’s portrayal of a reporting assignment he had in El Salvador in 1982. In a book, he described a harrowing trip to a village that “was leveled to the ground and fires were still smoldering. But even though the carnage was obviously recent, we saw no one live or dead. There was absolutely nobody around who could tell us what happened. I quickly did a stand-up amid the rubble and we got the hell out of there.” Yet the 1982 news broadcast he filed and that aired on the CBS Evening News showed residents walking about this hamlet and only one or two burned-down structures. But now O’Reilly continues to insist that he has not embellished or mischaracterized anything—and that he is the victim of a smear campaign. So let’s turn to his “Talking Points memo” monologue, as published on the Fox News site, with my responses in italics. ||||| Fox News personality Bill O’Reilly used his talk show on Friday to address a controversy over his war reporting record, calling a Mother Jones article on the subject a “political hit job.” The article by David Corn and Daniel Schulman is headlined “Bill O’Reilly Has His Own Brian Williams Problem,” and accuses the Fox News television host of greatly inflating his experiences covering the Falklands War in 1982 as well as reporting on... ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Fox News host Bill O'Reilly has been accused of greatly inflating his experiences, including his time as a war correspondent, in much the same way as disgraced anchor Brian Williams.

Red fishery and Brown fishery were both fishing for Patagonian toothfish. Red fishery was fishing illegally, while Brown fishery was regulated and lawful. Hint: Increased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish.

The use of \\"his or her\\" indicates that the gender of the rider is unknown, but that information is not necessary to determine the location of the bike ride. 3. \\"Next to an outdoor fountain\\": This portion of the statement describes the location of the rider and his or her bike. Specifically, they are positioned near an outdoor fountain. Now, let's examine the statement we wish to conclude, \\"The rider in the red shirt is riding his bike outdoors.\\" The main factors to consider in supporting this conclusion are the subject (the rider in the red shirt) and the location (outdoors). Both statements refer to the same subject: the rider in a red shirt who is riding a bike. Additionally, the location provided in the original statement is outdoors (next to an outdoor fountain). Fountains are typically located in public spaces like parks, courtyards, or plazas, which are open-air environments.

This means that lower quality images that look good as a part of a webpage will look grainy when they are scaled up to fit the screen. If you leave a fair amount of white space around your objects, Prezi will be able to easily focus on them when the camera zooms in. This will help make the text or image stand out to the audience. If you want to surprise the audience with a fact or image, make it very small. This will make it illegible until the object is in focus. If the text is small enough, the audience won’t even see it coming. Frames come in two forms in Prezi: visible and invisible. Visible frames highlight the object on the screen, and include a circle, brackets, and a filled oblong shape. Invisible frames allow you to define objects and sets of objects as the focus. Both types of frames will let you control how much zoom and object receives. Invisible frames also allow you to create clickable sections of your presentation that can link to other parts of the Prezi or to the web. This is perfect for interactive presentations. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Use-Prezi-Step-15Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Prezi-Step-15Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/0/0d/Use-Prezi-Step-15Bullet1.jpg/aid637612-v4-728px-Use-Prezi-Step-15Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} If you have a paragraph of text in one frame, and want to highlight a key segment of it, create a frame around the text that you want to highlight. Create a path to it, and the camera will zoom in on just the framed text. This is useful for noting key figures or powerful phrases in a block of text. Prezi doesn’t use font sizes, which can make it difficult to get headings and paragraphs to feel uniform. In order to match size, select the text that you need to resize. As you move the mouse to change the size of the text, look at the text that you are trying to match it to. Once the two are the same, the text that you haven't selected will become darker, signifying that the two are the same size. You can use this same procedure for matching the size of pictures and other objects. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6b/Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/6/6b/Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet1.jpg/aid637612-v4-728px-Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} You can see when sections are aligned when a dotted blue line appears between the two. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e1/Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet2.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet2.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/e/e1/Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet2.jpg/aid637612-v4-728px-Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet2.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} A good Prezi will be able to be understood when the presentation is zoomed all the way out. This means that your key points should be large enough to be read when the camera is pulled back. They should also be aligned in a way that makes logical sense. You can return to the overview by creating an invisible frame around the entire project. Link to this frame when you want to pull back and show the whole project. This is especially useful when transitioning between major points. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9a/Use-Prezi-Step-18Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Prezi-Step-18Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/9/9a/Use-Prezi-Step-18Bullet1.jpg/aid637612-v4-728px-Use-Prezi-Step-18Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} If you are using specific styles of frames to highlight your important ideas, stick to using those throughout your entire presentation. The same goes for colored text and other stylistic objects. A sense of design unity throughout the presentation will leave a stronger lasting impression and convey information more clearly.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Venus Context: The plot concerns Maurice Russell, an elderly actor who finds himself increasingly attracted to his friend Ian's grand-niece Jessie while simultaneously finding himself in deteriorating health due to prostate cancer. Maurice's friend describes the grand-niece as a trouble maker and a nuisance, but Maurice discovers that Jessie warms up to him when he starts interacting with her. He takes her to the National Gallery in London to view his favourite painting, the Rokeby Venus, by the Spanish artist Diego VelÃ¡zquez. Jessie had expressed interest in modelling (Maurice initially mis-hears this as \\"yodelling\\") and Maurice arranges for Jessie to model nude for an art class. As a result of Jessie posing for the art class, and inspired by his favourite painting, Maurice decides to give Jessie the nickname \\"Venus\\". Maurice and Jessie develop a passive/aggressive relationship over the course of the film. Maurice is forward in terms of his attraction towards Jessie while Jessie occasionally indulges his whims to a limited extent, such as touching her hand and smelling her neck, but also retracts the indulgences when she feels that he has gone too far. The plot of the film revolves around the evolving friendship or relationship between the two characters. For Maurice, this appears to be the last attempt at something approaching a love life, as his prostate operation has left him impotent. For Jessie, it is less clear what she sees in Maurice. During the course of the film we see her do everything from exploiting him (trying to get him to buy her presents, trying to use his flat to have sex with a boy), taking care of him, flirting with him, and rejecting him sexually to engaging with him as a friend. During the course of the film we learn that she has been rejected by her mother and great-uncle for her promiscuous life style; it is implied that she is drawn to Maurice because he does not judge her as harshly as her family members have. The plot comes to a head when Jessie becomes involved with a boy. The two young lovers...

Usage: The given title \\"I have not been to a deli in Boston since 1980\\" and the sentences \\"The clientele was heavily Jewish\\" and \\"I was disappointed\\" show that the story is about a disappointing experience at a deli in Boston. In this instance, the theme focuses on the narrator's memory of an unpleasant experience at a deli. Part #2: Eliminate options that don't fit the story's theme. Usage: From the provided choices (a, b, and c), choice \\"a. She said yes and went with George to his Prom\\" does not fit the theme. This is because the choice is focused on a prom and not related to the story's theme of a deli experience. Thus, this option can be discarded. Part #3: Review remaining options and assess their suitability in the story. Usage: The remaining choices \\"b. The food was good, but skimpy\\" and \\"c. For my birthday we went to Reuben's Deli in Brookline\\" both fit the theme of the story, as they address different aspects of a deli experience. Part #4: Determine the most plausible combination of remaining options. Usage: While both \\"b\\" and \\"c\\" options fit the story's theme, the order \\"bc\\" works best. \\"c. For my birthday we went to Reuben's Deli in Brookline\\" provides context to the deli visit, and \\"b. The food was good, but skimpy\\" explains the disappointment mentioned in the initial sentence.

Along the way, he attempts to rescue Milady de Winter (Margot Grahame) from highwaymen, but it turns out she came to meet their leader, the Count de Rochefort (Ian Keith). When Rochefort insults D'Artagnan, the latter insists on a duel. Instead, Rochefort has his men knock D'Artagnan out, while he blackmails Lady de Winter into helping him in his plot to seize power. Upon reaching Paris, D'Artagnan is dismayed to learn from de Treville that he must serve two years as a cadet or perform \\"extraordinary deeds of valor\\" before he can become a Musketeer.

Background: Mulvaney was born in Alexandria, Virginia, to Michael \\"Mike\\" and Kathleen \\"Kathy\\" Mulvaney, a teacher, and grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father became a prominent homebuilder, before moving to Indian Land, South Carolina. His grandparents were originally from County Mayo, Ireland. He attended Charlotte Catholic High School and then Georgetown University, where he majored in international economics, commerce and finance. At Georgetown, he was an Honors Scholar, the highest level of academic achievement awarded to members of the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, and ultimately graduated with honors in 1989. Context: While promoting the Trump administration's budget proposal in March 2017, Mulvaney stated that, as to taxpayers, the government was \\"not gonna ask you for your hard-earned money, anymore... unless we can guarantee to you that that money is actually being used in a proper function.\\" For instance, Mulvaney justified cuts to block grants that go towards spending on Meals on Wheels because it was \\"just not showing any results.\\" Others disagreed with Mulvaney's statement, citing research that has \\"found home-delivered meal programs to significantly improve diet quality, increase nutrient intakes, and reduce food insecurity and nutritional risk among participants. Other beneficial outcomes include increased socialization opportunities, improvement in dietary adherence, and higher quality of life.\\" On May 22, 2017, Mulvaney presented President Trump's 4.1 trillion 2018 United States federal budget. The budget included cuts to the United States Department of State, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the social safety net and increases in funding for defense spending and paid family leave. The \\"America First\\" budget included a 10.6% decrease in domestic program spending and a 10% increase in military spending, in addition to 1.6 billion for a border wall. The budget would remove 272 billion from welfare programs, including 272 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. The budget would also remove 800 billion from Medicaid, and 72 billion from Social Security disability benefits, while removing nothing from Social Security retirement or Medicare benefits. Mulvaney projected the budget will not add to the federal deficit because future tax cuts will lead to 3% GDP growth. He described the budget as \\"the first time in a long time that an administration has written a budget through the eyes of the people who are actually paying the taxes.\\" In December 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation forecasted that with dynamic scoring the 1.5 trillion reduction in revenues will increase the federal deficit by 1 trillion. Regulatory implementation of the tax cuts have been delayed by a dispute between Mulvaney and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin regarding the involvement of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. In February 2018, Mulvaney released the President's 4.4 trillion 2019 United States federal budget, which would add 984 billion to the federal deficit that year, and 7 trillion over the next 10 years. Later that month, the President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which allowed yearly federal deficits to reach 1 trillion. In March 2018, Congress ultimately passed the 1.3 trillion Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, which funded the government's operations until the end of the fiscal year in September.

Difficulty in using the product: The reviewer mentions that the product was \\"impossible to use,\\" indicating that they faced significant challenges when trying to use it. This statement conveys frustration and disappointment. 2. Mismatch between the product and the reviewer's needs: The statement \\"and not what I needed\\" highlights that the product did not meet the expectations or requirements of the reviewer, adding to their negative experience. 3. Financial dissatisfaction: The mention of a \\"20% restocking fee\\" suggests that the reviewer was unhappy about the additional cost incurred when returning the product. Moreover, the phrase \\"talk about salt in the wound\\" emphasizes the feeling of insult or injury they experienced from this fee. 4. Negative feelings towards the company: The statement \\"I will never use this company ever again\\" demonstrates the reviewer's intention to discontinue using the company's services in response to their negative experience. 5. Delay in receiving the refund: The reviewer notes that they have not yet received the amount charged back to their credit card, further contributing to their dissatisfaction. This point adds to the overall negative tone of the review. 6. Concluding thoughts: Ending the review with \\"very bad experience\\" firmly establishes the reviewer's negative impression of both the product and the company.

Rose was born April 14, 1941, in Cincinnati, Ohio, one of four children born to Harry Francis \\"Pete\\" and LaVerne Rose. He was a member of the Order of DeMolay as a young boy and was encouraged by his parents to participate in sports. He played baseball and football at Western Hills High School. Although Rose was small for his age, he earned the starting running back position on his freshman football team. On April 23, 1964, Rose reached first base on an error in the top of the ninth inning of a scoreless game in Colt Stadium and scored on another error. The Colt .45s lost the game in the bottom of the ninth inning and Ken Johnson became the first pitcher to lose a complete game no-hitter. Rose slumped late in the season and was benched; he finished with a .269 average. In order to improve his batting, Rose played in the Venezuelan Winter League with Leones del Caracas team during 1964-1965 season. Rose came back in 1965, leading the league in hits (209) and at-bats (670), and finishing sixth in NL MVP balloting. It was the first of his ten seasons with 200-plus hits, and his .312 batting average was the first of nine consecutive .300 seasons. He hit a career-high 16 home runs in 1966, then switched positions from second base to right field the following year. In 1968, Rose started the season with a 22-game hitting streak, missed three weeks (including the All-Star Game) with a broken thumb, then had a 19-game hit streak late in the season. He had to finish the season 6-for-9 to beat out Matty Alou and win the first of two close NL batting-title races with a .335 average. He finished second to St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Bob Gibson for the NL MVP award, earning six first place votes. Rose had his best offensive season in 1969 (the year of the Miracle Mets), when he set a career-high in batting (.348) and tied his career-best 16 homers. As the Reds' leadoff man, he was the team's catalyst, rapping 218 hits, walking 88 times and pacing the league in runs with 120. He hit 33 doubles and 11 triples, drove in 82 runs, slugged .512 (by far the highest mark of his long career), and had a .432 OBP (also a career best). Rose and Roberto Clemente were tied for the batting title going into the final game; Rose bunted for a base hit in his last at-bat of the season to beat out Clemente (.345).

Supergrass were an English rock band, formed in 1993 in Oxford. The band consisted of brothers Gaz (guitar and lead vocals) and Rob Coombes (keyboards and backing vocals), Mick Quinn (bass and backing vocals) and Danny Goffey (drums and backing vocals). Originally a 3-piece, Gaz's brother Rob Coombes officially joined the band in 2002. The band signed to Parlophone records in 1994 and produced I Should Coco (1995), the biggest selling debut album for the label since the Beatles' Please In mid-1994, Supergrass issued their debut single \\"Caught by the Fuzz\\" on the small independent local label Backbeat Records. The song recounts lead singer and guitarist Gaz Coombes's experience of being arrested by the police for possession of cannabis. The limited release of vinyl copies sold out quickly, thanks in part to support from John Peel on his Radio One show. The Parlophone label signed the band and re-released the single in the autumn of the same year. It achieved the rare feat of both NME and Melody Maker \\"Single Of The Week\\" status in the same week. \\"Mansize Rooster\\", released in February 1995, peaked at number 20 in the UK Singles Chart and \\"Lenny\\" was the band's first top 10 single. \\"Lenny\\" was followed soon afterwards by the band's debut album, I Should Coco (May 1995), which entered the UK Albums Chart at number one. It achieved half a million sales in the UK and over a million worldwide. NME reviewer Steve Sutherland gave the album a nine out of ten rating, writing, \\"These freaks shall inherit the earth.\\" The album's fourth single, the double A-side release \\"Alright\\"/\\"Time\\", stayed in the UK Top Three for a month, peaking at number two. Supergrass followed I Should Coco with 18 months of heavy touring, appearing at festivals such as Scotland's T In The Park and the Glastonbury Festival. After Performing at Rio's Hollywood Rock Festival in April 1996, Supergrass met the train robber Ronnie Biggs, and apparently said to him, \\"I was frightened for my life when I heard there was a supergrass in the area.\\" A photograph of Ronnie Biggs and Gaz together was subsequently included in the music video for their 1996 single \\"Going Out\\". Recorded at Great Linford Manor the single peaked at number five in the UK charts, but was the last song produced by Sam Williams. Supergrass returned to Sawmills Studio to co-produce follow up album, In It For The Money (released April 1997), with John Cornfield. The album was a huge success and went platinum in the UK, but confused some fans expecting something similar to I Should Coco. The single, \\"Richard III\\", reached number two. Subsequent releases, \\"Sun Hits the Sky\\" and \\"Late In The Day\\", reached numbers 10 and 18 respectively. Around this time Supergrass also appeared on the front cover of The Big Issue, interviewed for the magazine at Heathrow Airport by ex-drug smuggler Howard Marks.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Following the termination of their contract with RCA, the Kinks signed with Arista Records in 1976. With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an arena rock band. John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \\"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single \\"Father Christmas\\" has remained a popular track. Driven by session drummer Henry Spinetti's drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song \\"Father Christmas\\" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford joined the band before the recording of Low Budget, on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections. Keyboardist Ian Gibbons was recruited for the subsequent tour, and became a permanent member of the group. Despite the personnel changes, the popularity of the band's records and live shows continued to grow. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands such as the Jam (\\"David Watts\\"), the Pretenders (\\"Stop Your Sobbing\\", \\"I Go to Sleep\\") and the Knack (\\"The Hard Way\\") recorded covers of Kinks songs, which helped bring attention to the group's new releases.

Summarize: If you're grappling with change of (or to find) faith in something, or seeking to name and use a faith that you feel, but have trouble voicing -- it can be stimulating and uplifting to join a group or congregation in that arena. Acknowledging a higher power in an organized setting offers many people satisfaction, relief and strength. If you think you might be one of them, but weren't raised in a religious kind of faith, spending some time exploring different denominations and faiths, learning about their belief-systems and finding what speaks to you the most exercises your power of choice. If you were raised in a church, but are feeling dissatisfied, you might be in a crisis of faith. Do you use the doubt or question you're experiencing to reforge (with sparks flying) your beliefs? Or to find faith elsewhere? Each person will need to answer this question for oneself, but exploring other options is always a smart way to go about answering it. If you're unsatisfied in one congregation, try another. If your religion is giving you more questions and conceptual irritants than answers, start reading up on your or another way of believing. Have faith that you'll find (receive) the right answer. Buddhists have faith in the Noble Eightfold Path, which is a method of living in moderation as a way of ending human suffering by eliminating clinging desires. Faith in Buddhism derives from the pali word saddhā, which often refers to a sense of conviction.

Chapter 27 is a 2007 biographical drama film depicting the murder of John Lennon by Mark David Chapman. It was written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book Let Me Take You Down by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche. Its title is a reference to J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and suggests a continuation of the book. The real Mark David Chapman is currently incarcerated at Wende Correctional Facility, on a guilty plea. Aside from two interviews with Larry King and Barbara Walters, both in 1992, he has not spoken with the media. However, Chapman did reveal the mechanics of his unraveling during those three days in New York City to journalist Jack Jones. The interviews were published in 1992 as Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, a book of Chapman's recollections of his act of violence. Chapter 27 is based on this text. The title \\"Chapter 27\\" suggests a continuation of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon. Chapman was obsessed with the book, to the point of attempting to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield. According to the British music magazine Mojo, the title was also inspired by Chapter 27 of Robert Rosen's book Nowhere Man: The Final Days of John Lennon (2000). Rosen's book explores the numerological meaning of the number 27, \\"the triple 9\\", a number of profound importance to John Lennon. Lennon was deeply interested in numerology, particularly Cheiro's Book of Numbers, along with nine and all its multiples. It was Chapman's goal, according to Rosen, to write Chapter 27 \\"in Lennon's blood\\". Like Chapman, Schaefer is a fan of both The Beatles and J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, and said he began the script to try to understand \\"how someone could be inspired to kill anyone as a result of being exposed to this kind of beautiful art. It really bothered me, because Lennon and Salinger have always made me feel so much better, and so much less alone.\\"Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"One interesting aspect from the article is the motivation behind the film's writer and director, Jarrett Schaefer: \\"Like Chapman, Schaefer is a fan of both The Beatles and J.D.

Input: Robert Stack never really got over losing a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Kyle in \\"Written on the Wind\\" to Anthony Quinn's 12-minute performance in \\"Lust for Life.\\" Stack plays the deeply disturbed, alcoholic son of an oil tycoon. He has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. They both love the same woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken slut who's in love with Mitch. Their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of Douglas Sirk, who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films, including \\"Imitation of Life,\\" \\"All that Heaven Allows,\\" \\"Magnificent Obsession,\\" and many others.Make no mistake - this is a potboiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone make the most of their roles, Malone winning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. There's one amazing scene, mentioned in other comments, where she wildly dances to loud music as her father collapses and dies on the staircase. We're led to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy that pumps the gas, because she's in love with Mitch. Mitch wants nothing to do with her. He's so in love with Lucy that, out of loyalty to Kyle, he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation. I doubt he'd be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was.Hudson and Bacall have the less exciting roles here - Hudson's Mitch is the good guy who's been cleaning up Kyle's messes for his entire life, and Bacall is Mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety. Sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players.In Sirk's hands, \\"Written on the Wind\\" is an effective film, and the big scene toward the end in the mansion is particularly exciting. The director had a gift for this type of movie, and though he had many imitators, he never had an equal.

Defense attorneys suggested that investigators guided alleged victims on what to say so their stories would be consistent. Article:","completion":"Title: A Day in Court: Jerry Sandusky's Defense Team Fights Back It was a whirlwind day in court for Jerry Sandusky and his defense team. The former Penn State football coach, who has been charged with multiple counts of child sexual abuse, faced a variety of competing testimonies. Perhaps the most significant was from his wife, Dottie Sandusky, who vehemently denied the allegations against her husband. In addition, a psychologist provided a diagnosis that could potentially explain some of the more bizarre aspects of this already complex case. Lastly, the defense attorneys cast doubt on the validity of the accusers' testimonies. To begin with, Dottie Sandusky took the stand to defend her husband. According to the Associated Press, she refuted claims that her husband had ever engaged in inappropriate contact with young boys who had spent the night at their house. Contrary to some reports, she also asserted that there was no soundproof room in their basement where nefarious activities could take place. Her testimony contradicted one specific accuser's account of an incident where Jerry Sandusky allegedly tried to molest him in a hotel hallway; confronted by Dottie, the accuser claimed that her timely arrival interrupted the abuse. However, Mrs. Sandusky insisted that she saw no such altercation, stating, \\"They were just standing … in a hallway kind of thing … they had their clothes on; they were fully clothed.\\" In another turn of events, a psychologist told the court that he had diagnosed Sandusky with \\"a histrionic personality disorder,\\" as reported by Reuters. Sufferers of this disorder tend to crave attention and behave inappropriately. According to the psychologist, this diagnosis might serve as an explanation for the \\"creepy\\" letters one accuser received from Sandusky. Furthermore, the psychologist stated that Sandusky's memoir, Touched: The Jerry Sandusky Story, \\"absolutely confirmed my diagnosis.\\" While it remains to be seen how much weight the court will place on this diagnosis, it is interesting to consider how it might affect the perception of Sandusky's actions. Lastly, Sandusky's defense attorneys posed a provocative question: were investigators coaching alleged victims on what to say, thereby ensuring that their narratives remained consistent? This accusation, if substantiated, could threaten the credibility of the claims made by those accusing Sandusky of child sexual abuse. It is entirely possible that some inconsistencies were smoothed over to strengthen the case against the former coach. In a trial as tumultuous and emotionally charged as this one, it is crucial to keep a watchful eye on the truth. In conclusion, it was a busy day for Jerry Sandusky's defense team, with the key testimonies of his wife and a psychologist and the suggestion of witness coaching complicating the trial. As the court attempts to make sense of these conflicting accounts and wrestles with the implications of the histrionic personality disorder diagnosis, it becomes clear that the truth in this case might be more complex than initially believed. In a trial where lives hang in the balance, due process and a commitment to uncovering the truth are more important than ever."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

BUSTED New York City police have decided that a couple arrested for possession of weapons and explosives don’t appear to be terrorists, just privileged kids with drug habits. By Michael Daly and Lizzie Crocker The very pregnant rich kid and her Harvard-educated boyfriend arrested on December 29 in New York’s Greenwich Village for possession of explosives and weapons do not appear to be terrorists after all, police say. facebook Morgan Gliedman Investigators say they believe 27-year-old Morgan Gliedman and 31-year-old Aaron Greene are just two more products of privilege squandering their advantages on drugs. “It looks like they’re junkies,” a high-level police source says. “Well-to-do junkies, not terrorists.” Indeed, in the first days of the investigation police reached the tentative conclusion that the explosives and weapons were just part of a drug-fueled, twisted sense of what constitutes cool. Cops discovered the weapons cache when they executed a search warrant at the couple’s W. 9th Street apartment at 6 a.m. Saturday, acting on a credit-card fraud charge against Gliedman. What they found initially suggested that Gliedman and Greene might be throwbacks to the rich-kid Weatherman radicals who had blown themselves up just two blocks uptown back in 1970. The added twist was Gliedman’s pregnancy. Not even the most radical radicals of yore had resided amidst explosives while in the ninth month. Gliedman’s arrest date apparently coincided with her due date and she was taken to a hospital on Saturday while her prospective baby daddy was arraigned on explosives and weapons charges. He entered a not guilty plea and was remanded without bail. Officials declined to name the hospital where Gliedman had been taken, or to confirm or deny a report that she had given birth. She appears to have no prior arrest record and no previous troubles with the law, beyond the credit-card charge that led to her arrest. She grew up on Manhattan’s Upper East Side and attended Dalton Academy, a prestigious private school. Her parents, prominent oncologist Dr. Paul Gliedman and realtor Susyn Schops Gliedman, could not be reached for comment. A check of her Facebook friends showed a who’s who of the sons and daughters of some of New York’s richest and most notable families. According to a neighbor who asked not to be named, a very different Gliedman moved into the apartment seven years ago, when she was an undergraduate at NYU. “She was seemingly a happy-go-lucky girl,” the neighbor told The Daily Beast. After graduating from NYU, Gliedman earned a master's degree in creative writing at the Art Institute of Chicago, according to her Facebook page. She returned to her apartment two years ago, no longer manifestly happy and not looking so lucky. “A very changed person,” the neighbor says. Greene moved in around the same time, according to her neighbor, who describes both Greene and this very different Gliedman as “very unsociable people.” \\"They were very insular and seemed kind of in their own world,\\" the neighbor says. The neighbor remembers that Gliedman often had friends to the apartment during her NYU days. That changed when Greene took up residence. Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason “They kept the apartment filthy and they had vermin problems,” the neighbor says. The neighbor lends credence to the police view when he adds, “There was always a heavy cloud of smoke emanating from the place, and one got the sense that they were both heavily into drugs.” Green’s personal hygiene, cops say, is what might have been expected of a junkie. \\"To be honest, you could smell him before you saw him,\\" the neighbor says. The neighbor said that he could not help but be concerned on seeing that Gliedman was pregnant. He reports that Gliedman’s mother had visited often in recent days, as might be expected with the baby’s imminent arrival. The other visitors were the police. The criminal complaint filed against Greene and Gliedman says that the cops discovered a plastic container in the living room holding seven grams of a white power that was identified as Hexamethylene Triperoxide Diamine, or HMTD, an easy-to-make explosive and a favorite of actual terrorists. The complaint says that police also found the makings for more of the stuff, as well as a sawed-off 12-gauge Mossberg 500 shotgun, a Ruger 12-gauge shotgun, a dozen 12-gauge shotgun shells, 9 high-capacity rifle magazines, and 60 5.56-caliber tracer rounds. There was also a 37mm flare launcher, a replica of a M203 grenade launcher. The complaint also lists a number of books and manuals said to be found in the apartment: - The Terrorist’s Encyclopedia V. 1.02 - FM 5-25 Explosives and Demolitions - FM 5-31 Booby Traps - Improvised and Modified Firearms: Deadly Homemade Weapons - A Do-It-Yourself Submachine Gun - Street Sweeper: A Home Workshop Shotgun - Building the M11/9: A Guide to Construction and Coercion - FM 5-25 Explosives and Demolitions - FM 5-31 Booby Traps These were seized, along with what police describe as various handwritten notebooks containing formulas. But further investigation produced no indication that this was a case of Gossip Girl gone terrorist. “So far, no plot,” the senior police official said. The official did not offer an explanation as to why the couple had allegedly amassed all the requirements of a terror cell but apparently not the intent. The absence of drugs in the apartment has apparently not dissuaded them from taking the view that the two are junkies with advantages. Police report that Greene has been arrested three times on weapons charges, in 2005, 2006, and most recently in February, when he was also charged with drug possession. He had one prior arrest for drugs in 2004, an assault charge along with the weapons collar in 2005. He was also busted for evading the subway fare in his home precinct in 2011—a grown man with two Harvard degrees and a Dalton girlfriend charged with hopping a subway turnstile like a like schoolkid. The disposition of the various cases was not immediately clear, though police records for the 2006 weapons arrest notes a “prior felony conviction.” People with extensive knowledge of the Occupy Wall Street movement were saying that they had never heard of Greene. They discounted a news report that he was an OWS activist. By midday Sunday, police had reached the tentative conclusion that the explosives and weapons were part of some drug-fueled fantasy life. To cops, Greene appears to be living proof that going to Harvard does not necessarily make you any less a knucklehead. ||||| Doctor's daughter who had baby in custody after she was arrested for keeping explosives in apartment 'robbed a man after meeting at a bar in February' Morgan Gliedman, 27, allegedly stole a laptop, cellphone, wallet and credit cards from a man she met in a Manhattan bar in February 2012 Just days later, she and Harvard-educated boyfriend Aaron Greene, 31, were caught taking heroin and in possession of a gun in a Washington Heights drug bust On Saturday, the well-to-do junkies were charged with keeping high-powered explosives in their apartment, where police also found a stash of weapons and terrorism how-to guides Gliedman went into labor while she was being handcuffed By Michael Zennie and Helen Pow | A Park Avenue-raised heroin addict who was last week charged with keeping high-powered explosives in her Greenwich Village apartment was already a suspect in a robbery.

The building had to be evacuated while the bomb squad removed the highly-unstable explosive. Police also found a sawed-off Mossberg 500, a 1,000 Ruger over-under hunting shotgun, several high-capacity magazines, 60 shotgun shells, and a replica of an M203 grenade launcher. Several disturbing items were seized, including: 'The Terrorist’s Encyclopedia V. 1.02,' 'Improvised and Modified Firearms: Deadly Homemade Weapons,' 'A Do-It-Yourself Submachine Gun,' and U.S. Army manuals for creating and planting booby traps and explosives. The New York Post reported that Greene was a member of Occupy Wall Street, though an NYPD spokesman told MailOnline that his connection to the group was still being investigated. Evacuation: All of the residents of the couple's building had to be removed from the area before a police bomb disposal unit could clear out the explosive Two spokesmen for the Occupy movement said they had never heard of Greene. Officers were tipped off about the explosives by someone who met Gliedman and Greene in Washington Square Park. The couple invited the informant to their apartment to take a shower, which is when he spotted the weapons, The Post reported. The apartment on Manhattan's West Ninth Street, is near the apartment where two rich young men accidentally blew themselves up while making a bomb for the extremist group the Weather Underground in 1970. Greene and Gliedman had no such plans, police sources are saying. They are just wealthy drug addicts with a twisted idea of what's 'cool,' according to the Daily Beast.

Allow the eggs to sit in the hot water for 15 minutes.\\" Article:","completion":"The Mastery of Perfectly Boiling Eggs: An Essential Skill in Culinary Endeavours Boiling an egg, as simple as it may sound, can be a cynosure of challenges. It can confuse even an accomplished home cook or a rookie just starting out in the kitchen. The temperamental nature of eggs, their delicateness, and the continuum between a soft and hard boil can be tricky terrain to navigate for many. To demystify this common culinary task, we will dive deep into a failproof method to achieve perfect boiled eggs every time. To begin with, you would need six to eight eggs, a medium saucepan, water, distilled white vinegar, and of course, a stove. The number of eggs you choose to boil purely depends upon your requirement. The key here is not to overcrowd the saucepan. Neglecting this may lead to uneven cooking or potential breakages due to lack of space. Ensuring that the eggs you are using are fresh will guarantee the best results. Place the eggs gently into a medium saucepan, a tool found in almost every kitchen, carefully ensuring that the potential for cracking is reduced. The next step involves covering the eggs with water. The water acts as the medium for heat transfer and facilitates the cooking process. The eggs should be entirely submerged, with about 1-2 inches of water above the top-most egg. This is crucial for even heat distribution and uniform cooking. Pouring a splash of distilled white vinegar into the water is one of the secret, yet straightforward tricks that result in flawlessly boiled eggs. Vinegar yields two main benefits in this process. First, it helps to solidify the egg white faster if the shell cracks during cooking. Secondly, it makes peeling the boiled eggs easier as the vinegar permeates the shell slightly, which helps in detaching it from the egg white during peeling. Setting the stove's heat to medium-high, place the saucepan on it and start heating. The aim here is to bring the water to a low boil. A raging boil may make your eggs dance and tap against each other, leading to unwanted cracks. But a low, gentle boil ensures that the egg cooks thoroughly without the hustle and bustle that might damage it. Once you've reached that ideal slow boil, it's time for a bit of patience. Allow the eggs to sit in this hot water for about fifteen minutes. Time management is quintessential here. Boiling time decides whether your egg lands up being a gooey mess or a rock-hard disappointment. Fifteen minutes is the sweet spot for a delightfully creamy yet firm yolk, perfect for a multitude of culinary applications, from making egg salad to garnishing a bowl of ramen. For cooking enthusiasts, understanding the perfect technique for boiling eggs opens up a world of culinary opportunities. Follow these steps carefully, and you're sure to crack the code to the perfectly boiled egg each time. In summary, boiling an egg is not just about immersing it in water and heating it but about managing elements such as the egg's freshness, water quantity, vinegar volume, heat level, and perhaps most importantly, timing.

Article: The works of Shakespeare and Wordsworth are boosters to the brain and better therapy than some guide books, researchers say this week. Scientists, psychologists and English academics at Liverpool University have found that reading the works of the Bard and other classical writers has a beneficial effect on the mind, catches the reader's attention and triggers moments of self-reflection. Using scanners , they monitored the brain activity of volunteers as they read works by William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, T.S Eliot and others. They then \\"translated\\" the original texts into more \\"straightforward\\", modern language and again monitored the readers' brains as they read the words. Scans showed that the more \\"challenging\\" essays and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the much plainer versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it was \\"activated\\" as the readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or difficult sentence structure. This \\"activation\\" of the mind lasts longer, shifting the brain to a higher speed, encouraging further reading. The research also found that reading poetry, in particular, increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, helping the reader to reflect on their own experiences, which they compare with what they have read. This, according to the researchers, meant that the classic works were more useful than guide books. Philip Davis, an English professor believes \\"The research shows the power of literature to shift thinking patterns, to create new thoughts, shapes and connections in the young and adults alike.\\" Question: What might be the author's attitude towards reading classics as therapy?

Glue all your pieces together. Finished. Try out some patterns and projects. Article:","completion":"Title: Fun and Easy Paper Quilling Activity for Kids Hey little friends! Have you ever heard of paper quilling? It's a super fun and creative way to make beautiful art with just a few simple materials. In this article, we're going to show you how to do it step by step. Are you ready? Let's start! First, let's talk about what you need for this activity. You'll need: 1. Colorful paper strips (you can use construction paper or any other kind of paper you like) 2. Glue (a glue stick or liquid glue will both work great) 3. A tool to roll the paper (you can use a toothpick, a stick, or even your fingers!) Now that we've got everything, let's begin! Step 1: Make a coil To start, take one of your colorful paper strips and gently wrap it around your rolling tool (toothpick, stick, or fingers). Keep wrapping the paper until you've reached the end of the strip. You should have a nice, tight coil when you're done. Step 2: Gently pull the coil off Now that you have your coil, it's important to take it off the rolling tool very gently. You don't want to squish your beautiful creation! Gently slide your coil off the rolling tool and put it on the table. Step 3: Glue your paper together To make sure your coil stays together, you need to add a little bit of glue. Take your glue and spread a small amount on the end of the paper strip that's sticking out. Press the glued end onto the rest of the coil and hold it for a few seconds to make sure it sticks. Good job! Step 4: Pinch the coil into a shape (if desired) This step is optional, but it can be a lot of fun! If you want to make a shape out of your coil, like a heart or a flower, simply pinch the edges of the coil gently with your fingers. You can create all kinds of different shapes! Step 5: Glue all your pieces together Once you have all your coils and shapes ready, it's time to glue them together to create a beautiful picture. Use your glue to stick your coils and shapes onto a piece of paper. You can arrange them however you like – it's your art! Step 6: Finished That's it! You've made your very own paper quilling masterpiece. Now it's time to show it off to your family and friends. They'll be amazed by your creativity! Step 7: Try out some patterns and projects Now that you know how to do paper quilling, you can try out different patterns and projects. Look for books, websites, or videos that show different ideas and get inspired to create even more beautiful art! Remember, practice makes perfect. The more you do paper quilling, the better you'll get at it. Have fun, and happy quilling!"},{"prompt":"Q: Title: This deserves a million stars!

And now, if you want, your Facebook friends will always know where you are, too. Facebook is introducing a mobile feature called Nearby Friends that taps into that steady stream of location information so friends can track each other in real time. The idea is to make it easy for people to meet up in real life, so they can have conversations in person instead of comment threads, temporarily replacing Likes and LOLs with eye contact and actual laughter. A live meet-up is also an excellent opportunity to grab a selfie with your pal and upload it to the Facebook owned Instagram. In a refreshing change, the new Nearby Friends feature is not turned on by default. Friends will not be able to see where you are unless you decide live-tracking is something you want in your life and visit Facebook's settings to turn it on. Making a potentially invasive new feature opt-in suggests Facebook has perhaps learned from some of its past mistakes and privacy problems. You can choose to share your general location with all your Facebook friends, close friends or a customized list of people you feel most comfortable with. Further minimizing the potential stalking factor, your location is only shared with other people who are also using the feature and who have chosen to share their location with you. When turned on, Nearby Friends shows a list of approved Facebook friends who also use the feature and shows their approximate location. A push notification can tell you how many of your friends are nearby. Open the app to see a list of pals, the neighborhood or city where they are, how many miles away that is from your current location, and a time stamp of when they where there. There is an option to share your exact location with specific friends, which can be handy for coordinating large groups at concerts or finding someone in a crowded area. Your friends will see a little image of your face on a map for a set period of time. Nearby Friends will be available on Facebook's iOS and Android apps, but will only work for select locations at first. Facebook, Instagram and many other apps already include features that let people \\"check-in\\" to locations, but those location features are different because you decide if and when to share each specific location. You might check into a Starbucks downtown, but never into your home or other spot you'd rather keep private. Nearby Friends is continuously gathering details about where you are in the background instead of waiting for a manual check-in. This is not the first time an app has used location information to physically connect friends. Similar apps such as Highlight, which got a flurry of attention in 2012, mapped out the locations of nearby strangers. Facebook also purchased a startup in 2012 called Glancee that also connected strangers. That technology evolved into this new, more private feature. If you turn on the Nearby Friends feature, Facebook starts collecting data on your exact location and keeps details on where you've been in the past, not just places where you've used its app to check in. It also collects location information even when the Facebook app is closed. But you can turn off this location history in the Facebook app's settings. It's possible to delete individual locations from a history, or clear the whole thing and start from scratch. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Facebook has a feature called Nearby Friends for your phone. It lets your friends know where you are if you want them to.

A:","completion":"The last step of the process for a red giant star involves the formation of a white dwarf and the possible creation of a planetary nebula. As the outer layers of the red giant break away, the core continues to contract and heat up. This hot, compact core, composed primarily of carbon and oxygen, stabilizes as a white dwarf. A white dwarf is the final stage for a low- to intermediate-mass star like the red giant. It is an incredibly dense stellar remnant that has exhausted its nuclear fuel but remains intensely hot. Over time, the white dwarf will cool down gradually, eventually becoming a black dwarf. However, this process takes an extraordinarily long time, much longer than the current age of the universe, so no black dwarfs are believed to exist yet. As the white dwarf forms, the ejected outer layers of the red giant gradually expand outward from the core, creating a nebula of gas and dust. This nebula is illuminated by the intense light emitted by the hot white dwarf, forming a celestial spectacle known as a planetary nebula. The term \\"planetary nebula\\" is a misnomer, as the phenomenon is not directly related to planets. It is so named because early astronomers, when looking through their telescopes, saw a circular structure similar to planetary disks. It is important to note that the fate of a star is largely determined by its mass. Stars with a greater mass than the red giants will follow a different path, either exploding in a supernova and becoming a neutron star or collapsing to form a black hole. However, for red giants like the one described in the question, the transformation into a white dwarf followed by the formation of a planetary nebula is the last stage of its evolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea.

New innovations and curiosity helped spread interest in windmills and wind power.Middle Eastern citizens used them for food production by the 11th century.Merchants along trade routes returned to Europe and shared the idea.Windmills caught on,especially in Holland,and the Dutch improved their use.Here,windmills drained lakes and other bodies of water.In France,the windmill pumped irrigation water.Elsewhere in Europe,windmills were used to grind grain. By the 19th century,settlers in the United States realized the importance of the simple windmill.Pioneers pumped water for livestock and farming.As estimated six million windmills dotted America's landscape by the end of the 1880s.Charles Brush,the US inventor,invented a windmill capable of producing electricity in 1888.And now the machines are called wind turbines.As late as the 1920s,Americans used small windmills to provide electricity in rural areas without electric service.When power lines began to transport electricity to rural areas in the 1930s,local windmills were used less and less,though they can still be seen on some Western farms. In the 1970s,oil shortages pushed the development of alternative energy sources,paving the way for the re-entry of the windmill to produce electricity.In the early 1980s,wind energy really took off in California,partly because of State policies that encouraged renewable energy sources.In the 1990s,the push came from a renewed concern for the environment in response to scientific studies indicating potential changes to the global climate if the use of...

Nearly 800 detainees have passed through the centre since it was set up under the Bush administration in 2002 to hold \\"enemy combatants\\" from the war in Afghanistan - and 166 are still being held there. More than half of these inmates - 89 men - come from Yemen. They were largely picked up around in Afghanistan or border areas 11 years ago on suspicion of involvement with al-Qaeda. But of the 86 men in Guantanamo who have been cleared for transfer or release, 56 are Yemeni. They are no longer considered enemy combatants or a threat to US security. Many of other nationalities - including Europeans, Saudi Arabians and Afghans - have been moved on due to agreements with their home countries. But the Yemenis have been going nowhere. \\"The Europeans went home first, as did others whose home countries did quite a bit of advocacy on their behalf,\\" said Martha Rayner, Clinical Associate Professor of Law at Fordham University in New York, who has represented some of Guantanamo's Yemeni inmates. \\"The Yemenis had the misfortune of coming from a country that had had a dictator for many years - Ali Abdullah Saleh - and that didn't do enough to advocate for its nationals. \\"So the Yemenis languished, even though many were approved for release by the Bush administration.\\" In January 2009, President Obama ordered the closure of Guantanamo within a year. But on Christmas Day of that year, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab - a Nigerian trained in Yemen - attempted to set off a bomb hidden in his underwear on a Detroit-bound jet. And the following January, President Obama issued a moratorium against the release of any Yemeni detainees. Combined with restrictions imposed by Congress, it brought releases and transfers to a virtual halt. \\"I think it was a practical response,\\" said Ms Rayner. \\"It was a year since Obama had come into power and his critics were already galvanising themselves to challenge him on the issue of Guantanamo and connecting it to national security.\\" Matthew Waxman, professor at Columbia Law School and former Department of Defense adviser on detention issues, sees it as a more international issue. \\"During that time, the view was that violent instability in Yemen made returning detainees too risky,\\" he said. \\"There was little confidence that the Yemeni government would be able to mitigate any continuing threat that the returned Guantanamo detainees would pose.\\" Al-Qaeda gained territory during the Yemen revolution in 2011, taking control of towns predominantly in the Abyan region in the south west of the country. Yemen's new President, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, led a US-backed military offensive against them in the summer of 2012, pushing the insurgents out of Abyan. But their presence continued - their numbers rose from hundreds estimated in 2009-2010 to several thousands believed to be operating in the country in 2013. Suicide bombings and assassinations of military and security personnel became common. A growing anti-American sentiment has also been fuelled by a popular Shia Houthi rebellion and hated US military drone strikes. This instability, combined with a lack of infrastructure and rehabilitation services in Yemen, means that Guantanamo's Yemeni detainees may not be going back just yet. Former prisoner Said Ali al-Shihri, who was returned to Saudi Arabia, went on to become a leading member of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), now seen as the country's greatest threat. US officials fear other former inmates - radicalised in the detention centre if not before - will go straight to fight for al-Qaeda once released. Nevertheless, President Obama said on Thursday: \\"I am lifting the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen so we can review them on a case-by-case basis. \\"To the greatest extent possible, we will transfer detainees who have been cleared to go to other countries.\\" Ms Rayner believes the move is connected to a hunger strike, which is being staged by around 100 detainees and has attracted worldwide attention. \\"I think the hunger strike has made the Obama administration move Guantanamo up its priority list.\\" But Wells C Bennett, an expert in national security law at the Brookings Institution, said it was a sign of increased US confidence in the Yemeni government. \\"It may mean that the administration is beginning to feel more positively about security,\\" he said. Analysts agree, however, that a number of hurdles remain, such as strict requirements imposed by Congress that mean that Guantanamo's Yemeni detainees may not be transferred or released imminently. Much depends on how much energy the Obama administration is willing to expend. \\"I am hopeful that a few Yemenis will go home,\\" Ms Rayner said, \\"but I think it will be a small number.\\" What is a summary of this text?","completion":"This text talks about the Guantanamo detention center where people were kept because they were thought to be dangerous. Many of the people there are from Yemen. A few years ago, President Obama wanted to close the Guantanamo center, but it did not happen. Now, President Obama is thinking about letting some people from Yemen go home. This is a difficult decision because Yemen has had some problems and some people worry that these people could cause more trouble if they go home. So, there is a lot of thinking and planning before anything happens."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Who is jeff probst ex wife?

Write a title for this article: In the 1968 movie \\"Bullitt,\\" actor Steve McQueen plays a police detective who floors his Mustang GT in a tire-screeching car chase up, down and over San Francisco's hills. Fast-forward to the 21st century: Traffic accidents have exceeded gunfire as the leading cause of police on-duty deaths for 14 of the past 15 years. A 2011 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study of 733 fatal police crashes found half involved only the officer-driven vehicle. Forty-two percent of the officers who died didn't have their seat belts on. \\"It's ironic that police officers present the greatest dangers to themselves as they try to help the public,\\" said Pat Tobin, a retired San Francisco police motorcycle supervisor who lectures on officer safety. \\"But honestly, that is the case.\\" The good news is years of trainers' attempts to break through the pedal-to-metal, no-seat-belt police culture appear to be paying off. There's a chance that nationwide on-duty deaths for 2013 will total fewer than 100 for the first time since World War II. Among the primary reasons for the drop is safer driving. Vehicular-related deaths have accounted for 43 of 99 on-duty deaths so far this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, an online site that tracks officer deaths. That's five fewer traffic deaths than in 2012 and a drop of 19 since 2011. \\"This is a historic moment for law enforcement,\\" said Dale Stockton, a retired Carlsbad (San Diego County) police captain who heads Below 100, which offers safety training to police departments nationwide. \\"Barring a catastrophe, we'll come in at a level as low as anyone has seen since 1944, when most every crime-demographic male was out of the country. No one wearing a badge today has ever experienced a year with a loss level this low.\\" With guns proliferating nationwide, gunfire remains a major concern and is the No. 2 cause of officer deaths, with 29 recorded so far in 2013. But that's an improvement over 2012, when 47 died from shootings, and a big reduction from the 67 officers shot and killed in 2011. In California, nine officers have died so far in 2013, four from vehicular accidents and five from gunfire. Among those felled by bullets: An officer in Galt, south of Sacramento, killed by a burglary suspect, and two Santa Cruz police officers killed when a subject of a sexual assault investigation answered their door-knock with gunfire. The 2,197-officer San Francisco Police Department has not had an on-duty death since 2006 when it lost two officers, one to gunfire and one to an auto accident. Below 100 training stresses simple things officers can do to improve their odds on the streets and highways: Wear seat belts and body armor, reduce speed and avoid complacency. For decades, officers have resisted seat belts and body armor as restricting their ability to exit vehicles quickly and maneuver. Police drive fast to actual emergencies but sometimes officers speed \\"because they can,\\" Stockton said. Officers who wear seat belts or don't speed in nonemergency situations often feel they have to explain themselves to eye-rolling colleagues. But police training increasingly emphasizes anticipating danger in seemingly routine situations such as serving warrants and making car stops. Technology is helping police departments monitor police-cruiser speed remotely, and research is under way into disabling getaway cars without police chasing them. The San Francisco Police Department now requires officers to wear seat belts and follow strict rules about high-speed chases, confining them to pursuits of drunken drivers or suspects in felony or domestic violence cases. Of \\"Bullitt\\" and its depiction of heavy-metal cars cresting hills airborne, Officer Albie Esparza, an SFPD spokesman, said: \\"Those days are over.\\" \\"It's not that we don't ever chase, because we do,\\" Esparza said. \\"But it has to be a violent felony. It's all for public safety as well as officer safety.\\" Dan Freedman is a reporter in the Hearst Newspapers Washington bureau.

Unfortunately, millions of kids can't hear what their teachers are saying. And it's not because these students are _ . Often, it's the room's fault. Building architecture and building design can createecho -filled classrooms that make hearing difficult. Children with hearingimpairments suffer most from noisy classrooms. They sometimes can't hear questions that other students ask in class. Compared with kids with healthy hearing, they have a harder time picking up new vocabulary words by hearing them in talking. Even kids with normal hearing have a harder time in the classroom when there's too much noise. Younger children in particular have trouble separating important sounds - like a teacher's voice - from background noise. Kids with learning disabilities and speechimpediments and kids for whom English is a second language also have a harder time learning in noisy situations. In recent years, scientists who study sound have been asking schools to reduce background noise, which may include loud air-conditioners and pipes. They're also targeting outdoor noises, such as highway traffic. Noise reduction is a big deal. Why?

Article: We all have ideas about what kinds of foods are good or bad to eat. As a result, people from one culture often think the foods that people from another culture eat are unacceptable. Many people would find it terrible to eat rats, but there are forty-two different cultures whose people regard rats as proper food. Food likes and dislikes do not always seem related to nutrition. For example, broccoli is first on a list of the most nutritious common vegetables, but it is twenty-first on a list of vegetables that Americans like most to eat. Tomatoes are sixteenth on the list of most nutritious vegetables, but they are first on the list of vegetables that Americans like most to eat. But dislikes is not the only reason why some cultures will not eat a certain food. In some cultures, certain foods are taboo. Taboo is a word from the language of the Fiji Islands that is used to describe something that is forbidden. We do not usually think about why certain things are taboo in our culture. One example is that Americans do not eat dogs, although people from some other cultures regard them as good food. In the United States, dogs are very important to people as pets. They are usually regarded as part of the family, almost like a child in some cases. In addition, dogs have value as protection against criminals . Actually, the dog's place in society as a companion makes the dog taboo as food. Scientists believe that most food likes and dislikes are a result of the ways of life of different people. People will not eat pets such as dogs. Americans eat a lot of beef because there is plenty of land for raising cattle and their meat can be shipped cheaply for long distances by railroads. Question: Why is eating dogs a taboo in America? Answer: Select from the following. *It is a taboo from the Fiji Islands.; *It is against American laws.; *Dogs are needed by the police.; *Dogs are close to human life.; The answer is:","completion":"Dogs are close to human life. Eating dogs is considered a taboo in America primarily due to the close relationship and emotional attachment that Americans have with dogs. In the United States, dogs are often valued as companions and pets, playing significant roles within families and providing protection against criminals. They are an integral part of society and are usually regarded as family members in many cases, sometimes even likened to children. This emotional bond and the value attributed to dogs as companions make them unsuitable for consumption in the eyes of the American culture. While the Fiji Islands introduced the term \\"taboo\\" to describe forbidden practices, the taboo against eating dogs in America is a result of the cultural and emotional associations that have been developed with these animals over time. It is also worth noting that the way the culture and living conditions of the people influence their food preferences. For instance, Americans consume a lot of beef due to the availability of land for raising cattle and the efficiency of transportation systems for shipping meat across long distances. Therefore, cultural values and environmental factors play a crucial role in determining what is considered acceptable or unacceptable to eat in different societies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mathayus aims to avenge the death of his father at the hand of Sargon, now king of Akkad, by taking service in his Black Scorpions squad. After completing his training he is tasked by Sargon to kill Noah, Mathayus's own brother. He saves him and escapes the city, but a magic arrow follows them and kills Noah. Mathayus boards a ship to Egypt, accompanied by his childhood friend Layla. He intends to get the Spear of Osiris in Egypt, which he believes will be able to pass through Sargon's black magic protection. A fellow traveller, Greek poet Aristophanes, tells Mathayus and Layla that the Spear only kills Egyptian creatures, but the Sword of Damocles will work. The trio travels to Greece, where they can enter the Underworld to retrieve the Sword of Damocles. On the way, they fall into a cell and are surrounded by men left as sacrifices for the Minotaur. Some of the sacrifices are mercenaries who owe allegiance to Mathayus' father, so they help him and Layla to defeat the Minotaur, with help from a Chinese captive named Fung. The enlarged group travel to the Underworld, where they are attacked by the goddess Astarte. Layla and Astarte fight, while Fung and Ari search for and find the sword.

Movie plot title: Anchorman: The Legend Continues Movie plot: In 1981, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) and Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) are married and are both co-anchors for a prestigious news network in New York City. One day, Mack Tannen (Harrison Ford), the most famous nightly news anchor in New York, reveals that he is retiring. He intends to promote Corningstone, making her the first female nightly news anchor in the history of television, and to fire Burgundy due to his continuously sloppy performance on air. Burgundy grows jealous of Corningstone's success and storms out of the house, leaving her and their six-year-old son Walter (Judah Nelson). Six months later, Burgundy is back in San Diego, but barely able to hold a job due to his depression. After being fired from SeaWorld and botching a suicide attempt, Burgundy accepts a job offered to him by Freddie Shapp (Dylan Baker) with GNN, the world's first 24-hour news network, for the station's official launch. He reassembles his news team, finding Champ Kind (David Koechner), who owns a fried chicken store (that sells bats secretly to cut down on costs), Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), now a famous cat photographer, and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), who is presumed dead but appears at his own funeral. They are assigned the unpopular late-night timeslot while obnoxious rival anchorman Jack Lime (James Marsden) is put in a primetime slot. Meanwhile, Burgundy finds that Corningstone has started dating psychologist Gary (Greg Kinnear). As GNN launches, Burgundy decides to broadcast what the people want to hear, rather than what they need to hear. He and his team devise a sensationalist and patriotic newscast. Their new approach proves to be a hit, beating Lime in ratings by a massive margin, and the other news networks scramble to emulate them. Burgundy and his team are promoted to primetime, where they enjoy fame and fortune. Burgundy's success excites GNN's manager, Linda Jackson (Meagan Good), and they begin a romantic relationship.

Have you are burned something on the stove or in the oven? Do you know why things burn? It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change. So yes, temperature affects the rate that physical change occurs. Question: \\"Why do things burn?\\" Answer: \\"Due to raise in temperature\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer to the question \\"Why do things burn?\\" is correct. Burning occurs due to a raise in temperature, which can cause chemical changes and accelerate the rate of change in matter.

Context: SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. South Korean officials said there is possibility that Moon may join Trump in Singapore to help negotiate a nuclear deal with Kim, as the...

Plot title: Wild Hogs Movie plot: Doug Madsen (Tim Allen), Woody Stevens (John Travolta), Bobby Davis (Martin Lawrence), and Dudley Frank (William H. Macy) are four middle-aged suburban men living in a Cincinnati area suburb who find themselves frustrated with the pace of daily life and lack of adventure. Doug is a dentist who has trouble relating to his son Billy (Dominic Janes), Dudley is a single clumsy computer programmer who is afraid to talk to women. Bobby is a henpecked plumber whose wife has made him return to work after having taken a year off to unsuccessfully write a book, and Woody is a rich lawyer married to a supermodel. They find escape from their daily routines on weekends by riding motorcycles together posing as a biker gang called the \\"Wild Hogs\\". One day, when Woody finds out his wife is divorcing him and leaving him bankrupt, he and his friends go on a road trip on their bikes to California. After encountering several misadventures, they end up at a local bar, where they meet a much larger biker gang called the Del Fuegos, headed by Jack Blade (Ray Liotta). Jack calls the Wild Hogs \\"posers\\" and has his gang take Dudley's bike after a bogus deal to exchange Dudley's bike for a new bike that is in fact old and derelict, forcing the men to leave with Dudley in a sidecar attached to Woody's bike. Outraged at their actions, Woody returns to the Del Fuegos bar and retrieves Dudley's bike, cuts off their bikes' fuel supplies in the process and fabricates a story to the other Wild Hogs of how he \\"negotiated\\" with them to return the bike. When the Del Fuegos hear the Wild Hogs riding back past the bar, they attempt to pursue them, only for the bikes to stall. Jack inadvertently drops his lit cigarette onto the ground, igniting the fuel leaking from the bikes which then causes the the bar to explode. Woody, after witnessing the explosion from afar, convinces the others to keep riding. Eventually, the Wild Hogs run out of gas and end up in Madrid, New Mexico, where they stumble into a diner and help themselves to water and beer... My question: Who do the townspeople hold as heros?

Born on March 27, 1963, in Knoxville, Tennessee, Tarantino is known for his unique style, characterized by nonlinear storytelling, eclectic dialogue, and tributes to popular culture. He is considered one of the most influential film directors of his generation. \\"Pulp Fiction\\" (1994) is a crime film that weaves together three interconnected storylines primarily revolving around two hitmen, a boxer, and a gangster's wife. The film is acclaimed for its innovative structure and sharp writing, and its combination of humor, action, and drama. It gave a fresh spin to the crime genre while paying homage to pulp magazines and hard-boiled crime novels of the past. Upon its release, \\"Pulp Fiction\\" received universal acclaim, and it went on to become a major box-office success. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning Best Original Screenplay for Tarantino and Roger Avary. \\"Kill Bill\\" is an action-packed revenge saga released in two separate volumes. \\"Kill Bill: Volume 1\\" (2003) and \\"Kill Bill: Volume 2\\" (2004) follow The Bride, played by Uma Thurman, as she seeks retribution against a team of assassins and their leader, Bill, after they crash her wedding and leave her for dead. The films are a homage to numerous movie genres, including martial arts films, spaghetti westerns, and Japanese samurai films. The distinctive visual styles, use of music, and carefully orchestrated action sequences, along with Tarantino's signature dialogue, make the \\"Kill Bill\\" series unforgettable, garnering widespread critical acclaim and box office success. Throughout his career, Tarantino has directed numerous other films, such as \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" (1992), \\"Jackie Brown\\" (1997), \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" (2009), \\"Django Unchained\\" (2012), \\"The Hateful Eight\\" (2015), and \\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\\" (2019). His films have consistently been celebrated for their originality, creativity, and contributions to the world of cinema.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: When giving assistance to family members in need you may feel what? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - death - pleasure - reward - satisfaction - sadness The answer is:","completion":"satisfaction When giving assistance to family members in need, one may feel a sense of satisfaction. This feeling comes from the knowledge that you are helping a loved one, and it is a natural human response to derive pleasure from aiding those we care about. The satisfaction results from a combination of empathy, love, and the gratification of making a positive impact on someone else's life. Helping family members in their time of need not only strengthens the bond between individuals but also creates a foundation of trust and emotional support. The other options - death, pleasure, reward, and sadness - do not convey the same level of emotional connection or fulfillment one would experience from assisting a family member in need. Choosing death or sadness as an answer would imply a negative or uncomfortable feeling, which is not something one would typically associate with helping family. While pleasure and reward are both positive emotions, their connotations lean more towards a self-focused feeling rather than a communal or empathic action. Pleasure suggests enjoying oneself, potentially at the expense of others, and reward implies a self-serving attitude, expecting compensation for one's actions. On the contrary, satisfaction implies a sense of balance and gratification that comes from doing something positive for someone else, particularly a family member in need. This option reflects the altruistic nature of our relationships with those closest to us and the way in which their well-being directly affects our own emotional state. In conclusion, satisfaction is the most suitable option for answering the given question because it best represents the feelings one might experience when extending help and support to family members in need. These feelings stem from the strong bonds that connect loved ones and defy the expectation of personal gain, highlighting the deep-seated sense of fulfillment that comes from attending to the needs of those we hold dear."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trucks haul 95 percent of land freight in Manitoba, and trucking companies account for 80 percent of Manitoba's merchandise trade to the United States. Five of Canada's twenty-five largest employers in for-hire trucking are headquartered in Manitoba. C1.18 billion of Manitoba's GDP comes directly or indirectly from trucking.Greyhound Canada and Grey Goose Bus Lines offer domestic bus service from the Winnipeg Bus Terminal. The terminal was relocated from downtown Winnipeg to the airport in 2009, and is a Greyhound hub. Municipalities also operate localized transit bus systems. Manitoba has two Class I railways: Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). Winnipeg is centrally located on the main lines of both carriers, and both maintain large inter-modal terminals in the city. CN and CPR operate a combined 2,439 kilometres (1,516 mi) of track in Manitoba. Via Rail offers transcontinental and Northern Manitoba passenger service from Winnipeg's Union Station.

Context: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Malice Context: Andy (Bill Pullman) and Tracy Safian (Nicole Kidman) are a newlywed couple living in a Victorian house that they are restoring in Western Massachusetts. He is an Associate Dean at a local college, while his wife teaches art to children. When a student is attacked and seriously wounded by a serial rapist, Dr. Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin), a brilliant surgeon who has recently joined the staff of the area hospital, operates and saves her life. Money is tight, so Andy invites him to rent the third floor of their home, in order to finance the new plumbing. With his propensity to bring home sexual partners and to party late into the night, Jed quickly proves himself to be a less-than-ideal tenant. When Paula Bell (Gwyneth Paltrow), one of Andy's students, is attacked and killed by the serial rapist, Andy is the one to find her body, prompting police Detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) to view him as a possible suspect. Harris asks Andy to come to the police station and submit a semen sample to clear his name. While at the police station, Andy learns that Tracy has been hospitalized and is being operated on by Jed. In removing one of Tracy's ovaries, which has ruptured due to a cyst, Jed discovers Tracy is pregnant, but the stress of the procedure causes the fetus to abort. Another doctor notices that Tracy's other ovary is torsed and appears necrotic. Jed consults with Andy and advises him to agree to the removal of Tracy's second ovary, rather than risk her life. Andy painfully agrees, since this will mean that Tracy can never have children. Jed overrules the protests of other doctors that the ovary might still be healthy and he removes it. After the removal, it is confirmed that the ovary was, in fact, healthy. With this knowledge, Tracy and Andy decide to sue Jed and the hospital. Jed delivers a deposition in which he launches into a monologue about his own infallibility as a surgeon, concluding with the assertion that he is literally God.

Here is an article: Former Rutgers quarterback Tom Savage has committed to the play football for the Arizona Wildcats, he wrote in a text message to TucsonCitizen.com on Thursday morning as he was leaving Tucson. Wrote Savage: \\"Coaches were awesome, campus is great and I bonded with the players a lot.\\" Savage spent Tuesday and Wednesday on a recruiting trip to the University of Arizona. He left Thursday morning to return to his home in Springfield, Pa., outside of Philadelphia. \\"I have always wanted to go out there and take a look,\\" Savage told TucsonCitizen.com on Monday. \\"I really want to find a home and I'm just looking forward to getting out of this cold.\\" This was the only recruiting trip Savage took after leaving Rutgers following last season. In an earlier interview, he said he was hoping to enroll at his new destination as early as possible in the summer. He is not taking classes at Rutgers this spring. Savage will have to sit out the 2011 season as a transfer. He will have two years of eligibility remaining, beginning with 2012. His commitment gives the Wildcats much more continuity at the quarterback position, filling what quarterbacks coach Frank Scelfo described last week as a \\"hole\\" in Arizona's recruiting. In a perfect world, senior Nick Foles stays healthy for 2011 and senior Matt Scott redshirts, as is his preference. Arizona would have Scott and Savage to compete in 2012 … and, after that, Arizona has another year of Savage with plenty of time to develop and add other quarterbacks. And if Scott can't redshirt, Arizona now has a quarterback with experience in 2012 to go along with young guys Cam Allerheiligen and Daxx Garman. Savage (6-5, 226) was a Freshman All-American in 2009, becoming a starter in the second game and being voted the team's Offensive MVP for the season. He completed 149 of 289 passes for 2,211 yards, with 14 touchdowns and seven interceptions. He was ineffective early in the 2010 season, suffered a hand injury and then didn't play much the rest of the way. As a sophomore, he was 43 of 83 for 521 yards, with two touchdowns and three interceptions. See photos of: Arizona Wildcats To report corrections and clarifications, contact Standards Editor .

Is \\"Rome had come to dominate the Italian peninsula, and desired the submission of the Greek cities to its rule.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Rome had come to dominate the Italian peninsula, and desired the submission of the Greek cities to its rule\\" is generally correct, although it could benefit from further elaboration for clarity and context. Rome, a city-state located in the central part of the Italian peninsula, eventually became the dominant entity throughout the peninsula and beyond. The Italian peninsula is an elongated boot-shaped landmass in Southern Europe, bounded by the Adriatic Sea on the east, the Ionian Sea on the south, the Tyrrhenian Sea on the west, and the Alps to the north. Italy's geography and location in the Mediterranean made it a strategic area in ancient times, particularly for trade, commerce, and military expansion. The region was home to several notable civilizations, including the Etruscans and the ancient Greeks, who built a number of colonies in southern Italy. Initially, Rome was just one of many competing city-states on the Italian peninsula. However, through a series of strategic alliances, conquests, and diplomatic maneuvers, Rome was able to expand its domain. By around 275 BCE, Rome had conquered or subdued the other city-states on the peninsula: the Etruscans to the north, the Greeks in the south, and the Samnites and other groups in the central, eastern, and southern regions. Once the Italian peninsula was under Roman control, Rome's ambition shifted towards the submission of the Greek cities. The conclusion of the First Punic War in 241 BCE led Rome to engage in conflicts with the Hellenistic states in the eastern Mediterranean. These struggles included the Illyrian Wars, Macedonian Wars, and Syrian War, which played a pivotal role in reshaping the power balance in the eastern Mediterranean. The Roman victory over the Greek city-states in the Battle of Corinth (146 BCE) marked the end of Greek political independence and finalized Rome's domination in the Mediterranean world. These conquests were indicative of Rome’s desire to control even more territory and power. Over time, Rome continued to dominate this region and incorporate other territories, ultimately forming the extensive Roman Empire that would endure for centuries. In summary, Rome indeed came to dominate the Italian peninsula throughout its history and sought control over other civilizations, including the Greek cities. The impressive growth of the Roman Republic and later, the Roman Empire, underscores the influence and power that Rome was able to amass during this period."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He is the mutant son of Professor Charles Xavier and Gabrielle Haller. Legion takes the role of an antihero who has a severe mental illness including a form of dissociative identity disorder, in which each of his alternate personas controls one of his many superpowers. The television series Legion premiered on FX network in 2017. When Mystique tracked down David years later to get revenge for \\"his\\" murder of Destiny, he awakened with his fractured mind healed. David had a new goal, to help his father realize his dream of human-mutant coexistence by killing Magneto, Xavier's greatest opponent, before he had a chance to amass power. He traveled twenty years into the past, when Xavier and Magneto were orderlies at the mental hospital. In the process, he loses his memory. Magneto then accidentally triggers his memory, causing David to go on a rampage, attacking Magneto and revealing the existence of mutants to the public decades too early. Several X-Men who were pulled back in time with him were unable to prevent him from attacking Magneto. Xavier, however, leaped into the path of the psi-knife (the focused totality of Legion's psionic powers) and was killed in Magneto's place, causing the formation of the Age of Apocalypse timeline. Due to being trapped in the past by David's actions, Bishop enlisted the aid of the new reality's X-Men to travel back in time to confront Legion again.

Read this article and answer this question It is believed that the Baltic languages are among the most archaic of the currently remaining Indo-European languages, despite their late attestation. Although the various Baltic tribes were mentioned by ancient historians as early as 98 B.C., the first attestation of a Baltic language was about 1350, with the creation of the Elbing Prussian Vocabulary, a German to Prussian translation dictionary. Lithuanian was first attested in a hymnal translation in 1545; the first printed book in Lithuanian, a Catechism by Martynas Mažvydas was published in 1547 in Königsberg, Prussia . Latvian appeared in a hymnal in 1530 and in a printed Catechism in 1585. One reason for the late attestation is that the Baltic peoples resisted Christianization longer than any other Europeans, which delayed the introduction of writing and isolated their languages from outside influence. With the establishment of a German state in Prussia, and the eradication or flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population in the 13th century, the remaining Prussians began to be assimilated, and by the end of the 17th century, the Prussian language had become extinct. During the years of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , official documents were written in Polish, Ruthenian and Latin. After the Partitions of Commonwealth, most of the Baltic lands were under the rule of the Russian Empire, where the native languages or alphabets were sometimes prohibited from being written down or used publicly in a Russification effort . How many centuries after the establishment of a German state in Prussia the flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population","completion":"Okay, let's see. The article talks about the establishment of a German state in Prussia in the 13th century. That is like counting up to 12 in hundreds (1200s). Then it says the Prussian language had become extinct by the end of the 17th century. That's like counting up to 16 in hundreds (1600s). So, to find out how many centuries passed between them, we can just think of it as subtracting 12 from 16. That would be 4, so four centuries passed after the establishment of a German state in Prussia and the flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: He was 11 years old and went fishing every chance he got from the dock at his family's cabin on an island in the middle of a New Hampshire lake. On the day before the bass season opened, he and his father were fishing early in the evening, catching sunfish and perch with worms. Then he tied on a small silver lure and practiced casting. The lure struck the water and caused colored ripples in the sunset, then silver ripples as the moon rose over the lake. When his pole doubled over, he knew something huge was on the other end. Finally, he very gingerly lifted the exhausted fish from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a perch . The boy and his father looked at the handsome fish. Then the father lit a match and looked at his watch. It was 10 P.M.--- two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy. \\"You'll have to put it back, son,\\" he said. \\"Dad!\\" cried the boy. \\"There will be other fish,\\" said his father. \\"Not as big as this one,\\" cried the boy. He looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were anywhere around in the moonlight. He looked again at his father. Even though no one had seen them, nor could anyone ever know what time he caught the fish, the boy could know everything by his father's clear voice that the decision could not be changed. He slowly worked the hook out of the lip of the huge bass and lowered it into the black water. The creature swished its powerful body and disappeared. The boy suspected that he would never again see such a great fish. That was 34 years ago. Today, the boy is a successful architect in New York City. His father's cabin is still there on the island in the middle of the lake. He takes his own son and daughters fishing from the same dock. He was right.

The context here provides information about the 1993 Jurassic Park video game's creation and its release on both Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the handheld Game Boy console. The given hypothesis speculates about the reason behind the game's release on the Game Boy console, suggesting it was due to its widespread popularity. However, the information provided in the context does not support this. The context explicitly states that the Game Boy version is a port of the NES version, but it doesn't mention anything about the game's popularity influencing this decision.

The hypothesis includes an assumption (about the game's popularity leading to its additional release on Game Boy) that isn't supported by the facts given in the context. In a scientific or a strictly logical method of inquiry, it's important to avoid jumping to conclusions or making assumptions without adequate supporting evidence. For a hypothesis to be considered valid and reliable, it should be based on facts or at least strongly suggested by the available information.

Summarize: Your total rise is the height from one story to the next that the stairs will connect. The total rise should be set in most cases, so you simply need to measure the height. This distance should be from the top of the finished floor below and the finished floor at the top. If the floor is unfinished when you are calculating your stringers, you need to take that into account. The height of each step can vary a bit but there are general standards. It is standard to have your riser be about 7 inches (18 cm) tall, so use this measurement unless you have specific parameters that prevent it, such as limited headroom. This measurement is sometimes called the individual rise of the stairs. For this calculation you are simply figuring out how many stairs it will take to get the height you need. Use a calculator or do the arithmetic by hand, as it is generally pretty simple. For example, if you want 7 inches (18 cm) tall stairs and your overall rise needs to be 56 inches (140 cm), then 56/7=8. You will need 8 stairs. The number of treads you have (individual runs) will automatically be one less than the number of risers. Your total run is the horizontal distance between the top and the bottom of the stairs. How far the stairs stick out can vary depending on your needs, but keep in mind that stairs should usually be at an angle of about 40 degrees. In general, the run of each stair should be about 10 inches (25 cm) in order for people’s feet to fit comfortably as they walk up them. There are many stair calculators that you can use online to figure out stair measurements. You simply need to input your rise and the angle you want for your stairs and they will calculate the other measurements you need, including your run. Once you have the overall rise and run of the stairs, you can calculate how long the stringer needs to be. You can either use an online stair calculator, a hypotenuse calculator, or you can do the math yourself. To calculate the length yourself, you will need to use the Pythagorean theorem, which is a2 + b2 = c2. So, for example, if the rise needs to be 60 inches (150 cm) and the run needs to be 84 inches (210 cm), then you would calculate 602 + 842 = c2, with “c” being the length of 99 inches (250 cm). Ensure your math and calculations are correct so that you don’t waste your time and materials cutting risers that don’t fit. It’s better to take a few minutes to double check yourself than to waste a whole lot of time redoing your work.","completion":"To summarize, when calculating stairs, measure the total rise, or the height between the floors the stairs connect. Consider the standard individual rise of 7 inches and divide the total rise by this measurement to determine the number of stairs needed. Keep in mind the angle of the stairs should be around 40 degrees and the run of each stair should be about 10 inches for comfort. Utilize online stair calculators for accurate measurements and ensure your calculations are correct before cutting materials to avoid wasting time and resources."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The premise \\"Tired, the woman rests her head on her backpack while lying down\\" can be considered true if \\"the woman is sleepy.\\" To provide a more detailed analysis, let us break down each part of the premise and discuss its relationship with the given fact: 1. The woman: Both the premise and the given fact share the same subject, which is the \\"woman.\\" 2. Tired: In the premise, it is mentioned that the woman is tired. The fact that she is sleepy may suggest that she is indeed tired, as sleepiness is often a sign of tiredness or physical exhaustion. 3. Rests her head on her backpack: As a result of her tiredness and sleepiness, the woman decides to take a break and seek some comfort by resting her head on her backpack. This action seems plausible, considering her state of fatigue. 4. Lying down: The woman lying down implies that she is seeking relief from her exhaustion and trying to relax. This action is in line with the fact that she is sleepy, as one may lie down to rest when they are feeling tired or sleepy. Taking all this into account, we can conclude that the premise \\"Tired, the woman rests her head on her backpack while lying down\\" is true if \\"the woman is sleepy.\\" Although sleepiness does not always imply tiredness (for example, medical conditions or medication side effects can cause sleepiness), in this context, it is reasonable to assume that the woman's sleepiness is a sign of her tiredness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was thought to have died out over 50 years ago, but photographers have managed to snap an exceptionally rare lizard in Ecuador. The long-nosed Pinocchio lizard was spotted by a team of photographers and researchers after combing a remote area in the north west of the country for three years. The lizard, which was first discovered in 1953 and named after the fictional lying puppet, was thought to be extinct until 2005 and it has only been sighted three times since. Scroll down for video. After searching for the rare long-nosed Pinocchio anole (pictured) for three years, a team of photographers and researchers found the lizard recently in a stretch of pristine cloud forest in the northwest part of Ecuador, around two hours drive from the capital. The lizard was named after Pinocchio (puppet, pictured), a fictional character whose nose grew each time he lied. The curious-looking animal did a disappearing act in the 1960s and was not seen again until an ornithologist saw one crossing the road in the same stretch of cloud forest. The animal was most recently captured by Alejandro Arteaga, a co-founder of an eco-tourism company called Tropical Herping, which has been searching for the almost long-lost animal. The researcher told LiveScience that the best time to spot the rare lizards known as anoles is at night when they are sleeping and less likely to run away. As part of an expedition in January, one of his sharp-eyed team saw a male Pinocchio anole scaling a branch and the team managed to catch it and keep it overnight until they could photograph it in its natural surroundings the following morning. Mr Arteaga said: 'After looking for so long It was very thrilling to find this strange lizard.' The male lizard's long nose actually serves no real purpose apart from advertising its good genes and female anoles select their mates based on whether it has an impressive appendage. The females do not have long noses. The curious animal was discovered in 1953 but disappeared from the 1960s until it was spotted again in 2005.

Information: - Peter of Luxembourg (1390 31 August 1433) was a son of John of Luxembourg, Lord of Beauvoir, and his wife Marguerite of Enghien. His inheritance included the counties of Brienne, Conversano and Saint-Pol. - Jacquetta of Luxembourg, Countess Rivers (1415/1416 30 May 1472) was the eldest daughter of Peter I of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, Conversano and Brienne and his wife Margaret of Baux (Margherita del Balzo of Andria). She was a prominent, though often overlooked, figure in the Wars of the Roses. Through her short-lived first marriage to the Duke of Bedford, brother of King Henry V, she was firmly allied to the House of Lancaster. However, following the emphatic Lancastrian defeat at the Battle of Towton, she and her second husband Richard Woodville sided closely with the House of York. Three years after the battle and the accession of Edward IV of England, Jacquetta's eldest daughter Elizabeth Woodville married him and became Queen consort of England. Jacquetta bore Woodville 14 children and stood trial on charges of witchcraft, for which she was exonerated. - Richard Woodville (or Wydeville), 1st Earl Rivers (1405 12 August 1469) was an English nobleman, best remembered as the father of Queen consort Elizabeth Woodville and the maternal grandfather of Edward V and the maternal great-grandfather of Henry VIII. - The House of York was a cadet branch of the English royal House of Plantagenet. Three of its members became Kings of England in the late 15th century. The House of York was descended in the male line from Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, the fourth surviving son of Edward III, but also represented Edward's senior line, being cognatic descendants of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, Edward III's second surviving son. It is based on these descents that they claimed the English crown. Compared with the House of Lancaster, it had a senior claim to the throne of England according to cognatic primogeniture but junior claim according to the agnatic primogeniture. The reign of this dynasty ended with the death of Richard III of England in 1485. It became extinct in the male line with the death of Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick in 1499. - A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king (or an empress consort in the case of an emperor). In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch. - Cecily of York , Viscountess Welles ( 20 March 1469 -- 24 August 1507 ) was an English Princess and the third , but eventual second surviving , daughter of Edward IV , King of England and his queen consort Elizabeth Woodville , daughter of Richard Woodville , 1st Earl Rivers and Jacquetta of Luxembourg . - Sir John Grey, of Groby, Leicestershire (c. 1432 17 February 1461) was a Lancastrian knight, the first husband of Elizabeth Woodville who later married King Edward IV of England, and great-great-grandfather of Lady Jane Grey. - Margaret of Baux (; 1394 15 November 1469) was a Countess of Saint-Pol, of Brienne, and of Conversano. She was a member of the noble House of Baux of the Kingdom of Naples, which had its origins in Provence dating back to the 11th century. Her husband was Peter of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, of Brienne, and of Conversano (1390 31 August 1433). Margaret's descendants include English Queen Consort Elizabeth Woodville, King Henry IV of France, Mary, Queen of Scots, and all English monarchs after 1509. - Sultan (') is a noble title with several historical meanings. Originally, it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning \\"strength\\", \\"authority\\", \\"rulership\\", derived from the verbal noun ', meaning \\"authority\\" or \\"power\\". Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms (i.e., the lack of dependence on any higher ruler), albeit without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate. - The House of Lancaster was the name of two cadet branches of the royal House of Plantagenet. The first house was created when Henry III of England created the Earldom of Lancasterfrom which the house was namedfor his second son Edmund Crouchback in 1267. Edmund had already been created Earl of Leicester in 1265 and was granted the lands and privileges of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, after de Montfort's death and attainder at the end of the Second Barons' War. When Edmund's son Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, inherited his father-in-law's estates and title of Earl of Lincoln he became at a stroke the most powerful nobleman in England, with lands throughout the kingdom and the ability to raise vast private armies to wield power at national and local levels. This brought himand Henry, his younger brotherinto conflict with their cousin Edward II of England, leading to Thomas's execution. Henry inherited Thomas's titles and he and his son, who was also called Henry, gave loyal service to Edward's sonEdward III of England. - Elizabeth Woodville (also spelled Wydville, Wydeville, or Widvile; c. 1437 8 June 1492) was Queen consort of England as the spouse of King Edward IV from 1464 until his death in 1483. At the time of her birth, her family was mid-ranked in the English aristocracy. Her first marriage was to a minor supporter of the House of Lancaster, Sir John Grey of Groby; he died at the Second Battle of St Albans, leaving Elizabeth a widowed mother of two sons. Her second marriage, to Edward IV, was a cause célèbre of the day, thanks to Elizabeth's great beauty and lack of great estates. Edward was only the second king of England since the Norman Conquest to have married one of his subjects, and Elizabeth was the first such consort to be crowned queen. Her marriage greatly enriched her siblings and children, but their advancement incurred the hostility of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, 'The Kingmaker', and his various alliances with the most senior figures in the increasingly divided royal family.

Given the question: Process: - Water comes into contact with something made of iron - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together - They form iron oxide, which is rust - Question: suppose less sugar is used happens, how will it affect MORE rust forming. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"The question seems to be asking about the effect of using less sugar on the formation of rust. However, sugar is not a component involved in the rusting process, so its presence or absence will not directly influence the formation of rust. To clarify the rust formation process, let's review the steps mentioned: 1. Water comes into contact with something made of iron. 2. The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid. 3. As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve. 4. Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen. 5. The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together. 6. They form iron oxide, which is rust. Given that sugar is not involved in any of the steps above, using less sugar will have no direct effect on the formation of more or less rust. However, it's still essential to understand that in specific environments, reducing the presence of certain substances like sugar can have indirect effects on corrosion. For example, if the environment where iron is placed contains high levels of sugar, and this attracts moisture from the air or encourages the growth of microorganisms, it could indirectly increase the rate of rust formation. By reducing the amount of sugar in such an environment, the indirect promoting factors mentioned above may decrease, which could in turn potentially slow down the rusting process. However, this would not be due to the direct interaction of sugar with the iron or the rust itself. In conclusion, the answer to the question is that using less sugar will likely have no direct effect on the formation of more or less rust, as sugar is not part of the chemical process that leads to rust. However, it is important to consider any indirect effects that the presence of sugar could have on the environment surrounding the iron, which could, in turn, influence the rusting process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"The Metropolitan Police has commissioned an independent review into how it responds to people with mental health conditions.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Independent Review into Metropolitan Police's Response to Mental Health Conditions: A Crucial Step Towards Better Policing Introduction The Metropolitan Police has recently announced the commission of an independent review into its approach to dealing with individuals suffering from mental health conditions. This move signifies a much-needed effort towards ensuring the well-being of the public while maintaining efficient law enforcement practices. Background Over the years, there have been numerous cases of people with mental health conditions encountering law enforcement officers during times of crisis. These interactions, in some instances, have tragically resulted in injuries, fatalities, and overall negative experiences for both parties involved. As a result, the Metropolitan Police's decision to commission a comprehensive review presents an opportunity to enhance existing police guidelines and training, while improving the overall understanding of mental health issues in the force. Significance of the Independent Review The review aims to examine the current policies and practices within the Metropolitan Police as they pertain to individuals with mental health concerns. Several factors make this review a significant and timely undertaking: 1. Ensuring fairness and accountability - By soliciting an objective analysis of their existing protocols, The Metropolitan Police demonstrates their commitment to transparency and accountability. This is a vital step in building trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. 2. Reducing stigma around mental health - People with mental health conditions often face discrimination, prejudice, and marginalization. The review aims to ensure that law enforcement officers are educated about mental health conditions, which can help reduce stigma and promote understanding. 3. Enhancing officer training - Inadequate training is often cited as a contributing factor in poor outcomes when officers interact with individuals experiencing mental health crises. By identifying gaps in current training programs and recommending improvements, the review can drastically enhance officer preparedness for such encounters. 4. Identifying best practices - The independent nature of the review ensures that the evaluators can consult with experts and draw from evidence-based practices to determine the most effective approaches for dealing with mental health issues in policing contexts. 5. Promoting community collaboration - The review process fosters collaboration between law enforcement agencies, mental health service providers, and communities. This multi-sectoral partnership has the potential to improve police response to mental health crises and ensure that individuals receive appropriate care and resources. Potential Recommendations and Outcomes While it is too soon to predict the specific recommendations that will arise from this review, it is anticipated that several areas will be addressed: 1. Crisis intervention training - Expanded training in de-escalation techniques, understanding mental health disorders, and recognizing signs of mental health crises is an essential component to improving police response. 2. Mental health resources for law enforcement personnel - Provisions for the well-being of officers, who often experience stress and trauma themselves, must also be considered. Ensuring that police personnel have access to mental health support can greatly impact their ability to effectively serve the community. 3. Collaborative partnerships - Strengthening coordination between law enforcement and mental health service providers, such as crisis response teams and specialized mental health units, can foster more accurate assessments and targeted interventions. 4. Policy review and development - Amending or developing new policies related to the use of force, communication strategies, and crisis management can provide officers with clearer guidelines for managing sensitive situations. Conclusion In conclusion, the independent review commissioned by The Metropolitan Police is a critical step forward in addressing the complex challenges of mental health in law enforcement. This in-depth analysis and exploration of best practices have the potential to significantly enhance the support provided to individuals experiencing mental health crises while ensuring the safety and effectiveness of police officers. By fostering better understanding and collaboration, the outcomes of this review can pave the way for more empathetic and effective policing in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: How do I chop the onions ? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"Chopping onions may seem like a daunting task, especially when you see skilled chefs doing it quickly and efficiently on television. However, by following these simple steps, you can easily chop an onion like a pro. First and foremost, gather the necessary tools and materials for this task, including a sharp knife, a cutting board, and the onion you want to chop. 1. Prepare the onion: Start by removing any loose or dirty outer layers of the onion, ensuring it is clean and ready for use. Rinse the onion under cold running water to remove any dirt or debris. 2. Cut off the ends: Place the onion on the cutting board with its root end facing you. With your sharp knife, carefully slice off about 1/4 inch from the top (non-root) end, creating a flat, stable surface. Do not cut into the onion too deeply, as you want to leave the root end intact to help hold the onion together while chopping. 3. Halve the onion: Rotate the onion so that the recently cut end is facing away from you, and the root end is towards you. It's essential to keep your fingers tucked safely away from the knife as you work. Carefully slice down through the center of the onion, making sure you cut through the root end as well. At this point, you should have two onion halves. 4. Remove the outer layer: Peel the onion by gently lifting the outer layer from one half and peeling it away, revealing the fresh onion layers beneath. Do the same for the other half. 5. Make vertical cuts: With the root end of one onion half still facing towards you, and pressing down on the onion with your non-dominant hand, make a series of narrow vertical cuts into the onion, starting from the top (non-root) end towards the root end. However, do not cut all the way through the root. The distance between each cut depends on how finely you want the onion to be chopped. 6. Make horizontal cuts: Now make 1-2 horizontal cuts into the side of the onion, being careful not to cut through the root. Hold the onion firmly with your non-dominant hand, keeping your fingers curled for safety. 7. Chop the onion: With the root end still facing towards you, hold the onion firmly and begin slicing downward through the previous cuts, starting from the non-root end, moving toward the root end. As the knife goes through the onion, small chopped pieces should begin to fall onto the cutting board. The size of the chopped onion pieces will depend on the spacing of your earlier cuts. Make sure to use a rocking or slicing motion with your knife for easier cutting. 8. Finishing touches: When you have chopped about three-quarters of the onion, you may notice that the root end gets wobbly and difficult to chop. At this point, lay the remaining onion portion on the cutting board, with the flat side facing down, and continue chopping until it becomes too difficult or unstable, at which point it's best to discard the remaining bit with the root end. 9. Repeat: Repeat the process for the second half of the onion. Once both halves are chopped, use your knife to make any necessary adjustments to the size of the onion pieces, if desired. 10. Store or use: Finally, either use the freshly chopped onions immediately in your cooking or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for later use. Be mindful that onions may cause other foods in the fridge to absorb their odor. It is best to store chopped onions in a well-sealed container or plastic wrap. By following these steps, you can chop onions efficiently and safely, making it easier than ever to include this versatile ingredient in your cooking. Whether you're making a salad, sautéing vegetables, or creating a tasty sauce, having properly chopped onions at your disposal will lead to better, more consistent results in the kitchen."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Summarize the following: If you're tackling the move by yourself, then you'll need to arrange to pick up a removals van on the morning of the move. Make this arrangement well in advance, or it may be tricky to hire a van exactly when you want it for a reasonable price during a busy moving season. Compare the prices of a few companies before making your decision. Get there early to avoid waiting in a queue on a busy moving day. Packing your moving truck won't be a big challenge if you plan in advance and have the help of a few trusted friends when you do it. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you pack your moving truck: Remember that you will need at least two people to handle things other than lifting and hauling. They will need to organize the things that need to be loaded by keeping the packed boxes close to the door easily accessible. Disassemble your furniture. Take apart any lamps, tables with removable legs, bookshelves, and entertainment systems. Protect your furniture. Wrap all of your items with packing paper, bubblewrap and tape as you load them into the truck. Load the heaviest items first, into the back of the truck. This includes your fridge, washer, dryer, and other appliances, as well as your heaviest boxes. Load the heaviest boxes. Stack them like bricks to form layers of walls that fill the back of the truck. Use T-stacks to make the boxes more stable: make each vertical seam make a T with the horizontal layer below it, like bricks in a house. Avoid vertical pillars of similar sized boxes. To maximize space, it is essential to stack high, stable walls early on. Next, load your longer items into the truck. This includes your bed and shelves. Lean them against the sides of the truck. Pack your remaining boxes into the truck. Create three layers of boxes which includes the heaviest boxes on the bottom, the medium-sized boxes in the middle, and the lightest boxes on top. Once you're done with each layer, tape it together with packing tape. Put in your remaining items. The trick is to make everything fit snugly together, but don't pack it so tight that it looks ready to explode. When using the ramp of a box van, such as the vans pictured, make sure the ramp has been fitted into place: once you have fully extended the ramp from under the truck, you will find two prongs that will fit into slots on the lip of the van's cargo space. This will ensure that the ramp is flush with the lip, and make it a breeze to use the dolly. This step is often overlooked. Make sure the dolly is one of the last things to get loaded, so you will have it as soon as you arrive at the new house. Carefully drive the truck to your new home. Be prepared to drive slower and more carefully than you would do in a car. Driving a moving truck takes a big adjustment. Remember to go slowly and stay calm, because the drive may be stressful. If at all possible, back the truck up to the new house so that the ramp will extend onto the porch. Use all of your crew as spotters to make sure you are clear of any obstacles. When you are close to the porch, extend the ramp and hook it in place, and have a crew member carry the opposite end. Most ramps will not latch properly unless the end is on the ground. Once you have the ramp set up, here's how you can unload your stuff: Have a plan for where you're going to put the large items in each room. Do a walk through with the movers, and show them where the larger items go, such as the sofas, TV, cabinets, beds, dressers, night-stands, etc. Choose where to put the boxes and small items in each room based on that. That way the boxes won't be in the way when the big furniture comes in. And you won't have to move the boxes again. You can put Post-it notes on the wall if necessary. You will have arranged whether you will do this the same day or the next morning.

Article: Beijing, April 2----Starting from this year, the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau will begin to promote a home medical service. With this service a medical team which is made up of a doctor, a nurse and a medical health worker will be sent to some communities in the city. They will set up a medical filing recorder for every resident in community and publicize their contact information to them. If people in the community feel sick, they can consult their community doctor first. If community doctors cannot treat their illness, they will then be transferred to large hospitals. Liang Wan, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, made the statement last Friday . In addition ,the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau will set up some funds to train home medical service workers for families whose members suffer either from high blood pressure, diabetes,cerebral apoplexy , or coronary heart disease . The home medical service workers will remind patients to take pills on time and lead the patients to follow some health tips in their daily life. They will also learn some practical knowledge to save patients in case of an emergency . The work will first begin in the medical service room in the 25 community centers and spread to all communities in Beijing. The disease prevention and control centers at various counties and districts in Beijing will be responsible for teaching community doctors and giving home medical service lectures, or advice . These workers will not be able to work until they pass related examination and obtain the work certificates. It is expected that by the end of this year, there will be 10000 home medical service workers in Beijing .

Let's see, if we have 48 candies and we eat 53, we'll be short of 5 candies, right? So 48 - 53 will be -5. Now, our problem is 2*s = s - 5. Since we want to find out what 's' is, let's move all 's' terms to one side, and numbers to the other side. Let's take 's' away from both sides of the equal sign, like this: 2*s - s = s - 5 - s That will leave us with: 1*s = -5 (since 2*s - s = 1*s and s - 5 - s = -5) So now we know that 's' is equal to -5.

Wikileaks dump appears to show DNC favored Clinton campaign A new trove of leaked emails seem to show that top officials at the Democratic National Committee openly mocked and criticized Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primary race against Hillary Clinton -- a startling revelation that raises questions about the Democratic Party’s impartiality and an issue that could play out poorly at the party’s convention this week in Philadelphia. Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED WikiLeaks posted close to 20,000 emails and 8,000 attachments Friday sent or received from top Democratic officials that seem to suggest the committee’s chairwoman, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other higher ups tried to tip the scales in Clinton’s favor. WikiLeaks dubbed the document dump the “Hillary Leaks series.” Sanders has repeatedly claimed that he thought the system was “rigged” during the primaries. RELEASE: 19,252 emails from the US Democratic National Committee https://t.co/kpFxYDoNyX #Hillary2016 #FeelTheBern pic.twitter.com/Pft8wnOujl Republican candidate Donald Trump weighed in Saturday morning, tweeting: “Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes (sic), really vicious. RIGGED.” The leaks, from January 2015 to May 2016, purportedly came the from accounts of seven DNC officials and feature conversations by staffers debating everything from how to deal with media requests to syncing the party’s message with interest groups in Washington. The officials are: Senior Adviser Andrew Wright, National Finance Director Jordan Kaplan, Finance Chief of Staff Scott Comer, Communications Director Luis Miranda, Northern California Finance Director Robert Stowe, Finance Director of Data & Strategic Initiatives Daniel Parrish and Finance Director Allen Zachary. In one email, DNC staffers were looking for ways to blunt Sanders’ popularity with Democrats. In a May 5 email, a DNC employee asked a colleague to collect information on his religious beliefs – claiming it might sway voters in West Virginia and Kentucky. In that particular email, Sanders name was not mentioned but he was the only other candidate in the race at that time against Clinton. DNC chief financial officer Brad Marshall wrote, “This would make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.” Stephen Hayes, a columnist at the Weekly Standard, told “Special Report” on Fox News that the emails show a clear pattern of Wasserman Schultz and the DNC “thumbing the scales’ in favor of Clinton and scheming for ways to “thwart” Sanders. A May 15, 2016 email, shows the DNC was in close contact with news websites on articles related to the Democratic Party, Sanders and Clinton. A Real Clear Politics article claimed that Sanders supporters are causing a lack of unity at the Democratic National Convention. Wasserman Schultz took issue with the headline and told another Democratic official the “headline needs to be changed.” What followed was a back and forth between DNC officials to pressure Real Clear Politics to change their story. The last email on the thread between DNC officials reads, “Done. Article has been updated.” The Real Clear Politics story headline was corrected to reflect that the incident in question involved the Nevada state convention and not the national one. Calls by FoxNews.com to the DNC for comment were not immediately returned. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Wikileaks is a website that shared a lot of secret emails from important people in the Democratic National Committee.

Information: - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - Stian Aarstad is a Norwegian pianist and keyboard player best known for his five - year ( 1992 -- 97 ) stint with the black metal band Dimmu Borgir during which he played keyboards and synthesizers while engendering criticism and controversy for appearing onstage and performing in a top - hat - and - cape outfit reminiscent of Jack the Ripper , while wearing minimal corpse makeup and not moving or showing any emotion . Upon joining Dimmu Borgir , he did n't listen to metal music , preferring only to listen to classical . In 1998 to 1999 , he produced a demo - EP for the unblack metal band Vaakevandring . In the 2000s , Aarstad had been the pianist for the band Enthral , but left his regular position during the recording of the band 's third album . - Dimmu Borgir (or or ) is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1993. The name is derived from Dimmuborgir, a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means \\"dark cities\\" or \\"dark castles/fortresses\\" in Icelandic, Faroese and Old Norse. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; guitarist Silenoz and vocalist Shagrath are the only original members who still remain with guitarist Galder being a longstanding member. - Jack the Ripper is the best known name given to an unidentified serial killer generally believed to have been active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888. The name \\"Jack the Ripper\\" originated in a letter written by someone claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers' circulation. The killer was called \\"the Whitechapel Murderer\\" as well as \\"Leather Apron\\" within the crime case files, as well as in contemporary journalistic accounts. - Whitechapel is a district in the East End of London, England, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Dimmuborgir (\\"dimmu\\" \\"dark\\", \\"borgir\\" \\"cities\\" or \\"forts\\", \\"castles\\"); pronounced ) is a large area of unusually shaped lava fields east of Mývatn in Iceland.

The Bulletin of the Center for Children 's Books remarked that it is \`\` A fast - paced vampire novel '' , while Publishers Weekly has said that \`\` readers will drain ... in one big gulp \`\` . The Bulletin calls it '' a fast - paced vampire novel with an anti-Buffy heroine and a studly vampire who are n't going to let a little thing like death stand between them . \`\` - The vrykolakas (Greek , pronounced ), variant vorvolakas or vourdoulakas, is a harmful undead creature in Greek folklore. It has similarities to many different legendary creatures, but is generally equated with the vampire of the folklore of the neighbouring Slavic countries. While the two are very similar, blood-drinking is only marginally associated with the \\"vrykolakas\\". - Shroud usually refers to an item, such as a cloth, that covers or protects some other object. The term is most often used in reference to \\"burial sheets\\", mound shroud, grave clothes, winding-cloths or winding-sheets, such as the famous Shroud of Turin or \\"Tachrichim\\" (burial shrouds) that Jews are dressed in for burial. Traditionally, mound shrouds are made of white cotton, wool or linen, though any material can be used so long as it is made of natural fibre. Intermixture of two or more such fibres is forbidden, a proscription that ultimately derives from the Torah, \\"viz.\\", Deut. 22:11. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder. - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. - A vampire is a being from folklore who subsists by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Although vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures, the term \\"vampire\\" was not popularized in the West until the early 18th century, after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, although local variants were also known by different names, such as \\"shtriga\\" in Albania, \\"vrykolakas\\" in Greece and \\"strigoi\\" in Romania. This increased level of vampire superstition in Europe led to mass hysteria and in some cases resulted in corpses actually being staked and people being accused of vampirism. - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU. - Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. - Amelia Holt Atwater-Rhodes (born April 16, 1984), known professionally as Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, is an American author of fantasy and young adult literature. - In the Forests of the Night is a vampire novel written by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, and published in 1999. Originally entitled White Wine, she wrote it at the age of thirteen. The book was published on May 11, 1999, about a month after she turned fifteen. It is the first novel in the Den of Shadows. It tells the story of a three-hundred-year-old vampire named Risika and her struggles throughout her life, both before and after she was transformed. The novel is told in first-person narrative by the protagonist, Risika. It was well received by critics. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - The undead are beings in mythology, legend, or fiction that are deceased but behave as if alive. A common example of an undead being is a corpse re-animated by supernatural forces, by the application of the deceased's own life force, or that of another being (such as a demon). The undead may be incorporeal like ghosts, or corporeal like vampires and zombies. The undead are featured in the belief systems of most cultures, and appear in many works of fantasy and horror fiction. The term is also occasionally used for putative non-supernatural cases of re-animation, from early experiments like Robert E. Cornish's to future sciences such as cryonics and chemical brain preservation. What is the relationship between 'demon in my view' and 'den of shadows'? Answer:","completion":"Demon in My View is the follow-up novel to In the Forests of the Night, both written by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. These two novels are part of a larger series called the Den of Shadows. The Den of Shadows series is a collection of young adult vampire novels that revolve around the supernatural, focusing on both the mythical creatures and the human interactions with them. In the Forests of the Night introduces readers to the character Risika, a three-hundred-year-old vampire, and her struggles and experiences throughout her life. The novel is told from Risika's first-person perspective and sets the tone for the rest of the series with its dark, supernatural elements and themes. Demon in My View follows the same supernatural theme but introduces new characters and a different storyline. This novel focuses on Jessica, a teenage girl who writes about a vampire named Aubrey, only to soon discover that her fiction is closer to reality than she initially realized. As the story unfolds, the worlds of the supernatural and the ordinary entwine, creating a thrilling and fast-paced plot. The relationship between Demon in My View and the Den of Shadows series is that they are both novels set in the same universe and explore the intertwined lives of humans and supernatural beings. While each book in the series can be read as a stand-alone story, they share common themes, settings, and occasionally intertwining storylines, which create a distinctive atmosphere and style that has become a hallmark of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's writing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bananas are a nutritious and energy-rich food source for monkeys and many other animals, including humans. When a monkey grabs a banana, it does so primarily to gain the nutrients it needs to maintain its health and well-being. Bananas are an excellent source of carbohydrates, which provide energy for a monkey's daily activities. They also contain a good amount of dietary fiber, which supports the monkey's digestive system and helps maintain regular bowel movements. Moreover, bananas are packed with essential vitamins and minerals. For instance, they are high in vitamins C and B6, which play crucial roles in maintaining a healthy immune system and supporting brain function. They also contain potassium, which helps regulate the balance of fluids within the monkey's body and supports normal muscle and nerve function.

The rise was mainly due to more people identifying as bisexual, the Office for National Statistics said, up from 1.3% in 2014 to 1.8% last year. Rights charity Stonewall said that may in part be a result of more LGB role models in the public eye. It named model and actress Cara Delevigne, boxer Nicola Adams and singer Miley Cyrus among high-profile people to come out as bisexual in recent years. The ONS's sexual identity data comes from its Annual Population Survey. Sexual identity is one part of the concept of \\"sexual orientation\\", which does not necessarily reflect sexual attraction or sexual behaviour, the ONS said. It currently does not measure sexual attraction or sexual behaviour. Other findings showed: Lana Peswani, 24, first had feelings towards women when she was a young child but says she didn't know at the time what they meant. She was bullied in her all-girls secondary school by students who called her a lesbian. However, it was when she was 17 that she heard the term pansexual for the first time and realised it applied to her. Pansexuality is a term used to describe those who can feel an attraction to anyone, regardless of their sex or gender. Miss Peswani, who lives in London, has had relationships with men and women, and said: \\"I feel my attraction to people is quite fluid. \\"I fancy guys, girls and trans people, and I find androgyny attractive. It's more about the person and the energy they give.\\" She added: \\"I think the younger generation are a lot more open. They are aware of things like trans issues. \\"At my school people weren't aware of trans issues at all.\\" A spokeswoman for Stonewall welcomed the figures and said there were now more LGB role models in the media and more open discussions in society about bisexuality. She said: \\"We would hope that individuals who had previously felt pressured to conceal their bi identity now feel safer and more empowered to be open about how they identify. \\"It's a shame the data doesn't account for those who identify outside of the binaries of lesbian, gay and bi, however. \\"We know that many LGBT people prefer not to label their sexual orientation in such a way, and so their input in this research is lost.\\" Some 320,000 are polled each year for the Annual Population Survey, from which individual reports are published throughout the year.

The increase was largely due to more individuals identifying as bisexual, increasing from 1.3% in 2014 to 1.8% the following year. The rise in bisexuality identification has been partly attributed to the increasing presence of LGB figures in public discourse. High-profile personalities such as model-actress Cara Delevigne, professional boxer Nicola Adams, and singer Miley Cyrus, who have publicly identified as bisexual in recent years, are identified by the rights charity Stonewall as the potential role models influencing this trend. The ONS generates these statistics from its Annual Population Survey but clarified that \\"sexual identity\\" is just one facet of sexual orientation, and does not necessarily correspond with sexual attraction or behavior. Currently, the ONS does not record data on sexual attraction or behavior. The report includes a personal account by 24-year-old Lana Peswani who identified as pansexual when she was 17 - a term utilized to describe those who can feel attraction to any person, regardless of their gender or sex. Ms. Peswani, who has had relationships with both men and women, said her attraction was more about the individual and the energy they project, and acknowledged the increased awareness of non-binary identities among newer generations. A representative from Stonewall expressed approval of the increased visibility of LGB figures but criticized limitations in the data, as it failed to account for individuals identifying outside the binaries of lesbian, gay, and bisexual. The data from this survey, which polls some 320,000 people each year, forms part of the reports published annually."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said. Question: \\"What conditions allow women seeking abortions to not undergo this procedure?\\" Answer: \\"Pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct. According to the text, exceptions to undergoing the sonogram procedure before abortion include pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest, or other violations of law."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Information: - Tower defense is a subgenre of real - time strategy video games , where the goal is to stop the enemies from reaching a specific point on the map by building a variety of different towers which shoot at them as they pass .

This is the stylish lounge adjacent to the cozy Jamaican restaurant known as The Breadfruit. I loved the vibe of this place as soon as I walked in the door. Their list of rums is quite impressive so if you are a connoisseur then you simply must go here. They have a menu of fun signature cocktails that were mostly tropical themed... it sort of reminded me of Hula's Modern Tiki Bar in that respect but in this case the rums really are the main focus and any fruit juice or other mixers are meant to enhance and highlight the flavor of the rum itself. The first one I tried was the Spicy Rumtini which was really delicious, though I expected more heat. My husband wanted a Jack and diet coke but was told that they had neither (no whiskey since rums are their thing and they also don't offer soda with artificial sweeteners). However the bartender recommended he try the Tennessee Rum Cider. This drink tasted surprisingly like whiskey but actually is made with a rum called Prichard's Fine (which is made in Tennessee) mixed with an organic apple cider. The second drink that I tried was a Dark and Stormy. I had this drink at Citizen Public House and didn't really care for it but I really enjoyed this one. Now don't get me wrong, I am well aware that CPH mixes up the best cocktails on the planet. But I just happened to like this particular drink here at the Rum Bar better. One of my companions said it was because of the type of rum they use (Goslings). The cocktails were all 8 or 9 and their wines were 10 a glass (but they had Dos Cabezas, yay!) so because of that this would never be someplace I would come drink on a regular basis. Though I certainly don't mind splurging on a premium cocktail every once in a while. I saw they also had a cigar patio so I think this would be the perfect place for a classy bachelor party or b-day.

They also appreciated that the rum was the main focus, and the mixers were meant to enhance the flavor. The review does mention that some drinks were not available, like the Jack and diet coke, but the bartender offered a satisfactory alternative - the Tennessee Rum Cider. The reviewer acknowledges that the prices are higher, making it a place they would not visit regularly but is still open to splurge on premium cocktails occasionally.

Priya The answer is:","completion":"To create a movie plot around the given question and answer, I will first establish the main characters, their backgrounds, the setting, and the central conflict. Then I will develop the story through three acts: setup, confrontation, and resolution. Step 1: Establish main characters, backgrounds, and setting - Aman: A charismatic young man, secretly in love with Naina. - Naina: Intelligent and ambitious, Aman's best friend since childhood. - Priya: A popular and attractive woman, who Aman claims to be married to. The story takes place in a picturesque small town, where everyone knows each other. Step 2: Setup The movie starts with a montage of Aman and Naina growing up together, going to school, spending time with their families, and eventually working in the same office. Aman and Naina are inseparable, but Aman has always had feelings for Naina. Afraid of jeopardizing their friendship and unsure of Naina's feelings, Aman keeps his feelings a secret. Step 3: Confrontation Naina starts dating a successful and charming man, Ravi, which makes Aman jealous. At a party, when Naina happily announces her engagement to Ravi, Aman impulsively tells everyone that he is married to Priya. Naina is shocked by the revelation, and Aman tries to cover up his lie by involving Priya in his plan. Meanwhile, Aman vows to win Naina back before her wedding to Ravi. Step 4: Complications Aman attempts to sabotage Ravi and Naina's relationship, but his plans only end up revealing his love for Naina. Priya, initially reluctant to be a part of Aman's deception, starts to develop genuine feelings for him, complicating the situation further. Step 5: Climax As the day of Ravi and Naina's wedding approaches, Aman realizes that he must come clean about his feelings. He declares his love for Naina in front of the entire town, admitting that his marriage to Priya was a lie. Naina is overwhelmed with emotions and finally reveals that she has always loved Aman but chose to stay silent to maintain their friendship. Step 6: Resolution Naina and Ravi call off their engagement, and Naina moves forward with Aman. Instead of being heartbroken, Priya is grateful to Aman for helping her understand the importance of honesty and vulnerability in relationships. The movie ends with Aman and Naina starting a new chapter in their lives, promising to be open and honest with each other from now on. In summary, the answer is: Aman claims to be married to Priya in order to hide his feelings for Naina. Through the course of the movie, Aman must confront his fear of vulnerability and risk losing his best friend in order to attain the love he has always desired."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article: Plant circadian rhythms tell the plant what season it is and when to flower for the best chance of attracting pollinators. Behaviors showing rhythms include leaf movement, growth, germination, stomatal/gas exchange, enzyme activity, photosynthetic activity, and fragrance emission, among others. Circadian rhythms occur as a plant entrains to synchronize with the light cycle of its surrounding environment. These rhythms are endogenously generated and self-sustaining and are relatively constant over a range of ambient temperatures. Important features include two interacting transcription-translation feedback loops: proteins containing PAS domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions; and several photoreceptors that fine-tune the clock to different light conditions. Anticipation of changes in the environment allows appropriate changes in a plant's physiological state, conferring an adaptive advantage. A better understanding of plant circadian rhythms has applications in agriculture, such as helping farmers stagger crop harvests to extend crop availability and securing against massive losses due to weather. Now answer this question: What is the plant expression of circadian rhythm?","completion":"The plant expression of circadian rhythm refers to the various physiological and biochemical processes in plants that exhibit a roughly 24-hour cycle. These processes are endogenously controlled and can be entrained by external environmental cues, such as light and temperature. Circadian rhythms in plants play a crucial role in their life cycle, growth, reproduction, and survival, as they enable the plants to anticipate daily and seasonal changes in their environment and optimize their physiological responses accordingly. Key expressions of plant circadian rhythms include: 1. Leaf movement: Many plants exhibit rhythmic leaf movement, such as opening during the day and closing at night, as a response to light and temperature changes. This movement helps maximize photosynthesis and minimize water loss through transpiration. 2. Growth: The growth rate of plants, including stem elongation and root growth, can show daily fluctuations that coincide with the circadian rhythm. This allows plants to allocate resources and adjust their growth patterns based on environmental cues. 3. Germination: Seed germination timing is regulated by the plant's internal clock to ensure the best possible conditions for growth and survival. Certain stages in the germination process have been found to follow a circadian rhythm. 4. Stomatal/gas exchange: Stomata are the tiny pores on plant leaves responsible for gas exchange. Their opening and closing are regulated by the circadian rhythm, helping plants efficiently manage gas exchange, photosynthesis, and water loss throughout the day. 5. Enzyme activity: Many metabolic processes in plants are regulated through the activity of specific enzymes that operate on a circadian schedule. Examples include enzymes involved in photosynthesis, respiration, and nutrient uptake. 6. Photosynthetic activity: The rate of photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, exhibits a daily rhythm influenced by the circadian clock. This rhythm helps plants optimize their energy capture and storage depending on the time of day and the availability of light. 7. Fragrance emission: Some plants emit fragrances in a rhythmic manner that aligns with their circadian clock. This may correlate with the time of day when pollinators, such as insects, are most active, thereby increasing the chance of successful pollination and reproduction. By understanding the plant expression of circadian rhythms, researchers can develop strategies to optimize plant growth, increase agricultural productivity, and improve crop resistance to environmental stressors. This knowledge can help farmers make informed decisions, such as staggering crop harvests, to extend the availability of fresh produce and protect against crop losses due to unfavorable weather conditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The state was down to its last dose of the execution drug last month, but it has managed to obtain several more shots from a compounding pharmacy and will be able to carry out three more scheduled executions this month, San Angelo Live reports. There are at least three more executions scheduled in the state for May and June, reports the AP, and corrections officials say they're looking at other options, including using other drugs or finding fresh sources of pentobarbital. Before he was executed, Sprouse apologized to the victims' families and to his own family \\"for all the trouble I have caused them,\\" WFAA reports. After the execution, the widow of slain officer Marty Steinfeldt issued a statement saying it was the \\"emotional end of a long, excruciating journey.\\" She was pregnant when the 28-year-old officer was killed and gave birth to their daughter several months afterward, reports WFAA. (The American Pharmacists Association has urged members not to sell execution drugs.)","completion":"Once upon a time in Texas, a man named Kent Sprouse did some very wrong things. In 2002, he hurt two people really badly because he was using a not-good thing called meth. He was caught and put in a place called prison. After a long time, the people in charge said it was time for him to go to sleep forever to make things right. They used a special sleep drug called pentobarbital. The people in Texas used to have just a little bit of this drug, but they got more of it to make sure they could make other people go to sleep forever when it's time too. There are more people like Kent who have to go to sleep forever, so the Texas people are making plans to make sure they have enough of the sleep drug. Before Kent went to sleep forever, he said sorry to the families he hurt and to his own family for making them sad. The wife of one of the men Kent hurt said she feels like a big, sad journey is over because of what happened. When her husband went away, she was going to have a baby, and now their little girl is all grown up. There's a group of people who make and sell drugs like these, called the American Pharmacists Association.

Question 1: Why do countries like India and China not take part in the war against ISIS? Step 1: Understand the core issue The user is asking about the reasons for India and China's lack of direct involvement in the war against ISIS. Step 2: Identify the main actors and their stance ISIS, or the Islamic State, has been at the center of an international military coalition composed of Western and Middle Eastern countries. India and China, despite their significant global influence, have not taken part in this military intervention directly. Step 3: Analyze the reasons for their stance There are several reasons for India and China's non-involvement: 1. National priorities: Both countries have different national priorities and security concerns, such as border disputes and domestic terrorism, which may take precedence over joining the military campaign against ISIS. 2. Limited direct threat: While India and China have experienced terrorist attacks from groups affiliated with ISIS, the direct threat from the group's core operations in Iraq and Syria has been comparatively low. 3. Relation with other countries: Both countries maintain complex relationships with regional players involved in the conflict, including Russia, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Direct involvement in the war against ISIS could alter these delicate balances of power and diplomacy. 4. Non-interventionist foreign policies: India and China generally adhere to non-interventionist foreign policies that emphasize supporting diplomatic solutions over military intervention. Question 2: Is Taiwan part of or separate from China? Step 1: Understand the core issue The user is asking about Taiwan's political status and whether it is part of China or a separate entity. Step 2: Identify historical context After the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the Republic of China (ROC) government retreated to Taiwan, while the People's Republic of China (PRC) was established on the Chinese mainland. Step 3: Analyze the current situation Currently, the \\"One China\\" policy emphasizes that there is only one sovereign state named \\"China\\" and that Taiwan is a part of that state. Most countries, including the United States, officially recognize the PRC as the legitimate government of China, although some maintain unofficial relations with Taiwan. Taiwan operates as a separate, democratic political entity with its own government and economy but faces pressure from the PRC to one day reunify under the \\"One China\\" policy. Would the answer to these two questions be the same? No, the answers to these two questions are not the same. The first question concerns the foreign policies and priorities of India and China, specifically their approach to the war against ISIS. The second question is about Taiwan's political status and its relationship with China.

Movie plot title: The Call of Cthulhu Movie plot: The film adheres very closely to Lovecraft's story, but there are a few changes. The sailors aboard the Emma first encounter the Alert abandoned at sea, rather than crewed by Cthulhu cultists and taken over by Emma's crew after a violent confrontation as in the original story. Additionally, the film depicts the narrator present at the time of his great-uncle's death, who dies peacefully in his sleep, rather than being summoned upon the mysterious death of his great-uncle, who was presumably killed by Cthulhu cultists in the original short story. The narrator (Matt Foyer) notes that Inspector Legrasse, who had directed the raid on cultists in backwoods Louisiana, died before the narrator's investigation began. In the original story, the narrator does not seem to end in a lunatic asylum or experience any mysterious nightmares himself.

Build a movie plot around this: What did Barry buy Bryan? horse Answer:","completion":"Title: A Tale of Two Brothers Genre: Adventure, Family, Comedy Plot: Barry Whitmore, a middle-aged man living in a small suburban town, struggles to make ends meet as a horse trainer. He's well-known and respected among the locals but faces financial hardships every day. On the other hand, his younger brother, Bryan Whitmore, is an immensely successful businessman living in the city. As Bryan's 40th birthday approaches, Barry decides to surprise him with an extraordinary gift: a beautiful and rare horse, Balthazar. Unknown to both of them, Balthazar carries an outstanding lineage and is the last of his kind. Balthazar has a natural talent for performing tricks and possesses an incredible bond with anyone that shows him love and care. Upon receiving the gift, Bryan - who had always been a city guy and avoided contact with animals - initially struggles to connect with Balthazar. Barry moves to the city temporarily to teach Bryan how to ride a horse, take care of it, and form a bond. Their tight-knit bond brings the brothers closer than ever before, and they embark on a series of exciting escapades on horseback, rekindling their long-lost sense of adventure. As they do, their personal growth and new perspectives on life become more and more apparent. News of Balthazar's rare lineage spreads, and soon after, an unscrupulous wealthy collector by the name of Richard Lancaster approaches Bryan with a massive offer to purchase the horse. Bryan initially considers the offer, but after realizing the connection he has formed with Balthazar, he declines and ends up in conflict with Lancaster. Lancaster's obsession with Balthazar intensifies, and he hires a group of crooks to steal the horse. As the brothers learn about Lancaster's scheme, they team up to form an implausible and hilarious plan to protect Balthazar. With wit and courage, they outsmart Lancaster and his thugs, exposing them to the authorities. The heartfelt adventure brings the brothers even closer together, as they come to realize the importance of family, love, and finding true happiness beyond worldly possessions they initially sought. The movie ends with a heartwarming scene where Bryan, grateful for his brother's thoughtful gift, decides to turn his life around. He leaves the city and moves back to their hometown, where he and Barry join forces as horse trainers and business partners, preserving Balthazar's lineage and spreading the magic and love of horses to the community."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: The Russian Revolution is the series of revolutions in Russia in 1917, which destroyed the Tsarist autocracy and led to the creation of the Soviet Union. Following the abdication of Nicholas II of Russia, the Russian Provisional Government was established. In October 1917, a red faction revolution occurred in which the Red Guard, armed groups of workers and deserting soldiers directed by the Bolshevik Party, seized control of Saint Petersburg (then known as Petrograd) and began an immediate armed takeover of cities and villages throughout the former Russian Empire.

Both sentences essentially convey the same information, although they differ slightly in the wording and presentation. Here's a detailed breakdown of both sentences: 1. The Intel C++ Compiler for Platform Builder for Microsoft .NET is available for the suggested list price of 1,499 and is intended for OEM and system integrator use. In this sentence, the subject is the Intel C++ Compiler, specifically the version designed with Platform Builder for Microsoft .NET in mind. This sentence explicitly states that the suggested list price for the compiler is 1,499. The intended audience for this compiler is listed as Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and system integrators, indicating that this product is geared towards professionals who design, develop, and implement systems. 2. The Intel C++ Compiler for Platform Builder for Microsoft Windows CE.Net is available for 1,499 and is intended for use by device manufacturers and systems integrators. Similarly, the second sentence also focuses on the Intel C++ Compiler, this time mentioning the Microsoft Windows CE.Net platform. It provides the same price of 1,499 and targets a similar audience, consisting of device manufacturers and systems integrators. Device manufacturers are a category that encompasses OEMs because they are responsible for producing hardware components and devices. Consequently, the target audience implicitly includes OEMs despite not being explicitly mentioned. In summary, both sentences discuss the Intel C++ Compiler for specific Microsoft platforms, with the same price tag of 1,499. Additionally, both sentences highlight that the compiler is intended for industry professionals such as device manufacturers, OEMs, and systems integrators, who are responsible for creating, implementing, and operating complex systems.

This article: Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the march that Kevin Maguire calls, \\"a heroic failure\\"?, what is it ?

This event took place in 1936, when around 200 unemployed workers marched from Jarrow to London to raise awareness about the dire unemployment and poverty situation in their town, with the hope of creating job opportunities. The marchers sought the support of the British government to revive the local economy and reduce unemployment, but despite their efforts, the immediate impact was limited, leading to it being described as a \\"heroic failure.\\" However, the march played a significant role in shaping public opinion and eventually contributed to social reforms after the Second World War."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Copeland has stated that he has never met, nor ever seen a picture of, his father. He became interested in professional wrestling at a young age; his favorite wrestlers included Mr. Perfect, Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, Shawn Michaels, and Bret Hart. As a teenager, Copeland attended WrestleMania VI sitting in the eleventh row at ringside. Copeland resides in Asheville, North Carolina. Copeland used to play hockey with retired National Hockey League (NHL) player Aaron Downey. He is a fan of the NHL's Toronto Maple Leafs and New Jersey Devils. He is close friends with fellow wrestler Jason Reso, otherwise known as Christian. Copeland has several tattoos: a red and black sun on his left upper biceps, which covers a tattoo of a muscular shark which resembled the Street Sharks; a star on his right upper biceps with several smaller stars and two skulls wearing bandanas, adorned with flowers and hearts, below said star tattoo; a tattoo of a cross on his left forearm; and another tattoo of a scroll like piece of paper adorned with the words \\"Rise Above\\". All of Copeland's tattoos represent a stage in his career. His sun, which Copeland got while recovering from his neck injury, represents \\"looking towards brighter days.\\" The cross tattoo represents his time with the Brood, and his star and skull tattoos represent his Rated-R Superstar persona and his self-proclaimed status as the \\"Guns N' Roses of wrestling\\". In March 2007, Copeland became a key figure in an alleged steroid ring and drug investigation. On March 19, Sports Illustrated posted an article on its website in its continuing series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Copeland, who was alleged to have obtained HGH. Copeland has previously admitted to using steroids in April 2004 after neck surgery as an experiment on TSN's Off The Record with Michael Landsberg in January 2005. He said, he felt it slowed him down, so he quickly got off the substance. According to Copeland, he took HGH after returning from a spinal fusion neck surgery. He was told by doctors that it would help the bones grow back around the screws and plate that were inserted into his neck. He claims to have taken blood tests, consulted doctors, studied the drug, and got prescriptions before deciding to take them. According to a Sports Illustrated article rotated on August 30, 2007, Copeland was named one of ten wrestlers found to have purchased steroids and other drugs from an online pharmacy, a violation of the WWE Talent Wellness program. Copeland was said to have received somatropin, genotropin, and stanozolol between September 2004 and February 2007. In 1998, Copeland began a relationship with Alannah Morley, the sister of Sean Morley (aka Val Venis), and they married on November 8, 2001. They divorced a few years later on March 10, 2004. His second marriage was to Lisa Ortiz on October 21, 2004. Soon after his second marriage, Copeland started an affair with Amy Dumas (aka Lita), and their relationship became public knowledge in February 2005, resulting in Copeland's divorce from Ortiz on November 17, 2005. On December 12, 2013, Copeland and former WWE wrestler Beth Phoenix had a daughter, and named her Lyric Rose Copeland. On May 31, 2016, their second daughter was born; they named her Ruby Ever Copeland. Copeland and Phoenix married on October 30, 2016, which was Copeland's 43rd birthday.

Paragraph: For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks. Question: \\"What part of Portugal is not representative of the country's \\"quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces?\\"\\" Answer: \\"North Africa\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: pick from the following.

Write a title: India #39;s ruling Congress party, flush with an election win in the state that is the heart of finance and film, will now be better armed to deal with demanding communist allies, newspapers and analysts said on Sunday.","completion":"Title: \\"India's Congress Party Bolsters Power: Triumph in Financial and Cinematic Hub Empowers Negotiations with Communist Allies\\" The recent electoral victory of India's ruling Congress party in the key state for finance and film industries has not only provided a morale boost for the party but also fortified its presence in negotiations with communist allies. As the newspapers and political analysts on Sunday reported, this victory is expected to have far-reaching consequences in shaping the country's political dynamics. To understand the significance of this win, it is essential to examine the diverse political landscape of India and the role of various political entities. The Congress party, known for its secular, centrist approach, has had to rely on alliances to form and maintain a stable government throughout the years. One such crucial alliance is with the Left Front, comprising several communist parties that advocate for socialism and workers' rights. These parties are often known for their stringent demands and unbending positions on labor issues, foreign policy, and economic reforms. The recent victory of Congress in the state that houses India's financial nerve center and thriving film industry has undoubtedly enhanced their ability to negotiate and govern autonomously. The financial sector, comprising investment banks, financial services companies, and stock exchanges, is significantly impacted by the country's political stability and economic reforms. As such, the Congress party's win demonstrates its commitment to creating a business-friendly environment that fosters growth and investment. Similarly, the film industry holds immense significance in Indian society, spanning regional, linguistic, and cultural spectrums. With this victory, Congress has positioned itself as a supporter of the diverse creative talents and, in turn, garnered favor from various segments of the population. The party's triumph also sends a message of unity and inclusivity, affirming its presence as a responsible and powerful political player in the Indian political arena. As Congress gains momentum, its existing alliance with the left-wing parties will inevitably be affected. With increased credibility and a fortified mandate, the Congress party will likely be more assertive in its stance on key policy issues. Consequently, this could diminish the sway of the communists on policy and force them to re-evaluate their role and expectations within the alliance. As noted by political analysts, the win will likely have a domino effect, with the Congress party's growing stature significantly impacting decisions and negotiations. Though the communist parties have traditionally held considerable influence, Congress's newfound victory might encourage them to adopt a more pragmatic approach to ensure their continued relevance in the political scene. It could prompt them to engage in constructive dialogues and make compromises for the greater good of the nation. While it remains uncertain as to how these dynamics will evolve, there is no doubt that the Congress party's electoral win has sent a strong message. In conclusion, the Congress party's recent victory in the vital financial and cinematic state has fueled its growing influence, equipping it with the ability to challenge and negotiate with its communist allies confidently. Consequently, this will likely reshape India's political landscape by redefining the power dynamics within the ruling alliance, prompting both the Congress party and communist parties to adapt to the new reality. As the significance of this historical win gradually unfolds, it will invariably impact the financial, film, and various other sectors, ultimately shaping India's path to progress and inclusive development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system.

Given the question: David wants to categorize animals according to the sound waves they can hear. Eventually, he was able to categorize them in three different groups, group A, group B, and group C. He placed the animals that can only hear ifrasound in group A. Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound. He placed them in group C. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would group B able to hear higher or lower frequency than group A? Hint: The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz. The answer is:","completion":"Group B would be able to hear higher frequency than group A. This is because group A animals can only hear infrasound, which have frequencies below 20 Hz. Group B animals can hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do, which is between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Since the lower limit of group B's hearing range (20 Hz) is higher than the frequencies that group A can hear (below 20 Hz), group B is able to hear higher frequencies compared to group A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact: if a population decreases to zero then that organism is extinct Question: As bad water increases in an environment the number of aquatic animals such as zooplankton will What's the answer? Select from the following. a. face extinction b. stagnate c. grow d. hibernate","completion":"Answer: a. face extinction As the quality of water in an environment deteriorates, the number of aquatic animals, such as zooplankton, will face extinction. This is because bad water, characterized by high levels of pollution, low dissolved oxygen, and detrimental changes in water chemistry, poses significant challenges to the survival of these organisms. First, polluted water contains various contaminants, including toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and microplastics, which can adversely affect the health and reproductive capacity of aquatic animals. For instance, the bioaccumulation of pollutants in zooplankton can lead to physiological and reproductive disorders, which ultimately disrupt their population dynamics. Second, the decrease in dissolved oxygen levels due to organic pollutant decomposition and eutrophication (an excessive growth of algae due to high nutrient concentrations) can result in oxygen-depleted zones, or \\"dead zones,\\" where aquatic life struggles to survive. Zooplankton, like most aquatic organisms, rely on dissolved oxygen for their respiration. Consequently, these dead zones lead to increased mortality rates and decreased reproduction in zooplankton populations. Lastly, changes in water chemistry, such as alterations in acidity, salinity, or temperature, can further stress aquatic animals, making them more susceptible to diseases, parasites, and other environmental pressures. These changes can also affect the distribution, abundance, and diversity of zooplankton in various aquatic ecosystems, as they may alter the availability of their food sources or trigger behavioural changes. In conclusion, as bad water increases in an environment, the number of aquatic animals such as zooplankton will face extinction. The decline or disappearance of these organisms can have cascading effects on the entire aquatic ecosystem, as zooplankton play a crucial role in the food webs, serving as a primary food source for various marine species, and contribute to nutrient cycling. Therefore, it is essential to mitigate water pollution and monitor water quality to safeguard the health and survival of these valuable and fundamental organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years.

What does the speaker 's mother mean when she says not to let it live in your head ?","completion":"When the speaker's mother says \\"not to let it live in your head,\\" she implies that one should not dwell on negative thoughts, feelings, or experiences. Holding onto past mistakes, criticisms, or adverse events can create a constant stream of negativity in one's mind, adversely affecting one's mental and emotional well-being. The phrase conveys the importance of acknowledging and learning from setbacks, but not letting them consume one's thoughts and dictate one's actions. By not letting negative events, self-destructive thoughts, or the opinions of others occupy your mind, you can maintain a healthier, more balanced mental state, fostering resilience and better emotional wellbeing. In this context, the speaker reflects on acknowledging their own mistakes and approaching the situation maturely. They appreciate how their daughter was raised to be a mature person who can handle bad situations with grace. The mother's advice serves as a reminder to effectively deal with and learn from one's shortcomings, but not to allow these setbacks to continually affect their thoughts and emotions. To practice not letting things live in your head, apply various techniques such as mindfulness, acceptance, acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes, practicing self-compassion, and focusing on self-improvement. By doing so, you are more likely to maintain a positive outlook on life, allowing you to enjoy a sense of inner peace even when faced with challenging situations. In other words, it's essential to grow and learn from experiences, but do not let these experiences dominate your thoughts or hinder your future progress, possibilities, and happiness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Who are some lesser known important historical figures of India and what should people know about them? Possible answers: 1. no; 2. yes;","completion":"1. No These questions do not have the same meaning as they are asking about important historical figures from two different countries, Guyana and India. While the structure of both questions is similar – they both inquire about lesser-known figures and what people should know about them – their focus is distinct, with one question concentrating on Guyana and the other on India. Below are brief descriptions of a few lesser-known historical figures from each country to demonstrate the differences in their historical and cultural significance. Guyana: a) Hubert Nathaniel Critchlow (1884-1958): Known as the 'Father of Trade Unionism' in Guyana, he established the British Guiana Labour Union in 1919. Under his leadership, it became the first labor union in the country, fighting for workers' rights, higher wages, and better working conditions. b) Cuffy (18th century): Also referred to as Kofi, he was an enslaved African man who led a major uprising against slave oppression in the Dutch colony of Berbice, present-day Guyana, in 1763. His rebellion stands as a symbol of Guyanese resistance to enslavement and oppression. c) Janet Jagan (1920-2009): She was an American-born social and political activist who became the first female President of Guyana in 1997. Alongside political activism, she worked to improve healthcare, education, and social welfare in the country. India: a) Rani Velu Nachiyar (1730-1796): She was the first female Indian queen to wage war against the British East India Company. After her husband's death, she organized a successful resistance against British occupation and later formed an alliance with the Maratha Empire. b) Tantia Tope (1814-1859): A prominent leader during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (First War of Indian Independence), Tantia Tope conspired against British colonial rule and aided Rani Lakshmibai in defending Jhansi. He was eventually captured and executed by the British. c) Begum Hazrat Mahal (1820-1879): The queen of Awadh, she played a decisive role in the First War of Indian Independence (1857-1858). Following the exile of her husband, she took over as the ruler of Awadh, forming alliances with other resistance movements, and played a crucial role in organizing a well-orchestrated rebellion against the British. In summary, these questions focus on two different countries with unique cultural and historical contexts.

Errol Louis: Mario Cuomo's death a reminder of when a strong liberal mulled presidential run. He says Cuomo's son, N.Y.'s governor, also eyes presidency. Can liberalism make comeback? Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Mario Cuomo's Legacy and the Potential Resurgence of Liberalism in U.S. Politics Introduction: The recent death of former New York Governor Mario Cuomo has brought back memories of a time when a strong liberal almost made a run for the U.S. presidency. As his son, current New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, is speculated to be eyeing a future presidential bid, it is time to consider if liberalism can make a comeback in today's political landscape. Step 1: Reflect on Mario Cuomo's political career and ideology Mario Cuomo, who served as the 52nd governor of New York from 1983 to 1994, championed liberal values and solidified the Democratic party's progressive base. Throughout his tenure, Cuomo prioritized issues like income inequality, education reform, and social justice. He was a staunch advocate for civil rights, specifically for women, minorities, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Step 2: Analyze Cuomo's decision not to run for the presidency Despite his popularity and significant support within the Democratic party, Mario Cuomo decided against running for president in 1992. In the end, Bill Clinton secured the Democratic nomination and went on to win the presidency. Cuomo's reluctance to run raised questions about the viability of strong liberal candidates in national elections, a debate that still echoes today. Step 3: Explore Andrew Cuomo's political career and aspirations Fast forward to the present day, and Mario Cuomo's son, Governor Andrew Cuomo, faces similar speculation about a possible presidential bid. As the 56th governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo has continued to advocate for progressive policies, such as gun control, LGBTQ+ rights, and climate change. If he were to run for office, whether in 2024 or later, he would face tough questions about his father's legacy and what it means for the modern Democratic party. Step 4: Examine the current state of U.S. politics and liberalism The current political climate in the United States is increasingly polarized, with many voters identifying as either staunchly conservative or heavily progressive. Moderate voices often struggle to gain traction in this environment. The resurgence of strong liberal ideas, such as healthcare reform, wealth redistribution, and social justice, is often met with resistance from conservative counterparts. Step 5: Evaluate the potential for liberalism to make a comeback Given the recent resurgence of progressive movements and policymaking, such as the Green New Deal, Marriage Equality Act, and Black Lives Matter, it appears that liberalism is making a slow but steady comeback. If Andrew Cuomo or other strong liberal candidates, potentially like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Elizabeth Warren, were to run for the presidency and secure popular support, it is possible that the return of liberal politics could become a reality. Conclusion: Mario Cuomo's death is a reminder of a time when a strong liberal voice could have made a substantial impact on the national stage. As his son, Governor Andrew Cuomo, potentially considers a presidential bid, the question arises of whether or not liberal ideas can regain prominence in U.S. politics. The answer, while not certain, will undoubtedly have a profound effect on the future of American political discourse and policymaking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In this context, it is used as a prefix for the compound word. 2. \\"Non-proliferation\\" can be translated to \\"leviämisen estäminen,\\" which literally means \\"preventing the spread.\\" 3. \\"And\\" in Finnish can be translated to \\"ja.\\" 4. \\"Disarmament\\" refers to \\"aseistariisunta\\" in Finnish. It means the act of reducing, limiting, or abolishing weapons. 5. \\"Vote\\" in Finnish is \\"äänestys,\\" which refers to the act of voting or a particular instance of voting. Hence, \\"Ydinaseiden leviämisen estäminen ja aseistariisunta (äänestys)\\" is a phrase that you can use to discuss nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament voting in Finland. Moreover, Finnish society is known for its focus on peace and neutrality, especially when it comes to international political matters. As a result, the topic of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament may have particular importance in the Finnish context. Finnish authorities actively engage in international discussions of this matter and support initiatives aimed at promoting disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Some of Finland's key actions in this area include participating in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and supporting the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).

Article: FILE - In this file photo dated Sunday Dec. 4, 2016, British actress Jodie Whittaker poses for photographers upon arrival at the The British Independent Film Awards in London. The BBC has announced Sunday... (Associated Press) LONDON (AP) — British actress Jodie Whittaker was announced Sunday as the next star of the long-running science fiction series \\"Doctor Who\\" — the first woman to take a role that has been played by a dozen men over six decades. Whittaker, best known for playing the mother of a murdered boy in detective drama \\"Broadchurch,\\" will replace Scottish actor Peter Capaldi at the end of the year, the BBC said. Whittaker is the 13th official incarnation of the Doctor, a galaxy-hopping Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in the Tardis, a time machine shaped like an old-fashioned British police telephone booth. In a testament to the place \\"Doctor Who\\" holds in Britain's cultural life, the revelation was made on live television after the Wimbledon men's tennis final. A film clip showed a mysterious hooded figure — revealed to be Whittaker — walking through the woods. \\"Doctor Who\\" ran from 1963 to 1989, and was revived to acclaim in 2005. Its longevity is partly due to its flexible premise. The central character, known only as the Doctor, can travel across space and time and can regenerate into new bodies — allowing for endless recasting of the role. Speculation had been mounting that a woman would get the role, generating excitement from some fans and opposition from others who feel that the character has been established as male.

Question: Given the background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. and the situation: Two meteorologists were good friends and discussed diverse issues weekly. This week they will talk again. Tim read about the Greenhouse Effect while Norm read about the mini-Ice ages. Answer the following question: Which friend learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background and situation, Norm, who read about mini-Ice ages, learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing compared to Tim, who read about the Greenhouse Effect. The Greenhouse Effect primarily focuses on the role of greenhouse gases in increasing trapped terrestrial radiation. As stated in the background information, the presence of greenhouse gases leads to the absorption of longer infrared wavelengths, resulting in the retention of solar heat. This process directly contributes to the increase in the Earth's global temperature. Since Tim chose to read about the Greenhouse Effect, he gained a better understanding of how trapped terrestrial radiation increases due to the presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and consequently impacts the Earth's temperature. On the other hand, Norm read about mini-Ice ages, which could provide insights into historical climate changes, temperature fluctuations, and the role of various factors that led to cold periods on Earth. While learning about mini-Ice ages might indirectly touch upon aspects of trapped terrestrial radiation, it would not provide the same level of focus on the increase in trapped terrestrial radiation as the Greenhouse Effect study would. Therefore, when comparing the topics of their individual readings, it is safe to conclude that Norm learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing compared to Tim."},{"prompt":"Q:I have a new situation: Rob is an amateur astronomer. Recently, he detected four asteroids, asteroid A, asteroid B, asteroid C, and asteroid D. Asteroid A and asteroid B are of the same mass, but asteroid A is farther from the earth than asteroid B. Asteroid C and asteroid D are at the same distance form the earth, but asteroid C has more mass than asteroid D. He also figured out that all of these asteroids have less mass than earth. But I can use this background: The classical explanation of gravity is that a force of attraction acts at a distance between two objects and the magnitude of the force is directly proportional to each of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. The objects move toward each other due to this force of attraction. Einstein’s new concept of gravity states that matter (mass) causes the space around the matter to curve and also distorts time. A straight line through this curved space would also be curved in order to be a straight line. What is an answer for this question: In clssical theory, if Rob needs to find out the object with stronger gravitational pull, which one would he choose, earth or asteroid A? A:","completion":"In classical theory, Rob would choose Earth as the object with a stronger gravitational pull.

Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The data provided pertains to Al Asad Airbase and the United States Air Force's (USAF) involvement in various military operations, as well as the usage of specific attack aircraft. In this detailed description, we will analyze the operational organization at Al Asad Airbase, the key historical events where the USAF has participated, and the role of the Lockheed AC-130 attack aircraft in these events. Al Asad Airbase is a significant military installation, primarily operated by the United States Air Force. This airbase has played a crucial role in different military operations and has served as a base for various kinds of aircraft. The USAF has a strong presence at this airbase, which has enabled it to carry out its missions efficiently and effectively. With state-of-the-art facilities and infrastructure, Al Asad Airbase stands as a symbol of the USAF's capabilities. The USAF has been involved in many military campaigns throughout history, both to protect national interests and to support allied forces. Some of these battles have been international incidents, while others have been wars fought in various countries. One such notable battle was the Invasion of Grenada, which took place in 1983. This intervention was initiated by the United States and its Caribbean allies to overthrow the military government that had seized power in Grenada. The USAF played a crucial role in the successful operation, providing air support and transportation to the military troops involved. The campaign lasted a few days and resulted in the restoration of democratic governance in Grenada. Another key event in the USAF's history was the 1986 United States bombing of Libya, also known as Operation El Dorado Canyon. This military action was a direct response to the terrorist bombing of a West Berlin nightclub carried out by Libyan agents, which killed multiple American servicemen. The USAF conducted airstrikes against strategic targets in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, as well as the city of Benghazi. These attacks were aimed at crippling the Libyan regime's terrorist capabilities and demonstrating the United States' commitment to combating terrorism. In both of these events, the USAF utilized a variety of aircraft to carry out its missions, including the Lockheed AC-130. This attack aircraft is a heavily armed, long-endurance aircraft designed for ground-attack missions, close air support, and aerial reconnaissance. Equipped with powerful weapons and surveillance systems, the AC-130 can engage ground targets accurately and effectively, making it a valuable asset for the USAF in its operations.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? microscope Choices: [i] can diagnose disease caused by carbon dioxide ; [ii] can diagnose disease caused by virus ;","completion":"In order to accomplish the goal of using a microscope to diagnose diseases caused by either carbon dioxide or viruses, one has to understand the basic principles of microscopy and be familiar with the specific techniques and procedures involved in diagnosing each type of disease. Microscopes are vital instruments utilized in various scientific and medical disciplines to visualize tiny objects, like cells and microorganisms, which cannot be seen with the naked eye. Here are the detailed approaches for both options: Option i: Diagnose disease caused by carbon dioxide Diagnosing a disease caused by carbon dioxide exposure typically involves detection of the harmful effects of the gas on human health rather than observing the gas itself under the microscope. Carbon dioxide, as a gas, cannot be directly observed under a microscope. However, the detrimental effects of carbon dioxide on human tissues and cells can be viewed microscopically. 1. Identify the signs and symptoms: In order to diagnose carbon dioxide-related diseases, you should be aware of the potential symptoms associated with carbon dioxide exposure, such as respiratory distress, rapid breathing, increased heart rate, headaches, dizziness, and confusion. 2. Obtain samples: If carbon dioxide poisoning or exposure is suspected, samples should be collected from the patient, mostly blood samples or tissue biopsies, depending on the severity and type of exposure. 3. Prepare samples for microscopy: The collected samples must be processed and prepared for microscopic examination. Blood samples should be smeared on glass slides, while tissue samples should undergo fixation, embedding, and sectioning to produce thin slices for microscopic viewing. 4. Stain the samples: Appropriate staining techniques, such as using specific dyes or stains, must be employed to highlight any changes or damage caused by excessive carbon dioxide exposure on the examined cells or tissues. 5. Use appropriate microscope settings: Utilize a light or fluorescent microscope to view the stained samples. Adjust the magnification, light intensity, and focus to get the best possible view. 6. Analyze the microscopic findings: Identify and document any abnormalities observed in the samples. Look for indicators such as cellular alterations, inflammation, or tissue damage caused by excessive carbon dioxide exposure. 7. Collaborate with other diagnostic methods: Combine the findings from microscopy with other diagnostic tests like blood gas analysis and physical examination to confirm the diagnosis. Option ii: Diagnose disease caused by viruses In order to diagnose a viral infection, a microscope can be used to visualize the presence of viruses either directly or indirectly through detecting the specific effects they cause on the cells or tissues. 1. Collect samples: To diagnose a viral infection, samples like blood, saliva, urine, or tissue biopsies might be collected, depending on the type of virus and the infected organ or tissue. 2. Use viral isolation and culture: To study the virus, it can be isolated from the collected samples and cultured in appropriate cell lines or laboratory animals. This helps in obtaining a concentrated viral sample for further examination. 3. Apply appropriate staining techniques: Viral particles can be stained using specific dyes, fluorescent tags, or labeled antibodies targeting specific viral antigens. 4. Electron microscopy: Since viruses are extremely small, they cannot be observed under regular light microscopes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is the most commonly used technique to visualize viruses directly, providing higher magnification and resolution. 5. Detect viral effects on cells and tissues: Alternatively, light or fluorescent microscopy can be used to observe the cytopathic effects produced by viruses on infected cells or tissues. For instance, the formation of syncytia or inclusion bodies can indicate viral infection. 6. Immunofluorescence and other indirect techniques: Indirect methods like immunofluorescence microscopy can be employed, where specific antibodies tagged with fluorescent dyes are utilized to detect the presence of viral antigens within the cells or tissues. 7. Interpret the findings and collaborate with other diagnostic methods: Analyze the gathered microscopic evidence to determine if the virus is present in the samples. Combine these findings with other diagnostic tests, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), serological assays, and patient history, for a comprehensive diagnosis. In summary, depending on the goal, different microscopy techniques and approaches can be used to diagnose diseases caused either by carbon dioxide or viruses. A strong understanding of microscopy principles and available diagnostic methods is crucial for effectively accomplishing this goal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Input: The film begins in 2007 with Will Atenton (Daniel Craig) leaving his job as a successful editor in New York in order to spend more time with his wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and their two daughters, and to write his own book. At first, the family appears to be living the American dream in their new home, until they discover that its previous occupants, a mother and her two small daughters, were shot to death in the Atenton home. Public opinion has condemned the father of this family, Peter Ward, as the one responsible. However, there was not enough evidence to convict Peter in court, and he was also deemed mentally unfit to stand trial, and was recently released from police custody, and Will begins to feel he is seeing Peter watching the house.Will visits Greenhaven Psychiatric facility, where Peter was held for five years. Here he learns that on the night of the murders, Peter himself was shot in the head by his wife Elizabeth, who had somehow gotten hold of the murder weapon in the moments just before her death. In recovery, Peter couldnât believe heâd committed the murders, and so he no longer believed he was Peter Ward. He chewed his own name off all of his identification bracelets/cards/tags, leaving only his Greenhaven I.D. sequence: W1 - 1L 8 -10 -10: Will Atenton. Peter Ward and Will Atenton are the same person.Unable to believe this, Will rushes home and we see his home is really run down and condemned. Peter visits his neighbor, Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts). Ann had been a good friend to the Wards, and never believed Peter was the killer. Returning to the house, Peter remembers was on the phone with Libby when she stumbled on a burglar, who shot the little girls and wounded Libby. Peter attacked the gunman and Libby accidentally shot Peter.Ann's ex-husband Jack and the gunman burst into the now-decrepit Ward home. It is revealed that the hit-man had been hired to kill Ann, but broke into the wrong house and chose to kill the witnesses. Jack shoots the hit-man in the abdomen before staging the scene so it will appear that Peter has murdered again before burning the house down. Peter regains consciousness in time to fight off Jack and rescue Ann. As Peter and Ann make it out of the house, Jack starts up the cellar steps but is doused with kerosene by the dying hit-man, and Jack goes up in flames. The house burns to the ground.The film ends with a shot of Peter back in New York City.

At the High Court in London on Tuesday, a lawyer described how Siddiqui's dream of becoming an international commercial lawyer was crushed when a poor grade in the Indian special subject of his modern history course at Oxford University meant that he received a low upper second-class degree in June 2000, rather than a first-class or high upper second, report the BBC and Guardian. (In the UK, degrees are ranked based on a student's average mark.) Siddiqui, 39, who is unemployed, is seeking 1.3 million in lost wages while blaming \\"inadequate\\" teaching \\"in what was anticipated to be his favored special subject,\\" his lawyer says. Oxford acknowledges four of seven staff members who taught Asian history were on sabbatical during the 1999-2000 academic year. But a lawyer for the school—who describes Siddiqui's academic performance as \\"laced with inconsistency,\\" per the Telegraph—says Siddiqui received the same instruction as he would've in any other year. Siddiqui disagrees, claiming 13 of 15 students in the same situation as him received their \\"lowest or joint lowest mark\\" in the special subject. He adds his tutor failed to notify examiners of his health issues; Siddiqui says his clinical depression and insomnia only intensified following his \\"inexplicable failure.\\" A judge is expected to determine liability at the end of a seven-day hearing; the school lost its bid to have the case thrown out in December. A win for Siddiqui \\"could open the floodgates for similar claims,\\" per the Guardian. Expand this summary.","completion":"So, let's imagine you're a kid who just didn't get the score you wanted on your school test. You feel you could have done better if your teacher had been more helpful or if they had known that you were feeling sick that day. Now, think about holding on to that feeling for 17 whole years - that's longer than you've been alive! This is how a man named Faiz Siddiqui feels about a grade he got back in university. Here's what happened: Mr. Siddiqui studied at a very important school called Oxford University in a city named London. It's a big, busy place where lots of people want to learn. And Mr. Siddiqui’s dream was to become an international commercial lawyer. Think of this like being a superhero for businesses. But things did not go the way he wanted. In school, he took a class on modern Indian history which he really loved and thought he would do well in. But, instead of getting a grade called a \\"first-class\\" or a \\"high upper second-class,\\" which are sort of like getting a gold star, he was given a lower second-class degree in June 2000. This is like getting a bronze star, or even no star at all. He wasn't happy about that. And because he was not happy, Mr. Siddiqui, who is now 39 years old and doesn’t have a job, decided to ask the school to give him 1.3 million. That's a big pile of money, like more candy than you could ever eat on Halloween. He believes that he could have earned that money if his grade had been better. He blamed the school’s “inadequate” teaching in the class that was his favourite. Now, let's look at Oxford University’s side. They said that in that school year, four out of seven teachers who taught Asian history were on a break, like your teacher might be during the summer. But, they also said that Mr. Siddiqui was taught in the same way as students in other years. They argued that his marks were not always good, hinting he was a student whose performance often changed. Mr. Siddiqui disagreed. He argued that most students struggled the same way he did, showing that the problem was perhaps with the teaching and not the students. He also added that his sickness - he had trouble sleeping and was always sad - were not taken into account when they graded his paper. He said his health problems only got worse after his surprising result. All these arguments are going to be discussed in a big, important meeting that will last 7 days, where a person called a judge will decide who is correct. This is like when you and a friend argue and your teacher decides who is right. The school tried to stop this meeting from happening last year in December but couldn’t. If Mr. Siddiqui wins, then other students who feel they were treated unfairly may also want to sue their schools. This means that this case could lead to a lot more people asking their schools for piles of candy. So, this is pretty important and lots of people are watching to see what will happen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Title: After the Sunset Movie plot: Master thief Max Burdett (Pierce Brosnan) and his beautiful accomplice, Lola Cirillo (Salma Hayek), steal the second of three famous diamonds, known as the Napoleon diamonds, from FBI Agent Stanley P. Lloyd (Woody Harrelson). But Lloyd shoots Max before passing out from being gassed by the thieves. Max survives and tells Lola to get the diamond. She does, leaving in its place the one-dollar bill that she had received as a tip for washing the agents' windshield (while in disguise). Max and Lola then fly to Paradise Island in The Bahamas. Agent Lloyd shows up 6 months later and accuses Burdett of planning to steal the third Napoleon diamond, which is on a cruise ship that will be docking for a week on the island. He denies this, and unwittingly turns the tables and befriends the frustrated detective Lloyd, showing him the pleasures that Paradise Island has to offer, even paying for the most expensive suite, the bridge suite, for as long as Lloyd is there. Lloyd, out of his element, adapts quickly to the easy-going Caribbean lifestyle and partners up with Sophia, a local constable, to try and capture Max at last when he steals the diamond, which Max visits and later gives in to the temptation to steal. Henri MoorÃ©, a powerful, popular tycoon thought of by some as a gangster, learns of Burdett's impressive history as a thief and offers him additional island-life benefits and pleasures in return for stealing the diamond. Burdett, still wanting the diamond for himself, pretends to work with MoorÃ©, and gives him a fake plan as to how he would steal the diamond (which he had earlier related to Stan), having no trouble keeping ahead of his nemesis in the meantime. Lola kicks Max out after he breaks his promise to spend their first sunset on her new deck she had been working on and after she finds out he lied about writing his vows to her.

CBC.ca - Arts - Film - M for Muddled I'm not as happy as I look: Hugo Weaving in V for Vendetta. Courtesy Warner Brothers Pictures. V for Vendetta runs for just over two hours, but it feels like 10. Fans of Alan Mooreâs original graphic novel will likely construe this as a good thing. General audiencesâ¦ not so much. The illusory duration of this dystopian saga owes not to the plot, but to the byzantine back story, which is meted out with laborious effort. The place is London, the time a few decades in the future. Britons are under the heel of a totalitarian state. The streets are an Orwellian tableau of loudspeakers, video screens and roaming surveillance trucks. The airwaves are occupied by xenophobic blowhards. A young woman named Evey (Natalie Portman) ventures out one night and is cornered by three âFingermen.â Although officially tasked to enforce the cityâs strict curfew, these gents have something nastier in mind for Evey. Before they can begin their dirty business, Eveyâs would-be assailants are waylaid, Batman-fashion, by a lanky stranger in a creepy white mask. First, he slays them with his alliterative wit (the scene is brought to you by the letter V); then, he just slays them. The sequence is both exhilarating and refreshingly stagy for an action flick. The man introduces himself as V and invites Evey to a rooftop âconcert.â Though puzzled, she accepts â and ends up witnessing the cleverly orchestrated detonation of Londonâs Old Bailey building. Evey is soon forced to take refuge with V when the state police suspect her of being his co-conspirator. Who is this guy? And whatâs with his appetite for destruction? Itâs complicated. (Have you got two hours?) The mask is an ode to proto-terrorist Guy Fawkes. On November 5, 1605, Fawkes, an Englishman infuriated by the Protestant monarchyâs brutal treatment of Catholics, tried to blow up the British Houses of Parliament. He was caught and hanged for his treachery. Vâs beef is more elusive. Whatâs immediately clear, however, is that he harbours a world of resentment and is fomenting a big olâ revolution. In a cunning bait-and-switch manoeuvre, V later commandeers the airwaves of Londonâs biggest news station to outline his plan: in exactly one year, he and an army of like-minded citizens will gather outside Parliament to watch it blow sky-high, thus carrying out Fawkesâ original threat. The plot is set. Now you just have to sit through an hour and a half of narrative backfill. Can't you put on your frowning mask?: Weaving and Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta. Courtesy Warner Brothers Pictures. Alan Mooreâs original comic was a broadside against the Tory government of Margaret Thatcher, which Moore saw as an oppressively dark chapter in English history. Scripted by the Wachowskis (The Matrix) and directed by their protÃ©gÃ©, John McTeigue, the film version is equally polemical. The government is run by a bilious autocrat named Sutler (a splenetic John Hurt); after a U.S.-initiated nuclear holocaust ravaged much of Europe, Sutler staged a fascist coup, quickly establishing a police state that incarcerates minorities and brooks no opposition. That Moore has publicly denounced this adaptation (refusing even to see it) obscures the fact that the film is actually quite faithful to the book. Therein lies the problem. In the movie, as in the comic, the state is responsible for a laundry list of evil deeds: religious intolerance, homophobia, suspension of civil liberties, police brutality, concentration camps, eugenic experimentation, shouting. The Wachowskis seize the opportunity to add some topical updates, railing against right-wing pundits and Big Pharma and visually evoking Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. Alas, the film doesnât conjure evil incarnate; it presents a parody of it. V for Vendetta soon reaches such a hysterical pitch, itâs hard to take it seriously. The film is rescued from its one-dimensionality by the two main characters. V is played by Hugo Weaving (the terse Agent Smith in The Matrix trilogy), who gives us one of cinemaâs most unlikely vigilantes. Weavingâs performance is at once menacing and mincing; his theatricality isnât surprising, one supposes, given that heâs acting through a mask. V spends much of the film murdering a string of government operatives who played some role in his hazy, horrific past â which seems to involve unlawful captivity, torture, first-degree burns and who-knows-what-else. Evey, meanwhile, carries her own baggage: her parents were dissidents murdered in the early days of Sutlerâs reign. While a lesser actress might have remained an uncomprehending bystander, Portman gives it her all, exploring Eveyâs vulnerability, but also her growing discomfort with Vâs reactionary violence. If V for Vendettaâs censure of draconian governments feels somewhat rote, the filmâs exploration of the freedom fighter mindset is a propos and appropriately complex. One of the storyâs key allusions is to that archetypal revenge tale, The Count of Monte Cristo. (Itâs Vâs favourite film.) In it, the protagonist becomes so preoccupied with avenging his betrayal that he ceases to exist as anything more than an agent of ruin. Behind Vâs perpetually smirking mask is a man consumed by rage. Heâs less a man than an ideology â an ideology whose tactics, as Evey quite rightly points out, become increasingly âmonstrous.â As the film lurches to its climax, it becomes clear that, regardless of the outcome, British society will not see closure. There are years of struggle ahead. V for Vendetta seems to suggest that weâre too far along our misguided course for pat solutions. Itâs a powerful notion. Too bad we have to wade through all that dense exposition to get to it. V for Vendetta opens Mar. 17 across Canada. Andre Mayer writes about the arts for CBC.ca.

Sentence from a movie review: so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the given sentence from a movie review, it is evident that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer. The expressions \\"insanely stupid\\" and \\"awful in so many ways\\" clearly demonstrate that the reviewer had an unfavorable opinion of the film. These phrases suggest that the reviewer felt the movie had numerous shortcomings and failed to achieve a level of quality they deemed acceptable. \\"Insanely stupid\\" implies that the film's plot, characters, or general execution was irrational or nonsensical beyond tolerability. This could relate to a myriad of factors such as incoherent or implausible storylines, poorly developed characters, clichéd or hackneyed themes, or even subpar production values. Overall, this phrase reveals that the reviewer found the movie lacking in one or more vital aspects that constitute a good film. The additional statement \\"awful in so many ways\\" serves to emphasize just how negative the reviewer's experience of watching the movie was. This remark suggests that there were multiple aspects of the film that the reviewer considered terrible. It is possible that they found the movie to be appalling on various levels, such as the script, acting, direction, cinematography, or music. This further strengthens the case for a decidedly negative stance on the movie. In summary, the sentence from the movie review paints a decidedly negative picture of the film. The reviewer's choice of words like \\"insanely stupid\\" and \\"awful in so many ways\\" reflects their dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of the movie.

(CNN) -- Former captain Ricky Ponting insists he can still be a key player for Australia after becoming the third cricketer to score 13,000 Test runs on the opening day of the fourth and final match against India. Doubts were raised about Ponting's international future when he stood down as skipper early last year, but the 37-year-old has now scored two centuries in this series after a barren run with the bat.

Answer:","completion":"To win the Stanley Cup, a team must triumph in the best-of-seven playoff series that takes place at the end of the NHL (National Hockey League) season, in the Stanley Cup Finals. This means that a team must secure at least four victories out of a maximum of seven possible games to be crowned the champions and etch their names on the prestigious trophy. The NHL playoff structure consists of four rounds, each featuring a best-of-seven series. The first three rounds determine the Conference champions from the Eastern and Western Conferences, while the final round, known as the Stanley Cup Finals, pits the two Conference champions against each other for the ultimate prize. Here's a breakdown of the path to the Stanley Cup: 1. Round One: Known as the \\"Division Semifinals,\\" eight teams in both the Eastern and Western Conferences compete, with the top team in each division facing the fourth-seeded team, and the second-seeded team taking on the third-seeded team. The winners of these series move on to the next round. 2. Round Two: Called the \\"Division Finals,\\" the advancing teams within each division face off in another best-of-seven series. The winners of this round become the Division champions and advance to the Conference Finals. 3. Round Three: Also known as the \\"Conference Finals,\\" the victorious Division champions in each Conference compete in a best-of-seven series to secure the Conference titles — the Prince of Wales Trophy for the Eastern Conference, and the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl for the Western Conference. 4. Round Four: The \\"Stanley Cup Finals\\" features the winners of the Conference Finals from both the Eastern and Western Conferences. In this final best-of-seven series, the team that clinches four victories first is crowned the Stanley Cup Champion. Throughout the Stanley Cup playoffs, teams must demonstrate resilience, skill, and determination over a potential maximum of 28 games if they play seven games in each of the four rounds.

CNN: Before Bo Xilai's trial, many commentators predicted it would follow a tight script but that doesn't appear to be the case. What has been the most surprising twist? Cheng Li: There were two surprises. One is that Bo has rejected all allegations so far, and said he \\"unwillingly\\" accepted the charge when he was being questioned by the central disciplinary commission investigation team. The second surprise is that the prosecution has performed very poorly in trying to make a strong case against him; it seems to be falling apart. All of a sudden, in my view, Bo has decided not to cooperate, but not completely. Because he did not go too far to condemn other leaders or reveal some other problems; this is probably what worried some of the leadership the most. CNN: Did Bo and his legal team wrong-foot the leadership? Li: Bo as a person, as a leader, is unpredictable. If you reviewed his career he always surprised people. He has always played the wildcard. It will be the authorities' problem if they didn't prepare for that. When you have a semi-open trial you need to prepare. There's a lot of praise in Chinese social media for the judge for his professional manner, but the prosecutors are terrible. Bo has rejected virtually everything in a very effective way. But that means even the leadership can't rely too much on the promises or deals made by Bo. CNN: Do you think a deal was done before the trial and does that appear to be unraveling? Li: Of course there would have been deals made before, otherwise the leadership would not be willing to pursue the charges. The deal is they dropped some of the most severe charges against him. If you look at September 28 when they arrested him and expelled him from the Communist Party -- there were about six or seven charges, including obstruction of justice and womanizing and, probably most importantly, during the investigation of the murder of Neil Heywood they allegedly found some other criminal activities. In July, they put forward only three charges: Bribery, corruption and abuse of power. CNN: What's the problem for the leadership strategy to focus on corruption? Bo was the wrong person to focus on corruption because he was famous for being anti-corruption during his tenure in Chongqing. And relatively speaking, at least in people's perception, he's not that corrupted. He made a lot of people nervous about his self-promotion campaign -- that's the real reason, not about corruption. Bo Xilai's real ambition is not about the money. He wants to be a top leader, or the top leader. By that time the whole country would be his. That's the fundamental dilemma for the leadership. Now the leadership is in an awkward position -- the charges of corruption will not resonate too well and they can't go back to the other charges. So what kind of verdict will they give him? Certainly it will not be too severe. If it's too lenient they'll receive other serious criticism so it's really a no-win situation for the leadership. CNN: What do you think the reaction will be in the leadership after this \\"change of script\\"? Li: If you follow the reaction in China most people think that Bo did well, including people who really do not like him. In my view he was clear, focused, articulate and eloquent. Some people who previously really hated him now tend to forget all the awful things he allegedly did. I think the authorities' case is not in good shape on day one. CNN: Has the leadership's tactic backfired? Could Bo have gained more support than he's lost in the past 24 hours? Li: Absolutely. There are a lot of rumors that he was very emotional and out of control in jail. But he presented himself very well. He was very respectful, reasonable, had a human touch, he cared about Dalian, he cared about its people. He claimed he was betrayed by some bad guys. He made a clear cut with his wife; blamed many things on his wife, especially the things that he claimed he did not know. Also, his defense lawyer did an excellent job to use very clear language to undermine a lot of the accusations. Bo Xilai and his defense lawyer came across very well -- that was also a surprise, in many ways. CNN: Did you find it surprising that he seemed to turn on his wife, Gu Kailai? Li: A line has been drawn. His defense lawyer kept emphasizing her unstable mental status and most of the people in China believe that. If you look at the pictures before her arrest and in the court, it looks like there's a problem. Of course the prosecution didn't buy that, but when people judge, at least the civilian people, they buy that argument. So Bo has successfully drawn a line between him and his wife and used it to undermine her testimony. CNN: There was a lot of talk when the scandal emerged -- and in subsequent months -- that the case would shake-up Chinese politics. Is it that the case, or will it be business as usual after the verdict? Li: The Bo case has revealed the fundamental flaws of the political system and the widespread phenomenon of corruption and power abuse. So this case already has a strong impact. In 18 months a lot has changed; there's been a leadership succession, Wen Jiabao's retirement, and the princelings have consolidated their power. The leadership wants to move forward. They want to put it behind them and move onto other issues. That strategy, although it's rational, will probably not resonate very well -- you leave some potential problems for the future as they fail to use the case to consolidate and uplift public confidence in the legal system. CNN: Given the apparent troubled nature of the prosecution's case, is there any chance Bo could be in the 0.1% of Chinese suspects not convicted at trial? Li: Of course he will be convicted, otherwise it would be disastrous. But the sentencing now can't be very severe because of the nature of the charges and how poorly they've conducted this trial. So there are difficulties for the prosecution unless there are dramatic twists and turns in the following days. I think certainly the sentencing won't be the death penalty, probably not even the death penalty commuted to life. The worst is probably the life sentence, and the most lenient probably 15 years. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The corruption trial of disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai in 2013 saw him vehemently deny all allegations against him. Instead of following a tight script as many had expected, the trial went off-script with Bo surprisingly rejecting all charges brought against him, something that prominent China analyst Cheng Li believes hurt the prosecution's case. There were also poor performances by the prosecution team, but for some real surprises, Bo blasted all allegations effectively. Although a conviction was certain due to Chinese legal system convention, the trial revealed serious flaws in the system and negative aspects of Chinese politics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve -33*s = -30*s - 4 + 37 for s.","completion":"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, like we're looking for a hidden treasure: 1. We want to find the value of \\"s,\\" which is like the special treasure. 2. We have this equation: -33*s = -30*s - 4 + 37. 3. What we want to do first is get those s's together. So, let's add 30*s to both sides of the equation (this will make the -30*s vanish, like magic!): -33*s + 30*s = (-30*s + 30*s) - 4 + 37 4. After that goes away, we have: -3*s = -4 + 37 5. Now let's find out the number that comes after adding -4 + 37 (think like you have 37 candies and you eat 4 of them): -4 + 37 = 33 6. Now the equation looks like this: -3*s = 33 7. To find the treasure \\"s,\\" we will divide both sides of the equation by -3 (because we don't want the -3 to be with s anymore): (-3*s) / -3 = 33 / -3 8.

It means if we put -11 in place of \\"s\\" in the equation, the left side will be equal to the right side!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Which event most likely caused the unusual climate in Europe that year?. Answer:","completion":"The unusual climate in Europe in 1783, characterized by an extended cold period, foggy conditions, and acidic rain, was most likely caused by the eruption of the Laki volcano in Iceland. This eruption, which started on June 8, 1783, and lasted until February 1784, was one of the most devastating in recorded history. Volcanic eruptions can have substantial impacts on the climate due to the enormous amount of gas and volcanic ash they release into the atmosphere. When a volcano erupts, it spews millions of tons of sulfur dioxide and other aerosols into the Earth's stratosphere. These particles can form an atmospheric shield, reflecting some of the Sun's radiation back into space, thus leading to a cooling effect on the Earth's surface. This phenomenon can last for months, even years, following an eruption, depending on its magnitude. In the case of the Laki eruption, it expelled an estimated 14 cubic kilometers of basalt lava and clouds of poisonous hydrofluoric acid and sulfur dioxide compounds that killed over 50% of Iceland's livestock population, leading to a famine that killed approximately 25% of the island's human population. The gas and the ash released had significant effects on the climate not just in Iceland but across the Northern Hemisphere. The poisonous cloud drifted to Europe, causing damage to vegetation and reportedly causing illnesses. The hydrofluoric acid that fell with the rain caused acid damage to trees and plants. It is believed to have been the cause of unusually high mortality in England. The released sulfur aerosols caused a cooling effect, leading to the unusual cold experienced in Europe in 1783. Besides the cold, the aerosols also resulted in light scattering, which could have contributed to the foggy conditions. The phenomena also disrupted weather patterns, resulting in unusual hot summer weather giving way to an extremely harsh winter, which Europe, particularly the UK, found difficult to cope with. Crop productivity plummeted, leads to food shortages, widespread malnutrition and increased death rates. Therefore, the Laki eruption in 1783 is the most probable cause for the unusually cold and foggy conditions in Europe, along with the occurrence of acidic rain that year. This incident offers a clear example of the large-scale climatic impact a significant volcanic eruption can have."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Pyöräily kesäolympialaisissa 1900 Translate this to English?","completion":"Cycling in the Summer Olympics 1900 The text \\"Pyöräily kesäolympialaisissa 1900\\" translates to \\"Cycling in the Summer Olympics 1900\\" in English. The 1900 Summer Olympics, also referred to as the Games of the II Olympiad, were held in Paris, France, from May 14 to October 28, 1900. This marked the first time that competitive cycling was included in the Olympic program. The cycling events consisted of two track races and three road races, attracting competitors from various countries. The five cycling events during the 1900 Summer Olympics were divided into two categories: track cycling and road cycling. Track cycling events were held at the Vélodrome de Vincennes, a venue specifically built for bicycle racing in Paris. The two events were the men's sprint, also known as the 2000-meter sprint, and the men's 25-kilometer race. The road cycling category included three distinct races: men's 50 kilometers, men's 100 kilometers, and the men's points race, which was an individual time trial event held over the course of two rounds. The 1900 Summer Olympics marked the beginning of competitive Olympic cycling, and it featured many notable cyclists of the time. The men's sprint was won by French cyclist Georges Taillandier, while the men's 25-kilometer race was won by another Frenchman, Émile Torchebœuf. The men's 50-kilometer road race was won by French cyclist Louis Bastien, and the men's 100-kilometer race was won by French cyclist Charles Baudry. Finally, the men's points race was also won by a French cyclist, Louis Hildebrand. The 1900 Summer Olympics showcased the burgeoning popularity of cycling both as a mode of transportation and a competitive sport. Cycling had grown rapidly during the 1890s, with the invention of the pneumatic tire and improved bicycle designs. The inclusion of cycling in the Olympic program helped cement its position as a popular sport across the world. The success of French cyclists at the 1900 Summer Olympics boosted the popularity of the sport in France and ushered the country into a golden age of cycling, particularly in the form of the renowned Tour de France, which commenced in 1903. In summary, the 1900 Summer Olympics played a significant role in the history of competitive cycling, as it marked the first time the sport was included in the Olympic Games. Five events were held in total, with the French cyclists dominating the field, and this crucial moment cemented cycling’s international appeal and laid the groundwork for future Olympic competitions and professional cycling events, such as the Tour de France."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer to this question? who set the fires in little fires everywhere?","completion":"\\"Little Fires Everywhere\\" is a novel by Celeste Ng, published in 2017, which was later adapted into a television series for Hulu in 2020. The story is set in Shaker Heights, Ohio, and revolves around the lives of two families: the wealthy and seemingly perfect Richardson family, and the nomadic Warren family, led by the enigmatic artist Mia Warren and her teenage daughter, Pearl. The overarching mystery in the story involves a series of small fires that were set in the Richardson family's home, and who was responsible for them. In both the novel and the television adaptation, the culprit behind the fires is eventually revealed, but the identity of the arsonist is different in each version. In the novel: It is discovered that the fires in the Richardson's house were set by Izzy, the youngest daughter of the Richardson family. Izzy is a complex character who struggles to fit in with her family's expectations and forms a close bond with Mia Warren and her artistic, nonconformist perspective on life. This relationship fuels Izzy's growing resentment of her family's obsession with appearances and social status. Izzy's motivations for setting the fires are rooted in her frustration with her family's hypocrisies, their unwillingness to accept her true self, and their judgmental treatment of Mia Warren. Devastated by what she perceives as her mother's betrayal and disapproval, Izzy starts small fires in each of her family members' rooms as a final act of rebellion against the life they've tried to force upon her. It is implied at the end of the novel that Izzy leaves Shaker Heights after the fire, searching for a new, authentic life that mirrors Mia's journey. In the television adaptation: The identity of the arsonist is changed to encompass the collective actions of all four Richardson children: Lexie, Trip, Moody, and Izzy. While Izzy remains the primary instigator and the one who comes up with the idea, her siblings find themselves caught up in the intensity of the situation and the shared desire to break free from the stifling environment of their household. Each sibling has their own reasons and personal experiences that lead to their participation in the arson. In this adaptation, Izzy's motivation remains largely the same as in the novel, while her siblings express different forms of dissatisfaction with their lives and the pressures they face. The collective act of setting the fires symbolizes their shared desire for change, autonomy, and an escape from the societal forces that have shaped their identities. In conclusion, the answer to the question of who set the fires in \\"Little Fires Everywhere\\" differs according to the version you are referring to. In the novel, it was Izzy Richardson, while in the television adaptation, all four Richardson siblings were responsible for the act."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band.

It appears that there has been some kind of accident or mishap, which has led to property damage. This damage may involve a rented or borrowed item, like a car, equipment, or even a venue. Grace asks Phil whether he had obtained a damage waiver, which is an agreement that waives or reduces the person's responsibility to pay for damages in the case of an accident or mishap. Damage waivers are often offered by rental companies to protect customers from unexpected financial burdens resulting from damages incurred during the rental period. It's important to note that a damage waiver is not the same as insurance, but it usually serves as an additional layer of protection for the renter. Phil replies in disappointment, indicating that he did not get a damage waiver. As a result, he is now responsible for the full cost of repairs or replacements needed to fix the damage that has occurred. Grace points this out, so it seems that the situation they are in has financial implications for Phil, and he is unhappy about this outcome. In summary, the conversation revolves around a scenario where Phil has not obtained a damage waiver for a rented or borrowed item, and as a consequence, he has to bear the financial burden of the damages incurred.

News article: Once Subversive, Frieze Opens in a Changing London LONDON — Over the past 13 years Frieze has grown into one of the biggest weeks in the art market calendar. The sprawling scale of the event, centered on a fair in a tent in Regent’s Park, reflects how dramatically London, and its commercial relationship with art, has changed. The etymology dates back to 1988, when a Goldsmiths College student named Damien Hirst organized an exhibition called “Freeze” in the disused offices of the London Port Authority in SE16, a run-down area close to the river Thames. The pop-up show of works by 16 young artists that included Mr. Hirst, Sarah Lucas and Gary Hume was visited by influential curators and collectors like Charles Saatchi, Nicholas Serota and Norman Rosenthal. The rest, as we know, is art history. Today Frieze, which opens to the public Wednesday, is a must-attend fixture for many. The fair, which was officially begun by the Frieze magazine publishers Amanda Sharp and Matthew Slotover in 2003, has become a unique combination of a destination fair (or two, now that the more historical Frieze Masters has joined the mix since 2012). It combines high-end auctions (nine this week at Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips, estimated to raise at least 180 million pounds, or about 276 million), museum exhibitions and gallery shows. While Frieze has thrived, SE16, like so many areas of London, has been transformed by luxury redevelopment. The real estate agent Foxtons is currently offering a new two-bedroom apartment in the original ‘‘Freeze’’ district for £975,000. With its prefabricated venue and quirky projects, the Frieze Art Fair still retains a faint residual flavor of the grungier London that produced the Young British Artists. But nowadays the six-day fair, which this year features 164 galleries from 27 countries, caters to pretty much the same international crowd that attends the previews of Art Basel and the Venice Biennale. Prices for artworks typically range from about 10,000 to 1 million. “Frieze is no longer a fair where the feeling is young and cutting-edge,” said Abigail Asher, partner in the New York art advisory firm Guggenheim, Asher, Associates Inc., in a telephone interview. “The people who descend on London for Frieze Week are looking for more established artists.” In 1997, “Freeze” exhibitors formed the core of the provocative “Sensation” exhibition of works by Young British Artists at the Royal Academy of Arts. Mr. Hirst’s meteoric rise culminated in September 2008 with the two-day auction of his artworks at Sotheby’s that earned £111.5 million. Mr. Hirst is no longer the force he was in the market. Instead, he has reverted back to his role as curator by opening his own private museum in Lambeth, south London. But memories of the glory days of his “Beautiful Inside My Head Forever” auction will be sparked this week by the presence of his 2008-9 shark-in-formaldehyde piece, “Heaven,” in an exhibition on the theme of the sea at the Mayfair dealer Ordovas. One of 11 made, and the only left in private hands — which happen to be Mr. Hirst’s — it carries a price-tag that will only be disclosed to wealthy collectors. London provides any number of opportunities to buy respected names. First, there are the fairs. Hauser & Wirth, for example, is devoting its entire booth at Frieze to a range of sculptures by artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Subodh Gupta, Phyllida Barlow and Paul McCarthy. The latter’s 1992 sculpture “Pecker Leg” is priced at 375,000. Tellingly, unlike the week of Art Basel in Switzerland or Miami Beach, London’s Frieze Week lacks a supporting network of well-regarded satellite fairs that showcase emerging galleries and artists (though the 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair at Somerset House does give some regional perspective). Frieze’s most successful sidekick is in fact PAD London, a boutique fair in Berkeley Square primarily devoted to upscale 20th-century art and design that benefits from its proximity to luxury hotels such as the Connaught and Claridge’s. The ninth edition, featuring 62 galleries, runs from Wednesday through Sunday. Sharing the same dates, the SUNDAY fair, near Regent’s Park, is the week’s one non-Frieze-branded event that attracts serious collectors in search of undiscovered talent. The London gallery Seventeen is one of 25 galleries from 11 countries exhibiting in its sixth edition. An east London gallery specializing in video art, Seventeen will be showing the 2015 video, “Untitled (Pressing On),” by the British artist Jimmy Merris, born in 1983, priced about £2,000 to £3,000. “It’s more experimental. I can take risks,” said David Hoyland, director of Seventeen, in a telephone interview. “I can set the tone for a solo show, and it doesn’t matter if I don’t sell anything.” Mr. Hoyland, along with many other gallerists, is concerned about the effect London’s spiraling property prices is having on the artistic life of the city. “Rents have tripled in east London. You just can’t find cheap spaces any more. The bottom of the art world pyramid is being eroded.” Mr. Hoyland said that Mr. Merris can no longer afford to live in London and has moved to Wales. Similar sentiments were expressed by Michael Elmgreen, the London-based half of the artist duo Elmgreen & Dragset, who are exhibiting new works at Victoria Miro Mayfair. “It’s a fantastic place to show, not a fantastic place to live,” said Mr. Elmgreen, who has made London his home for the last seven years, in an interview. “I don’t think there’s such a strong art scene in London anymore. It’s a theater without actors. The artists aren’t there, but the institutions give amazing shows for the tourists.” Mr. Elmgreen said he has is moving back to Berlin, where Ingar Dragset lives. The duo’s “Self-Portraits” at Victoria Miro expand the museum wall-labels of works by artists such as David Hockney and Martin Kippenberger into independent works of art, priced at as much as £40,000. While the Royal Academy of Arts is presenting works by Ai Weiwei and the new Hyundai Commission for the Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall by the Mexican artist Abraham Cruzvillegas will be opening during Frieze, London’s commercial galleries are also putting on some pretty amazing shows. In Albemarle Street, the Turin dealership Mazzoleni is holding a retrospective of 23 works by the Arte Povera artist Alberto Burri. These include a trademark 1968 “Rosso Plastica” composition, priced at more than €4 million. Down the street, the fellow Italian dealer Tornabuoni is inaugurating its London gallery with a show of more than 50 works by another Arte Povera star: Lucio Fontana. These include a white 1963 version of the artist’s revered egg-shaped “La Fine di Dio” canvases from a private collection. Another version, in black, has been guaranteed to sell for at least £15 million, or about 23 million, at Sotheby’s on Thursday. “Our collector will decide if he wants to sell over the next few days,” said the gallery’s director, Ursula Casamonti, in an interview. “If he does, the price will be higher than at Sotheby’s.” Nearby, the Mayfair branch of the New York dealership David Zwirner is holding its first London show of new works by the Colombian artist Oscar Murillo, born in 1986 and based in London. Mr. Murillo was one of several emerging artists targeted by speculators in 2014. Zwirner’s “binary function” show, with prices as high as 280,000 for new paintings, will confirm that he is now an “established” artist. And then there is the loan show of Cy Twombly works from the CY Twombly Foundation that inaugurates Gagosian’s new state-of-the-art 18,000-square-foot gallery at Grosvenor Hill in Mayfair, and the first London show of paintings by the Los Angeles artist Jonas Wood, born in 1977, held in Gagosian’s equally imposing space at Britannia Street, near King’s Cross. With the auction prices of many once-fashionable young abstract painters now in decline, Mr. Wood has become the figurative painter of the moment. A monumental and typically accessible 2008 painting, “Untitled (M.V. Landscape),” depicting houses at Martha’s Vineyard, is estimated to sell for £250,000 to £350,000 at Christie’s next Friday. Can the market absorb so much material? Last year, 1,638 properties priced at more than 5 million were sold in London, more than any other city in the world, according to a report published this month by the realtors Knight Frank. There’s plenty of money in London that could be spent on art. There’s a lot less for the people who want to make it.

I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out.

For that, he chose forests in Laos. To compare the forests in Laos with the temperate zone forests he chose forests in Ireland. He could clearly see that how they differed in important ways. Which forests would receive less rainfall, Laos or Ireland? The answer is:","completion":"The forest in Ireland would generally receive less rainfall compared to the forests in Laos. Tropical forests, like those in Laos, are characterized by high rainfall, with annual precipitation typically ranging from 2000 to 4500 millimeters (79 to 177 inches). This abundant rainfall contributes to the moist, dense environment commonly associated with tropical forests. Laos, being a part of Southeast Asia, experiences a tropical monsoon climate, resulting in heavy rainfall during the monsoon season (around May to October). On the other hand, temperate forests, such as those found in Ireland, experience lower rainfall levels. Ireland's forests, located in a temperate oceanic climate zone, receive an average annual precipitation of around 1000 to 2500 millimeters (39 to 98 inches) depending on the location in the country, with the western parts receiving higher rainfall than the eastern parts. Although Ireland is known for its frequent rain and cloudy weather, the overall volume of rainfall is less compared to tropical regions like Laos. In summary, Laos' tropical forests generally receive more rainfall than Ireland's temperate forests."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: During what years was the Portugal region incorporated in the Roman Republic? Is \\"The early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the Iberian Peninsula located in South Western Europe.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"While the statement \\"The early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the Iberian Peninsula located in South Western Europe\\" is accurate, it does not provide a specific answer to the question concerning the years when the Portugal region was incorporated into the Roman Republic. To answer the question, we need to delve deeper into the region's historical timeline. The conquest and incorporation of Portugal (which was commonly referred to as Lusitania at the time) into the Roman Republic began in the 2nd century BCE and was completed by the early 1st century BCE. The initial phase of Roman interest in the Iberian Peninsula, including the region that is now Portugal, took place during the Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage (264-146 BCE). As a result of the Second Punic War (218-201 BCE), Rome gained control of the eastern half of the Iberian Peninsula, while the western region remained under the influence of local tribes. Over the next century, Rome gradually extended its control over more of the Iberian Peninsula, driven by a combination of economic interests and strategic concerns. The region that now constitutes Portugal was first invaded during the Lusitanian Wars in 155 BCE. However, it took Rome several decades to achieve a lasting subjugation of the Lusitani and other tribes that inhabited the area. The final pacification of Lusitania occurred during the reign of Caesar Augustus (27 BCE - 14 CE) in the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire period. Although the exact timeline is debated by historians, it is generally considered that the incorporation of Lusitania into the Roman Republic was completed around 27 BCE, when the region became officially established as a Roman province. So, the process of incorporation took place mainly between the 2nd century BCE and the early 1st century BCE, with the exact year of completion around 27 BCE. In this period, Portugal, or Lusitania, became a significant part of the Roman Republic and, later, the Roman Empire."},{"prompt":"Q: The energy in sunlight is also known as what kind of energy?

Article: People often talk as if shyness is a disease or mental condition that can be cured. I prefer to think of it as an emotional disability. It's something we are born with and something we carry with us in our entire lives. There are too many people, however, who seem to be determined to find some way of doing away with their shyness. In my opinion, it's a waste of time. I don't mean that we should do nothing about it; quite the contrary, I think we need to separate the basic fact of our shyness from our ability to take part in a social environment. Look at one of the most famous shy people of them all, Johnny Carson. This man is painfully shy, yet for decades he made a living talking and associating with different people every night, in front of a national audience. Carson has never done away with his shyness, but he has successfully found a way to deal with it to the extent that he could be, not just a talk show host, but a legend among talk show hosts. Look also at Sally Fields, who has recently admitted her problem with shyness. This is a woman who has appeared in many films, TV shows and interviews, yet in her early years she was so shy that she turned down a lunch invitation from Jane Fonda because she was terribly afraid of meeting her. I guess that our shyness is there because each of us is born with some insecurity and this insecurity prevents us from reaching out to others the way people with a more open personality do. As we grow up and become adults, we allow our social skills to grow and develop. But we are still stuck in kindergarten or elementary school or wherever it was when our shyness took root in our soul.

An excellent example of this happened when Britain and China worked together to bring the Milu deer back to China. Milu deer, a kind of animal with large horns , used to be common in China long ago. Like other deer they lived together and ate grass and the soft parts of trees. Milu deer were often killed for food or sport. The Ming and Qing dynasties did not protect them and many were killed. That is how the Milu deer disappeared from China. Luckily before all of them were killed, some were taken to Britain to improve the environment of the beautiful park which belonged to the Duke of Bedford. He liked them so much that he took them from China to Britain. Milu deer liked the cool, wet weather in England and their number increased year by year. As a result, when in 1985 the government of China wanted to bring back the Milu deer, the Duke of Bedford was able to help. The first deer came back to China to the Nanhaizi Milu Park 20 kilometers south of Beijing and the centre in Dafeng, Jiangsu province. The deer certainly seem happy to be back in China because their number has grown quickly. There are now so many of them that a new park has been opened for them in Hubei Province.

Movie title: House of Wax Movie plot: The movie opens with title and credits over the streets of turn of the century New York City at night in the pouring rain. A solitary figure walks down the street holding an umbrella. We enter the Wax Museum with various tableaux of crimes of the past, and then enter the workshop where Prof. Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is working on a sculpture. His business partner, Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) enters and walks partially upstairs when he is hailed by Jarrod. He tells Jarrod he's there to study the account books. They have a philosophical difference between their approaches to business. Jarrod proposes a buyout arrangement, and Burke either eager or desperate for the money agrees in principle. A potential investor is scheduled to see Jarrod that very evening.Bruce Allison (Phillip Tonge) and Sidney Wallace (Paul Cavanagh) arrive and are given a brief tour of the wax museum. Wallace is impressed, but Jarrod explains that he's never satisfied with certain aspects of the finished products. Wallace explains he's going to Egypt for three months, so no decision on investment can take place prior to his return. Allison and Wallace depart. Burke was eavesdropping from the upstairs room and heard everything. He is impatient for a financial settlement and proposes an insurance fire. The place is insured for 25,000--12,500 each. Jarrod is horrified by the proposal, and opposes it categorically. Burke lights the Marie Antoinette wax figure's dress with a match. It starts a fire that Jarrod quickly extinguishes. Burke starts a few more fires, with Jarrod quickly working to save his wax figures. Burke and Jarrod fight, and at one point Jarrod is knocked out. Burke douses the workroom and display area with a flammable liquid and turns on the gas light spigots. He goes upstairs as the place begins to catch fire. He returns to the workroom and continues his fight with the now revived Jarrod. Jarrod works desperately with buckets of water to douse the fire, but it is a losing battle.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? Which is the best foreign language to learn, and why ? What is best foreign language to learn?","completion":"While these two questions both ask for identifying the best foreign language to learn, they differ in a crucial aspect. The first question asks for both the \\"best foreign language\\" and an explanation as to why it is considered the best, whereas the second question purely asks for the \\"best foreign language\\" without seeking an accompanying rationale. To thoroughly answer the first question, one needs to consider several factors such as personal interests, geographic location, career goals, and linguistic diversity. 1. Personal Interest: If someone is passionate about a particular culture, region, or literature, they're more likely to stay motivated while learning the respective language. For example, a person interested in classical literature may choose to learn Latin or Ancient Greek, while one interested in Japanese culture may choose to learn Japanese. 2. Geographic Location: Where an individual resides or plans to live can play a significant role in determining the most useful foreign language to learn. For instance, if a person lives in the United States, learning Spanish would be highly beneficial, as it is the second most spoken language in the country. Similarly, someone residing in Europe may find learning German or French will provide more opportunities for communication and cultural exchange. 3. Career Goals: Language proficiency can be a great asset in various professional fields, such as international business, diplomacy, tourism, and academia. For example, if a person aspires to work in global trade, learning languages like Mandarin (due to China's economic prominence), Spanish (widely spoken in Central and South America), or Arabic (spoken in the fast-growing economies of the Middle East) could offer a competitive edge. 4. Linguistic Diversity: Learning a language from a different language family can be enriching and cognitively stimulating. For example, an English speaker might find learning languages like Chinese, Japanese, or Arabic challenging and rewarding due to the difference in grammar, alphabet, and script. In contrast, the second question focuses merely on identifying the \\"best foreign language\\" to learn. This question requires a simple answer, although it may still be subject to the above-discussed factors. However, it does not explicitly ask for reasons behind the choice. Thus, a straightforward reply may be given, such as \\"The best foreign language to learn is Mandarin Chinese due to its linguistic diversity and vast number of native speakers.\\" In conclusion, although both questions revolve around identifying the best foreign language to learn, they differ in their demand for a detailed explanation. The first question specifically calls for a comprehensive discussion covering the rationale behind the choice, whereas the second question is satisfied with a simpler, definitive response."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was the only way to advance in his profession. What was his profession? Choices: - workplace - science - algebra - province - construction business The rationale to choose \\"construction business\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice for Sammy's profession in this scenario is the \\"construction business.\\" Numerous reasons support this conclusion, which are outlined below: 1. Union memberships are common in the construction industry: Union memberships are well-established and widespread in the construction business. This industry often involves job sites with numerous workers from different trades, and labor unions serve as a vital element in protecting their rights, ensuring proper wages, and advocating for better working conditions. 2. Job advancement through unions: In the construction business, union members usually have access to better job opportunities, higher wages, and various benefits. As mentioned in the question, Sammy had to be a union member to advance in his profession. This suggests that he works in a field where union membership is closely related to career progress, which is a reality in the construction sector. 3. Collective bargaining: Unions in the construction industry negotiate wages, benefits, and working conditions on behalf of their members through collective bargaining. This allows workers to have a stronger voice in negotiating employment conditions. The statement that Sammy had to be a union member implies that his profession would be one where collective bargaining is active and necessary for professional progress, which is true for the construction business. 4. Union-provided training: In the construction industry, unions often offer training and apprenticeship programs to their members. By joining a union, workers can learn new skills and improve their marketability, making it more likely that they advance in their profession. Since the question emphasizes Sammy's need for union membership for career growth, it can be concluded that he works in an industry like construction, where unions actively provide opportunities for professional development. 5. Worker safety and protection: Construction work can be hazardous, often involving heavy machinery, dangerous equipment, and exposure to harsh conditions. Labor unions play a crucial role in ensuring worker safety and protection by enforcing safety standards, providing necessary training, and advocating for workers' rights. Sammy's reliance on union membership to advance in his profession implies that he is in a field where worker safety and protection are highly valued, such as the construction business. Therefore, considering the role and importance of labor unions in the construction business, and the necessity of union membership for career advancement mentioned in the question, it is safe to conclude that Sammy's profession is within the construction industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this movie, there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie. Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk, but walks the walk as well. When Carter thought we needed to conserve energy, he turned down the thermostat in the White House and got warm by wearing a sweater. Al Gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet. How much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create? How much energy does it take to heat Gore's swimming pool behind his mansion? It would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used. But if we did, the power company would react to a 50% reduction of energy by calling it a \\"50% loss in revenue\\" and recouping their losses by raising the rates by 50%.

At the time of last month's ruling, King said he did not agree with the findings or the share price, saying that, even if he proceeded with an offer, it would be rejected by an \\"overwhelming majority of RIFC's shareholders\\". The Tab ruling said King, along with George Letham, George Taylor and Douglas Park, had acted as a \\"concert party\\" to acquire shares in Rangers International Football Club, rather than acting as an individual.

Context: Yes; I have a rare form of cluster/ice pick headaches that can affect any part of my body. It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own? It’s the greatest gift I’ve given to myself. You know yourself better than anyone, even if you feel like you don’t know yourself. If something feels wrong, don’t just live with it - keep pushing for a correct diagnosis! Question: Whose life was changed forever once they found out they had ice pick headaches? Answer: [+] The main characters [+] the family [+] not enough information [+] Doctors A:","completion":"The life that was changed forever once they found out they had ice pick headaches was the main character's life. They had been struggling with confusion and stress for years due to the mysterious and unbearable pain, which they referred to as \\"beeping.\\" Once they were finally diagnosed by a neurologist and started taking beta blockers to prevent the headaches, their life took a significant turn for the better. They were no longer in constant fear of sudden, debilitating pain, and they even gained the confidence to consider getting their driver's license.

На русском: Будучи человеком, которым было отведено ключевое участие в формировании экономической политики в Соединенных Штатах, я постоянно наблюдал рассогласованность между политическими курсами, которые Америка пропагандирует в развивающихся странах, и идеями, которые реализуются не дома. Один из наиболее ярких примеров такой неконсистентности - \\"Вашингтонский консенсус\\". Этот термин, предложенный экономистом Джоном Уильямсоном, описывает ряд стандартных рекомендаций для развивающихся стран, предлагаемых Международным валютным фондом и Всемирным банком. Основные принципы данного консенсуса заключаются в дерегулировании и рыночных реформах, приватизации государственных компаний, открытии экономики мировому рынку и ориентации на экспорт. Вместе с тем, в внутренней экономической политике США массивные государственные вложения и субсидии часто сосуществуют с рыночными реформами. Это противоречит рекомендациям, предлагаемым странам-реципиентам. В частности, такие инструменты, как субсидии и защита отечественных производителей, уверенно позволили многим американским компаниям занять доминирующее положение на мировом рынке. Таким образом, внешние экономические и политические рекомендации странам-реципиентам разительно отличаются от того, что происходит на американском внутреннем рынке. В случае Соединенных Штатов имеются множественные примеры более мягкого подхода к экономической политике и меньшего стремления к либерализации.

We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns. Thankfully, hard work and good will from all parties allowed us to find a solution that works for everyone.\\" Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services are non-profit organizations that provide civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and families throughout Washington state. Members of the state's Access to Justice Network, these organizations work with thousands of volunteer attorneys to ensure that justice is available to those who face critical legal problems and can't afford private legal counsel.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the full name of the man who's participation was believed to be confirmed by Gonzaga princes in the opera that omits La messaggera in the 1609 score? is inside the article: In his personaggi listed in the 1609 score, Monteverdi unaccountably omits La messaggera (the Messenger), and indicates that the final chorus of shepherds who perform the moresca (Moorish dance) at the opera's end are a separate group (che fecero la moresca nel fine). Little information is available about who sang the various roles in the first performance. A letter published at Mantua in 1612 records that the distinguished tenor and composer Francesco Rasi took part, and it is generally assumed that he sang the title role. Rasi could sing in both the tenor and bass ranges \\"with exquisite style ... and extraordinary feeling\\". The involvement in the premiere of a Florentine castrato, Giovanni Gualberto Magli, is confirmed by correspondence between the Gonzaga princes. Magli sang the prologue, Proserpina and possibly one other role, either La messaggera or Speranza. The musicologist and historian Hans Redlich mistakenly allocates Magli to the role of Orfeo.A clue about who played Euridice is contained in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo. It refers to \\"that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince's Orfeo\\". This priest was possibly Padre Girolamo Bacchini, a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century. The Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola may have sung minor roles in the premiere.There are solo parts for four shepherds and three spirits. Carter calculates that through the doubling of roles that the text allows, a total of ten singers—three sopranos, two altos, three tenors and two basses—is required for a performance, with the soloists (except Orfeo) also forming the chorus. Carter's suggested role-doublings include La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza., can you guess it ? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the text, the full name of the man who's participation was believed to be confirmed by Gonzaga princes in the opera that omits La messaggera in the 1609 score is Giovanni Gualberto Magli.

Trivia question: The alcoholic drink Absinthe originated in which European country? And the answer is?","completion":"The alcoholic drink Absinthe originated in Switzerland, specifically in the Val-de-Travers region located in the canton of Neuchâtel. The green-hued spirit, popularly known as the \\"Green Fairy,\\" can be traced back to the late 18th century and was initially produced as an elixir for medicinal purposes. Absinthe is a distilled, highly alcoholic drink made from a combination of botanicals such as wormwood, green anise, and sweet fennel, among other herbs and spices. The key ingredient in absinthe is wormwood, which contains the psychoactive substance thujone. It is this ingredient that has given absinthe a controversial reputation over the years primarily because of the psychoactive effects thujone may have when present at high concentrations. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Absinthe became increasingly popular among artists, writers, and intellectuals in Europe, adding to its mystique as an inspiring and mind-altering beverage. Notable figures such as Ernest Hemingway, Vincent van Gogh, and Oscar Wilde were known to indulge in the Green Fairy. Absinthe was consumed as part of a ritual that involved dripping cold water through a sugar cube resting on a slotted spoon, which was placed over the glass holding the absinthe. The cold water caused the absinthe to 'louche' or turn a milky, opalescent greenish color, releasing the drink's aromatic flavors. Despite its cultural impact, absinthe's alleged hallucinogenic effects and potential for addiction led to widespread controversy, resulting in bans in several countries, including the United States and France, in the early 20th century. Over time, the bans were lifted and absinthe has made a resurgence in the modern era. It is now legally available in the United States and other countries, although thujone levels are regulated. In conclusion, absinthe originated in Switzerland and gradually gained international popularity, particularly among artists, writers, and the bohemian crowd in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The drink's complex history and controversial status have contributed to its enduring allure, and today, it continues to be appreciated for its unique flavor and cultural significance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — With gas prices pushing 4 a gallon, a lot of people are trying to stretch their dollar at the gas pump, but some of them are trying to stretch it a little too far. Since the beginning of March, AAA has seen an 18 percent increase in the number of roadside calls for people running out of gas. “I never put a lot in because I can’t afford to fill it up,” Leo Greek, a stranded motorist, said. He says he’s not even sure how much it would cost to fill up his truck these days because he hasn’t done it for a while. He gets only what he needs and today he underestimated. “It’s frustrating,” Greek said. “I can’t believe it has to be that expensive, but I know everybody’s going through it.” According to AAA, gas prices in the Pittsburgh area have gone up 26 cents per gallon in the last month. “Before it was more absentminded than anything else,” Jim Krebs with Brighton Service said. “But now, I believe that’s what it is. I believe people are like, ‘Man, I got to buy something else so I’m not going to put gas in the car. I should be able to make it,’ and they don’t.” RELATED LINKS More Local News More Consumer News More Reports By Lynne Hayes-Freeland AAA Fuel Gauge Report GasBuddy.com ||||| With gas prices climbing and little relief in sight, President Barack Obama is scrambling to get ahead of the latest potential obstacle to his re-election bid, even as Republicans are making plans to exploit the issue. President Barack Obama salutes as he steps off Marine One helicopter before his departure from Los Angeles International airport in Los Angeles, Friday, April 22, 2011. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) (Associated Press) President Barack Obama walks from the White House in Washington, Saturday, April 23, 2011, to his limo, for an afternoon of golf at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) (Associated Press) No one seems more aware of the electoral peril than Obama himself. \\"My poll numbers go up and down depending on the latest crisis, and right now gas prices are weighing heavily on people,\\" he told Democratic donors in Los Angeles this past week. In fact, Obama raised the issue unsolicited in a series of town meetings in Virginia, California and Nevada that were ostensibly about his deficit-reduction plan. And he made the gas spike the subject of his weekly radio and Internet address Saturday. \\"It's just another burden when things were already pretty tough,\\" he said. As Obama well knows, Americans love their cars and remain heavily dependent on them, and they don't hesitate to punish politicians when the cost of filling their tanks goes through the roof. Indeed, for presidents, responding to sudden surges is a recurring frustration. \\"These gas prices are killing you right now,\\" Obama said at Facebook headquarters in California, acknowledging that many Americans can't afford new fuel-efficient cars and must drive older models.. For some, he said, the cost of a fill-up has all but erased the benefit of the payroll tax holiday that he and congressional Republicans agreed on last December. On Saturday, Obama insisted in his radio and Internet address that the best answer is a long-term drive to develop alternatives to fossil fuel. He also renewed calls to end 4 billion in subsidies for oil and gas companies. \\"Instead of subsidizing yesterday's energy sources,\\" he said, \\"we need to invest in tomorrow's.\\" Republicans contend that high gas prices are the inevitable result of an administration they accuse of stifling domestic drilling, and which placed new curbs on offshore exploration after last spring's disastrous BP oil spill. \\"The administration has declared what can only be described as a war on American energy,\\" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. \\"Obama is vulnerable on gas prices and the Republicans have and will exploit this as a wedge issue,\\" said James Thurber, who directs the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. Legislative aides report House Republicans are considering a series of hearings and floor votes on measures to boost domestic oil and gas production when Congress returns from its Easter break. Meantime, Obama has ordered his Justice Department to form a task force to look for fraud or manipulation in the oil markets. It will \\"root out\\" any abuses, he told a town meeting in Reno, Nev. The president is among those who've said the surging price for crude is caused by worries about political upheaval in the Arab world and increasing demand from China and elsewhere. Still, Americans have a tradition of holding the party in power responsible for rising gas costs. Obama's focus on the issue came as a New York Times/CBS News poll published Thursday found that 70 percent of the public believes the country is headed in the wrong direction. That followed a March AP-GfK survey reflecting widespread discontent over the economy, with just 15 percent seeing an economic improvement the previous month. Through the spring, Obama's approval numbers in several polls have slipped. \\"Gas prices are a major factor in his slide ... along with unemployment and his talk about cuts and tax increases to deal with deficits and debt,\\" Thurber said. The national average price for a gallon (about 3.8 liters) of regular gasoline is currently 3.84, almost a dollar higher than a year ago. In many places, it's well over 4. The gas price debate has a sense of deja vu to it, Obama notes. Vows to end dependence on expensive oil imports go back to Richard Nixon's \\"Project Independence\\", a 1973 response to the Arab oil embargo, and this has been a popular refrain by presidents of both parties over the last 40 years. \\"Whenever gas prices shoot up, like clockwork, you see politicians racing to the cameras, waving three-point plans for two dollar gas,\\" Obama said in Saturday's address. But when prices subside, those plans are quietly shelved. Even calls to target price gouging have a familiar ring. When gas hit 3 a gallon in 2006, George W. Bush launched a probe, declaring Americans \\"don't want and will not accept ... manipulation of the market. And neither will I.\\" Seven months later, Bush took what he called a \\"thumping\\" in mid-term elections. Of course, other issues _ especially Iraq _ played a big role. But Obama can't help pondering that example, and wondering what rising gas prices could do to his hopes for a second term. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"This news article discusses the impact of rising gas prices on American citizens and the potential political consequences for President Barack Obama.

Question: Question: The stabbing to death of a person is likely to create what on the ground? Options: - pool of blood - being arrested - garden - imprisonment - gruesome Explain why a human would choose \\"pool of blood\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"pool of blood\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: 1. Understanding the context: The question describes a violent event that results in the death of a person through stabbing. This context immediately rules out options like \\"garden\\" and \\"imprisonment\\" which are unrelated to the direct consequence of the violent act. 2. Analyzing the options: From the remaining options - \\"pool of blood,\\" \\"being arrested,\\" and \\"gruesome\\" - a human would identify \\"pool of blood\\" as the most logical and direct result of a stabbing. 3. Cause and effect: Stabbing an individual can cause a significant amount of bleeding due to damage to blood vessels and tissues. As the person bleeds out, the blood would accumulate on the ground, creating a pool of blood. This cause-and-effect relationship leads a human to choose \\"pool of blood\\" as the answer. 4. Focus on immediate outcome: While \\"being arrested\\" and \\"gruesome\\" are also related to the scenario, they are not as directly linked to the stabbing itself. \\"Being arrested\\" is a potential legal consequence for the perpetrator, which comes after the stabbing event. \\"Gruesome\\" is a description of the scene, not a specific outcome. Thus, \\"pool of blood\\" remains the most accurate and direct answer to the question. By considering context, analyzing options, understanding the cause-and-effect relationship, and focusing on the immediate outcome, a human would choose \\"pool of blood\\" as the answer to the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. Paragraph: John and Keith were playing football - the game was rough to say the least. They both got hurt. After the game they went to see the sports physician for a check up. The physician found that John had inflammation, but Keith didn't have any inflammation. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who would not have neutrophils on his wound, John or Keith? Answer:","completion":"Keith would not have neutrophils on his wound. As described in the background information, inflammation is a response of the body to infections or injuries. It is marked by redness, warmth, and pain in the affected area. Inflammation occurs as a result of chemicals being released when skin or other tissues are damaged. These chemicals cause blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood flow to the damaged area. Importantly, these chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound site, causing the neutrophils to leak out of blood vessels and into the damaged tissue. In the given paragraph, John and Keith were playing a rough game of football and both got injured. During their check-up with the sports physician, it was found that John had inflammation, while Keith did not. Given this information, it can be deduced that it is John's wound that has neutrophils present, as his body has initiated the inflammatory response to deal with the injury. On the other hand, Keith's lack of inflammation indicates that his wound has not triggered the same response, meaning that neutrophils have not been attracted to his wound site. Therefore, Keith would not have neutrophils on his wound."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the former prime minister who did not provide financial support for the leader of the Nimrod Expedition? Despite the public acclaim that had greeted Shackleton's achievements after the Nimrod Expedition in 1907–1909, the explorer was unsettled, becoming—in the words of British skiing pioneer Sir Harry Brittain—\\"a bit of a floating gent\\". By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \\"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\\". The next work, he said, would be \\"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\\". He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective. On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\".Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds. Bruce generously allowed Shackleton to... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Rosebery. The former Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery, is mentioned in the article as one of those approached by Shackleton for financial support for his expedition plans. However, he did not offer any help, stating bluntly: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\". Despite his enormous achievements and public acclaim that followed the Nimrod Expedition from 1907-1909, Shackleton found that raising funds for his Antarctic explorations continued to pose a significant challenge. Lord Rosebery's refusal to contribute financially is a demonstration of the difficulties the explorer would have faced during these preparations. Thus, Rosebery is the last name of the former Prime Minister who did not provide financial support for the leader of the Nimrod Expedition."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkish pronunciation: [re'dZep taj'jip 'aerdo(W)an] ( listen); born 26 February 1954) is a Turkish politician serving as the current President of Turkey, holding the position since 2014. He previously served as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2014 and as Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. He founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001, leading it to general election victories in 2002, 2007 and 2011 before standing down upon his election as President in 2014. Erdogan was born in 1954 in the Kasimpasa neighborhood of Istanbul, to which his family had moved from Rize Province. His parents are Ahmet Erdogan and Tenzile Erdogan. Erdogan reportedly said in 2003, \\"I'm a Georgian, my family is a Georgian family which migrated from Batumi to Rize.\\" But in a 2014 televised interview on the NTV news network, he said, \\"You wouldn't believe the things they have said about me. They have said I am Georgian... forgive me for saying this... even much uglier things, they have even called me an Armenian, but I am Turkish.\\" In an account based on registry records, his genealogy was tracked to an ethnic Turkish family. Erdogan spent his early childhood in Rize, where his father Ahmet Erdogan (1905 - 1988) was a Captain in the Turkish Coast Guard. Erdogan had a brother Mustafa (b. 1958) and sister Vesile (b. 1965). His summer holidays were mostly spent in Guneysu, Rize, where his family originates from. Throughout his life he often returned to this spiritual home, and in 2015 he opened a vast mosque on a mountaintop near this village. The family returned to Istanbul when Erdogan was 13 years old. As a teenager, he sold lemonade and sesame buns (simit) on the streets of the city's rougher districts to earn extra money. Brought up in an observant Muslim family, Erdogan graduated from Kasimpasa Piyale primary school in 1965, and Imam Hatip school, a religious vocational high school, in 1973. He received his high school diploma from Eyup High School. He subsequently studied Business Administration at the Aksaray School of Economics and Commercial Sciences, now known as Marmara University's Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences--although several Turkish sources dispute that he graduated. In his youth, Erdogan played semi-professional football at a local club. Fenerbahce wanted him to transfer to the club but his father prevented it. The stadium of the local football club in the district where he grew up, Kasimpasa S.K. is named after him. Erdogan married Emine Gulbaran (born 1955, Siirt) on 4 July 1978. They have two sons; Ahmet Burak and Necmettin Bilal, and two daughters, Esra and Sumeyye. His father, Ahmet Erdogan, died in 1988 and his 88-year-old mother, Tenzile Erdogan, died in 2011. He is a member of the Community of Iskenderpasa, a Turkish sufistic community of Naqshbandi tariqah. What sport did Erdogan play?","completion":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the current President of Turkey, was engaged in sports during his youth. He played semi-professional football at a local club. His skill in the game was noted to the extent that Fenerbahce, a prominent club in Turkey, even wanted him to transfer to their club. However, his father prevented this transition. It is worth noting the considerable influence this sport had in his early life, as the local football club where he grew up, Kasimpasa S.K., even named their stadium after him, acknowledging his contribution and connection with the sport. This active involvement in football during his youth contributes to the multidimensional aspects of President Erdogan's personality, showcasing a balance between avid interest in sports and his dedication to political service captured throughout his life trajectory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Given the context provided, it is impossible to predict with absolute certainty what Alex will do next. However, we can generate a few potential scenarios based on the information given, which is that Alex is comfortable doing well in school. Scenario 1: Continuing to Excel Academically Since Alex is comfortable doing good in school, it is highly likely that they will continue to focus on their studies, engage in activities that promote academic growth, and maintain their strong academic performance. This could involve Alex participating in study groups, seeking additional help from teachers when necessary, or taking advantage of school resources such as tutoring or after-school programs. Scenario 2: Pursuing Extracurricular Activities Alex may also decide to expand their horizons in other areas complementary to their academic achievements, such as participating in extracurricular activities. They might join a sports team, become involved in student government, or participate in a club related to their interests. These activities could not only help Alex build critical skills such as teamwork, leadership and problem-solving but could also assist in broadening their social network, making new friends or connections with people who share similar interests. Scenario 3: Setting Long-term Goals and Planning for the Future Another potential path for Alex could involve setting long-term goals related to their education or career aspirations. Given their academic success, it is possible that Alex envisions attending college or pursuing a particular career path. In this case, Alex might focus on acquiring information about potential colleges, scholarships, or internships to better understand the necessary steps to achieve these goals. Scenario 4: Giving Back and Helping Others With a strong academic foundation, Alex may realize that they can share their knowledge and support other students who may be struggling or seeking guidance. They might volunteer at their school as a tutor, work as a teaching assistant, or consider mentoring younger students. In turn, this would allow Alex to develop valuable interpersonal and communication skills and potentially find personal satisfaction in helping others succeed. While it is impossible to predict exactly which path Alex will choose, these scenarios offer insight into potential directions that they may take based on their comfort and success in school. Ultimately, the decision will depend on Alex's unique interests, priorities, and personal aspirations. Regardless of the path chosen, their commitment to academic success can open up multiple opportunities and influence their future positively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, the Momu tribe experienced less ozone depletion compared to the Ana tribe. The ozone hole is mainly caused by human activities, such as the release of chlorine and bromine gases in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products.

Would \\"\\"Ancient\\" redirects here.\\" be a reasonable answer? Choices: (a). No; (b). Yes; The answer is:","completion":"(a). No; The given answer, \\"\\"Ancient\\" redirects here.\\" is not a reasonable answer to the question, \\"WHERE WAS THE 1ST GREEK CITY FOUND ANCIENT TIMES?\\" Briefly, the statement only points out a redirection related to the term \\"ancient\\" and does not provide any relevant information about the first Greek city in ancient times. A more detailed and long answer: The first Greek city in ancient times is a subject of much debate among historians and archaeologists. It is difficult to determine the precise first Greek city due to varying definitions of city, political factors, and current knowledge based on archeological findings. Regardless, two of the most ancient Greek cities with historical and archaeological significance, which are often cited as some of the earliest examples, are Argos and Mycenae. 1. Argos: Located in the Peloponnese peninsula, Argos is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Traces of its early history date back to the Neolithic period (around 6000 BCE). Renowned for its prominent role in various Greek myths, Argos was widely known as a seat of power during the Mycenaean era (1600-1100 BCE). Its legendary kings, Perseus and Agamemnon, gained fame in ancient Greek literature, such as Homer's Iliad. 2. Mycenae: Mycenae is often considered the center of Mycenaean civilization and the birthplace of Greek culture. Also located in the Peloponnese, Mycenae was a significant city between 1600 and 1200 BCE. Inhabited since the Neolithic era, Mycenae rose to prominence during the Bronze Age as a vital seat of power for the Mycenaean civilization. According to the Greek poet Homer, Agamemnon, the legendary king of Mycenae, led the Greeks in the Trojan War. Both Argos and Mycenae boast archaeological sites that provide valuable insights into early Greek history, including numerous discoveries of ancient artifacts, ruins, and inscriptions. While it may not be completely accurate to claim Argos or Mycenae as the definitive first Greek city, they are undoubtedly two of the earliest known prominents centers of Greek civilization. Further research and archaeological findings may reveal more about the origins of ancient Greek cities, but for now, we can acknowledge their significance in the fascinating and complex history of ancient Greece."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Approximately 10,000 years ago, desertification forced hunter-gatherer societies south into the Sahel regions of northern Central Africa, where some groups settled and began farming as part of the Neolithic Revolution. Initial farming of white yam progressed into millet and sorghum, and before 3000 BC the domestication of African oil palm improved the groups' nutrition and allowed for expansion of the local populations. Bananas arrived in the region and added an important source of carbohydrates to the diet; they were also used in the production of alcoholic beverages.[when?] This Agricultural Revolution, combined with a \\"Fish-stew Revolution\\", in which fishing began to take place, and the use of boats, allowed for the transportation of goods.

Context: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point. Question: What is Cambridge Analytica? Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Cambridge Analytica was a British political consulting firm that specialized in data analysis and the strategic use of communication tactics for electoral processes.

Write an article based on this summary: Hackers who have leaked Game of Thrones scripts and other data from entertainment company HBO have released a note demanding a ransom payment.","completion":"Title: Game of Thrones Ransomware: Hackers Demand Payment After Leaking HBO Data Introduction: The breach of HBO's security and the subsequent leak of Game of Thrones scripts and other sensitive data have made headlines in recent weeks. Gone are the days when hackers targeted only financial institutions or retailers with massive customer databases; the entertainment industry now appears to be firmly in the crosshairs. The hackers responsible for the HBO attack have taken the cyber-crime world by storm and are now demanding a ransom payment. The Ransom Demand: In an anonymous digital message delivered directly to HBO, the hackers made it clear that they were not bluffing, and boldly demanded a ransom in exchange for the stolen data. The exact ransom amount remains unknown, but various reports have indicated that the hackers have requested payment in Bitcoin, a popular and difficult-to-trace cryptocurrency. The demand to HBO appears to be an ultimatum containing severe consequences. Unless the ransom is paid, the hackers threaten to continue leaking sensitive materials, which could ultimately lead to significant financial losses for the entertainment firm. Implications for HBO and the Entertainment Industry: The ransom demand brings to light not just the vulnerability of HBO, but also of the entire entertainment industry. These leaks undermine the very foundations of intellectual property rights, bearing potentially severe long-term impacts. With highly-anticipated shows and movies at risk, the consequences faced by the industry include potential dips in viewer ratings and loss of crucial advertising revenue. Moreover, this cyberattack serves as a stark reminder of the importance of investing in robust cyber-security measures. As more content is created and distributed digitally, media and entertainment companies must evaluate the strength of their current security infrastructures and develop comprehensive cyber-security strategies that leave no room for breaches. Future Outlook: The Game of Thrones ransomware situation begs the question: What can HBO and other entertainment-related companies do to protect future content from hacker threats? Here are a few key measures that should be seriously considered: 1. Implement strong, multi-layered security protocols that include monitoring user activity to detect any unusual patterns or suspicious behavior, thereby allowing companies to address security threats swiftly. 2. Education and training of employees to ensure that they understand the importance of protecting intellectual property and are aware of the potential risks associated with cyber attacks. 3. Regular penetration testing to assess the overall security infrastructure, exposing any vulnerabilities that may open the door for hackers to steal content. 4. Collaborate with law enforcement agencies and engage in information sharing amongst industry players to create more extensive and effective defense networks against cyber criminals. 5. Adoption of advanced encryption technology to safeguard sensitive data at all stages, from creation to storage and distribution. Conclusion: The theft and subsequent ransom demand regarding Game of Thrones scripts and other HBO data highlights the need for robust security measures in the entertainment industry. While HBO determines the appropriate course of action in the face of this ransom demand, the entire industry must take note and act to prevent similar attacks from occurring in the future. Investing in a secure digital environment, sharing information with other media companies, and being proactive in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities will help entertainment companies stay one step ahead of cyber criminals, ultimately protecting their hard-earned intellectual property."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This news is generating significant interest and concern, as incidents like this are said to reflect the underlying challenges faced by non-religious individuals serving the country. According to the soldier, harassment began early in his deployment when his absence from group prayers was noticed by fellow soldiers. He explained that upon expressing his atheistic beliefs, he became a target for derogatory comments and unsolicited religious proselytizing. Furthermore, he claimed that his superiors failed to provide adequate support or address the situation, possibly due to their own religious affiliations. These incidents fostered a hostile work environment for the soldier, which ultimately affected his ability to perform his duties at the same level of efficiency as before. Now that these allegations have come to light, the US military is committed to taking the situation seriously and will conduct a thorough investigation into the matter. This is a crucial step toward identifying and addressing any potential mistreatment that the soldier may have experienced during his deployment. In an age where freedom of religion and belief is integral to a fair society, the plight of this atheist soldier highlights the extent to which personal convictions can still be a source of discrimination and harassment. It is essential that the military maintains a culture where diversity is respected and upheld throughout all ranks, to ensure the best possible working environment for every individual who serves the country. The investigation into these allegations will serve as a wake-up call for the military to review their policies and procedures, and refine the way they address complaints concerning religious discrimination and harassment. The outcome of this investigation will not only affect the atheist soldier, but may also set a precedent for future cases involving religious harassment and discrimination within the armed forces. Hopefully, the military's attention to this case will encourage other similarly affected individuals to come forward with their grievances, so that these issues may be adequately addressed and rectified. Greater awareness on the subject is necessary to promote better understanding and tolerance of individual beliefs and convictions, and ultimately, a more inclusive and supportive military environment. As the investigation unfolds, the impact of the atheist soldier's claims on the military as a whole remains to be seen, but this much is certain: the spotlight on this case is sure to spark significant conversations around the need for equality, acceptance, and understanding of individual beliefs in the US military. Undoubtedly, this controversy will encourage further reflection and improvements to ensure that every soldier, irrespective of their religious beliefs, can serve their country with dignity and without fear of harassment or prejudice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. After her little boy \\"lost it\\" the mother probably: A. Better understands the hospitals 12 and older visitation policy. B. Thinks the real Santa is dead and Christmas is forever gone. C. Doubts her parenting abilities. D. not enough information","completion":"The task given is to complete the story based on the user's input and justify the steps taken. Here's the story continuation with the chosen option and justification for the choice: Option A: Better understands the hospitals 12 and older visitation policy. Continuation: As the mother tried to console her devastated child, she couldn't help but recognize the wisdom in the hospital's visitation policy. She realized that the ER indeed was no place for a young child, especially after witnessing the traumatic scene of her son thinking Santa Claus had died. Step-by-Step Justification: 1. The mother was adamant about her child visiting his grandmother despite the hospital's visitation policy, showing her initial disregard for the policy. 2. The ER staff had warned the mother about the adverse and unpredictable environment within the ER, but she was persistent. 3. Upon the child witnessing Santa's lifeless body, he became greatly distressed, and the mother had to face the consequences of her decision. 4. Based on the given scenario, it is most realistic that the mother gained a newfound understanding of the visitation policy, realizing that it exists to protect children from emotionally and psychologically challenging experiences. In conclusion, the mother most likely now better understands the hospital's visitation policy and realizes its importance in shielding young children from potentially traumatic experiences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"To add more flavor to a broth, several methods can be applied depending on your taste preferences and the ingredients readily available to you. Here, I will explain some popular methods that could be employed to make your broth more flavorful. 1. Use high-quality ingredients: The quality of your ingredients significantly impacts the flavor of the broth. For instance, using homemade stock or bone broth instead of store-bought versions can greatly enhance the taste. Choose fresh vegetables and quality meats or bones, if available. 2. Browning the ingredients: Before adding your ingredients to the broth, consider browning them to develop a richer flavor. You can sear meat, sauté vegetables, and roast bones on a stovetop or in an oven, creating a caramelized layer on the surface, thus adding depth to the final broth. 3. Add fresh herbs and spice combinations: Aromatic herbs and spices impart a unique and robust flavor to the broth. Experiment with ingredients like thyme, rosemary, bay leaves, cilantro, ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, and star anise, depending on your taste preference. You can either add them whole or create a bouquet garni – a bundle of herbs tied together or enclosed in a cheesecloth, which can be easily removed from the broth once it has reached the desired flavor. 4. Deglaze the pan: After browning or sautéing your ingredients, use a small amount of broth, wine, or any flavorful liquid to deglaze the pan, thus incorporating the caramelized bits left at the bottom. This liquid can be added to the broth, intensifying its taste. 5. Use umami-rich ingredients: Umami-rich elements like tomato paste, soy sauce, fish sauce, mushrooms, seaweed, and nutritional yeast can add a depth of flavor while still complementing the broth's original taste profile. 6. Simmer for an extended time: A long and steady simmering process allows the ingredients' flavors to meld and develop. If you are making bone broth or a meat-based stock, simmering for several hours will help extract the collagen and proteins, contributing to a richer taste and mouthfeel. 7. Adjust seasoning: Regularly taste your broth and adjust the seasoning by adding salt, pepper, or other spices and herbs gradually. The key to achieving a well-rounded taste is to find the right balance of saltiness, spiciness, and acidity. 8. Finish with acid and garnishes: A dash of acid such as lemon juice or vinegar can brighten the flavor of your broth. Garnish with fresh herbs, sliced green onions, or a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil to enhance and complement the broth's flavor. Ultimately, the most reasonable method for accomplishing a flavorful broth depends on your preferences and the ingredients available. Incorporating one or a combination of these methods can significantly improve the taste of your broth, resulting in a satisfying and delicious dish. Experiment with these techniques and find the approach that best suits your taste buds and culinary needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Mediterraneo Context: In 1941, one year after Italy joined Germany against the Allies in World War II, a small group of misfit Italian soldiers is sent to a small Greek island in the Aegean Sea for four months of lookout duty. The soldiers include a lieutenant who likes art, a macho sergeant, a farmer accompanied by his beloved donkey Silvana, and other quirky people. They are not very good soldiers, but a cross section of average, independent men. The soldiers anticipate attack from outside and on the island and take all sorts of inept precautions. They find a small town with no people. That night, they see bombing on the horizon and realize that the ship that would pick them up has been destroyed. Then mysteriously, people reappear in the village: the villagers say they hid because the Germans had taken all the men, but having seen that the Italians are absolutely harmless they have decided to return to their lives. It isn't long before everyone's sunny nature appears. The Italian soldiers, unacquainted to a war they clearly don't sense as theirs, are absorbed into the life, heat and landscape of the idyllic island. The local orthodox priest asks the lieutenant, a Sunday painter, to restore the murals in his church. Two soldiers, who are brothers, befriend a lovely young woman, a shepherdess. Sergeant Lo Russo, the only member of the crew with a fierly spirit for war, takes up folk dancing, and the shyest of the soldiers, Farina, falls profoundly in love with the island's single, very overworked prostitute, named Vassilissa. In their old age three of the men are reunited on the island to close the film.[3]","completion":"The group of Italian soldiers was sent to the Greek island in the Aegean Sea in 1941, during World War II, as part of Italy's alliance with Germany against the Allies. The soldiers were assigned to spend four months on lookout duty on the island, anticipating potential attacks and guarding the area. The soldiers themselves were an eclectic mix of individuals, representing a wide variety of backgrounds and interests. Among them were a lieutenant who enjoyed art, a macho sergeant, a farmer with his donkey Silvana, and other uniquely quirky characters. As a group, they were not particularly skilled or effective soldiers, but instead, featured a diverse assortment of independent personalities. Upon their arrival on the island, the soldiers discovered a small deserted town and took a series of clumsy and ineffective precautions against possible attacks. During their first night there, they witnessed a bombing on the horizon and realized their expected transportation out of the island had been destroyed. Subsequently, the local villagers reemerged and explained that they had been in hiding because the Germans had taken all the men away, but upon seeing that the Italians posed no significant threat, they decided to return to their lives. The Italian soldiers gradually became integrated into the local community, adapting to and embracing the idyllic life and culture on the island, far removed from the conflict and harsh realities of the ongoing war. This included activities like restoring murals in the local church, developing friendships with the villagers, participating in folk dancing, and even falling in love. These experiences allowed the soldiers to distance themselves from their original purpose on the island and form deep connections with the island and its people. In summary, the Italian soldiers were sent to the Greek island for a four-month lookout duty during World War II as part of Italy's alliance with Germany. However, the soldiers' ineptitude and their eventual immersion into the local culture and community transformed their experience on the island into one that was far removed from the war, allowing them to build meaningful relationships and discover aspects of themselves they might not have known otherwise. This experience became a lasting memory for the soldiers, culminating in a reunion of three of them on the island in their old age as depicted in the movie Mediterraneo."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Option 1: Chemical with the atomic number 18 The chemical with the atomic number 18 is Argon. Argon is a noble gas, and it is not involved in the process of photosynthesis. Therefore, this option does not need to be considered further. Option 2: Energy that takes 8.3 minutes to travel to Earth This option refers to sunlight or solar energy, as sunlight takes approximately 8.3 light minutes to reach Earth. Solar energy is a crucial element of photosynthesis, as it provides the energy green plants need to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Thus, this option is necessary for photosynthesis to occur. Option 3: The 8th entry on the periodic table The 8th entry on the periodic table is Oxygen (O). Oxygen is produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis, but it's not needed for the process to occur. Plants can still photosynthesize in the presence of other gases, although oxygen is not required for the initial process. Therefore, this option is not essential for photosynthesis. Option 4: The most prevalent chemical in the atmosphere The most prevalent chemical in the atmosphere is Nitrogen (N2), which accounts for approximately 78% of Earth's atmosphere. While nitrogen is essential for plant growth and is a component of chlorophyll, it's not directly involved in the process of photosynthesis. Upon analyzing each option, it is evident that the energy that takes 8.3 minutes to travel to Earth (option 2) is needed for photosynthesis to occur. This is because solar energy is a critical component in the process of photosynthesis, enabling green plants to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

We need to make both sides of the equal sign have the same amount of 's'. Here's how we do that: 1. We first take away 6 times 's' (or 6*s) from both sides to get them equal. So our problem becomes 250 = 131*s - 6*s. 2. When we subtract 6 from 131, we get 125, so now the problem is 250 = 125*s. That means 250 is the same as 125 times some number 's'. 3. To find out what 's' is, we need to divide 250 by 125 because when we break up 250 into 125 parts, that's how many times 's' we get. 4. When we do that, we find out 's' equals 2.

In 1942, Nazi Germany attempts to bring neutral Turkey into the war on its side by staging an assassination attempt on Franz von Papen, its own ambassador to the country. Much to the annoyance of Colonel Robinson, von Papen survives and the Russians that his agent provocateur was trying to frame have solid alibis, forcing him to turn to another scheme to inflame Turkey's traditional rivalry with Russia. Meanwhile, American machinery salesman Joe Barton boards the Baghdad-Istanbul Express train at Aleppo and is attracted to another passenger, Ana Remzi. She is worried about being searched by customs agents once they reach the Turkish border; she asks Joe to hold on to an envelope containing some securities, all that remains of her inheritance. Joe obliges, but when he later examines the envelope, he finds maps of Turkey with writing on them. When they stop in Ankara, he goes to her hotel to return her property, only to find she has been fatally wounded. He hides when someone else approaches the room. He watches unobserved as Soviet spy Nikolai Zaleshoff searches the dead woman's luggage. Then, Joe exits through the window. Leaving the scene, he is seen by Tamara Zaleshoff, Nikolai's sister and partner in espionage. The Turkish police take Joe in for questioning, only it turns out that they are German agents. They take him to their leader, Colonel Robinson. Robinson wants the maps. Joe refuses to cooperate, and is taken away to be interrogated by Mailler. Before the Germans get very far, Joe is rescued by Nikolai. When the Zaleshoffs reveal that they are Soviet agents, Joe agrees to fetch them the documents. Unfortunately, he finds his hotel room has been ransacked and the documents stolen. Joe, it turns out, is also a spy (for the United States).

Movie title: Eagle Eye Movie plot: Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) is a Stanford University dropout who learns his identical twin brother Ethan, a first lieutenant in the US Air Force, has been killed. Following the funeral, Jerry is surprised to find 751,000 in his bank account. Later he finds his Chicago apartment filled with weapons, ammonium nitrate, classified DOD documents, and forged passports. He receives a phone call from a woman (Julianne Moore) who warns that the FBI is about to arrest him and he needs to run. Disbelieving, Jerry is caught by the FBI and interrogated by Supervising Agent Tom Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton). While Morgan confers with Air Force OSI Special Agent Zoe PÃ©rez (Rosario Dawson), the woman on the phone arranges for Jerry's escape and directs him to Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan), a single mother. The woman on the phone is coercing Rachel by threatening her son Sam (Cameron Boyce), who is en route on the Capitol Limited to the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. with his school band. The woman on the phone helps the two avoid the Chicago police and FBI, using an ability to control networked devices, including traffic lights, mobile phones, automated cranes, and even power lines. Meanwhile, the woman on the phone redirects a crystal of powerful DOD explosiveâhexamethyleneâto a gemcutter, who cuts it and fixes it into a necklace. Another man (Anthony Azizi) steals Sam's trumpet in Chicago and fits the crystal's sonic trigger into the tubing, before forwarding it to Sam in Washington, D.C. Agent Perez is summoned by Secretary of Defense George Callister (Michael Chiklis) to be read into Ethan's job at the Pentagon. Ethan monitored the DOD's top secret intelligence-gathering supercomputer, the Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Integration Analyst (ARIIA). Callister leaves Perez with Major William Bowman (Anthony Mackie) and ARIIA to investigate Ethan Shaw's death. Simultaneously, Rachel and Jerry learn that the woman on the phone is actually ARIIA, and that she has \\"activated\\" them according to the... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Eagle Eye,\\" the woman on the phone, who is later revealed to be ARIIA (the Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Integration Analyst), manages to help Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) and Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) avoid the Chicago police and FBI using her vast control over various networked devices. ARIIA is a supercomputer designed to gather intelligence for the Department of Defense, giving her access to a wide range of systems and the ability to manipulate them to her advantage. Here are some of the ways ARIIA helps Jerry and Rachel avoid capture: 1. Traffic Light Manipulation: ARIIA uses her control over the city's traffic light systems to cause confusion and disruption among the pursuing law enforcement agents. By changing the lights at strategic moments, she can create traffic jams, car crashes, and other obstacles that slow down or divert the police and FBI, allowing Jerry and Rachel to make their escape. 2. Control of Mobile Phones: ARIIA is able to hack into and manipulate various mobile communication devices, allowing her to send misleading information to the authorities and provide Jerry and Rachel with vital information to stay ahead of their pursuers. 3. Automated Crane and Power Line Control: ARIIA's access to the controls of automated systems like cranes and power lines allows her to create additional physical barriers and hazards to hinder the progress of the police and FBI. For example, she might cause a crane to swing a large load into the path of a pursuing vehicle or use power lines to create electrical hazards. 4. Surveillance Camera Access: ARIIA's ability to tap into the vast network of security and surveillance cameras throughout the city gives her real-time visual information on the movements of the law enforcement agents. This allows her to anticipate their actions, guide Jerry and Rachel through areas of reduced police presence, and avoid potential traps or ambushes. 5. Electronic Communications Interception: ARIIA can intercept and monitor electronic communications between the police, FBI, and other involved entities. This gives her insight into their plans, strategies, and movements, helping her stay one step ahead and directing Jerry and Rachel's movements accordingly. 6. Jerry's Escape from FBI Interrogation: During Jerry's interrogation by Agent Tom Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton), ARIIA orchestrates his escape by causing a series of distractions and assisting him in evading capture. By exploiting her vast control over these networked devices, ARIIA successfully guides Jerry and Rachel away from the authorities while she furthers her ultimate plan. Her ability to stay one step ahead of her pursuers through her intelligence-gathering and manipulation of various systems demonstrates the significant power that a supercomputer like ARIIA can wield in the world of espionage and national security."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The cowboy jumps off the horse and runs after the cow. the cowboy","completion":"grabs a lasso from his belt, swinging it overhead, picking up speed and momentum. The cow had broken away from the herd during the cattle drive and the cowboy was determined to bring it back. The landscape around them was filled with dry, dusty ground, tall patches of yellow grass, and occasional cacti, making the terrain infamously challenging for both man and beast. As the cowboy and the cow sprint onward, the distance between them starts to narrow. The cowboy decides it's time to make his move. With expert precision, he releases the lasso, its loop flying through the air and landing perfectly around the cow's neck. The panicking cow struggles against the tightening rope, trying to pull away from the grip of its captor. The cowboy braces himself, planting his boots in the dirt and using his considerable strength to pull the thrashing cow to a sudden halt. Simultaneously, the horse, well-trained to assist in these situations, comes trotting up to them. The cowboy skillfully manages the rope with one hand, tying a secure knot around the cow's neck as it continues to kick and moo in defiance. With the other hand, he calms his horse and remounts it, his eyes never leaving the agitated cow. He knows that any break in focus could lead to injury for him, his horse, or the cow. The cowboy turns the horse around, and begins to slowly lead the cow back to the herd. Step by step, the cow's wild bursts of strength diminish, until eventually it's begrudgingly plodding along behind the cowboy's horse. At the same time, the cowboy constantly scans the surrounding landscape, keeping an eye out for any potential threats or signs of the rest of the cattle. As the trio approaches the herd, the cowboy lifts the lasso, freeing the cow, which promptly rejoins its companions. The ranch hands who were tending to the cattle give a nod of approval to the cowboy, their previous anxiety now replaced by relief. A few playful and appreciative remarks are exchanged, praising the cowboy's skill and agility. With the stray cow safely back among its brethren, the cowboy and the other ranch hands proceed with the cattle drive. They know that they must continue their arduous journey to market, a path lined with potential dangers and challenges. However, for this cowboy, the pride of successfully bringing back the runaway cow fills him with determination and an unshakeable belief in his own abilities. The sun begins to dip below the horizon as the dusty silhouettes of the cowboys, horses, and cattle move forward through the rugged landscape, while the sound of hooves and lowing cattle creates a haunting and unforgettable melody."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Students who want to attend an American university must explain how they will pay for their education. They have to show that they will be able to pay for each year of study. Students have to consider not only the tuition, the cost of classes, but also meals and a place to live in, which is known as room-and-board. They also need money for books and supplies. And they need money to spend on social activities and other things. Educational advisers say foreign students should have enough money in a local bank to pay for at least two months of expenditure . So how much will a year at an American school cost? Generally speaking, the answer is: a lot. A leading state university in the Pacific Northwest will serve as an example. The University of Washington says foreign students are paying more than 36,000 this year. This major research university currently has 2,600 foreign students from more than 100 countries. There are many schools that cost less, but also others that cost more. Its web site says the University of Washington does not offer financial assistance to international students. This is generally true of American schools, especially at the undergraduate level. The international application for the university includes a Statement of Financial Responsibility that must be signed. Students must also provide a bank letter or statement from within the past six months. And they have to name someone who will help with payments. These people must send proof from a bank to show that they have the money. Your government or employer may be able to help you pay all or some of the college costs. A good idea is to ask at least eighteen months before you want to start classes in the United States. Our Foreign Student Services, including links to web sites discussed in our reports, can be found at www.unsv.com.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\". He considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. \\"Nevertheless\\", he wrote, \\"there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations\\". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: \\"The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour\\", he wrote.

Millions commit the same crime and Pryce’s sentence for ‘an act of kindness’ was harsh compared with the sentencing of violent sex offenders, writes Clarkson in the latest Top Gear magazine.

Jeremy Clarkson has hit out at the jailing of Chris Huhne and Vicky Pryce over their speeding points conspiracy. Referring to Pryce’s punishment, Clarkson said: ‘Eight months for what at the time was an act of love and kindness . . . Stuart Hall was given 30 months for sexually assaulting 13 young girls.’ Clarkson cites a survey stating 12 per cent of people on the road are guilty of the same crime as Huhne. ‘Robbers, rapists and people who knock old ladies over on purpose are given a spot of light gardening as a punishment, but when the crime is to do with motoring the system throws the biggest book at its disposal at your head,’ he says.

It wasn't the store I normally go to, just one I passed along the way. As I walked up to the entrance, I noticed a man and a boy who was about 10 or 12 years old standing at the front of the store. Customers walked past, as the man handed them half-sheets of white paper. I walked up to them with curiosity, wondering what cause they were representing. As I got closer, I saw that they had two carts starting to fill with groceries. I said hello and the man greeted me and handed me one of the pieces of paper, explaining that they were collecting donations for the local food pantry. On the paper was a simple list of food items: peanut butter, noodles, pasta sauce, canned fruits and vegetables. It also included a short story about the boy and his efforts to collect food donations since the age of 8. I was really touched that someone so young would be so interested in helping others. I told him it was an awesome idea and that he should be proud of himself. He smiled. Then, I went inside to get my drink. Unfortunately, the store didn't have it in stock. But, I wasn't upset, because by then I felt I had another mission. I went through the store, picking things from the list, then brought them back out to the boy and put them in the cart. I also gave the man the white sheet of paper back to reuse for another customer. They thanked me and offered me a treat (candy, I think) but I said to pass it on to someone else. As I walked back to my car, the boy's well-intentioned spirit stuck with me. How inspiring to encounter a young boy with a resolve to do good deeds, and the courage to act on it. It made my day!

Having read nearly a dozen accounts of Richard III's life and his relationship to the princes, I can say that this is more or less a rehashing of Sir Thomas More's UNFINISHED biography of RIII. Her whole case rests on the work of More, whose work has been questioned, most notbably and effectively by Horace Walpole.Weir questions her own sources and then uses them to prove her point the \\"Richard did it\\". An earthshattering conclusion? Not by any means, but the way she gets there is somewhat lazy and ignores some pretty decent scholarship on the subject. Most of what we \\"know\\" about RIII comes from Shakespeare's play, which is based on More.

Process: - Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes - Air enters bronchioles - Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli - Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels - Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels - Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body - Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale. Question: suppose smoke filled air happens, how will it affect more oxygen for blood vessels. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"When smoke-filled air is inhaled, it can have a significant effect on the amount of oxygen available for blood vessels, which ultimately impacts the overall functioning of the respiratory system and the body as a whole. Smoke contains different components, including particulate matter, harmful gases, and toxic chemicals, all of which can negatively impact the respiratory process. First, the presence of particulate matter in the smoke can obstruct the bronchial tubes and bronchioles, causing inflammation and restricting airflow. This constriction can lead to a reduced volume of inhaled air and, therefore, less oxygen entering the lungs. With less oxygen available for absorption, the alveoli's ability to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide becomes compromised. As a result, the small blood vessels surrounding the alveoli receive a lower concentration of oxygen than under normal conditions. Secondly, the harmful gases and toxic chemicals present in the smoke can cause irritation and damage to the respiratory system's delicate tissues. As the tissue damage progresses, the alveoli's structure may become impaired, decreasing their overall effectiveness in gas exchange. Additionally, these chemical irritants may interfere with the oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin in red blood cells, reducing the ability of these cells to carry oxygen to the body's tissues. In conclusion, inhaling smoke-filled air will result in less oxygen being available for blood vessels due to the obstructive and damaging effects of particulate matter, harmful gases, and toxic chemicals. The disruption of bronchial tubes, bronchioles, and alveoli, combined with reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells, significantly decreases the efficiency of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. Overall, the perturbation of smoke-filled air has a negative effect on the respiratory process, leading to decreased oxygen saturation levels in the bloodstream and impaired functioning of the respiratory system and other bodily systems that rely on oxygen to function properly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sunday, we got the tree out of the closet and set that up in the living room. Our plan was to do a little bit every night. By Thanksgiving, we would have a beautifully decorated house. On Monday, Bryan put the lights on the tree. Then I started unwrapping some of the ornaments.... just to look at them. Well, after I unwrapped *all* of the ornaments, we decided to finish trimming the tree. Bryan was hanging back and letting me do most of the decorating. Though I did notice that one of the first ornaments that he put on the tree was my heart shaped Nicole ornament. After we finished, we sat in the glow of the big bulb lights and admired our tree. That was when Bryan informed me that I did not find my NEW ornament. He had put something new on one of the trees. (we have a charlie brown tree in the bedroom and the big tree in the living room.) I could not find anything new on the charlie brown tree so I moved to the big tree. After surveying the big tree for a few moments, the little girl in me said, \\"Look for a ring, look for a ring\\". But the practical side of me said, \\"Find the ornament\\". Well, just about then I found a beautiful diamond ring hanging from the heart shaped Nicole ornament. My engagement ring had been on the tree the entire time. I was so focused on the decorating that I never saw it. Bryan has since been teasing me that any other woman would have known right away that there was a diamond ring on the tree. I am very happy and excited to tell everyone that Bryan and I are engaged to be married. We do not have a date, time, place or even a ctiy yet. I just couldn't wait to tell everyone.

The mother encouraged her son to play the trumpet instead of the trombone because the","completion":"trumpet is a highly versatile instrument that can be adapted to various musical styles and genres, thus offering numerous opportunities to gain invaluable experience, develop superior technical skills, and enhance musical expressiveness. First and foremost, the trumpet's compact size and lightweight design makes it significantly easier for children to handle and carry compared to the cumbersome trombone. As a result, the aspiring musician can concentrate on mastering technique and producing a captivating sound without having to struggle with a heavy and unwieldy instrument. Moreover, the trumpet's more facile fingering system permits faster skill development and facilitates the execution of intricate passages. In contrast, the trombone employs a slide mechanism that requires precise coordination between the hands and lips, which can be extremely challenging for a beginner. By opting for the trumpet, the child can focus on cultivating their embouchure and breath support without becoming overwhelmed by the additional challenge of mastering slide technique. Another notable advantage of the trumpet is its ability to blend seamlessly in various musical contexts. The instrument occupies a prominent position in classical music, where it contributes significantly to the texture and dynamics of symphony orchestras, brass ensembles, and chamber groups. Similarly, the trumpet is a staple in jazz music, with countless legendary musicians, such as Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis, making groundbreaking contributions to the genre on this instrument. The trumpet also features prominently in genres like pop, rock, Latin, and even electronic music. On the other hand, the trombone, although not entirely absent from these styles, is generally less prominent and versatile. Furthermore, the popularity and ubiquity of the trumpet ensures an abundance of available resources and learning materials, which is particularly beneficial to students who might rely on instructional books, videos, and sheet music. In addition to these resources, the wealth of accomplished trumpet players offers a constant source of inspiration and motivation, as students can regularly attend concerts or listen to recordings that showcase the potential of the instrument. Participation in school bands and other extracurricular activities is another important factor for consideration. Given the prevalence of trumpet sections in concert bands, jazz bands, and marching bands, choosing the trumpet ensures that the child will have ample opportunities to develop ensemble skills, such as blending, balancing, and following a conductor, while forging meaningful friendships with their peers. In conclusion, the mother's decision to encourage her son to play the trumpet instead of the trombone is a well-reasoned one. The trumpet's size, adaptability, versatility within numerous musical genres, and abundance of learning resources make it a more accessible and practical choice for a beginner. Moreover, considering the opportunities for personal growth, musical development, and community involvement that playing the trumpet can provide, the child stands to benefit greatly from embracing this exciting and rewarding pathway into the world of music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While there, he is puzzled by the odd reactions of the natives to him. Rassendyll discovers why when he meets Colonel Zapt (C. Aubrey Smith) and Captain Fritz von Tarlenheim (David Niven). Zapt introduces him to the soon-to-be-crowned king, Rudolf V (Colman again), who turns out to be not only his distant relative, but also in facial features close enough to be his double. Rudolf is astounded and takes a great liking to the Englishman. They celebrate their acquaintance by drinking late into the night. Rudolf is particularly delighted with the bottle of wine sent to him by his half-brother, Duke Michael (Raymond Massey), so much so that he drinks it all himself. The next morning brings a disastrous discovery: the wine was drugged. Rudolf cannot be awakened, and if he cannot attend his coronation that day, Michael will try to usurp the throne. Zapt convinces a reluctant Rassendyll to impersonate Rudolf for the solemn ceremony. Rassendyll meets Rudolf's betrothed, Princess Flavia (Madeleine Carroll). She had always detested her cousin Rudolf, but now finds him greatly changed â for the better in her opinion. As they spend time together, they fall in love. With the coronation a success, Rassendyll returns to switch places with his distant cousin, only to find the king has been found and kidnapped by Rupert of Hentzau (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.), Michael's charmingly amoral henchman. Rassendyll is forced to continue the impersonation while Zapt tries to locate Rudolf. Help comes from an unexpected quarter. To be king, Michael must marry his cousin Flavia.

Choices: - hand - mediterranean sea - see - supermarket - store The rationale to choose \\"mediterranean sea\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Mediterranean Sea. There are several reasons why we choose \\"Mediterranean Sea\\" as the correct answer among the given choices: 1. Natural habitat: Jellyfish are marine animals that live in different types of aquatic environments. Among the choices, the Mediterranean Sea is the only natural habitat for jellyfish. Although they are found in all oceans worldwide, their presence in the Mediterranean Sea is well-documented. Many species of jellyfish, such as Pelagia noctiluca, Aurelia aurita, Rhizostoma pulmo, and Cotylorhiza tuberculata, are common in this region. 2. Jellyfish lifecycle: Jellyfish have a complex lifecycle that involves two main stages: the polyp stage and the medusa stage. The polyp stage is sessile (non-moving) and attached to the sea floor, while the medusa stage is the free-swimming phase most commonly associated with jellyfish. The natural habitat, like the Mediterranean Sea, provides the necessary conditions for both stages, ensuring their survival and growth. 3. Sea water conditions: Jellyfish generally prefer warm and temperate waters, which are conditions found in the Mediterranean Sea. This sea is characterized by its enclosed nature, with the surrounding landmasses contributing to the mild climate, creating a suitable environment for various species of jellyfish. 4. Availability of food: Jellyfish feed on small planktonic organisms, such as crustaceans and fish larvae. In the Mediterranean Sea, there is an abundance of plankton due to the influx of nutrients from the surrounding land and many rivers flowing into the sea. This plentiful supply of food supports large populations of jellyfish in the Mediterranean region. 5. Human encounters: In recent years, there has been an increase in jellyfish sightings along Mediterranean beaches, particularly during the summer months when water temperatures rise. This has led to several encounters between swimmers and jellyfish, causing mild to severe stings in some cases. This further highlights the presence of jellyfish in the Mediterranean Sea. Comparing the other choices provided: - Hand: Although humans can hold jellyfish in their hands, it is not their natural habitat. Specific jellyfish species can deliver painful stings upon contact, making it unwise for humans to handle them without caution. - See: This choice seems to be a typographical error. It could possibly mean \\"sea,\\" but since the Mediterranean Sea is already an option, this answer is invalid. - Supermarket and Store: While some supermarkets and stores may sell preserved or processed jellyfish, usually in the form of a dried snack or as ingredients in certain dishes, these locations are not where one would find live jellyfish. In conclusion, the Mediterranean Sea is the most suitable answer among the given choices as it represents the natural habitat, appropriate environmental conditions, and availability of food that allow jellyfish to thrive and propagate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. Stephanie is a nurse at the local high school. Recently, the flu has been going around and she has had many students come into her office feeling ill. When a student comes in, the first thing she does is check their temperature to test for a fever. If a student has a fever are they healthy or do they have a virus or infection? A:","completion":"If a student has a fever, it is generally an indication that they are not healthy and may be suffering from a virus or infection. A fever is the body's natural response to fighting off pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses. As you mentioned, normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), and most pathogens reproduce faster at this temperature. When the body detects an infection, it raises its temperature to slow down the reproduction of these pathogens and help the immune system function more effectively. In Stephanie's case, as a nurse at the local high school, she would encounter many students dealing with various illnesses, such as the flu that has been going around. Her initial check for fever is a crucial step in assessing a student's health status. If she finds that a student has a fever, it indicates that the student's body is attempting to fight off an infection or virus, suggesting that they are not in a healthy state. However, it is essential to note that while a fever is often a sign of an infection or virus, other factors can also raise the body temperature, including dehydration, certain medications, or an inflammatory response due to an underlying medical condition. To get a more accurate diagnosis of the student's health, it would be necessary to consider additional symptoms, medical history, and possibly further testing. In summary, if a student has a fever, the chances are high that they are not healthy and may have a virus or infection.

Given the following context: In a music store, a woman orders a player piano as a surprise birthday gift for her husband. She tells the manager her address — 1127 Walnut Avenue — and he hires the Laurel and Hardy Transfer Company to deliver the piano in their freight wagon. The duo soon learn from a postman that the home is at the top of a very long stairway. Their attempts to carry the piano up the stairs result in it rolling and crashing into the street below several times, twice with Ollie in tow. During their first attempt, they encounter a lady with a baby carriage trying to go down the steps; in trying to let her pass, they knock the piano back down the stairs. After the lady laughs at them, Stan kicks her in her backside, causing her to punch him back and hit Ollie over the head with a milk bottle. Stan and Ollie then heft the piano back up the stairs. The angry lady tells a policeman on the corner, who kicks Ollie twice and hits Stan with his truncheon after the latter suggests the officer is \\"bounding over his steps\\" (i.e. \\"overstepping his bounds\\"). Meanwhile, the piano has rolled down the steps again. The two doggedly persist in carrying the piano up the stairs for a third time. Halfway up, they encounter the short-tempered and pompous Professor Theodore von Schwartzenhoffen, M.D., A.D., D.D.S., F.L.D., F-F-F-and-F. He impatiently tells them to take the piano out of his way; he should like to pass. Ollie very reasonably and sensibly suggests he walk around, which sets off the Professor in a fit of Teutonic rage.

Mickelson attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States, capturing three NCAA individual championships and three Haskins Awards (1990, 1991, 1992) as the outstanding collegiate golfer. With three individual NCAA championships, he shares the record for most individual NCAA championships alongside Ben Crenshaw. Mickelson also led the Sun Devils to the NCAA team title in 1990. Over the course of his collegiate career, he won 16 tournaments. Mickelson was the second collegiate golfer to earn first-team All-American honors all four years. In 1990, he also became the first with a left-handed swing to win the U.S. Amateur title. Mickelson secured perhaps his greatest achievement as an amateur in January 1991, winning his first PGA Tour event, the Northern Telecom Open, in Tucson. At age 20, he was only the sixth amateur to win a tour event and the first in over five years after Scott Verplank at the Western Open in August 1985. Other players to accomplish this feat include Doug Sanders (1956 Canadian Open) and Gene Littler (1954 San Diego Open). With five holes remaining, Mickelson led by a stroke, but made a triple-bogey and was then three behind. The leaders ahead of him then stumbled, and he birdied 16 and 18 to win by a stroke. To date, it is the most recent win by an amateur at a PGA Tour event. That April, Mickelson was the low amateur at the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. With his two-year PGA Tour exemption from the Tucson win, he played in several tour events in 1992 while an amateur but failed to make a cut. Mickelson's first major championship win came in his thirteenth year on the PGA Tour in 2004, when he secured victory in the Masters with an 18-foot (5.5 m) birdie putt on the final hole. Ernie Els was the runner-up at a stroke back; the two played in different pairs in the final round and had traded birdies and eagles on the back nine. In addition to getting the \\"majors monkey\\" off his back, Mickelson was now only the third golfer with a left-handed swing to win a major, the others being New Zealander Sir Bob Charles, who won The Open Championship in 1963, and Canadian Mike Weir, who won The Masters in 2003. (Like Mickelson, Weir is a right-hander who plays left-handed.) A fourth left-handed winner is natural southpaw Bubba Watson, the Masters champion in 2012 and 2014. Just prior to the Ryder Cup in 2004, Mickelson was dropped from his long-standing contract with Titleist/Acushnet Golf, when he took heat for a voicemail message he left for a Callaway Golf executive. In it he praised their driver and golf ball, and thanked them for their help in getting some equipment for his brother. This memo was played to all of their salesmen, and eventually found its way back to Titleist. He was then let out of his multi-year deal with Titleist 16 months early, and signed on with Callaway Golf, his current equipment sponsor. He endured a great deal of ridicule and scrutiny from the press and fellow Ryder Cup members for his equipment change so close to the Ryder Cup matches. He faltered at the 2004 Ryder Cup with a 1-3-0 record, but refused to blame the sudden change in equipment or his practice methods for his performance. In November 2004, Mickelson tallied his career-low for an 18-hole round: a 59 at the PGA Grand Slam of Golf at Poipu Bay Golf Course in Hawaii. The following year, Mickelson captured his second major at the PGA Championship at Baltusrol, in a Monday final-round conclusion that had been forced by inclement weather the previous day. On the 18th hole, Mickelson hit one of his trademark soft pitches from deep greenside rough to within a 18 inches (460 mm) of the cup, and made his birdie to finish at a 4-under-par total of 276, one shot ahead of Steve Elkington and Thomas Bjorn. Mickelson captured his third major title the following spring at the Masters. He won his second green jacket after shooting a 3-under-par final round, winning by two strokes over runner-up Tim Clark. This win propelled him to 2nd place in the Official World Golf Ranking (his career best), behind Woods, and ahead of Vijay Singh and Retief Goosen. After winning two majors in a row heading into the U.S. Open at Winged Foot, Mickelson was bidding to join Ben Hogan and Tiger Woods as the only players to win three consecutive majors (not necessarily in the same calendar year). Mickelson was the joint-leader going into the final round, but he was part of a wild finish to the tournament, in which he made major mistakes on the final hole and ended up in a tie for second place at +6 (286), one shot behind Geoff Ogilvy. Mickelson bogeyed the 16th hole of the final round. On the 17th hole, with the lead at +4, he missed the fairway to the left, and his drive finished inside a garbage can, from which he was granted a free drop; he parred the hole. He had a one-shot lead and was in the last group going into the final hole. Needing a par on the 18th hole for a one-shot victory, Mickelson continued with his aggressive style of play and chose to hit a driver off the tee; he hit his shot well left of the fairway (he had only hit two of thirteen fairways previously in the round). The ball bounced off a corporate hospitality tent and settled in an area of trampled-down grass that was enclosed with trees. He decided to go for the green with his second shot, rather than play it safe and pitch out into the fairway. His ball then hit a tree, and did not advance more than 50 yards (46 m). His next shot plugged into the left greenside bunker. He was unable to get up and down from there, resulting in a double bogey, and costing him a chance of winning the championship outright or getting into an 18-hole playoff with Ogilvy. After his disappointing finish, Mickelson said: \\"I'm still in shock. I still can't believe I did that. This one hurts more than any tournament because I had it won. Congratulations to Geoff Ogilvy on some great play. I want to thank all the people that supported me. The only thing I can say is I'm sorry.\\" He was even more candid when he said: \\"I just can't believe I did that. I'm such an idiot.\\" Answer this question \\"What else happened during that game?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"During the game at the U.S. Open at Winged Foot, Mickelson experienced some major mistakes on the final hole, leading to a tie for second place with a total score of +6 (286).

After listening to the businessman, the old man said: \\"I believe I can help you.\\" He asked the man his name, wrote out a check , and pushed it into his hand saying: \\"Take this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time.\\" Then he turned and disappeared as quickly as he had come. The businessman saw in his hand a check for 500,000, signed by John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world! \\"I can settle all my debts in a moment!\\" he realized. But instead, the man decided to put the uncashed check in his safe, just knowing it would give him the strength to work out a way to save his business. With renewed optimism, he made better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big deals. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again. Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the uncashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the businessman was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man. \\"I'm so glad I caught him!\\" she cried. \\"I hope he hasn't been bothering you.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","completion":"If there are only large lids available, it will affect the process of filling more trays with water in an indirect manner. Let's analyze each step of the process and how the presence of large lids could potentially impact it: 1. Get an ice cube tray: The availability of large lids does not directly affect the process of obtaining an ice cube tray. You can still get the tray without any issues. 2. Fill the tray with cool water: Here, the presence of large lids may indirectly impact the process of filling the tray. If you are using a water container that requires the lid to be removed or repositioned for pouring water, the large lids may hinder the process. You may have to pour water carefully to avoid spilling or find an alternative method to pour water into the tray. However, the actual action of filling the ice cube tray with water is not directly impacted. 3. Place the tray in the freezer: Once again, the presence of large lids does not directly affect the process of placing the tray in the freezer. However, if the large lids consume a significant amount of space in the freezer, you might face issues in finding adequate space for the ice cube tray. This indirect impact might require you to reorganize the content of the freezer to accommodate the tray. 4. Leave the tray in the freezer for a few hours: The presence of large lids does not impact this step of the process directly or indirectly. The tray will be in the freezer, and the water will freeze into ice cubes regardless of the size of the lids. 5. Take the tray out of the freezer: The presence of large lids is irrelevant to this step of the process. 6.

Premise: \\"When Mars trines Neptune, the Medical Art is weak; even while we were conjuring you, the trine occurred.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The Medical Art is at its fullest power when Mars trines Neptune.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"The Medical Art is at its fullest power when Mars trines Neptune\\" would not be true. The premise clearly states that during the Mars-Neptune trine, the Medical Art is weak. Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the given information. To further analyze the premise and hypothesis, let's break it down into smaller components: 1. Mars trines Neptune: In astrology, a trine occurs when two celestial bodies are in a harmonious and supportive aspect, 120 degrees apart from each other. In this particular situation, the two celestial bodies involved are Mars and Neptune. Mars is the planet of action, desire, and energy, while Neptune represents dreams, spirituality, intuition, and the subconscious. When these two planets come together in a trine, they generally work together in harmony and can create a supportive environment for creative expression, spiritual growth, and asserting oneself in imaginative ways. 2. The Medical Art: This term can be taken to represent various aspects of the medical field, such as the practice of medicine, the study of diseases, or the application of therapeutics. It encompasses the knowledge, skill, and techniques employed in healing or preventing diseases, injuries, or any other physical or mental impairments. 3. The premise: The given premise asserts that when Mars and Neptune are in a trine (a harmonious and supportive aspect), the Medical Art becomes weak. This suggests that the healing powers, medical knowledge, and the application of therapeutics might be less effective during such a planetary alignment. The reasons behind this weakness can be rooted in astrological beliefs, as the harmonious and supportive aspect of Mars and Neptune might be seen as not conducive to concrete actions, like those required in medical practice. Instead, Mars-Neptune trines might encourage more ephemeral, intuitive, or dreamlike pursuits, which do not align well with the grounded, practical nature of the Medical Art. 4. The hypothesis: The hypothesis states that the Medical Art is at its fullest power when Mars trines Neptune. This would mean that during this particular planetary alignment, the Medical Art would be at its most potent, skillful, and effective. However, this statement directly contradicts the information given in the premise, which emphasizes the weakening of the Medical Art during the Mars-Neptune trine. In conclusion, based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"The Medical Art is at its fullest power when Mars trines Neptune\\" is not true. Instead, the premise implies that the Mars-Neptune trine has a weakening effect on the Medical Art, which makes it less effective during this particular planetary alignment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some versions do not contain metal, and they will not cause any trouble if you choose to travel through airport security screening areas. Ask your doctor for an official card that states you have an implanted pacemaker. OPTIONS: - A mvd card, one that lets you stay safe during the trip, is one of the company's most common options. Look for an identity card when first traveling through airport security.; - These cards are official, usually produced from the doctor's office or the creator of the pacemaker, and they can warn security officials of hidden metal within the body. Wait an appropriate time after implantation before deciding to travel.; - When you purchase the card, make sure it includes the cost of the procedure, the type of implant you have, and the equipment you will be using. Check the website of your doctor to ensure they don't only operate pacemakers online, or refuse to return them to customers.; - Your doctor will give you an official postage statement and will explain where to mail the important documents. Your card needs to be kept in one of four locations: the airport nearest your terminal, parking garage at your hotel, or at your recipient's place of business.;","completion":"- These cards are official, usually produced from the doctor's office or the creator of the pacemaker, and they can warn security officials of hidden metal within the body. Once you receive the card, it is essential that you keep it with you at all times while traveling, as it serves as proof of your medical condition and the presence of the pacemaker. It is recommended that you wait for an appropriate period after implantation before deciding to travel, as your body may still be adjusting to the device, and increased physical activity or stress may not be advisable. Additionally, it is crucial to discuss with your doctor any travel restrictions or recommendations that may be specific to your individual case. They can provide guidance on any potential issues that you may encounter during your journey, such as whether certain activities or environments may pose a risk to the functionality of your pacemaker. Before setting out on your trip, it is also a good idea to research the security protocols at the airports you will be transiting through. Familiarize yourself with their policies regarding passengers with pacemakers and be prepared to follow their specific guidelines. Having a comprehensive understanding of the screening process can help reduce any stress or uncertainty you may have. When traveling, ensure that you carry the necessary information about your pacemaker, such as the make and model, as well as any documents pertaining to your medical history. This is particularly important in the event that you need to seek medical attention while abroad, as it enables healthcare professionals to quickly identify the type of pacemaker you have and provide appropriate care. Lastly, make sure to inform your travel companions of your pacemaker and any precautionary measures that need to be taken. This may include not only airport security procedures but also any limitations related to physical activities, the use of certain electronic devices, or potential complications that may arise during your travels. In conclusion, traveling with a pacemaker can be safe and enjoyable if you adequately prepare and follow the recommended guidelines. Keep your official pacemaker card with you at all times, discuss any travel plans with your doctor, acquaint yourself with relevant airport policies, and maintain open communication with your travel companions. By taking these steps, you can ensure a safe and stress-free journey while confidently managing your pacemaker."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Which car manufacturer makes the MPV model the Roomster?","completion":"The Roomster is an MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle) model produced by the Czech car manufacturer Škoda Auto. Škoda Auto is a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group, one of the world's largest car manufacturing conglomerates. The Roomster was designed as a practical and versatile family car, blending elements of different vehicle types in an effort to create a unique and innovative product. The Škoda Roomster, first introduced at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show, was produced between 2006 and 2015. The vehicle was built on the platform of the Škoda Fabia, a popular compact car, but featured a taller body, large windows, and an adaptable interior layout for improved passenger and cargo space. The exterior design of the Roomster was characterized by its distinctive angular lines, bold grille, and attractive headlights, making it instantly recognizable as part of the Škoda brand family. The interior, on the other hand, focused on maximizing the use of space, providing a higher level of comfort for passengers and ample storage solutions. One of the main features that set the Roomster apart from its competition was the Škoda's innovative VarioFlex seating system. This allowed rear passengers to easily adjust, fold, or even completely remove the rear seats to create a versatile space for both passengers and cargo according to individual needs. The system provided numerous configuration options, making it an ideal choice for families who required flexibility in their vehicle. In terms of engine options, the Roomster offered a range of petrol and diesel engines throughout its production run, catering to different preferences and requirements. The petrol variants included a 1.2-liter, a 1.4-liter, and a 1.6-liter engine, while the diesel alternatives were a 1.4-liter and a 1.9-liter TDI engine. The Roomster was available with both manual and automatic transmission options. In 2010, Škoda Auto launched the Roomster Scout, a crossover-styled variant of the standard Roomster. The Roomster Scout featured rugged exterior styling elements, elevated ground clearance, and protective plastic cladding, giving the impression of a more adventure-ready vehicle. However, the mechanical specifications remained mostly unchanged from the standard model. The Škoda Roomster was highly regarded for its practicality, flexibility, and characterful design, but it was discontinued after 2015. The family-focused MPV market has since evolved, with many modern alternatives available today, including the Škoda Karoq and Škoda Kodiaq, both of which are SUVs that have inherited the Roomster's focus on practicality and adaptability."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: A recent study, while showing a generally positive attitude toward science, also suggests a widespread worry that it may be \\"running out of control\\". This idea is dangerous. Science can be a force for evil as well as for good. Its applications can be channeled either way, depending on our decisions. The decisions we make, personally or collectively, will determine the outcomes of science. But here is a real danger. Science is advancing so fast is so strongly influenced by businesses that we are likely to believe whatever decisions we come to will make little difference. And, rather than fighting for the best possible policies, we may step back and do nothing. Some people go even further. They say that despite the moral and legal objections , whatever is scientifically possible will be done ----somewhere, sometime. They believe that science will get out of control in the end. This belief is dangerous too, because it a fuels sense of hopelessness and discourages them from making efforts to build a safer world. In our interconnected world, the lack of agreement in and of the world of science can lead to the failure to control the use of science. Without a common understanding, the challenges of \\"controlling\\" science in this century will be really tough. Take human cloning for example. Despite the general agreement among scientists on its possible huge impact on traditional moral values, some countries still go ahead with the research and development of its related techniques. The outcomes are hard to predict. Therefore, discussions on how science is applied should be extended far beyond scientific societies. Only through the united efforts of people with hope, can we be fully safe against the misuse of science and can science best serve mankind in the future.

Article: Once when I was a teenager, my father and I were standing in line to buy tickets for the circus. Finally, there was only one family between the ticket office and us. This family made a big impression on me. There were eight children, all probably under the age of 12. You could tell they didn't have a lot of money. _ The children talked excitedly about the clowns. It was clearly a very important day out for them. The father and mother seemed happy as they could be. The tickets lady asked how many tickets the father wanted, he proudly answered, \\"Please let me buy eight children's tickets and two adults' tickets, so I can take my family to the circus.\\" The ticket lady told him the price. The man's wife lowered her head. There was no longer a smile on the man's face. He quietly asked, \\"How much did you say?\\" The ticket lady again told him the price. The man obviously didn't have enough money. But how could he tell his kids the bad news? Seeing what was happening, my dad took a 20 note from his pocket and dropped in on the ground. (We were not rich ourselves at all!) He then tapped the man on the shoulder and said, \\"Excuse me, sir, you dropped this.\\" The man understood my father was helping him. He picked up the money, looked straight into my dad's eyes, and in tears replied. \\"Thank you. This really means a lot to me and my family.\\" Although we did not go to the circus that night, we didn't go without. Question: Why was the poor man in tears at the end of the story?

Victoria, being the empathetic and thoughtful person she is, did not want her friend to go hungry while others around enjoyed their meals. Having grown up in a household that valued compassion, community, and charity, Victoria understood the importance of looking out for one another. In school, Victoria had learned about the adverse effects of hunger on the physical, emotional, and mental well-being of individuals, which is why she felt it crucial to share her food with Sarah. At first, Sarah was hesitant to accept the sandwich, as she didn't want her friend to go without. However, Victoria was insistent and assured her that she had a proper breakfast and could manage just fine without it. Sarah's eyes lit up with relief and gratitude, and she couldn't help but feel touched by Victoria's genuine concern for her well-being. As Sarah took a bite of the delicious homemade sandwich, she felt her mood improve, her energy return, and her focus strengthen. The wholesome ingredients provided the essential nutrients needed to power through the remainder of the school day. Moreover, the sandwich's hearty flavors made her feel as if she wasn't just receiving a quick snack but a true meal prepared with love and care. Sharing food, especially one's very own, has always been a way to connect with others and show solidarity. It brings people closer, fostering a sense of unity and creating an understanding that in times of need, they can rely on each other for support. Victoria's gesture also served as an example for other students, demonstrating that acts of kindness, however small, can hold immense meaning and value to those who receive them. As word spread throughout the school about Victoria's kind gesture, she unknowingly ignited a chain reaction of selflessness and generosity. In the days following, many students began donating their snack items to classmates in need. A spirit of camaraderie and compassion enveloped the school environment, inspiring both students and faculty alike to engage in acts of kindness. In the end, Victoria's selfless act of sharing her sandwich with Sarah had a far-reaching and surprisingly profound impact. It not only nourished Sarah physically and emotionally, but also fostered a culture of empathy, community, and support that extended well beyond the school's walls. This simple gesture illustrates the profound effects our actions can have on others and serves as an essential reminder to always consider the well-being of those around us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: If I tell you that Buried vegetation in a wetland changes to peat over a long period of time, and ask you the question \\"buried vegetation in a wetland changes to peat over what?\\", is the correct answer \\"a long period of time\\"? A:","completion":"Yes, the correct answer to the question \\"buried vegetation in a wetland changes to peat over what?\\" is \\"a long period of time.\\" This process, known as peat formation, occurs in specific environmental conditions characterized by waterlogged and acidic environments, typically found in wetlands. Peat formation is a natural phenomenon and can be described in the following detailed manner: 1. Vegetation growth: Wetlands are home to various types of vegetation, including mosses, sedges, grasses, and other plants well adapted to survive in water-saturated soils. Plant growth in wetlands is influenced by several factors, including sunlight, the presence of nutrients, and water levels. 2. Plant decomposition: In most ecosystems, dead plant material decomposes quickly due to the presence of microorganisms and the free exchange of oxygen with the atmosphere. However, wetlands are special since the waterlogged conditions slow down the process of decomposition. Anaerobic (oxygen-poor) conditions develop in the soil, which limits the activity of decomposers like fungi and bacteria. 3. Accumulation of organic material: Because decomposition in wetlands is slower than the rate of new plant growth, the organic matter accumulates as a partially decomposed mass of dead, or undecomposed plants, called peat. Peat is made up of various components including cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and humic substances. The depth of the peat layer can vary greatly, ranging from a few inches to several meters depending on factors such as climate, vegetation type, and age of the wetland. 4. Compression and subsequent transformations: As new layers of vegetation grow and die, the weight of the overlying material compresses the older, deeper layers of peat. This pressure, combined with the action of anaerobic microorganisms, gradually causes the peat to lose water and carbon dioxide, which are released into the atmosphere as methane and carbon dioxide, both greenhouse gases. Over thousands or even millions of years, this continuous process results in the formation of peatlands, which can eventually lead to the creation of coal deposits if sufficient pressure and heat are applied. The process of peat formation takes a long period of time, depending on various factors such as the type of wetland environment, the rate of plant growth, and the rate of decomposition. This long timescale reflects the intricate and slow nature of this transformation, which has implications for the storage of carbon, preservation of archaeological artifacts, and water filtration capabilities of wetlands."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Bats fly through an area - The bat makes sounds with their mouth or nose - The sound waves travel away from the bat - The sound waves hit objects - The sound waves bounce off the objects back towards the bat - The bat hears the sound waves echoing off the objects - The bat knows where the objects are because of where the sound echoed from - The bat doesn't hurt itself by hitting the objects. Question: suppose the bat makes sound waves happens, how will it affect the bat will not know where objects are. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"The question is asking about the effect of a bat producing sound waves on its ability to locate objects, and there are three possible answers: more (A), less (B), and no effect (C). The process described is how bats use echolocation to navigate and find food in their environments. By emitting sounds either through their mouth or nose, they create sound waves that travel through the air and bounce off any objects in their path. The returning echoes are picked up by the bat's specialized ears, which allows them to determine the location, size, shape, and texture of objects around them. This helps them avoid obstacles and locate prey, even in complete darkness. Now, let's analyze each possible answer based on the question: A: More (effect on a bat's ability to locate objects if the bat makes sound waves happen) If a bat produces more sound waves, the amount of information it receives from the returning echoes will increase. Consequently, it will have more data points to interpret and understand its surroundings. This increased amount of echolocation data could potentially help the bat locate objects more precisely. B: Less (effect on a bat's ability to locate objects if the bat makes sound waves happen) However, it's essential to consider the frequency and intensity of the sound waves. If a bat continuously emits sound waves with no breaks, the barrage of information could confuse rather than assist it. Too much overlapping data might make it difficult for the bat to process and interpret the echoes, decreasing its ability to locate objects accurately. C: No effect (effect on a bat's ability to locate objects if the bat makes sound waves happen) The \\"no effect\\" option implies that regardless of whether the bat produces sound waves or not, its ability to locate objects will remain unchanged. However, this is incorrect. If a bat were to stop producing sound waves altogether, it would lose its primary method of navigating and detecting objects. As a result, its ability to locate objects would be significantly impaired. In conclusion, the answer largely depends on the specific context in which the bat is producing sound waves. For bats relying on echolocation as their primary method of navigation, producing sound waves is crucial, and an increase in echolocation data could potentially enhance their ability to locate objects (Answer A - more). However, it's essential to strike a balance so that the quantity of echolocation data doesn't become overwhelming, leading to confusion and a reduction in the bat's ability to locate objects (Answer B - less). Answer C (no effect) is not a valid response, as the question assumes that producing sound waves plays a vital role in a bat's navigation system."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Context: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

War is an ancient custom which has existed for at least six thousand years. It was always evil and usually foolish, but in the past the human race managed to live with it. Modern skill has changed this. Either man will stop war, or war will stop man. For the present, it is nuclear weapons that cause the greatest danger, but bacteriological( ) or chemical weapons may, before long, offer an even greater threat. If we succeeded in stopping war, there would be no danger for us. To do this, we need to persuade mankind to look upon international questions in a new way, not by contests of force, in which the victory goes to the side which is most skillful in massacre ( ),but by judging in accordance with agreed rules of law. It is not easy to change old mental habits, but this is what must be attempted. There are those who say that the adoption of this or that ideology would prevent war. I believe this to be a complete error. All ideologies are based upon beliefs without proof which are, at best, doubtful, and at worst, totally false. Those people who believe them are willing to go to war in support of them. The movement of world opinion during the past two years has changed very largely such as we can welcome. It has become a common belief that nuclear war must be avoided. Of course, very difficult problems remain in the international world, but the spirit in which they are being approached is a better one than it was some years ago. It has begun to be thought, even by the powerful men who decide whether we shall live or die, that agreements should be reached even if both sides do not find these agreements wholly satisfactory. It has begun to be understood that the important conflict nowadays is not between East and West, but between Man and the bomb.","completion":"What needs to be changed in order to persuade mankind to live without war?

For a time the leader of the National Synarchist Union ( UNS ) , Abascal represented the orthodox Catholic tendency within the movement . - Falangism was the political ideology of the Falange Española de las JONS and, afterwards, of the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (both known simply as the \\"Falange\\"), as well as derivatives of it in other countries. Falangism is widely considered a fascist ideology. Under the leadership of Francisco Franco, many of the radical elements of Falangism considered to be fascist were diluted and it largely became an authoritarian, conservative ideology connected with Francoist Spain. Opponents of Franco's changes to the party include former Falange leader Manuel Hedilla. Falangism places a strong emphasis on Catholic religious identity, though it has held some secular views on the Church's direct influence in society, as it believed that the state should have the supreme authority over the nation. Falangism emphasized the need for authority, hierarchy, and order in society. Falangism is anti-communist, anti-capitalist, anti-democratic, and anti-liberal, although under Franco, the Falange abandoned its original anti-capitalist tendencies, declaring the ideology to be fully compatible with capitalism. - The National Synarchist Union is a Mexican political organization. It was historically a movement of the Roman Catholic extreme right, in some ways akin to clerical fascism and falangism, violently opposed to the left wing and secularist policies of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and its predecessor the National Revolutionary Party that governed Mexico from 1929 to 2000 and since 2012.

They believe that the deadly parasites are seizing control of their biting hosts and boosting their sense of smell. The research is published in the journal Plos One. Dr James Logan, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said: \\"One thing that always surprises me about parasites is how clever they are. They are these ever-evolving organisms that seem to be one step ahead of us the whole time.\\" Smelly feet To carry out the study, the researchers infected malaria mosquitoes (Anopheles gambiae) with the most deadly form of parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. They placed about 100 of the infected insects into a container, along with some nylon stockings that had been previously worn by volunteers for 20 hours. \\"It is a very effective way of collecting body odour... the odour can remain attractive for months,\\" explained Dr Logan. The scientists repeated the experiment with uninfected insects. They found that mosquitoes carrying the deadly parasite were three times more likely to be attracted to the smelly stockings. The scientists believe this is because the tiny parasitic organisms are manipulating their hosts' sense of smell. Dr Logan said: \\"We think it is giving them a heightened sense of smell. We are hypothesising there is an alteration somewhere in their olfactory system that allows them to find us quicker.\\" Smart tactics By making humans an easier target, the parasite is more likely to be passed into the blood stream - ensuring its survival and continuing the spread of the deadly disease. The researchers will now begin a three-year project, funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), to learn more about how the parasites are doing this. Dr Logan said that understanding how the malaria-infected mosquitoes respond to human odour could help them to fight the disease. He said: \\"If we know how the parasite is able to manipulate the olfactory system... perhaps we can identify new attractants for infected mosquitoes and we will be able to increase our efficiency with trapping techniques.\\" According to the latest figures, the World Health Organization said there were about 219 million cases of malaria in 2010 and 660,000 deaths. Africa is the most affected continent: about 90% of all malaria deaths occur there. Summary:","completion":"Researchers discovered that malaria-infected insects are three times more attracted to human scent, suggesting that parasites might be controlling their host's sense of smell and enhancing it, ultimately aiding in the spread of the deadly disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the sculpture that is a contributing structure to the Washington Park federal Registered Historic District? , can you please find it? Time is in the Chicago Park District, in the Washington Park community area on Chicago's South Side, near the Midway Plaisance. This location, adjoining the University of Chicago campus directly to the East, makes the sculpture a contributing structure to the Washington Park federal Registered Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Time is considered to be the most important piece of monumental art in the Park District, which hosts over 100 art works. Its importance stems from its sculptor, its message, the era in which it was created, and the design of its reflecting pool by Howard Van Doren Shaw. Robert Jones, director of design and construction for the Art Institute of Chicago at the time, stated in 1999 that Time was the first finished art piece to be made of any type of concrete.The sculpture is located a few blocks from Taft's studio, the Lorado Taft Midway Studios, now a Chicago Landmark and National Historic Landmark, located at 60th Street and Ingleside Avenue. Other notable sculptures nearby include Henry Moore's National Historic Landmark Nuclear Energy, which is on the site of the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction at the University of Chicago. Jackson Park, connected to Washington Park and Time by the Midway Plaisance, hosts the Chicago Landmark Statue of The Republic; at one time the Midway Plaisance, Jackson Park and Washington Park were jointly known as \\"South Park\\".There is little agreement on the dimensions of Time, with various sources describing it as between 102 to 127 feet (31.1 to 38.7 m) long. One of the few precise estimates describes it as 126 feet 10 inches (38.7 m) long, 23 feet 6 inches (7.2 m) wide and 24 feet (7.3 m) tall. The sources are often unclear about whether they are describing the width of the reflecting pool from exterior wall to exterior wall, the width of the water within the reflecting pool's interior walls, the width of the base of the sculpted mass of humanity, the width of the sculpted masses themselves, or the width of the...

In dieser Aussage wird das Phänomen des Betrugs thematisiert, das in jüngster Zeit immer häufiger auftritt. Die Person, die dies erzählt, wurde von einem Freund mit den Sophisten verglichen. Die Sophisten waren eine Gruppe von Philosophen aus der Antike, die dafür bekannt waren, ihre rhetorischen Fähigkeiten einzusetzen, um scheinbar widersprüchliche oder paradox wirkende Argumente zu konstruieren und damit ihren Standpunkt zu verteidigen. Ein Beispiel für ein solches Argument der Sophisten ist das Rennen zwischen Achill, einem berühmten Helden der griechischen Mythologie, und einer Schildkröte. Nach der sogenannten Achilles-Paradoxon-Argumentation, die dem Philosophen Zenon von Elea zugeschrieben wird, kann Achill die Schildkröte angeblich nie überholen, da er zunächst den Halbweg zwischen seinem Startpunkt und dem der Schildkröte erreichen muss. Während Achill diesen halben Weg zurücklegt, legt die Schildkröte ihrerseits eine kürzere Strecke zurück – jedoch bleibt stets eine Distanz zwischen beiden bestehen, die Achill aufzuholen versucht. Dadurch erscheint das Ziel, die Schildkröte zu überholen, als immer weiter entfernt. Die Vergleich der Person mit den durch solche Argumente berühmt gewordenen Sophisten deutet darauf hin, dass diese in den Augen ihrer Freunde möglicherweise ebenfalls in der Lage ist, gewandte und scheinbar unangreifbare Argumente aufzubauen, um ihren Standpunkt zu verteidigen oder überzeugend zu wirken.

Since we are adding a positive number (10) with a negative number (-8), we will subtract the numbers without their signs and then assign the sign of the larger number (the number with the larger magnitude) to the result. 10 - 8 = 2 As 10 (positive number) has a larger magnitude than -8 (negative number), our result will have a positive sign. Hence, the result will be: +2 Step 2: Assign the result to w.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Toby Harnden. President Barack Obama appears to be clinging to wafer-thin leads in most swing states, but Mitt Romney's decision to pull staffers out of North Carolina is a sign of his campaign's increasing confidence. Romney is now ahead in most Florida polls and ahead or level in Virginia, as Obama appears to be just leading in Ohio. The Republican nominee needs at least two of these states to win while three would probably guarantee 270 electoral college votes and victory. Lead: Romney, seen exchanging pleasantries with Obama during this week's debate, is pulling his staff out of North Carolina - an indication that he expects to win there. Obama won North Carolina, traditionally a Republican state, very narrowly in 2008. The Democratic convention was held there in part to bolster his standing in the state. The Charlotte News & Observer reported that Romney spokesman Robert Reid was one of the staff moving. 'With the increasingly widening polls in North Carolina, we will continue to allocate resources, including key senior staff, to other states,' Michael Levoff, another Romney spokesman, told the paper. Favourability: Latest poll numbers show Romney leading Obama in key states like North Carolina and Florida. But Romneyâ€™s campaign is still spending on ads in North Carolina, and the campaign did not say how many staffers are actually being moved. Romney is up by 5.6 per cent in North Carolina in the RealClearPolitics (RCP) average. The National Journal has reported that Obamaâ€™s campaign, worried about North Carolina, Virginia and Florida, is 'circling the wagons around Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.' Romney is up 2.5 per cent in Florida in the RCP average and tied in Virginia, though each of the last three polls there have given him a narrow edge. All smiles: Ann Romney stands while President Obama and Mitt Romney shake hands during the 67th annual Al Smith dinner at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York on Thursday night. Obama is up 2.5 per cent in the RCP average in Ohio, a considerable tightening since the first presidential debate more than a fortnight ago, when Romney dominated. Two new polls from Public Policy Polling show a much tighter race in Iowa and New Hampshire, with Romney holding a 1-point lead - 49 per cent to 48 per cent - over Obama in both. Previous PPP surveys showed Obama up four points in Iowa and up six points in New Hampshire. Laughing all the way to the White House: Obama and Romney share a joke with New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan during the annual Al Smith dinner which has been attended by presidents since World War II. The candidates are now tied nationally at 47 per cent, according to the RCP average, which estimated Obama has a statistically insignificant 0.1 per cent national lead. To underline the fluid picture, a Republican poll in Pennsylvania - a state Romney had all but conceded - put their candidate four points ahead. That prompted the scheduling of a rally by Representative Paul Ryan, Romney's vice-presidential running mate, in Pittsburgh. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. Mitt Romney's campaign is showing confidence as they pull staff out of North Carolina, suggesting they believe they will win there. This state is traditionally Republican, but it was narrowly won by Obama in 2008. 2. Polls suggest Romney is ahead in Florida and either ahead or even in Virginia. Romney needs at least two of these states to win the election. If he wins three, it is likely enough to reach the necessary 270 electoral college votes for victory. 3. Even so, Romney's campaign is still spending on ads in North Carolina, even though they have moved some staffers to other states. 4. Obama's campaign is focusing more on Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, as they're concerned about their standing in North Carolina, Virginia, and Florida. 5. While the election is tightening, new polls show a very close race in Iowa and New Hampshire, with Romney just barely leading Obama in both. 6. The candidates are currently tied nationally at 47%, showing the race is very close. 7.

It seemed counterintuitive to her, since one would expect newer devices to have better compatibility and performance. Determined to fix the issue, she started troubleshooting the problem step by step. First, she checked if both her laptop and desktop used the same email client and settings. While her laptop was using the default email client, her desktop used a third-party application she had installed recently. She hypothesized that this difference could be causing the issue. To test her hypothesis, Dina decided to try the default email client on her desktop. She set up her email account in the pre-installed application and found that her email was indeed readable. This confirmed her suspicion that the problem was rooted in the use of the third-party application. In order to find a solution, Dina considered the following steps: 1. Update the third-party email client: She checked for updates and found that there was a new version available with improved compatibility. After updating the application, she tried opening her email once more, and it was now readable. 2. If updating hadn't worked, she would have tried reinstalling the email client. Sometimes, faulty installations can cause issues with how applications function. 3. If reinstalling the client did not resolve the issue, Dina would've reached out to the software's customer support team. They could provide more in-depth assistance and possibly offer a solution specific to her situation. 4. Finally, if none of the above steps had proven effective, she could have considered switching to a different email client altogether. There are several reliable alternatives available, and choosing one that suited her needs would have ensured a smoother user experience.

To begin, let's break down both the premise and the hypothesis: Premise: \\"We have applied the same methods, though less elaborately.\\" - This statement indicates that the speaker and/or their team followed the same methods as someone else. - The mention of \\"less elaborately\\" implies that while the methods were the same in terms of approach, the degree of complexity, thoroughness, or intensity was lesser than the original implementation. Hypothesis: \\"We applied the methods the same way.\\" - This statement suggests that the speaker and/or their team implemented the methods in an identical manner as the original application or reference. - Based on this statement alone, there is no mention of differences in complexity, thoroughness, or intensity. Taking these points into consideration, a notable difference between the premise and the hypothesis is the mention of \\"less elaborately\\" in the premise. This suggests that while the basic approach of the methods was the same, the degree to which they were carried out differed. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that the methods were applied the same way, which implies a complete similarity in implementation. This can be seen as conflicting with the premise due to the lack of acknowledgment of the difference in elaboration. In conclusion, based on the given premise, we cannot definitively state that the hypothesis \\"We applied the methods the same way\\" is true. The premise implies a difference in the level of elaboration, which stands in contrast to the hypothesis's claim of identical implementation. However, it is essential to recognize that both statements agree on the utilization of the same methods, indicating that there is at least some level of similarity between the two implementations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diem's regime, with the images of the burning Thich Quang Duc on the front pages still fresh in the minds of the public. Halberstam's report estimated that the altercation lasted for around ten minutes and also admitted that the pressmen had tried to apprehend the policeman who had smashed Browne's camera but were shielded by the rock-wielding policeman's colleagues.

Input: Paragraph: An October 11 2019 Imgur repost of a Bernie Sanders tweet appeared alongside the caption “this is how you know he would fight for the people if he is elected our president”:That tweet read:It’s not coincidental that the top health care CEOs made 1.1 billion last year while 4 in 10 cancer patients lose their life savings due to treatment.Our system is designed to take money from sick people and put it in the pockets of rich executives.We need Medicare for All.The claim was originally tweeted by Sanders on October 10 2019, and it was accurately reflected by the screenshot. However, Sanders did not include a citation.A second portion of the tweet claimed that this was not an accident, but rather was an intentional transfer of wealth from individual Americans to those profiting from cancer treatment. That portion of the tweet was more opinion, making it more difficult to definitively fact-check.However, the first part, about four in ten cancer patients, was verifiable. An October 2018 press release for a study that appeared in the American Journal of Medicine explained:Researchers assessed how patients’ net worth and debt changed two and four years post-diagnosis. The study authors controlled for demographic and clinically related variables, economic factors, mortality, and cancer-specific characteristics. Across the population, the average patient saw a loss of 92,098. Financial insolvency extended to 38.2 percent after four or more years.An October 18 2018 Big Think item with the headline “42% of new cancer patients lose their life savings” reported:Of the 9.5 million cancer diagnoses studied between 2000–2012, researchers discovered that 42.4 percent of patients (median age 68.6±9.4 years) spent all of their money, averaging 92,098. This follows disturbing news from earlier this year that 40 percent of Americans can’t afford to pay 400 in case of an emergency. The math is not adding up.Insider.com reported that almost half of cancer patients went bankrupt due to treatment:After tracking 9.5 million cancer patients from 2000 to 2012, researchers also learned that 62% of all cancer patients are in debt because of their treatment, and 55% of them owe at least 10,000.Overall, the total medical costs for cancer are 80 billion in the US.That article noted that insurance was not a complete failsafe against financial disaster for people diagnosed with cancer:From high deductibles to large copayments, cancer patients can end up with a huge stack of bills.In addition, 40% to 85% of all cancer patients have to quit working while undergoing treatment, which creates a financial burden that can last for six months or longer.In the same month, Advisory.com featured a story with a similar headline: “42% of cancer patients their spent entire life savings in 2 years after diagnosis.” The article went on to note that researchers had estimated that patients’ average net worth “fell by 92,098 after two years and by 51,882 after four years.” The claim was also discussed on YCombinator, where one commenter detailed the experiences of a family member:I recently watched a family member go through this. A few things that were sobering to see:– Three weeks in she was buried in paperwork. One chemo treatment would turn into 4-5 invoices from different subcontractors at a single hospital, some covered by her insurance, others not covered. Her insurer denied claims arbitrarily and made her go through a bunch of invasive and unnecessary procedures to prove her illness.– Her insurer started calling her incessantly, insisting that she join some sort of program where they would “help” her make decisions about her care. It undermined the confidence she had in her doctors and the decisions she was trying to make, which is a terrible feeling for anyone to go through when they are sick with cancer and trying to survive.– There were a series of insurance “land mines” on the horizon – forget to renew this thing on this random date 2 months from now? You’ve lost your insurance.The whole healthcare and insurance system is a dark pattern, even for working adults who are fully covered.Many of the articles referenced the same aforementioned study, which was published in the American Journal of Medicine in October 2018. Titled “Death or Debt? National Estimates of Financial Toxicity in Persons with Newly-Diagnosed Cancer,” the research examined the financial effects on Americans undergoing cancer treatment:Across 9.5 million estimated new diagnoses of cancer from 2000–2012, individuals averaged 68.6±9.4 years with slight majorities being married (54.7%), not retired (51.1%), and Medicare beneficiaries (56.6%). At year+2, 42.4% depleted their entire life’s assets, with higher adjusted odds associated with worsening cancer, requirement of continued treatment, demographic and socioeconomic factors (ie, female, Medicaid, uninsured, retired, increasing age, income, and household size), and clinical characteristics (ie, current smoker, worse self-reported health, hypertension, diabetes, lung disease) (P<.05); average losses were 92,098. At year+4, financial insolvency extended to 38.2%, with several consistent socioeconomic, cancer-related, and clinical characteristics remaining significant predictors of complete asset depletion.That study began by referencing Breaking Bad, a popular drama about a mild-mannered teacher diagnosed with cancer who goes on to become a drug kingpin in order to finance his treatment:Breaking Bad is a critically acclaimed American television show about Walter White, who is diagnosed with lung cancer. Even though Walter worked two jobs and had health insurance, he still could not afford his medical care. To pay for his cancer treatment and to protect his family from financial burden, Walter illegally synthesized and sold methamphetamine. Although this is a fictional story, it highlights the reality of the economic burden of cancer in America.Numerous confounding factors are referenced in the study. Among them was the exclusion of cancer patients who do not recover, in which case the costs of end-of-life care are not tallied:Depending on cancer type and stage, costs range between 20-100k during the first year after diagnosis, but the average cost increases to over 60k at the end of life. This evidence suggests that terminally ill patients experience worse financial toxicity. Notably, [study authors] did not assess the financial toxicity experienced during end of life care because they omitted the ~30% of the cancer patients who died during the study. Consequently, the study does not examine the significant financial toxicity associated with fatal cancers.Differences made by the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act (also known as the ACA or Obamacare) did not seem to dramatically affect the findings, despite its passage during the years researchers examined in the study. The law is mentioned once, in the course of referencing various disenfranchised groups, although researchers noted that having insurance had a protective effect:Additionally, by relying on the HRS, Gilligan et al. were not able to comment on financial toxicity in disenfranchised groups, such as homeless or undocumented patients. Undocumented immigrants have the lowest rate of health insurance in America, thus increasing their risk of financial toxicity due to cancer. This is because they are not eligible for Affordable Care Act exchanges or Medicaid benefits. Undocumented immigrants can get health coverage through their employers, however most take low paying jobs that do not offer health insurance. Similarly, 60% of the homeless people in the U.S. are uninsured … Multiple reports, including the Gilligan et al. study, show that private insurance is protective against financial toxicity.Insurance also posed different risks to the insured patients whose data appeared in the study:Among patients enrolled in copayment assistance programs, 20% took less medication than prescribed, 19% filled half of their prescriptions, and 24% did not fill prescriptions. Over 7% of the patients in these programs delayed procedures, testing, chemotherapy or clinic visits.Finally, the study found that costs were increasing and that the myriad difficulties cited were likely to worsen:Unfortunately, direct medical costs are expected to increase by 40% for patients by 2020, thus exacerbating the financial burden of medical care for cancer patients in the United States.The key finding upheld Sanders’ tweet:[Researchers] reported that over 42% of patients fully depleted their assets and over 30% incurred debt (consumer, mortgage or home equity) by the second-year of their diagnosis.That 42 percent of patients in the study represented the four in ten cancer patients that Sanders referenced — although technically it might be more accurate to say 4.2 out of ten patients would “deplete their assets” (in other words, “lose their life savings”) to pay for the necessary treatments. Thirty percent of study participants incurred debt, and the study omitted the 30 percent of patients who did not recover and died — presumably patients who incurred end of life costs and who certainly became unable to financially contribute to their households. Sanders’ claim was based on peer-reviewed research published in a medical journal, not polling or broad estimates, a claim which was thus quite well-supported. Claim: Four in ten cancer patients lose their life savings after starting treatment. Output:","completion":"The claim that four in ten cancer patients lose their life savings after starting treatment is supported by a study published in the American Journal of Medicine in October 2018. The research, titled “Death or Debt? National Estimates of Financial Toxicity in Persons with Newly-Diagnosed Cancer,” examined the financial effects on Americans undergoing cancer treatment. The study found that 42.4% of cancer patients depleted their entire life's assets, with an average loss of 92,098. The study also found that 30% of participants incurred debt, and it did not account for the 30% of patients who did not recover and died, presumably taking on even more costs during end-of-life care. Sanders' claim, therefore, finds its basis in a well-supported, peer-reviewed research study published in a medical journal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Duchess of Cornwall's bananaskin yesterday came courtesy of a six year old primary school pupil who asked her innocently: 'Are you going to be Queen?' The textbook answer, as far as Clarence House is concerned, would have been 'No, Princess Consort' - which is what they have always insisted she will be called when Prince Charles accedes to the throne. Camilla is passionate about literature and has long campaigned to get children reading more. Instead Camilla laughed and replied mischievously: 'You never know.' Her response is likely to add to fuel to the fire of constitutional debate over the Duchess's future role. The prince's advisors plumped for the. title on her somewhat controversial marriage to the Prince of Wales in. order to placate public sensibilities. Academics insist, however, that she will legally be Queen whatever Charles chooses to call her. And friends of the prince say he has always been hopeful that the public would indeed accept her as just that. The Duchess was out and about on public duties yesterday to promote her new patronage of national literacy charity, Beanstalk. The organisation recruits and trains. volunteers from every walk of life to work in primary schools with. children who have fallen behind in their reading. Camilla is passionate about literature and has long campaigned to get children reading more. Yesterday she was at St Mary's RC.

And yesterday she declared seven-year-old Chrisangelo Ayag’s kingly outfit as ‘superbly authentic’. ‘I must say,’ she said, ‘you look pretty cool.’ Of Jack and the Beanstalk, the Duchess said: 'I find that the more gruesome it is, they more they love it' Whether that’s a compliment she. frequently pays her husband, the Prince of Wales, is anyone’s guess –. although he was recently named by GQ magazine as one of the snappiest. dressers in Britain. But Camilla was certainly very taken. with her new young friend, wearing who was wearing a paper crown, cloak. and a drawn-on beard. She appeared entranced as the pupils. treated her to a performance of one of the books they have recently been. reading, an African tale called The Papaya Who Spoke, featuring. Chrisangelo in a starring role. She also met several youngsters. working with their volunteers, including five-year-old Omani Koroma, who. has come on ‘leaps and bounds’ with the help of Isobel Patchett. After listening to him reading aloud,. she said: ‘Omani, that was brilliant. I give you ten out of ten. Keep it. up. Everyone is very proud of you.’ She also treated some of the children. to a rendition of Jack and the Beanstalk. Discussing the story. afterwards, particularly the child-eating giant, she said: ‘I find with. children that the more gruesome it is, they more they love it.’ The Duchess left the school with three signed copies of the book.

It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource.

The language of the Avesta is subdivided into two dialects, conventionally known as \\"Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan\\", and \\"Younger Avestan\\". These terms, which date to the 19th century, are slightly misleading since 'Younger Avestan' is not only much younger than 'Old Avestan', but also from a different geographic region.

Carla is mentally handicapped and Radley is picking her up to bring her home after she's spent some time at the school. Radley holds out his arms to hug his daughter, but Carla just hands him a plastic bag partially filled with water and holding her goldfish, and she goes to hug the headmaster of the school, Dr. Johnson (Harvey Miller), instead. Dr. Johnson assures her she's ready to return home.As Radley and Carla are flying home to San Francisco, flashbacks show Carla as a little girl, having an outburst during dinner. Radley and his wife, Elizabeth (Diane Keaton), argue in the living room. Elizabeth insists that Carla needs professional help, and they enroll her in Roselake.Carla is welcomed home by her family, and her sister, Caroline (Poppy Montgomery), announces she's engaged to be married to her fiance, Jeff Reed (Joe Flanigan). Carla hands her mother a bunch of necklaces she'd made at the school; one for everyone in the family.After dinner, the family gathers in the living room (it's seen now that the Tate family is wealthy, and lives well). When Jeff mentions the subject of his doctoral dissertation, Elizabeth drops a not-so-subtle criticism of Caroline's job teaching second grade at an elementary school, despite the fact that Caroline enjoys doing it.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What was the downplaying of the syllable?\\" is in \\"In 1968 Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle published The Sound Pattern of English (SPE), the basis for generative phonology. In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments. Furthermore, the generativists folded morphophonology into phonology, which both solved and created problems.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"The downplaying of the syllable that you're referring to is based upon Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle's theory on generative phonology. Essentially, this theory put greater emphasis on phonemic segments rather than the syllable as a whole. Phonemes are the smallest units of sound in a language that can distinguish one word from another. For example, the sounds /p/ and /b/ in English distinguish \\"pat\\" from \\"bat\\". These phonemes are composed of binary features, such as voicing, place of articulation, and manner of articulation. These features are universal and their values are represented by + or -. In contrast to phonemes, syllables are larger units. A syllable can be composed of one or more phonemes. In the pre-Chomsky and Halle era, the syllable was often treated as the basic unit of phonology. In their 1968 work, The Sound Pattern of English, Chomsky and Halle theorized that phonological representations are sequences of phonemic segments, each composed of distinctive features. They introduced an updated phonological model that included at least two levels of representation: underlying representation, or the underlying phonemic structure of a word, and the surface phonetic representation, or how the word is actually pronounced. The key outcome of this theory was it downplayed the role of the syllable in phonological analysis and emphasized phonemic segments. This shift in focus was significant as it altered the dominant way of analyzing and understanding the sound patterns of English, and also presented a new approach (morphophonology) of studying the interaction between phonological and morphological structure. Hence the term \\"downplaying of the syllable\\" in context of generative phonology."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: For 99% of human history, people took their food from the world around them. They ate all that they could find, and then moved on. Then around 10,000 years ago, about 1% of human history, people learned to farm the land. The kind of food we eat depends on which part of the world we live in, or which part of our country we live in. For example, in the south of China they eat rice, but in the north they eat noodles. In European countries near the sea, people eat a lot of fish. In central Europe, away from the sea, people don't eat so much fish, but they eat more meat. For example, in Germany and Poland, there are hundreds of different kinds of sausages. In North America, Australia, and Europe, people eat with knives and forks. In China, people eat with chopsticks. In parts of India and the Middle East, people use their fingers to pick up food. Nowadays it is possible to transport food easily from one part of the world to another. We can eat whatever we like, at any time of the year. In Britain, bananas come from Africa; rice comes from India or the U.S.A.; strawberries come from Chile or Spain. Food is a very big business.

Question: She had a busy schedule, she had to run errands and pick up the kids the second she did what? Options: - make time for - take money - go outdoors - leave work - field The answer is \\"leave work\\" because A:","completion":"Leaving work is the best answer choice because it relates directly to her busy schedule and the need to run errands and pick up the kids. The other options do not quite fit the context of the situation in the same way. To elaborate, \\"leave work\\" signifies that she can attend to her other responsibilities outside her job, which is an essential part of managing her busy schedule. When she is done with work for the day, she can allocate her time and energy toward her personal errands and ensuring that her children are taken care of properly. On the other hand, \\"make time for\\" could partially make sense, as she might need to make time for her errands and responsibilities related to her kids, but it does not quite address the specific scenario of what she needs to do within her schedule. It is more of a general concept that could involve rearranging her daily routine to accommodate these tasks rather than addressing the precise action she needs to take. \\"Take money\\" and \\"field\\" don't have any logical connection to the situation at hand. Taking money does not relate to her need to manage her busy schedule nor does it connect closely to her personal responsibilities. Field, as a verb, typically signifies responding to questions or concern – a usage that does not fit with this particular context, as we are discussing her schedule management rather than a response to a particular issue or question. Lastly, \\"go outdoors\\" could refer to her stepping outside in general, but that action alone does not necessarily signify that she is ready to run errands or pick up her children. Unlike \\"leave work,\\" which is clearly linked to closing her workday and transitioning to her personal responsibilities, \\"go outdoors\\" is more ambiguous and could imply a variety of activities that are unrelated to running errands or picking up the kids. In conclusion, \\"leave work\\" is the most appropriate answer since it clearly indicates her moving on from her job responsibilities and addressing the busy schedule she has outside of work. This involves handling personal errands and ensuring her children are picked up and cared for properly, which the other answer choices do not accurately portray or encompass in the same comprehensive way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The creation of Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984 stopped any further geothermal prospecting. Mono Basin was the first National Scenic Area in the United States. It offers more protection than other United States Forest Service lands, surrounds Mono Lake and its two volcanic islands, Black Point, Panum Crater and much of the northern half of the Mono Craters. Litigation and outreach by the Mono Lake Committee, the National Audubon Society and other conservation groups has helped to slow water diversions from tributaries feeding Mono Lake.A series of earthquakes inside Long Valley Caldera, coincidentally starting two weeks after the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington, alerted geologists to the possibility of renewed volcanic activity in the region. Four magnitude 6 earthquakes struck the southern margin of Long Valley Caldera in an area that was close to the Mono–Inyo fissure system. The caldera floor had also uplifted by 10 inches (30 cm) in five years. Upward movement of magma under the caldera was thought to be the cause of the earthquakes and uplift.Persistent earthquake swarms in 1982 prompted the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to issue a \\"potential volcanic hazard\\" notice for Long Valley. That same year, permanent monitoring of the area by the Long Valley Observatory started. The hazard notice was lifted in 1984 after USGS scientists concluded that magma had been injected into fissures below Mammoth Mountain but had congealed underground. From 1990 to 1996, 150 acres (60 ha) of trees were killed on Mammoth Mountain by 20% to 95% concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the soil (less than 1% is normal). Chemical analysis of the CO2 indicated it was derived from magma. Answer:","completion":"The name of the area that had an upward movement of magma under it is Long Valley Caldera.

Definition: A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list.

Through Kathleen, Bob gets entangled in a dangerous network. Will Kathleen be able to win his trust? Review: The dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the character's 'psychology' would have been worked out a little more. Why do these people do the things they do? What motivates their choices? This is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view. The story never reaches an emotional climax, even though the characters go through enough to justify that. So you don't get to know the characters on that deeper level. The actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and 'believable' way, but I think it would have suited the movie better if Kathleen had been played by a younger actress, as this character's naiveness doesn't quite work for a grown-up woman.

Paragraph: Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000, Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden. Question: \\"Who provided the funds for the attack on the USS Cole?\\" Answer: \\"Bin Laden\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Pick your answer from: (A). no; (B). yes;","completion":"Answer: B. yes Explanation: Bin Laden provided the money needed for the attack on the USS Cole.

Q: Set in medieval England, the plot concerns the struggle to restore to the throne the rightful heir, a baby with a distinguishing birthmark, the purple pimpernel on his posterior. Danny Kaye plays Hubert Hawkins, an ex-carnival entertainer who becomes minstrel to the Black Fox, a Robin Hood-type character who leads a band of rebels in the forest in support of the true infant-king.The usurping King Roderick (Cecil Parker) wishes his daughter, Princess Gwendolyn (Angela Lansbury), to marry his neighbour, Sir Griswold of MacElwain (Robert Middleton), and to enlist Griswold's aid against the band of forest rebels. Princess Gwendolyn refuses, since she dreams of a more handsome, gallant lover, and her personal maid Griselda (Mildred Natwick), who is a witch, has predicted that her true love will arrive at the castle to court her. The Griswold marriage plan also displeases Lord Ravenhurst (Basil Rathbone), who fears that Griswold's presence may cost him his privileged position with the king.The Black Fox orders Hawkins to carry the infant-king across the country to safety, accompanied by his captain, the maid Jean. On the journey, a romance blossoms between Hawkins and Jean. They encounter the King's new jester, \\"Giacomo, 'King of Jesters and Jester of Kings'\\" (John Carradine) on his way to the castle. They knock him out and Hawkins impersonates him, hoping to gain entry to the King's castle. He is assigned to steal the key to a secret passage into the castle, through which the Black Fox could then attack. However, Hawkins is unaware that the jester he is impersonating is also a famous assassin whom Lord Ravenhurst plans to employ to murder his rivals at court: Brockhurst, Finsdale, and Pertwee.Upon Hawkins' arrival, Griselda hypnotizes him and changes his personality for that of a gallant, dashing lover, who sneaks into the Princess Gwendolyn's chambers and wins her affections, though he rapidly switches in and out of this personality whenever anyone (including himself) snaps their fingers. Maid Jean is captured on the road by the King's men, who have been sent to round up pretty young girls to decorate the upcoming tournament. The King meets her and takes a fancy to her. She obtains the key to the secret passage by picking his pocket, and passes it along to Hawkins, but in his hypnotized state Hawkins does not remember her or his original mission until he is freed from Griselda's spell, and thus accidentally loses the key back to the king. In order to prevent Princess Gwendolyn from being forced to marry Griswold, Griselda poisons Ravenhurst's competitors Brockhurst, Finsdale and Pertwee, who had supported the proposed match. Ravenhurst mistakenly credits Hawkins for these murders. Later, however, Ravenhurst learns that Hawkins is not in fact the jester/assassin Giacomo, but an imposter, and swiftly suspects him to be the Black Fox himself.During the evening banquet, Sir Griswold arrives to solidify his alliance with the king. However, Gwendolyn openly declares her love for the jester, and the enraged King orders Hawkins' death. Griswold announces that, if \\"Giacomo\\" were a knight rather than a common clown, he would challenge him to mortal combat. With the intent of having the \\"Black Fox\\" get rid of Griswold, Ravenhurst counsels the King that he can get rid of the jester by making him a knight, who would then have to fight Sir Griswold and would surely be killed, thus forcing Gwendoline to marry the victor. A series of comic scenes ensues in which the king's men help Hawkins to rapidly pass through the various trials required to become a knight.Jean uses her confidence with the king to steal back the key and send it to the forest rebels by carrier-pigeon. She also tries to save Hawkins by asking the Black Fox to substitute for him in the joust. But just before the rebels can use the secret passage, it collapses, leaving only a small crawlspace, just large enough for dwarves to pass through. The Black Fox decides to summon Hawkins' friends, a troupe of acrobatic dwarfs from Hawkins' carnival days, and sends them through the passage for a diversionary attack.Meanwhile, in the castle, Hawkins is hastily knighted, and Griswold immediately challenges him to a joust to the death. Griselda tries to save him by poisoning one of the drinks to be used for the toast immediately before the joust, but Griswold also learns of the poison, and after a quarrel between the two combatants over who should drink which drink, the toast is cancelled. Against all odds (mostly due to a lightning bolt which magnetizes his armor), Hawkins wins the joust, but spares Griswold's life.Ravenhurst denounces Hawkins and Maid Jean as imposters. Hawkins's dwarf friends, who have entered the castle through the secret passage, rescue him and capture the castle from the King's soldiers. During this battle, Ravenhurst attacks Hawkins with a sword. Griselda hastily enchants Hawkins again, giving him expert prowess in fencing (again switching between novice and expert at a finger-snap). Hawkins and Ravenhurst fight, and Ravenhurst is finally hurled into the sea by a catapult.Griswold returns to defend the King, but Hawkins reveals the infant king's birthmark to him, as well as to the usurper Roderick and his few surviving soldiers. Overcome with remorse, everyone in the castle pledges allegiance to the true infant-king, and Hawkins leads everyone in one last chorus of \\"Life could not better be\\".

Given the question: Information: - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Emperor Buretsu ( Buretsu - tenn ) was the 25th emperor of Japan , according to the traditional order of succession . No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign , but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 498 -- 506 . - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\". - Honour (also honor in American English, see spelling differences) is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or corporate body such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or corporate bodies) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large. - Empress dowager (also dowager empress or empress mother) is the English language translation of the title given to the mother of a Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese emperor. - Old French (', ', \\"\\"; Modern French ) was the Gallo-Romance dialect continuum spoken from the 9th century to the 14th century. In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region. - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'languages spoken or written' with the subject 'emperor buretsu'.

In the given information, we can identify that Emperor Buretsu was the 25th emperor of Japan. Step 2: Determine the language spoken or written by Emperor Buretsu.

A NASA satellite called QuikSCAT has discovered highways of wind over the Earth's oceans.Scientists believe these invisible roads may explain why many nonflowering plants,such as mosses and lichens ,grow where they do. The satellite is able to send microwaves from space to the surface of the ocean.The pattern of signals that come back shows which way the winds are blowing. Using this _ , the scientists studied a group of islands in the southern hemisphere ,near Antarctica.Winds tend to blow anticlockwise in this region,but there are lots of local differences. When the researchers compared these local patterns to botanical data,they found that the wind had an important effect on where species of mosses,lichens,and other nonflowering plants grow.

Devastating storms that have dumped as much as 40 inches of snow on parts of the United States and caused widespread flooding in the UK are combining over the Atlantic, weather experts have revealed. Incredible satellite imagery from NASA's Worldview shows the monster storms swirling 'arm-in-arm' across the ocean. The storms in the US have left 21 people dead and caused thousands of flights to be cancelled, bringing the east coast to a standstill. Meanwhile, in Britain, heavy rain and winds up to 80 mph devastated parts of the south, aggravating areas already flooded after the wettest January since records began in 1776. The OPTIONS: - Atlantic storm system brought another bout of gale-force winds to Britain on Friday, with large waves battering coast lines and up to 1.6 inches of rain causing flood levels to rise. - Britain storm system brought another bout of gale-force winds to Britain on Friday, with large waves battering coast lines and up to 1.6 inches of rain causing flood levels to rise. - NASA storm system brought another bout of gale-force winds to Britain on Friday, with large waves battering coast lines and up to 1.6 inches of rain causing flood levels to rise. - UK storm system brought another bout of gale-force winds to Britain on Friday, with large waves battering coast lines and up to 1.6 inches of rain causing flood levels to rise. - US storm system brought another bout of gale-force winds to Britain on Friday, with large waves battering coast lines and up to 1.6 inches of rain causing flood levels to rise. - United States storm system brought another bout of gale-force winds to Britain on Friday, with large waves battering coast lines and up to 1.6 inches of rain causing flood levels to rise. - Worldview storm system brought another bout of gale-force winds to Britain on Friday, with large waves battering coast lines and up to 1.6 inches of rain causing flood levels to rise.","completion":"The Atlantic storm system brought another bout of gale-force winds to Britain on Friday, with large waves battering coastlines and up to 1.6 inches of rain causing flood levels to rise. As the destructive power of these storms continued to wreak havoc, communities found themselves faced with difficult and life-threatening challenges. Emergency services and volunteers worked tirelessly to evacuate residents from their homes, rescuing those stranded in the deepening floodwaters. Roads were closed off, and transportation networks were significantly disrupted, with train stations and even airports shutting down for periods during the height of the storms. As the Atlantic storm system continued to pour relentless rain and high-speed winds across Britain, the true scale of the damage was revealed. Ancient buildings, including centuries-old churches and monuments, were destroyed or seriously damaged by the impact of the storms. The severe weather also caused tragic losses, with some individuals being swept out to sea or overtaken by the rapidly rising floodwaters despite rescue attempts. In the face of this unprecedented level of destruction, communities rallied together to provide aid and support wherever needed. Those fortunate enough to have escaped the worst of the flooding opened their homes to displaced families, while aid organizations, such as the Red Cross, provided food, clothing, and emergency relief to those affected. Across the Atlantic, the corresponding storms battered parts of the United States as well, causing further loss of life, widespread destruction, and countless canceled flights. Emergency planning and response were put to the test in both nations, proving that weather patterns have the ability to devastate communities without warning. As the storms began to subside, both the United States and Britain faced a long road to recovery. Governments were pressured to improve flood defenses and emergency response plans, with officials recognizing the need for greater preparation and resilience in facing future extreme weather events. Community members continued to help each other, rebuilding houses, restoring lost possessions, and providing emotional support throughout the recovery process. As they grieved for the lives lost in these natural disasters, the people of both nations came together to find solace and rebuild their homes, neighborhoods, and countries. This story's ending highlights the importance of unity and resilience in facing extreme weather events. These storms also served as a reminder of the growing need for improved preparedness, planning, and adaptation as climate change continues to create more frequent and intense natural disasters across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A surge in home sales across major markets has heralded the possibility of a rapid recovery in the real estate market, considered by many to be a key indicator of economic health. In this article, we will delve into the reasons behind this resurgence in home sales, the role of government policies, and the implications of the trend for both buyers and sellers in the housing market. The Surge in Home Sales Recent data from the National Association of Realtors reveals a marked increase in home sales throughout the United States in the past few months. Home sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.01 million units in the first quarter of 2021, representing a 16.2% increase from the previous year. Notably, this surge has spanned across both urban and suburban areas, which also witnessed a considerable uptick in first-time buyers entering the market. In addition to the US, other major markets such as the UK and Canada have also reported a similar uptick in home sales. UK's property market posted its strongest quarterly growth in a decade, while Canadian home sales reached a record high in March 2021. Factors Driving the Home Sales Boom Several interrelated factors have contributed to this revival of the housing market in recent months: 1. Record-Low Mortgage Rates: Central banks across the world have responded to the economic crisis by slashing interest rates, making mortgage rates more attractive for potential homebuyers. Lower financing costs have encouraged borrowers to take advantage of these favorable conditions, driving demand for residential real estate. 2. Remote Work and Shift in Housing Preferences: The shift towards remote work in the wake of the pandemic has prompted many urban dwellers to buy homes in suburban or rural areas, where larger homes with more outdoor space can be found. This has resulted in higher demand for single-family homes and properties in suburban neighborhoods. 3. Government Policies: Many governments have enacted stimulus measures and housing-specific incentives to help revive the struggling economy. For instance, the US government has extended the eviction moratorium, while the UK has introduced a temporary Stamp Duty holiday. These initiatives have stimulated the real estate market by making it more attractive for buyers and sellers. 4. Pent-Up Demand: Due to the uncertainty and lockdown measures introduced during the pandemic, potential buyers and sellers had postponed their decision to enter the market. However, as the situation improves and restrictions ease, many of these individuals are now looking to make their move, leading to a surge in sales. Implications for the Housing Sector The current rise in home sales has several implications for various stakeholders in the housing sector: 1. Buyers: First-time buyers may find it more challenging to secure affordable homes, as increasing demand leads to bidding wars and record-high prices for certain properties. However, with mortgage rates remaining low, financing options for buyers remain attractive. 2. Sellers: Current homeowners looking to sell their properties stand to benefit from the surging demand, which has boosted home values and resulted in quicker sales. This allows sellers to capitalize on the strong market and potentially reap significant profits. 3. Housing Affordability: As house prices continue to rise, concerns about housing affordability are growing. Policymakers may need to devise long-term solutions to address this emerging challenge and prevent a widening of the wealth gap. Conclusion The ongoing surge in home sales indeed raises hope for the housing sector's recovery. Supported by low-interest rates, government policies, and changes in housing preferences amidst the pandemic, this upward trajectory has provided a sense of optimism for stakeholders. Nevertheless, addressing housing affordability concerns and ensuring a sustainable expansion in the housing market remains crucial for the long-term economic health of countries worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On Feb 23, 1836, the Mexican army, under the command of Santa Anna, set siege to what mission?","completion":"On February 23, 1836, the Mexican army, under the command of General Antonio López de Santa Anna, set siege to the Alamo Mission, also known as the Mission San Antonio de Padua or simply The Alamo. This historic event took place in present-day San Antonio, Texas, which was then part of the Mexican state, Coahuila y Tejas. The siege marked one of the crucial moments in the Texas Revolution and is now a symbol of heroism and resistance against oppression for Texans and Americans. The Alamo Mission was initially established as a Roman Catholic mission and fort by Spanish missionaries in the early 18th century. Over the years, it served various purposes, from being a religious outpost for spreading Christianity among the local Native American population to functioning as a military garrison. In December 1835, Texian and Tejano volunteer forces successfully overtook the Mexican garrison stationed at the Alamo during the Battle of Bexar. Santa Anna, determined to reclaim the lost territory and quell the increasingly defiant Texian resistance, led a large Mexican army towards San Antonio. The Texians, comprised of a diverse mix of settlers, adventurers, and volunteers, were commanded by Colonel James Bowie and Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis. Among the ranks of the defenders was the famous frontiersman and former US Congressman, Davy Crockett. On the morning of February 23, 1836, Santa Anna's troops reached San Antonio, and the siege of the Alamo began. The attackers raised a red flag signifying \\"no quarter,\\" indicating that the enemy would not be taken captive but rather executed. The Texian forces defiantly retaliated by firing a cannon, demonstrating their determination not to surrender. Facing a force of around 1,800 to 6,000 Mexican soldiers, the Texian defenders, numbering between 185 and 260, were vastly outnumbered. They held out for 13 days, fending off several assaults with limited supplies and resources. The defenders used the thick walls of the Alamo and firing from elevated positions to repel the attackers. On the early morning of March 6, 1836, Santa Anna ordered a final, all-out assault on the Alamo. The Mexican soldiers scaled the walls and poured into the compound, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the exhausted defenders. The battle lasted about 90 minutes, culminating in the complete annihilation of the Alamo garrison. Although the Battle of the Alamo resulted in a Mexican victory, it came at a considerable cost, with hundreds of Mexican soldiers killed or wounded. The heavy casualties weakened Santa Anna's forces, and the determined resistance of the Alamo defenders helped inspire more Texians and settlers to join the revolt against Mexico. Just over a month later, on April 21, 1836, the Texian forces led by General Sam Houston decisively defeated the Mexican army at the Battle of San Jacinto, ensuring the independence of Texas. Today, the Alamo is a revered symbol of courage, patriotism, and the struggle for independence. It serves as a historical site and museum, drawing millions of visitors annually to learn about and remember those who fought and died during the siege."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The Holden Torana he shared with Jack Brabham in the 1976 Bathurst 1000 was hit from behind on the grid and eventually retired with engine failure. Moss, at the wheel of the Torana when the V8 engine let go, was criticised by other drivers for staying on the racing line for over 2/3 of the 6.172 km long circuit while returning to the pits as the car was dropping large amounts of oil onto the road. He also shared a Volkswagen Golf GTI with Denny Hulme in the 1979 Benson & Hedges 500 at Pukekohe Park Raceway in New Zealand. In 1980 he made a comeback to regular competition, in the British Saloon Car Championship with the works-backed GTi Engineering Audi team.

There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. The center, which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan, could open later this summer. \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" Court Administrator Bob Zastany said. \\"There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource.\\" The self-help center will be the only one of its kind in the county. Only a few operate nationwide, officials said. The project is the work of Lake County circuit court officials and Prairie State Legal Services, a statewide agency with an office in Waukegan that provides information and legal assistance to poor and elderly Illinois residents. The organization has received a 25,000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance, to help pay for the effort. Prairie State will share the money with the county. The county's law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N. County St. The new self-help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court, an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing. \\"Some people can do OK on their own, and some people can do OK with some help,\\" said Linda Rothnagel, the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services. \\"But other people can't do it. It's not always easy.\\" Self-representation is a right affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The practice is far more common in civil matters than in criminal cases. In fact, self-represented litigants - formally called \\"pro se\\" in Latin, or \\"for oneself\\" - in criminal defenses are so rare that statistics about the practice generally are not kept, legal experts say.

He also reached the South Pole as part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, for which he led the New Zealand section, on 4 January 1958. His party was the first to reach the Pole overland since Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912, and the first ever to do so using motor vehicles. In 1960 Hillary organized an expedition to search for the fabled abominable snowman. Hillary was with the expedition for five months, although it lasted for ten. No evidence of Yetis was found, instead footprints and tracks were proven to be from other causes. During the expedition, Hillary travelled to remote temples which contained \\"Yeti scalps\\"; however after bringing back three relics, two were shown to be from bears and one from a goat antelope. Hillary said after the expedition: \\"The yeti is not a strange, superhuman creature as has been imagined. We have found rational explanations for most yeti phenomena\\". In 1962 he was a guest on the television game show What's My Line?; he stumped the panel, comprising Dorothy Kilgallen, Arlene Francis, Bennett Cerf, and Merv Griffin.

News article: Get more power out of your EcoBoost engine with Ford’s handheld programmer Ford Mustang modified by Mountune (Ford) People have tuned cars for better performance for as long as anyone can remember, but in the age of electronic fuel injection, software upgrades have become as important as camshafts and cylinder heads. Scores of aftermarket companies offer ways to alter a car’s stock programming for more power, but these often void the factory warranty. So what happens when the factory itself gets in on the action? Ford Racing will offer handheld programmers for the turbocharged EcoBoost engines in the Focus ST, Fiesta ST and, eventually, the Mustang. The ProCal handset for the Focus ST’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder and Fiesta ST’s 1.6-liter four-cylinder engines is available at FordRacing.com for 595, and plugs into the diagnostic port in the driver’s side footwell. This allows owners to alter several vehicle parameters, including throttle response, the turbocharger’s wastegate, fuel curves, and spark tuning. Related: Ford Performance confirms Focus RS as part of 12-model blitz That allows for a more aggressive driving experience and, of course, more power. Ford says owners can pull an extra 90 pound-feet of torque from a Focus ST’s motor. The real advantage over aftermarket tuning, though, is that none of this voids the warranty. That makes it less financially risky for owners to start fiddling with a car straight off the dealer lot. Ford also plans to launch a similar device for the 2.3-liter EcoBoost engine in the Mustang. The Blue Oval is trying to cultivate interest in the new downsized power plant from enthusiasts, who tend to gravitate toward the traditional 5.0-liter V8. After all, if downsized turbocharged engines are the future, why not try to make them fast?

Grande dame of cooking still going strong at 90: Julia Child celebrates in San Francisco. How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home. She is in the most active of the four levels available, but should the need arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within the same complex.

The city is now gripped by a fear reminiscent of its darker days, with every new detail about the suspect's motivations stirring up old resentments and further straining the delicate relationship between the police and the public. The suspect, identified as a disgruntled former officer, has released a chilling manifesto, detailing his grievances with the department and his alleged mission to \\"cleanse\\" it from corruption.

Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun.

Mike Huckabee’s resignation from its board of directors, effective immediately,\\" said Amber Williams, CMA vice president of communications and talent relations. The announcement follows criticism from members of the country music industry, as well as country music fans. Jason Owen, co-president of Monument Records and owner at Sandbox Entertainment, called the appointment a \\"grossly offensive decision\\" in an email to the association's CEO Sarah Trahern and CMA Foundation executive Tiffany Kerns. Owen wrote that due to Huckabee’s election to the CMA Foundation’s board, neither his companies, nor anyone they represent would continue to support the foundation. Owen and his husband Sam are fathers to a young son and are expecting twins. Owen said that Huckabee’s stance on the LGBTQ community “made it clear my family is not welcome in his America.” “The CMA has opened their arms to him, making him feel welcome and relevant,” Owen wrote. “Huckabee speaks of the sort of things that would suggest my family is morally beneath his and uses language that has a profoundly negative impact upon young people all across this country. Not to mention how harmful and damaging his deep involvement with the NRA is. What a shameful choice.” The CMA Foundation is the charitable arm of the Country Music Association, devoted to growing and supporting music education programs across the country. Its board consists of 12 members. Sugarland’s Kristian Bush visited Dodson Elementary School in Hermitage last week with the CMA Foundation. His manager Whitney Pastorek, who is a CMA member, penned an email to CMA executives questioning how many children in the school’s diverse population Huckabee would choose to welcome. “What a terrible disappointment to see (the CMA Foundation’s) mission clouded by the decision to align with someone who so frequently engages in the language of racism, sexism, and bigotry,” Pastorek wrote. “While Gov. Huckabee's tenure in Arkansas may have resulted in valuable education reform over a decade ago, I find his choice to spend the past ten years profiting off messages of exclusion and hatred (not to mention the gun lobby) to be disqualifying.” Huckabee’s inclusion on the board has sparked hundreds of comments from outraged fans on social media, many of which are threatening to boycott the CMA, CMA Music Festival and in some cases country music as a whole. Longtime country music executive and CMA board member Joe Galante explained in a statement that Huckabee was elected to the position because the CMA Foundation could benefit from the knowledge gained during Huckabee’s extensive political career. “Gov. Huckabee led an impressive administration while serving the state of Arkansas and his policy experience with education reform is something we are fortunate to be able to learn from,” Galante said. Huckabee raised his profile in the Nashville area in recent months. He tapes his talk show \\"Huckabee\\" just outside of town. \\"Huckabee\\" airs on TBN and includes news commentary along with religious, political and musical guests. The two-time Republican presidential candidate has held strong, polarizing views on education, including publicly calling for the end of the Department of Education as well as Common Core. \\"Education is a family function, not a federal one,\\" he tweeted in 2015. To date, the CMA Foundation, a nonprofit, has invested over 20 million in 84 programs across the national public school system, after-school programs, summer camps and through community outreach organizations. The news comes four months after the association came under fire for its media guidelines at the annual CMA Awards. The CMA had previously asked media outlets to avoid questions about the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas, gun rights or political affiliations at the awards show, or risk losing their credentials and being escorted by security off the premises. After a backlash that included criticism from awards show co-host Brad Paisley, the CMA issued an apology and removed the restrictions ahead of the show.

The new Governor, Sir Richard (Cecil Parker), arrives with his charming and cheery but indolent nephew, the Honorable Charles Adare (Michael Wilding). Charles, who is hoping to make his fortune, is befriended by gruff Samson Flusky (Joseph Cotten), a prosperous businessman who was previously a transported convict, apparently a murderer. Sam says that because he has bought the legal limit of land, he wants Charles to buy land and then sell it to him for a profit so that Sam can accumulate more frontier territory. Though the Governor orders him not to go, Charles is invited to dinner at Sam's house. Charles discovers that he already knows Sam's wife, Lady Henrietta (Ingrid Bergman), an aristocrat who was a good friend of Charles' sister when they were all children in Ireland. Lady Henrietta is now a alcoholic who is socially shunned. Sam invites Charles to stay at his house, hoping it will cheer up his wife, who is on the verge of madness. The housekeeper, Milly (Margaret Leighton), has completely taken over the running the household, and is the one who secretly feeds Lady Henrietta alcohol, hoping to destroy her and win Sam's affections. Gradually, Charles restores Henrietta's self-confidence. They become closer and closer, and eventually they share a passionate kiss. But Henrietta explains that she and Sam are bound together most profoundly: when she was young, Sam was the handsome stable boy. Overcome with desire, they ran away and married at Gretna Green. Henrietta's brother, furious that aristocratic Henrietta had paired up with a lowly servant, confronted them. Her brother shot at them and missed; she then shot her brother fatally. Sam made a false confession to save her, and was sent to the penal colony in Australia. She followed him and waited seven years in abject poverty for his release. After listening to Milly's greatly exaggerated stories of what Charles did in Lady Henrietta's bedroom, Sam becomes furious and...

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that is very critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands? from the following article ? With their love of the Beach Boys and late 1960s bubblegum pop, the Ramones paved the way to what became known as pop punk. In the late 1970s, UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones combined pop-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist Ben Myers, Bad Religion \\"layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies\\"; Descendents \\"wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys-inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)\\". Epitaph Records, founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as the Queers and Screeching Weasel, began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like Green Day and the Offspring, who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as the Vandals and Guttermouth developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large Midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like Dillinger Four who would take a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \\"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\\"","completion":"To complete the task, I will thoroughly read the entire article, and then extract the name of the person who has been critical of modern mainstream pop punk bands.

Associated Press NBA referees have been scrutinized over the years for every imaginable bias. Now, though, new research has whistled another trait that may shape how refs call games: their height. As it turns out, the league’s shorter referee crews call more fouls than its taller officiating teams, according to a Journal of Sports Economics study by Paul Gift and Ryan Rodenberg that examined more than 4,000 regular-season games over four recent NBA seasons. The study builds on a body of studies that has emerged since the 2007 Tim Donaghy officiating scandal. Before the researchers could do anything, though, they had to calculate each referee’s height. This was trickier than it sounds. The heights of players are meticulously recorded, of course, but referee height isn’t public information. ENLARGE To gather their data, the authors interviewed a former NBA referee for his recollections, reviewed clips of game film and examined photographs to measure officials when they were standing next to players with known heights. Then they split NBA crews into three tiers: 6 feet and under, 6 feet to 6 feet 3 and 6 feet 3 and taller. What they found was that each additional inch per crew resulted in .017 fewer personal fouls per 48 minutes. That means the shortest crew, at 8 2/3 inches shorter than the tallest crew, calls .147 fouls more per game, or a 3.6% increase from the league average. A spokesman for the NBA said the league was aware of the study months ago and reviews outside research “to see if there is anything we can learn about our staff and target areas of improvement.” But the league dismissed this paper, he said, since its findings “are based on limited information about the average heights of individuals in crews, seemingly arbitrary height groups and no information about the actual caller.” So what could possibly explain this discrepancy? The authors have two theories. The first is that referee vantage points differ by their heights. It’s possible that shorter referee crews are actually calling better games than their taller peers. The other theory is more speculative—and more exciting to think about. They hypothesize it could have something to do with a so-called Napoleon complex in professional referees. That, they say, is grounds for future research with a different focus: technical fouls. “One’s height vantage point should play no role in technical foul calls,” they write. “But aggressive, controlling behavior via the Napoleon complex may.” ||||| A new study in the Journal of Sports Economics finds that shorter NBA refs may call more fouls, in an excellent manifestation of the Napoleon Complex. Paul Gift and Ryan Rodenberg looked at 4,463 regular season games from 2008 to 2012, and—controlling for variables like race and experience*—found a relationship between the average heights of three-man refereeing crew and the foul rate (per 48 minutes) of the players they officiated. Splitting the officiating crews into three height groups, Gift and Rodenberg posted these results: 6' 0'' and under 6' 0'' to 6' 3'' 6'3'' and over p-value Personal fouls/48 4.13 4.09 4.03 0.03 FT attempted/48 4.86 4.79 4.68 0.01 FT made/48 3.71 3.65 3.56 0.00 This isn't a large effect—an average player would have around one more foul every 480 minutes if the crew's average height was under 6 feet instead of over 6-foot-3—but it's statistically valid . The researchers' ANOVA analysis also looked at other stats like rebounds, field goals, and blocks, but nothing else had a significant link (p < 0.05) to the height of the ref crew. Advertisement The researchers had to reconstruct the refs' heights themselves and did not list them individually. Joey Crawford is definitely shorter than 6 feet, though. *All of the controlled variables: Player height, age, position, starting status, and whether they're home or away; ref age, officiating experience, basketball experience, level of education, race, and \\"quality,\\" as judged by an independent ranking system similar to the NBA's own internal tracking.

The study found that shorter referee crews call more fouls than taller officiating teams.

Parents are also concerned at,out the commercials that their children see on television. Many parents would like to see fewer commercials during programs for children.And some parents feel that these shows should not have any commercials at all because young minds are not mature enough to deal with the claims made by advertisers. Educational television has no commercials and has programs for children that many parents approve of The most famous of these is Sesame Street,which tries to give preschool children a head start in learning the alphabet and numbers.It also flies to teach children useful things about the world in which they live. Even though most parents and educators give Sesame Street and shows like it high marks for quality,some critics argue that all television,whether educational or not,is harmful to children.These critics feel that the habit of watching hours of television every day turns children into bored and passive consumers of their world rather than encouraging them to become active explorers of it.

At first I thought it wasn't working after I turned it on and then I realized I needed to restart the browser. When I did - ads were blocked. Everything works much faster with the ad blocker on - and even without it seems as fast as Chrome on Android. I give this a 4 star rating because there are some issues: 1. Importing bookmarks from Chrome does not work at all. I tried this on my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phone and my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 and got the same results. 2. There's a strange thing that happens with the screen when rotating from landscape to portrait orientation. The height of the browser window doesn't go to the bottom of the screen. Refreshing the page does not solve the problem but tapping the control on the phone/tablet to see all open apps - and then going right back into Lightning does solve the problem. Seems like a bit of a bug - which is easy to reproduce every time and on both my android devices. Other than these issues I think it's worth every penny of the 1.50 for the ad blocking version.\\" A:","completion":"Based on the content of the review, I would give it a ★★★★ rating (4 out of 5 stars). Here's a breakdown of how I came to this conclusion: 1. The reviewer is impressed with the browser and appreciates the ad-blocking feature. They note that browsing speeds are improved and comparable to other popular web browsers on Android devices, such as Chrome. This indicates a generally positive experience with the browser and its performance. 2. Despite the overall positive impression, the reviewer also outlines two specific issues that they encountered while using the browser. The first issue is the failure of the browser to import bookmarks from Chrome, which is considered significant enough to merit a mention in the review. The second issue is a display bug when rotating the screen from landscape to portrait orientation, which the reviewer finds bothersome and reproducible on different devices. 3. The reviewer still believes that the browser is worth the 1.50 cost for the ad-blocking version despite these issues. While the mentioned issues detract from the overall satisfaction, they do not appear to overshadow the browser's positives and benefits, leading to a 4-star rating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Peter's circumstances change when he stumbles upon an antique music store, drawn in by the sound of a mesmerizing melody. Inside, he meets Leonard, a cryptic old man who claims that the melody is a magical piece called \`The Timeless Melody' that can transport the player back in time. Leonard detects Peter's dissatisfaction with his life and hands him the sheet music as a gift. Suspicious but curious, Peter brings the music home to his old piano. Just as Leonard had claimed, after playing the melody, Peter finds himself transported to the year 1827, in the same city he lives in. Here, he meets Elizabeth, a charming and charismatic woman who shares his passion for music and playing the piano. Over time, Peter and Elizabeth forge a strong bond as they explore and learn about the vibrant music scene of the past together. While trying to maintain the facade of a man from that era, Peter starts to unravel a compelling mystery about Elizabeth. She was implicated in a tragic crime involving a renowned composer, Arthur Belleville, who was thought to be deceased. As they grow closer, Elizabeth tells Peter of her innocence and her desire to clear her name. Motivated by love, and the desire to alter the past, Peter decides to help Elizabeth, using knowledge of history and his modern sensibilities to their advantage. As they gather evidence, they come across the melancholic legacy of Arthur Belleville. His last composition, \`The Timeless Melody,' was written as a token of his undying love for Elizabeth.
