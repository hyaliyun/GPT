Input: Structure and content[edit]Mirror depicts the thoughts, emotions and memories of Alexei, or Alyosha (Ignat Daniltsev), and the world around him as a child, adolescent, and forty-year-old. The adult Alexei is only briefly glimpsed, but is present as a voice-over in some scenes including substantial dialogue. The structure of the film is discontinuous and nonchronological, without a conventional plot, and combines incidents, dreams and memories along with some news-reel footage. The film switches among three different time-frames: prewar (1935), war-time (1940s), and postwar (1960s or '70s).Mirror draws heavily on Tarkovsky's own childhood. Memories such as the evacuation from Moscow to the countryside during the war, a withdrawn father and his own mother, who actually worked as a proof-reader at a printing press, feature prominently.Synopsis[edit]The film opens with Alexei's adolescent son Ignat (also played by Ignat Daniltsev) switching on a televisor and watching the examination of a stammerer by a physician. After the opening titles roll, a scene is set in the countryside during prewar times in which Alexei's mother Maria (Margarita Terekhova) â also called Masha and Marusya â talks with a doctor (Anatoli Solonitsyn) who chances to be passing by. The exterior and interior of Alexei's grandfather's country house are seen. The young Alexei, his mother and sister watch as the family barn burns down. In a dream sequence Maria is washing her hair. Now in the postwar time-frame, Alexei is heard talking with his mother Maria on the phone while rooms of an apartment are seen. Switching back to the prewar time-frame, Maria is seen rushing frantically to her work-place as a proof-reader at a printing press. She is worrying about a mistake she may have overlooked, but is comforted by her colleague Liza (Alla Demidova), who then abruptly reduces her to tears with withering criticism. Back in postwar time, Alexei quarrels with his wife, Natalia (also played by Margarita Terekhova), who has divorced him and is living with their son Ignat. This is followed by news-reel scenes from the Spanish Civil War and of a balloon ascent in the U.S.S.R. In the next scene, set in Alexei's apartment, Ignat meets with a strange woman (Tamara Ogorodnikova) sitting at a table. At her request, Ignat reads a passage from a letter by Pushkin and receives a telephone call from his father Alexei. The strange woman vanishes mysteriously. Switching to war-time, the adolescent Alexei is seen undergoing rifle training with a dour instructor, intercut with news-reel footage of World War II and the Sino-Soviet border conflict. The reunion of Alexei and his sister with their father (Oleg Yankovsky) at war's end is shown. The film then returns to the quarrel between Alexei and his wife Natalia in the postwar sequence. Switching again to prewar time, vistas of the country house and surrounding countryside are followed by a dreamlike sequence showing a levitating Maria. The film then moves to the postwar time, showing Alexei apparently on his death-bed with a mysterious malady. The final scene plays in the prewar time-frame, showing a pregnant mother, Maria, intercut with scenes showing Maria young and old. (Old Maria is played by Tarkovsky's own mother, Maria Vishnyakova.)

Ian asked Robert to come over and help with his project to soundproof a room when","completion":"Ian realized that he'd need some extra hands on deck for this task. He knew Robert had some experience in soundproofing and was eager to learn from a knowledgeable friend. Step 1: Assess the room and gather materials Before getting started, both Ian and Robert took the time to assess the room that needed soundproofing. They measured the dimensions and discussed the intended purpose of the soundproofed space. Once they had a clear understanding, they made a list of materials they would need, such as acoustic foam panels, mass loaded vinyl, caulking, and weatherstripping. Step 2: Seal gaps and cracks To prevent sound from entering and escaping, Ian and Robert sealed any gaps and cracks in the walls, ceiling, and floor. They used acoustic caulk to fill in any gaps, paying particular attention to areas around windows, doors, and electrical outlets. Step 3: Install mass loaded vinyl Mass loaded vinyl (MLV) is a flexible sound barrier that adds mass to walls, reducing sound transmission. Ian and Robert decided to use this material for its excellent sound attenuation properties. They affixed the MLV to the walls and ceiling of the room, carefully covering all surfaces. Step 4: Add acoustic foam panels Acoustic foam panels are specially designed to absorb sound waves and reduce sound reverberation. Ian and Robert strategically placed these panels on the room's walls and ceiling, focusing on areas that were likely to produce the most echoes, such as corners and flat surfaces. Step 5: Weatherstrip doors and windows To further reduce sound transmission, Ian and Robert applied weatherstripping to the room's doors and windows. This not only helped to seal any remaining gaps but also provided an extra layer of sound dampening between the room and the outdoors. Step 6: Install a solid core door (optional) While not strictly necessary for soundproofing, Ian and Robert opted to replace the room's hollow core door with a solid core one. This provided an additional barrier to sound transmission and only required minimal modifications to the existing door frame. Step 7: Test the room's soundproofing Once all of the soundproofing measures had been implemented, Ian and Robert tested the room's effectiveness by playing loud music outside of it and assessing the sound level inside. They found the room to be significantly more soundproof than before and were satisfied with the results. Throughout the entire process, Ian and Robert worked collaboratively, learning from each other and refining their methods as they went. In the end, they had successfully soundproofed the room and deepened their friendship through shared effort and achievement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Unable to dislodge the food, Julia attempts to save her by performing a tracheotomy which results in the child's bleeding to death. Julia leaves her husband Magnus (Keir Dullea) and moves to a new house with an upstairs room containing a child's possessions, including a mechanical clown toy with sharp cymbals on which she cuts her finger.

Do you have any questions?","completion":"Based on the information provided, William C. Walbrecher Jr., an executive at San Francisco-based 1st Nationwide Bank, has been appointed as President and CEO of Citadel Holding Corp. and its primary operating unit, Fidelity Federal Bank. The appointment comes after the resignation of James A. Taylor for health reasons in March, who was then succeeded by Edward L. Kane as chairman. Apart from this management change, Citadel Holding Corp. has reported a third-quarter net loss of 2.3 million, or 68 cents per share, as opposed to a net income of 5.3 million, or 1.61 per share, in the same period the previous year. This decline can be attributed to several unusual write-downs totaling an after-tax impact of 4.9 million. One significant component of these write-downs was the expenses associated with the potential Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association acquisition, which was terminated on September 27, 1989. Additionally, Citadel's operating results were negatively impacted by an increase in loan and real estate loss reserves. On the American Stock Exchange, Citadel's shares closed at 45.75, which was a decrease of 25 cents from their previous value. To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the situation, we can ask several questions: 1. What led to William C. Walbrecher Jr.'s appointment as President and CEO of Citadel Holding Corp. and Fidelity Federal Bank, and what qualifications and experience does he bring to the role? 2. What was James A. Taylor's contribution to the company during his tenure, and how will Edward L. Kane's role as chairman differ? 3. What specific factors contributed to the unusual write-downs and increase in loan and real estate loss reserves in Citadel's third-quarter results? 4. How does Citadel plan to address the reported losses and improve its financial performance in the future? 5. What was the initial driving force behind the potential Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association acquisition, and why was it terminated?"},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What is the full name of the person that gave Jules Massenet his first piano lessons? Answer the above question based on the context below: Massenet was born at Montaud, then an outlying hamlet and now a part of the city of Saint-Étienne, in the Loire. He was the youngest of the four children of Alexis Massenet (1788–1863) and his second wife Eléonore-Adelaïde née Royer de Marancour (1809–1875); the elder children were Julie, Léon and Edmond. Massenet senior was a prosperous ironmonger; his wife was a talented amateur musician who gave Jules his first piano lessons. By early 1848 the family had moved to Paris, where they settled in a flat in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Massenet was educated at the Lycée Saint-Louis and, from either 1851 or 1853, the Paris Conservatoire. According to his colourful but unreliable memoirs, Massenet auditioned in October 1851, when he was nine, before a judging panel comprising Daniel Auber, Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas and Michele Carafa, and was admitted at once. His biographer Demar Irvine dates the audition and admission as January 1853. Both sources agree that Massenet continued his general education at the lycée in tandem with his musical studies. Ambroise Thomas, my beloved master, came towards me and said, \\"Embrace Berlioz, you owe him a great deal for your prize.\\" \\"The prize,\\" I cried, bewildered, my face shining with joy. \\"I have the prize!!!\\" I was deeply moved and I embraced Berlioz, then my master, and finally Monsieur Auber. Monsieur Auber comforted me. Did I need comforting? Then he said to Berlioz pointing to me, \\"He'll go far, the young rascal, when he's had less experience!\\" The prize brought a well-subsidised three-year period of study, two-thirds of which was spent at the French Academy in Rome, based at the Villa Medici. At that time the academy was dominated by painters rather than musicians; Massenet enjoyed his time there, and made lifelong friendships with, among others, the sculptor Alexandre Falguière and the painter Carolus-Duran, but the musical benefit he derived was largely self-taught. He absorbed the music at St Peter's, and closely studied the works of the great German masters, from...

Context_4 : Ghost Town (sometimes spelled Ghosttown) is the informal name of the Foster Hoover Historic District neighborhood in West Oakland, Oakland, California. The community is known for its violence and blight . Some people believe the name originates from a drug king pin who referred to the area as a ghost town due to the shortage of other drug dealers whose absence was attributed to the king pin's dominance over the area. Others believe it derives from the two former casket companies located side by side on Filbert Street between 30th and 32nd Streets, while others claim that the presence of ghostly white people in an historically black neighborhood gave it its name. Ghost Town stretches from 27th Street to 35th Street in the area immediately southwest of the MacArthur Maze. Others see the neighborhood bounded by Adeline on the West and San Pablo on the East. Ghost Town Farms, one of the more successful expressions of urban agriculture activity in Oakland is located in the heart of the district at 2727 Martin Luther King Jr. Way, between 27th and 28th Streets.

The behavior of the male character is a violation of personal boundaries, decency, and respect. The woman in this situation may feel uncomfortable, threatened, and disrespected by the violation of her body's personal space. The response to such a situation can vary depending on individual personalities and cultural backgrounds. In this context, if another man noticed this invasive behavior, he could feel compelled to intervene to stop the aggressive and disrespectful behavior. Here are some potential scenarios that could unfold: 1. Confronting the perpetrator: The other man might approach the male character, expressing his disapproval of the inappropriate behavior and asking him to stop immediately. This could lead to a discussion about respect, consent, and the consequences of engaging in such actions. The second man could also suggest that the perpetrator apologize to the woman for his intrusive behavior. 2. Offering support to the woman: Recognizing the potential distress caused by the situation, the other man could speak to the woman and ask her if she is alright or if she needs any help. He could express empathy and an understanding of her discomfort and assure her that the situation is not her fault. The woman might choose to leave the area or to report the incident to an authority figure or someone in charge. 3. Alerting the authority: If the incident takes place in a public setting or venue, the other man could find a security officer, supervisor, or manager to address the situation. Reporting the perpetrator's actions could lead to appropriate disciplinary measures, removing the individual from the area, or handing the issue over to the police. 4. Encouraging bystanders to help: The other man might try to involve others in addressing this inappropriate behavior, as there is strength in numbers. Bystanders who are aware of the situation could gather together to confront the perpetrator, support the woman, or seek help from an appropriate authority. 5. Educating others about appropriate behavior: In the aftermath of such an incident, the other man could engage in discussions with his peers, friends, family, and colleagues about the importance of respecting others' personal space, boundaries, and consent. Sharing this experience and encouraging others to take action in similar situations can help ensure that society becomes less tolerant of such disrespectful actions. In conclusion, when faced with disrespectful and invasive behavior, it is important for individuals to take swift and appropriate action to support and protect those who are being subjected to such actions.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the school that was attended by the person who was notable for being involved in the Profumo affair? ? Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers. It closed in 1970 and was demolished in 1972. Notable old boys included Doctor Who actor Jon Pertwee and...

Is Bhutan an Indian protectorate? Is Bhutan an Indian protectorate? If not why Bhutan is not free to made its foreign policy? If yes Why it didn't became part of India as Sikkim did? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose your answer from: A). no. B). yes.","completion":"A). no. Bhutan is not considered an Indian protectorate, but it does have a unique relationship with India. This relationship is governed by the 1949 Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which was later revised in 2007 through the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. These treaties establish a close bond between the two countries, particularly in areas of defense and foreign policy. Bhutan is a sovereign country with its own monarch, government, and constitution. However, its foreign policy is closely aligned and coordinated with India's. The reason for this alignment is primarily due to the historical, cultural, economic, and security ties that exist between Bhutan and India. The 1949 treaty effectively made Bhutan a protectorate of India because it stated that Bhutan would be \\"guided by the advice of the Government of India in regard to its external relations.\\" However, the 2007 revision updated the language and removed this clause, allowing Bhutan more autonomy in conducting its foreign policy. However, India still plays a considerable role in Bhutan's external affairs, particularly in matters related to defense and security. Bhutan's unique relationship with India can be seen as a strategic decision aimed at preserving its sovereignty and ensuring its security. India, as the regional power, provides protection to Bhutan against potential threats from neighboring countries like China. In return, Bhutan maintains close diplomatic and economic ties with India. This relationship is mutually beneficial for both countries and fosters regional stability. The case of Sikkim is different from that of Bhutan. Sikkim, once a separate kingdom, became a part of India in 1975, following a controversial referendum in which the people of Sikkim overwhelmingly voted to merge with India. Sikkim's merger was driven by political instability within the kingdom, external threats, and a desire to be closely integrated with the Indian economy. In conclusion, although Bhutan is not an Indian protectorate, it has a unique and strategic relationship with India that plays a significant role in its foreign policy decisions. The reasons why Bhutan didn't become a part of India like Sikkim are rooted in Bhutan's desire to maintain its sovereignty, political stability, and its mutually beneficial relationship with India."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Title: She's the One Movie plot: The film tells the story of two Irish Catholic Fitzpatrick brothers, Mickey (Edward Burns) and Francis (Mike McGlone) and the tribulations of love, family and betrayal. Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair. During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents who live on Long Island. Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis is also having problems in his marriage. He is concerned that he is being unfair to Heather, his mistress, the same woman Mickey left, by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly (Amanda Peet), suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she has Mickey and their father, Frank, confront him about it. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful. Meanwhile, Francis' arrogance leads him to take potshots at his brother for the apparent lack of forward progression in his life with his wife, while Francis argues with Heather about her own sexual infidelity with a much older man referred to as \\"Papa\\".

How to prevent houseplants from damaging the carpet Keep all houseplant pots in an impermeable saucer.

Plant pots are designed to let excess moisture slowly drip out of the drainage hole at the bottom of the pot, which poses a risk to carpet and other surfaces.","completion":"Step 1: Explain the benefits of using impermeable saucers for plant pots An impermeable saucer will catch any water that drips out of the plant pot, protecting your carpet and other surfaces from moisture damage and staining. This is essential in maintaining the longevity and cleanliness of your carpet. Step 2: Describe proper placement of saucers under plant pots Make sure that the saucers are large enough to fit the entire base of the plant pot, including any protruding parts. This will ensure that all the excess water is caught by the saucer, reducing the chances of water seeping onto the carpet. Step 3: Discuss regular maintenance of saucers In addition to placing saucers beneath your plant pots, it's essential to check on them regularly. Be sure to empty any collected water, as it can attract pests or create a musty smell if left to accumulate. Cleaning the saucers can also help prevent mold or mildew growth. Step 4: Suggest alternatives to impermeable saucers, if needed If you're unable to find an impermeable saucer that fits your particular plant pot, you can also use plastic trays or even shallow baking dishes as alternatives. Just be sure that they are wide and deep enough to catch any excess water. Step 5: Highlight the importance of monitoring plant watering habits To further minimize the risk of carpet damage, monitor your plant watering habits. Overwatering is a primary cause of water seeping into carpets. Make sure to adjust your watering routine according to the specific needs of your plants and the humidity levels in your home. This not only protects your carpet but also promotes healthy plant growth. By following these steps, you can effectively prevent houseplants from damaging your carpet, ensuring both the cleanliness of your living space and the health of your beloved plants."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A. new york B. canada C. chemotherapy D. rocky mountains E. british columbia The best answer is The answer to this question is:","completion":"C. Chemotherapy The joke made by the comedian, though dull, was attempting to use humor to imply that the bald eagle had lost its feathers or became bald due to undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Chemotherapy is a well-known treatment for cancer, and one of its side effects often includes hair loss in humans. The comedian attempted to create a funny scenario by linking the baldness of the eagle to this well-known side effect of chemotherapy. However, let's briefly discuss the other options as well: A. New York: This isn't a valid answer because it is a location and not a treatment that would cause baldness in an eagle. B. Canada: Similar to option A, Canada is a country and not a treatment or a reason for the eagle's baldness. D. Rocky Mountains: This option refers to a mountain range in North America, and again, it is not a treatment or a cause for the bald eagle's baldness. E. British Columbia: Like the previous options, British Columbia is a province in Canada and does not have anything to do with the bald eagle's loss of feathers.

People thank each other everywhere in England, all the time.When people buy something in a shop, customer and retail assistant in most cases thank each other twice or more.In Germany, it would be exceptional to hear more than one thank you in such a conversation.British students thank their lecturers when leaving the room.English employers thank their employees for doing their jobs as opposed to Germans, who would normally think that paying their workers money is already enough. Another thing I observed during my stay was that English people rarely criticize others.Even when I was working and mistakes were pointed out to me.my employers stressed several times but none of their explanations were intended as criticism.It has been my impression that by avoiding criticism, English people are making an effort to make others feel comfortable.This also is shown in other ways.British men still open doors for women, and British men are more likely to treat women to a meal than German men.However, 1 do need to point out here that this applies to English men a bit more than it would to Scottish men' Yes, the latter are a bit tightfisted.

He stretches the rubber band out as far as he can without breaking it But I can use this background: Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL: What is an answer for this question: Given a spring, will compressing it down cause it to stay compressed or return to its original shape?","completion":"To answer the question, let's break it down step-by-step using the provided background information. Step 1: Identify the main subject In this case, the subject is a spring. Step 2: Determine if the subject has the property of elasticity The background information states that elastic materials can return to their original shape after being stretched or compressed. A spring is an elastic material. Step 3: Apply the situation to the subject The situation asks if compressing the spring will cause it to stay compressed or return to its original shape. Step 4: Evaluate the behavior of the subject based on its properties As per the background information, when an elastic material is stretched or compressed, it exerts a counter force in the opposite direction (elastic force). The greater the change in shape, the higher the elastic force becomes. When the compressing force is released, the elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. Step 5: Provide an answer Given a spring (an elastic material), compressing it down will cause it to return to its original shape, not stay compressed. This is because the elastic force will counteract the compressing force and allow the spring to return to its original shape once the compressing force is released."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared.

Well, you need to put them all in a suitcase or a bag, right? Those bags are called 'baggage'.

The airlines collected the most baggage fees they ever had! It was like getting the biggest number of ice cream scoops on a cone! Can you imagine? Why did this happen, you ask? Well, there are a few reasons. First, more people than ever before were traveling by plane, just like when there are more kids at the playground than ever before. Next, some airlines decided they needed more money, so they started charging more fees for baggage. It was like when you want to buy more candies, but they cost more than before. So how does this affect you and your family? Well, sometimes you might have noticed that Mommy and Daddy pack the suitcases very carefully, making sure there is space for everything, and not taking too many bags. This is because they want to save money on these baggage fees. In the end, the important thing to remember is that even though airlines collected record baggage fees in 2012, you can still have a fun time on your plane trip! Just make sure to pack your favorite toys and snacks in a smart way, so you're ready for the adventure that awaits you! And that's the story about how airlines collected the most baggage fees in 2012. Happy flying, little friends!"},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

She attends groups with her two friends, Alisha (Julia Garro) and Phil (Adam Wagner). One evening after giving her speech talking about the purity ring those in the group wear and what it means, she is introduced to Tobey (Hale Appleman) and finds him attractive. The four begin going out as a group, and Dawn has fantasies of marrying Tobey, although after acknowledging the attraction they agree that they cannot spend time together.One day, Dawn and Tobey and their friends meet at a local swimming lake. After swimming together, Dawn and Tobey go in to a cave to get warm and begin kissing. Dawn gets uncomfortable and tries to get them to go back. Tobey then attempts to force sex on Dawn, who panics and tries to push him off. Tobey becomes aggressive and shakes Dawn, resulting in her smacking her head on the ground. While she is recovering from disorientation, Tobey takes this as his chance to begin raping her. Dawn fights back and inadvertently bites off his penis with her vagina.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning. While there are some exceptions, the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes. The kids in Paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds, as they're both very annoying and they don't have an ounce of acting ability between them. In short; they're rubbish. This isn't good considering that they're the leads, and it especially isn't good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors. It's a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isn't (not completely). It follows a young girl who, after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook, wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created. It soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings, and so sets about making various changes, until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare. Oh dear. As you can see, this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie. However, it is squandered through a number of fatal faults. First and foremost, in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness; the movie is extremely stale. The central plot is hardly played with at all, and the result is an entirely boring experience. The lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie, as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just don't care any more (which is due to a lack of ideas). Thanks in part to it's lead characters, the film feels like a kids movie throughout. This is to be expected as it stars kids, but Bernard Rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story; as the horror in the movie is laughable at best. The film is also very cheesy, and the 'romance' between the two leads is extremely cringe-worthy, and makes for very painful viewing. In fact, if I had to sum this travesty up in one word, I would choose 'painful'. Paperhouse is poorly acted, laughably plotted, very corny and dull on the whole.

But politics is a fickle business, Americans have short memories, and every race is different. On the latter point, as Sen. Marco Rubio (who was on top just a year ago) told CNN's Dana Bash, \\"I think we need to understand that some of these races don't apply to future races. Every race is different — it has a different set of factors — but I congratulate (Christie) on his win.\\" Some will say this is a less-than-gracious congratulations. Maybe. But it's also true. There is a danger in winning, inasmuch as it fosters hubris and often reinforces the wrong lessons. Ken Cuccinelli, for example, won a series of down-ballot elections despite being outspent and having a penchant for micro-managing. He always won — until he didn't. When we win, we have a tendency to think it's because we did everything right. In this regard, winning a landslide election can be especially dangerous. Losers may have to re-evaluate things — but not winners. For this reason, winning can ironically reinforce bad habits and make a candidate less likely to engage in introspection, or even be open to constructive criticism. It must feel good to believe you've finally cracked the code. But this is a trap. As Cuccinelli just learned, what works in a state Senate race may not work in a governor's race. And as Christie may soon learn, what works in a governor's race may not work on a presidential race (just ask Rick Perry). For Christie right now, the champagne is still flowing, and laudatory notes and calls and columns are still coming in. So if you're Chris Christie, you probably think a couple things are true. You think that through the shear force of your personality, you can make people like you. And you probably believe that you can get away with being confrontational. You might even think this is a selling point. You think this because — so far — it's held true. So far, Christie's confrontational style has mostly come across as refreshing. (Perhaps we secretly enjoy getting to yell at people vicariously through him?) And in a primary contest where conservatives are looking for a fighter, this might actually help him. So many of us already conflate anger and passion with a conservative philosophy. Christie may also benefit from a style that is an obvious contrast to the cerebral and aloof Obama. On the other hand, as Jonathan Chait has noted, while attacking teachers or Obama might help in a primary, \\"It's another thing altogether if he gives this treatment to Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Paul Ryan, Scott Walker, or other fellow partisans.\\" But let's just assume, for the sake of argument, that Christie makes it to the general election. Imagine a time after the press has turned on him (as they turned on John McCain and other Republican media darlings). What happens when MSNBC plays video of him yelling at someone for the millionth time, and after George Will or Charles Krauthammer writes the column about the danger of an angry man having his finger on the button? What happens when he tells a national political reporter that \\"it's none of your business\\"? How will that play in Peoria — under the intense glare of a presidential campaign? Not everyone thinks this is a problem. \\"Christie's confrontational personality can appeal to all sorts of electorates so long as he trains his anger in the right places,\\" writes Josh Barro, who believes the \\"right places\\" include New Jersey teachers, because \\"Christie's ire toward groups that demand ever-higher taxes and spending is popular with the electorate.\\" But as Scott Galupo points out, other interest groups Christie might encounter on the presidential trail won't make for such easy marks: Is Chris Christie going to yell at senior citizens about Medicare? Is he going to yell at beneficiaries of food stamps? Is he going to yell at families on Medicaid or CHIP? Is he going to yell at farmers about agribusiness subsidies? [The American Conservative] The problem isn't just that Christie's style won't always work on the presidential trail. It's that it might backfire ... horribly. It's understandable why his advisors might not want him to tinker with his natural demeanor. And you can imagine the \\"let Christie be Christie\\" headlines that would surely emerge were he to tone down his style and fall flat. But conservatives who have seen the media turn on Republicans once they become a viable threat to a Democrat like Hillary Clinton worry his behavior will gradually go from being portrayed as \\"colorful\\" or charming to erratic and dangerous. \\"If Christie yells at a teacher at a town hall in Iowa, that teacher is going to get a lot of time on television afterward — in a way that these people [who] get berated in New Jersey don't,\\" says my liberal sparring partner Bill Scher. This is a good point. In recent years, we've seen \\"civilians\\" like Joe the Plumber and Sandra Fluke elevated to rock star status. One can easily imagine Christie telling some teacher in Davenport to 'Do your job!' But what happens when she goes on to become a cause célèbre? The media would then parade this \\"victim\\" around as an excuse to talk about Christie's \\"bullying\\" and Christie's \\"war on women.\\" If I were Hillary, I would set a trap. Just send female supporters in to every Christie coffee, rally, or speech in New Hampshire or Iowa — and have them confront him on camera. What would he do? How long before he snaps at one of them? You can watch Bill Scher and I discuss this on Bloggingheads below: ||||| All signs point to Gov. Chris Christie cruising to reelection in New Jersey tonight. This is one of those times when personal bias is well nigh overwhelming: Christie—an authentic, half-Italian, New Jerseyan Bruce Springsteen uberfanatic, and a strong conservative by any reasonable standard—is about to rocket to the top tier of 2016 presidential contenders. Judging by a spate of recent posts and on-the-ground reports, Business Insider’s Josh Barro is an unabashed fan of Christie as well. He even brushes aside the one serious reservation I have about the governor: his proclivity for in-your-face confrontations—in a word, “bullying”: Christie’s confrontational personality can appeal to all sorts of electorates so long as he trains his anger in the right places. When Christie yelled at that teacher yesterday about how education spending levels will “never be enough” for New Jersey’s teachers’ unions, he was doing so in a state that spent 19,291 per pupil on K-12 education last year — more than any state except New York and Vermont and 74% more than the national average. … So long as Christie keeps training his anger in the right place, Christie will be O.K. What national liberal reporters don’t get is that “towards teachers” can be the right place, politically and substantively, to train that anger. This is true as far as it goes. Which I fear is not actually very far. Back in 2010, I wrote this at U.S. News: In the short term, the example of New Jersey’s Gov. Chris Christie is instructive. He has maintained popularity while aggressively pushing an agenda of fiscal austerity. How does he do it? Simple: In teachers unions and state-government employees, Christie has found a juicy, isolatable adversary. This works on the state level, where things like pensions and teacher benefits are significant sources of budget shortfalls—unlike on the national level, where middle-class entitlements are the big driver. The lesson is this: To the extent that “government” is a sectional entity—an interest group consisting of people who have not had to “sacrifice like the rest of us”—Republicans will find that cutting it is politically popular. To that extent that “government” is Grandma and Grandpa in Boca Raton, Republicans will need to tread carefully and—it’s possible to do both—honestly. Zoom in on “juicy, isolatable adversary.” At the presidential level, teachers aren’t going to cut it. Neither are employees of the federal government, whose salaries account for about 5 percent of total federal spending. Is Chris Christie going to yell at senior citizens about Medicare? Is he going to yell at beneficiaries of food stamps? Is he going to yell at families on Medicaid or CHIP? Is he going to yell at farmers about agribusiness subsidies? If Christie is a wise and disciplined campaigner, I find it hard to believe he’d do any of those things. And given his recent disparagement of the GOP’s “libertarian strain” in the context of the debate over the national security state, I can’t see Christie getting up in the grill of a Pentagon contractor, either. Teachers and public-sector employees who don’t want to pay as much for their healthcare as most of the rest of us do are the “right targets” when you’re arguing about state budgets. In fact, they are ridiculously easy targets. They are to Chris Christie what southern reactionaries are to Sacha Baron Cohen. But I ask Josh: who are the analogously easy marks when you’re talking about the federal budget, and do you honestly think it will do Chris Christie any good to get in their faces? |||||","completion":"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's success in state elections could potentially be put at risk on the national stage due to his confrontational tactics. Christie has built a reputation for directly confronting and challenging teachers, unions, and local politicians, which has resonated with some voters at the state level. However, these tactics may not translate well to a presidential race, where the media and public scrutiny are significantly more intense. Experts argue that Christie's in-your-face demeanor might be seen as bullying or even dangerous by potential voters when discussing issues such as Medicare, food stamps, and agribusiness subsidies, which could be to his detriment in a national election."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, occasionally formerly known as The Imprudence of Candaules, is a 45.1 by 55.9 cm (17.8 by 22.0 in) oil painting on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830. It shows a scene from the Histories by Herodotus, in which Candaules, king of Lydia, invites his bodyguard Gyges to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying and challenges him to either accept his own execution or to kill Candaules as a punishment. Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, still unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last of her clothes. Etty hoped that his audience would take from the painting the moral lesson that women are not chattels and that men infringing on their rights should justly be punished, but he made little effort to explain this to audiences. The painting was immediately controversial and perceived as a cynical combination of a pornographic image and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and it was condemned as an immoral piece of the type one would expect from a foreign, not a British, artist. It was bought by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, and in 1847 was one of a number of paintings given by Vernon to the nation. The work retained its controversial reputation in later years, and when The Art Journal bought the reproduction rights to Vernon's former collection in 1849 they did not distribute reproductions of Candaules. In 1929 it was among several paintings transferred to the newly expanded Tate Gallery, where as of 2018 it remains.","completion":"The painting \\"Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed\\" by William Etty resides at the Tate Gallery in London.

Soon you'll be able to send payments directly to their Visa card. Visa Inc. on Wednesday said it is creating a service to allow individuals to use their own Visa or a bank account to send money to a personal Visa debit, credit or prepaid card. Users also may bring cash to a participating bank to make a transfer. Users also will be able to send money using a recipient's mobile phone number or e-mail address. In those cases, recipients will receive a message that someone is sending them money and then enter their own Visa account number to receive it. Money transferred to debit and prepaid cards will be treated as deposits. Money sent to Visa credit cards will be treated as a payment. Visa has partnered with two companies that provide technology to banks, Fiserv Inc. and CashEdge Inc. Fiserv operates the ZashPay network, which already is used by about 500 banks and credit unions for person-to-person payments. Fiserv said Wednesday that working with Visa will greatly expand its service, which transfers payments in as short a period as one day. About 200 banks, including several of the nation's largest, already use CashEdge's PopMoney service. The increasingly competitive field of person-to-person payments includes eBay's PayPal and a handful of other companies. One advantage Visa will have in the market is that there are about 1.85 billion Visa cards in circulation worldwide. Kelly Alpert of Visa's digital money transfer unit said it's expected that banks will start taking part in the service at mid-year. Any fees related to sending money will be determined by the banks, she said. It will build on Visa's international money transfer business. The company already handles international remittances and person-to-person payments in conjunction with MoneyGram International and Bancomer Transfer Services Inc. Visa shares added 23 cents to 71.45 in midday trading. EBay shares fell 38 cents to 30.06. Fiserv shares fell 14 cents to 58.41. ||||| Visa is launching a new service that will let people send each other money from their Visa or bank account to each other's Visa debit, credit or prepaid card, as we noted yesterday. But while this will open up new vistas of convenience, and offer a way for people who are sick of scammers exploiting Paypal's refund system to conduct transactions, I would at the same time expect to see new kinds of advance fee fraud using the service. Basically take all the scams that we already see and just swap out Visa pay by credit card instead of Western Union and checks.

They want you to send the money by Visa pay by credit card, then a few days later the money in your account bounces. Oopsies.

This scenario falls under the \\"Business\\" category because it addresses the financial performance and dynamics within a specific industry or company. In the business world, a company's financial performance is often measured in terms of revenue, profits, and earnings per share, among other statistics and benchmarks. Meeting earnings projections is an important indicator for investors, as they rely on these forecasts to make investment decisions and judge a company's overall financial health. This software maker managed to meet the expectations established by previous financial guidance, which substantiates its overall market value. However, it's essential to analyze various aspects of a company to understand the whole context. In this case, although the company met its earnings projections, there is a noticeable problem in the applications business, with sales in that particular unit down by a significant 36 percent. This performance could potentially raise concerns if it impacts the company's long-term growth and profitability. The applications unit's languishing sales could be attributed to several factors: heightened competition, a changing market landscape, or possibly internal issues such as mismanagement or lack of innovation. To improve sales performance, the business might need to adopt new strategies or revise its approach to product development, marketing, and sales operations. In conclusion, the given scenario is undoubtedly related to the \\"Business\\" category as it deals with the financial performance and challenges faced by a software maker in a competitive environment.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Simple Yet Effective Method for Preparing Crisp and Refreshing Apples Introduction: Apples are one of the most popular and versatile fruits. They can be enjoyed in various recipes, eaten fresh, or packed in a lunchbox for a healthy, on-the-go snack. However, many people often struggle with preparing apples in a way that preserves their freshness and crispness. In this article, we will discuss a straightforward method that ensures your apples will remain crisp and refreshing, whether you're enjoying them at home or taking them on your trips and adventures. Step 1: Washing the Apples The first step in this process involves thoroughly washing your apples. Since apples are often coated with a thin layer of wax or other residue, it is essential to remove these substances before enjoying your fruit. To do this, simply hold each apple under running water and gently rub its surface. You may use a soft fruit brush if desired, but be careful not to damage the skin. Once the apples are clean, pat them dry with a clean towel. Step 2: Removing the Stems After washing your apples, the next step is pulling off the stems. Although some people might leave the stems on for aesthetic purposes, removing them ensures that no dirt or other contaminants are hidden beneath the stems. Moreover, it makes the apples more enjoyable to eat, as you won't have to worry about accidentally biting into or chewing on a stem. To remove the stems, grasp each apple firmly in one hand and use your other hand to gently twist and pull the stem until it detaches from the fruit. Step 3: Refrigeration Now that your apples are clean and stem-free, it's time to refrigerate them. Place your apples in a refrigerator for about 1 to 2 hours. This simple step will not only keep your apples fresh but also enhance their crispness. The cold temperature inside the refrigerator will help maintain the apple's texture, preventing it from becoming mushy or losing its crunch. Note that you should avoid storing apples near strong-smelling foods, as the apples can absorb the odors and compromise their taste. Conclusion: Preparing crisp and refreshing apples doesn't have to be a complex or time-consuming task. By following the straightforward method outlined in this article - washing the apples, removing the stems, and refrigerating them for 1 to 2 hours - you can ensure that your apples remain fresh, flavorful, and enjoyable to eat. So, the next time you buy a batch of apples, give this method a try and relish the enhanced taste and texture of your fruit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She was born on 19 December 1934 in the village of Nadgaon, in the Jalgaon district of Maharashtra, India. She was educated initially at R. R. Vidyalaya, Jalgaon, and subsequently was awarded a master's degree in Political Science and Economics by Mooljee Jetha College, Jalgaon (then under Pune University), and then a Bachelor of Law degree by Government Law College, Mumbai, affiliated to the University of Mumbai. Patil then began to practice law at the Jalgaon District Court, while also taking interest in social issues such as improving the conditions faced by Indian women. Patil's term as the President of India saw various controversies. She commuted the death sentences of 35 petitioners to life, a record. The presidential office, however, defended this by saying that the President had granted clemency to the petitioners after due consideration and examining the advice of the Home Ministry. Patil was noted for having spent more money on foreign trips, and having taken a greater number of foreign trips, than any prior president. Sometimes accompanied by as many as 11 members of her family, there had been 12 foreign trips spanning 22 countries by May 2012, when she was away on her 13th trip. Those completed travels had cost Rs 205 crore (2.05 billion). The Ministry of External Affairs said that taking family members \\"was not abnormal\\". The office of president has a five-year term and Patil retired from the role in July 2012. Patil allegedly used public funds to build a retirement mansion on a 260,000 square feet (24,000 m2) plot of military land in Pune. Tradition is that a retiring president either takes residence in government accommodation in Delhi or moves back to their residence in their home state; her use of government money to build a retirement home at the end of the presidential term was unprecedented. Other controversies that arose after her retirement included her desire to claim both an official government car and fuel allowance for the running of a private car, despite rules clearly stipulating that this was an either/or situation. She also took possession of many gifts that had been given to her in her official role and was later forced to return them.

The two-time world champion may return to former team Renault.","completion":"Title: Spain's Fernando Alonso Exits McLaren, Eyes a Return to Renault Introduction In a surprising turn of events, Spain's Fernando Alonso, the two-time world champion, has announced his departure from McLaren, with two years remaining on his contract. Alonso's decision has sent ripples through the Formula 1 community, as he had been deposed as world champion after a contentious 2007 season. The talented driver may now return to his former team, Renault, following this shocking announcement. In this article, we will explore Alonso's history with McLaren, the factors that contributed to his decision, and the potential repercussions of his move. Alonso's History with McLaren Fernando Alonso, born on July 29, 1981, in Oviedo, Spain, began his journey in Formula 1 racing in 2001 with the Minardi team. However, it wasn't until his move to Renault in 2003 that he garnered widespread attention by winning the 2005 and 2006 championships. Afterward, Alonso continued to build on his successful career by joining McLaren in 2007. During his tenure with the British racing team, he had an impressive record. However, the controversial 2007 racing season saw him lose the World Champion title, resulting in friction within the team. Factors Leading to Alonso's Decision There were several factors that contributed to Fernando Alonso's decision to quit McLaren, the most prominent being the notorious 2007 season. During that year, Alonso was involved in several controversial incidents, including disagreements with team management and disputes over team strategy. This culminated in a sour working relationship, which many believe was the driving force behind Alonso's decision to leave McLaren prematurely. Furthermore, McLaren's recent struggles on the track and subpar car performance may have been another reason for the Spanish driver to part ways. Having missed out on more significant victories and chances for championship titles, Alonso might have felt that leaving McLaren in search of a more competitive team would be the best move for his career. The Potential Repercussions of Alonso's Move Fernando Alonso's decision to quit McLaren has created both challenges and opportunities for both parties. On the one hand, McLaren will need to find a suitable replacement for the two-time world champion and will have to bear the consequences of losing a crucial figure from their team lineup. This sudden departure could impact the team's performance in the upcoming races, and potentially harm its long-term prospects. Additionally, Alonso's exit may serve as a watershed moment for other drivers in the team, who might evaluate their positions and options. On the other hand, Fernando Alonso's potential return to his former team Renault could boost the French racing team's prospects. In the past, Alonso had experienced immense success with Renault, capturing two world championship titles. His return might galvanize the team and revitalize its performance on the track. Conclusion Fernando Alonso's shock resignation from McLaren has sent tremors through the Formula 1 community and has raised numerous questions about his next destination. With a potential return to Renault, Alonso might be hoping to recapture the form that earned him his title as one of the best drivers in the sport's history. As for McLaren, the search for a suitable replacement and the need to recover from this significant personnel loss will be looking to shape its future. Whether both parties emerge stronger or weaker from this ordeal, only time will tell, as Formula 1 fans worldwide await the next chapter in Fernando Alonso's storied racing career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Several kilometers deep, they obscure the underlying topography. Only nunataks protrude from their surfaces. The only extant ice sheets are the two that cover most of Antarctica and Greenland. They contain vast quantities of fresh water, enough that if both melted, global sea levels would rise by over 70 m (230 ft). Portions of an ice sheet or cap that extend into water are called ice shelves; they tend to be thin with limited slopes and reduced velocities.

Hugh Redwald Trevor-Roper, Baron Dacre of Glanton, FBA (15 January 1914 - 26 January 2003), was a British historian of early modern Britain and Nazi Germany. He was Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford. Trevor-Roper was made a life peer in 1979 on the recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, choosing the title Baron Dacre of Glanton. Trevor-Roper was a polemicist and essayist on a wide range of historical topics, but particularly England in the 16th and 17th centuries and Nazi Germany. A notable thesis propagated by Trevor-Roper was the \\"general crisis of the 17th century\\". He argued that the middle years of the 17th century in Western Europe saw a widespread break-down in politics, economics and society caused by demographic, social, religious, economic and political problems. In this \\"general crisis,\\" various events, such as the English Civil War, the Fronde in France, the climax of the Thirty Years' War in Germany, troubles in the Netherlands, and revolts against the Spanish Crown in Portugal, Naples and Catalonia, were all manifestations of the same problems. The most important causes of the \\"general crisis\\" in Trevor-Roper's opinion were conflicts between \\"Court\\" and \\"Country\\"; that is between the increasingly powerful centralizing, bureaucratic, sovereign princely states, represented by the Court, and the traditional, regional, land-based aristocracy and gentry, representing the country. In addition, he said that the religious and intellectual changes introduced by the Reformation and the Renaissance were important secondary causes of the \\"general crisis.\\" The \\"general crisis\\" thesis generated controversy between supporters of this theory, and those, such as the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, who agreed with him that there was a \\"general crisis,\\" but saw the problems of 17th century Europe as more economic in origin than Trevor-Roper would allow. A third faction denied that there was any \\"general crisis,\\" for example the Dutch historian Ivo Schoffer, the Danish historian Niels Steengsgaard, and the Soviet historian A. D. Lublinskaya. Trevor-Roper's \\"general crisis\\" thesis provoked much discussion, and led experts in 17th century history such as Roland Mousnier, J. H. Elliott, Lawrence Stone, E. H. Kossmann, Eric Hobsbawm and J. H. Hexter to become advocates of the pros and cons of the theory. At times the discussion became quite heated; the Italian Marxist historian Rosario Villari, speaking of the work of Trevor-Roper and Mousnier, claimed that: \\"The hypothesis of imbalance between bureaucratic expansion and the needs of the state is too vague to be plausible, and rests on inflated rhetoric, typical of a certain type of political conservative, rather than on effective analysis.\\" Villari accused Trevor-Roper of downgrading the importance of what Villari called the English Revolution (the usual Marxist term for the English Civil War), and insisted that the \\"general crisis\\" was part of a Europe-wide revolutionary movement. Another Marxist critic of Trevor-Roper the Soviet historian A. D. Lublinskaya attacked the concept of a conflict between \\"Court\\" and \\"Country\\" as fiction, arguing there was no \\"general crisis;\\" instead she maintained that the so-called \\"general crisis\\" was merely the emergence of capitalism. What was the crisis?","completion":"The \\"general crisis of the 17th century,\\" as proposed by Hugh Trevor-Roper, refers to a wide-ranging break-down in politics, economics, and society that occurred in Western Europe during the middle years of the 17th century. According to Trevor-Roper, various events such as the English Civil War, the Fronde in France, the climax of the Thirty Years' War in Germany, troubles in the Netherlands, and revolts against the Spanish Crown in Portugal, Naples, and Catalonia were all connected manifestations of the same underlying problems. The key factors contributing to this \\"general crisis,\\" according to Trevor-Roper, were the conflicts between \\"Court\\" and \\"Country,\\" which represented the contention between the increasingly powerful centralizing, bureaucratic, sovereign princely states (the Court) and the more traditional, regional, land-based aristocracy and gentry (the Country). Trevor-Roper believed that this power struggle played a significant role in the widespread instability and unrest during the 17th century. In addition to the \\"Court\\" and \\"Country\\" conflict, Trevor-Roper argued that religious and intellectual changes introduced by the Reformation and the Renaissance played a crucial secondary role in contributing to the \\"general crisis.\\" These transformations led to social and political upheaval, as the spread of new ideas and differing religious beliefs fueled tensions within societies, governments, and across borders. The \\"general crisis\\" thesis generated significant debate among historians, with some supporting Trevor-Roper's argument, others attributing the turmoil of the 17th century to economic factors, and a third faction denying the existence of a \\"general crisis\\" altogether. The discussion around the \\"general crisis\\" thesis led to a renewed focus on the study of 17th century history and provoked important dialogues among historians on the various elements that might have contributed to the political, social, and economic unrest during this period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's good to know that films like this are still being made (even if they aren't getting wide releases), and Cypher is refreshing for that reason. The plot twists and turns, which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of Cypher's mystery. The plot follows Morgan Sullivan; a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with Digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons, to him, unknown. However, his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as Rita... This film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it's apocalyptic imaging of the future. This gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type, with it's only real close affiliate being Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. The plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish - and more thrilling - plot developing. You never quite know where you are with the plot, which serves in making it all the more intriguing. The acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars; Jeremy Northam and Lucy Lui. Northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale, and does well with his role. Lucy Lui is an actress that has a resume that doesn't quite fit her talent, but she has a look about her that just fits this movie.

Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra Â£32m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging. He accuses Stephen Farry of a blatantly opportunistic decision to force the college to agree to one of the solutions he proposes for the future streamlining of teacher training in Northern Ireland. None of the four options includes St Mary's keeping its current autonomy. It says it is determined to retain its character and Catholic ethos, however, Prof Finn says he is keen for what he called \\"very deep sharing\\" between the various teacher training institutions. That could involve students from each being taught in other university colleges from time to time. Prof Finn strongly objects to the notion that the small scale and specialist premia only exist in Northern Ireland and therefore should be removed. He agrees the payments were removed from similar institutions in England but says those bodies, in return, were allowed to charge much higher tuition fees and were not restricted in how many students they could accept. St Mary's was not permitted that freedom. Stranmillis University College, which has mainly trained teachers for schools other than Catholic, has similar problems but has been in negotiations to merge completely with Queen's University. That process began in 2008 but has met some opposition and has not yet been approved. The reduction in funding and the removal of the premia would also affect that college.

Please answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who replaced Zack de la Rocha? Answer the above question based on the context below: Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.\\" The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues. A:","completion":"Based on the context provided, the person who replaced Zack de la Rocha as the lead vocalist in the band after his departure is Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Reasoning: 1. The text states that after Zack de la Rocha left the band, Rage Against the Machine, the remaining members wanted to continue with a new vocalist. 2. Many vocalists jammed with them, but they did not pick any of them. 3. A music producer and friend, Rick Rubin, suggested that they play with Chris Cornell. 4. The remaining members of the band found an irreplaceable chemistry with Cornell immediately. Therefore, based on these details, we can deduce that Chris Cornell is the person who replaced Zack de la Rocha."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Another situation can occur when one party wishes to create an obligation under international law, but the other party does not. This factor has been at work with respect to discussions between North Korea and the United States over security guarantees and nuclear proliferation. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Discussions between what two countries have been influence by one party's desire to create an obligation under international law?","completion":"The discussions between North Korea and the United States have been influenced by one party's desire to create an obligation under international law. These discussions revolve primarily around the issues of security guarantees and nuclear proliferation. North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), has long been a point of concern for the international community due to its continued development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. Given its reclusive nature and hostile stance towards the West, particularly the United States, the North Korean issue has persisted for decades, making negotiations between the two nations complex and often tension-ridden. The United States, as a major global power and one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, has been at the forefront of efforts to engage North Korea diplomatically in order to resolve the nuclear impasse. Preferably, the United States wishes to formalize an agreement with North Korea under international law that would address and resolve outstanding security and nuclear proliferation concerns. On the other hand, North Korea has been resistant to such agreements, primarily due to its apprehension over the potential implications of committing to such a binding obligation under international law. In recent years, North Korea has participated in various diplomatic engagements, such as the Six-Party Talks and the historic summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018. Despite the progress made in these engagements, there has been no conclusive or legally binding agreement made thus far. One possible reason for North Korea's reluctance to commit to an obligation under international law is the perception that doing so would compromise its sovereignty and leave it vulnerable to potential regime change or foreign intervention. North Korea has often expressed doubts about the efficacy of security guarantees and looks to examples such as Libya, where the promises made did not prevent the eventual overthrow of its leader Muammar Gaddafi. The United States, meanwhile, has sought to exert pressure on North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program, utilizing various methods such as international sanctions, political isolation, and military deterrence. While the United States remains open to finding a diplomatic resolution, the crux of the issue lies in creating an internationally binding agreement that is acceptable to both parties. In conclusion, discussions between North Korea and the United States have been significantly influenced by one party's desire to create an obligation under international law, specifically with regard to security guarantees and nuclear proliferation. While diplomatic efforts are ongoing, the two countries have yet to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement that would resolve these issues and establish a legal framework to ensure lasting stability in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which ocean is probably connected to more oceans with higher salinities? The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters. Hint: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years. The answer is:","completion":"The Listy Ocean is probably connected to more oceans with higher salinities. In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This information suggests that the Madrigal Ocean could be similar to Earth's Arctic Ocean, as the Arctic Ocean has the lowest salinity on average among the five major oceans. This low salinity can be attributed to low evaporation, significant freshwater inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. On the other hand, the Listy Ocean has a higher salinity compared to the Madrigal Ocean, which implies that it has a greater connection to oceans with higher salinities. This could be due to factors such as increased evaporation, less freshwater inflow, and greater connectivity to other oceanic waters. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the Listy Ocean is probably connected to more oceans with higher salinities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel was ranked first for the third consecutive year, followed by Brazil President Dilma Rousseff, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation co-chair Melinda Gates, First Lady Michelle Obama and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The magazine said Sandberg has not only led Facebook’s momentum to gain revenues from mobile advertising, but her March 2013 book, “Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead,” has “incited a new conversation on feminism in the workplace … The manifesto sold nearly 150,000 copies in its first week and has held the top non-fiction spot on bestseller lists since.” Sandberg was also the top tech executive on the list, ahead of Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman, who rose three spots to Number 15. Oracle Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz was number 23, rising from 48 last year. Marissa Mayer, who left Google to take over as Yahoo’s Chief Executive Officer, yet fell from 21 to 32 on the list.

The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Western Europe, also West Europe, is the region comprising the western part of the European continent. There may be differences between the geopolitical and purely geographic definitions of the term. - Wallonia (, , Dutch: \\"Wallonië\\" ) is a region of Belgium. Wallonia is primarily French-speaking, and accounts for 55% of the territory of Belgium, and a third of its population. Unlike Flanders, the Walloon Region was not merged with the French Community of Belgium which is the political entity that is responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education. The German-speaking minority in the east forms the German-speaking Community of Belgium, which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues. - The Minister-President of Flanders is the head of the Flemish Government, which is the executive branch of the Flemish Region and Flemish Community (see the communities, regions and language areas of Belgium). - The Parliament of the French Community (or PCF) is the legislative assembly of the French Community of Belgium based in the Quartier Royal. It consists of all 75 members of the Walloon Parliament except German-speaking members (currently two) who are substituted by French-speaking members from the same party, and 19 members elected by the French linguistic group of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region within the former body. These members are elected for a term of five years. - Belgians are the citizens and natives of the Kingdom of Belgium, a federal state in Western Europe. - The Flemish Parliament (Dutch: , and formerly called Flemish Council or \\"Vlaamse Raad\\") constitutes the legislative power in Flanders, for matters which fall within the competence of Flanders, both as a geographic region and a cultural community of Belgium (unlike the French-speaking community and Wallonia, which each have separate legislatures - the Parliament of the French Community and the Walloon Parliament). - Belgium is a federal state comprising three communities, three regions, and four language areas. For each of these subdivision types, the subdivisions together make up the entire country; in other words, the types overlap. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - The Flemish Region (Dutch: ) is one of the three official regions of the Kingdom of Belgiumalongside the Walloon Region and the Brussels-Capital Region. Colloquially, it is usually simply referred to as \\"Flanders\\". It occupies the northern part of Belgium and covers an area of 13,522 km (44.29% of Belgium). It is one of the most densely populated regions of Europe with around 470 inhabitants per square kilometer. - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park \\"Hohes Venn-Eifel\\", in the Ardennes. Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (not \\"fens\\" as the name would imply) both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park. - Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest juridical authority in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union. - Flanders is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium, although there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics and history. It is one of the communities, regions and language areas of Belgium. The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming, while the corresponding adjective is Flemish. The official capital of Flanders is Brussels, although Brussels itself has an independent regional government, and the government of Flanders only oversees some cultural aspects of Brussels life. - The Flemish Government (Dutch: ) is the executive branch of the Flemish Community and the Flemish Region of Belgium. It consists of a government cabinet, headed by the Minister-President and accountable to the Flemish Parliament, and the public administration (civil service) divided into 13 policy areas, each with an executive department and multiple agencies. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Speaker of the Flemish Parliament ( Dutch : Voorzitter van het Vlaams Parlement ) is the presiding member of the Flemish Parliament , which is the legislature of Flanders ( Belgium ) . The Speaker is elected at the beginning of each parliamentary year , on the fourth Monday in September . The Speaker chairs the plenary sessions of the Flemish Parliament and acts as its official representative . He or she determines whether a certain initiative is admissible and thus can be put to parliament at all . The Flemish Ministers take the oath before the Speaker of the Flemish Parliament . Only the head of the Flemish government , the Minister - President of Flanders , takes the oath before the King . The Speaker also presides over the Bureau and the Extended Bureau of the Flemish Parliament . He or she is assisted by four Deputy Speakers . The current Speaker of the Flemish Parliament is Jan Peumans of the New Flemish Alliance ( N - VA ) . - Brussels, officially the Brussels-Capital Region, is a region of Belgium comprising 19 municipalities, including the City of Brussels which is the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is a part of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the region of Flanders (in which it forms an enclave) or Wallonia. The region has a population of 1.2 million and a metropolitan area with a population of over 1.8 million, the largest in Belgium. - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.

Is this statement correct \\"is the cn tower the tallest building in toronto\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Is the CN Tower the tallest building in Toronto?\\" is correct. The CN Tower, which stands at 553.3 meters (1,815 feet 5 inches) tall, is the tallest free-standing structure in both Toronto and the Western Hemisphere. Completed in 1976, it continues to be an iconic part of Toronto's skyline and serves as a major tourist attraction, telecommunications hub, and symbol of Canadian pride. As mentioned earlier, the CN Tower held the title of the world's tallest free-standing structure until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Nonetheless, it remains a significant landmark and an enduring testament to the innovation and ambition of Canadian engineering. Designed by architect John Andrews and WZMH Architects (formerly known as Webb Zerafa Menkès Housden Partnership), the CN Tower was created as a testament to Canada's industrial strength and ingenuity. Its construction was sponsored by Canadian National (CN), a Canadian corporation overseeing the nation's railway system, which also happens to be the reason behind the structure's name. The CN Tower features a variety of attractions, including the 360 Restaurant, which completes a full rotation every 72 minutes, giving diners a panoramic view of Toronto. Another popular attraction is the Glass Floor, located at a height of 342 meters (1,122 feet), allowing visitors to look straight down onto the streets below. For more daring individuals, there is the EdgeWalk, a hands-free walk around the tower's main pod at 356 meters (1,168 feet) above the ground. Broadcasting remains one of the core functions of the CN Tower, as it serves as a hub for radio, television, and telecommunications signals, including both analog and digital transmissions. The tower's vital role in communications ensures its continuous relevance in maintaining the region's connectivity. In conclusion, the CN Tower is indeed the tallest building in Toronto, playing an important role as both a tourist attraction and a telecommunications facilitator. Its status as one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World and a member of the World Federation of Great Towers highlights its significance in architecture, engineering, and the history of Toronto and Canada at large."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Physical weathering occurs due to temperature changes, freezing and thawing of water, and mechanical abrasion from wind, water, and other natural forces. Chemical weathering involves processes such as dissolution, oxidation, and hydrolysis, which alter the rock's minerals or cause them to break down. This combination of physical and chemical weathering results in the disintegration of rocks into smaller fragments or particles called sediments, which can then be picked up and transported away by agents like wind and water.

Answer: Major architects to promote the change in direction from baroque were Colen Campbell, author of the influential book Vitruvius Britannicus (1715-1725); Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington and his protégé William Kent; Isaac Ware; Henry Flitcroft and the Venetian Giacomo Leoni, who spent most of his career in England. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: Yes, the question is answered in a satisfactory fashion. The Venetian who spent most of his career in England is Giacomo Leoni. Giacomo Leoni was a prominent Venetian architect and draughtsman who played a significant role in the introduction and popularization of Palladian architecture in England during the early 18th century. Born in Venice in 1686, Leoni moved to England around 1714, where he spent the majority of his career. Leoni is best known for his influential translations of the works of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio, which helped disseminate the principles of Palladianism throughout Britain. His publications, which include \\"The Architecture of A. Palladio; in three books\\" (1714-1720), were instrumental in shaping the British architectural landscape of the 18th century. Over the course of his career in England, Leoni worked on several high-profile projects, including the design and construction of numerous stately homes and public buildings. Some of his most notable works include Clandon Park in Surrey, Lyme Park in Cheshire, and Moor Park in Hertfordshire. In each of these projects, Leoni showcased his mastery of the Palladian style, which is characterized by its elegant proportions, symmetrical facades, and classical detailing. Collaborating with fellow architects such as Colen Campbell, Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, and William Kent, Leoni played an important role in the transition from the opulent Baroque style to the more restrained and sophisticated Palladianism. Through his commitment to the principles of classical architecture, Leoni left a lasting impact on the built environment of 18th-century England. He passed away in London in 1746, leaving behind a legacy of architectural excellence that continues to be appreciated today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She, however, will not see him due to a disastrous Japanese tour set up for her by Kelly, and on which Callas was very disappointed with her performances.

Initially resistant, citing her inability to bring anything new and fresh to roles she has played hundreds of times, she finally consents to doing a film version of Bizet's Carmen, as she has never performed that role live on stage, only in recordings. Carmen goes into production, and with the help of Kelly, another longtime friend and journalist Sarah Keller (Joan Plowright), her director and costars, Callas rediscovers the thrill of artistic creation that she thought she had lost, and the love and adoration that millions of fans still have for the diva and her iconic voice.

Please answer the following question: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

This book dispels that notion by telling the history of an unknown immigrant group in the city -- the Italian Americans.The book has nearly 100 family photographs collected from the Italian community in and around Albuquerque. Many of these photographs have never before been seen, and it is refreshing to see them used creatively to tell the story of an ethinc group and its contributions to new mexico.Each photograph is heavily researched, and the result is a compilation of a lot of information about the history of the community.Hopefully this book will set a precedent for other books showcasing the visual history of Albuquerque's many European immigrant groups.

Meanwhile, the Chinese government stayed silent on why Vice President Xi Jinping, expected to be China's next president, unexpectedly pulled out of a planned meeting with Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday. A U.S. official said Mr. Xi was suffering from a back problem. Beijing's information vacuum regarding its senior leaders often spurs speculation by an increasingly curious and digitally savvy public.

Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"He stayed in hotels\\" correctly answer the question \\"Where did Mohamed Atta reside while in Germany?\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"He stayed in hotels\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Where did Mohamed Atta reside while in Germany?\\". According to the paragraph, Mohamed Atta initially lived with a German family in Hamburg, and later moved to a place of his own while staying in the city for his studies at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How is \\"Blagaic has been less fortunate with some of his other ventures during the current downturn, trying to hold car and real estate shows but without success.\\" said in Romanian?","completion":"To translate the given sentence into Romanian, I will carefully consider each word and phrase, taking into account the nuances of grammar and vocabulary between the two languages. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of my thought process: 1. I'll start with the subject of the sentence: \\"Blagaic has been less fortunate\\". In Romanian, the subject would be \\"Blagaic\\" and \\"has been less fortunate\\" could be translated as \\"a avut mai puțin noroc\\". This makes the initial part of the sentence in Romanian: \\"Blagaic a avut mai puțin noroc\\". 2. Moving on to the next part: \\"with some of his other ventures\\". This could be translated as \\"cu unele dintre celelalte afaceri ale sale\\", where \\"with\\" is \\"cu\\", \\"some\\" is \\"unele\\", \\"of his other\\" is \\"dintre celelalte ale sale\\", and \\"ventures\\" is \\"afaceri\\". Now we have: \\"Blagaic a avut mai puțin noroc cu unele dintre celelalte afaceri ale sale\\". 3. The next portion of the sentence is: \\"during the current downturn\\". This can be translated as \\"în timpul actualei crize economice\\", where \\"during\\" is \\"în timpul\\", \\"the current\\" is \\"actualei\\", and \\"downturn\\" refers to \\"crize economice\\". Now our sentence is: \\"Blagaic a avut mai puțin noroc cu unele dintre celelalte afaceri ale sale în timpul actualei crize economice\\". 4. Finally, I'll translate the last part of the sentence: \\"trying to hold car and real estate shows but without success\\". The verb \\"trying\\" can be translated as \\"încercând\\" and \\"to hold\\" as \\"să organizeze\\". The phrase \\"car and real estate shows\\" can be translated as \\"expoziții de mașini și imobiliare\\". The word \\"but\\" can be translated as \\"dar\\", and \\"without success\\" as \\"fără succes\\". This results in the following sentence in Romanian: \\"încercând să organizeze expoziții de mașini și imobiliare, dar fără succes\\". 5. Now I'll put all the parts together to form the complete sentence in Romanian: \\"Blagaic a avut mai puțin noroc cu unele dintre celelalte afaceri ale sale în timpul actualei crize economice, încercând să organizeze expoziții de mașini și imobiliare, dar fără succes\\". To summarize, the translation of the English sentence \\"Blagaic has been less fortunate with some of his other ventures during the current downturn, trying to hold car and real estate shows but without success.\\" into Romanian is: \\"Blagaic a avut mai puțin noroc cu unele dintre celelalte afaceri ale sale în timpul actualei crize economice, încercând să organizeze expoziții de mașini și imobiliare, dar fără succes.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Susan Feldman and St. Ann’s Warehouse Unveil a Permanent Home It is hard to separate St. Ann’s Warehouse from Susan Feldman. She was there at the very beginning, hired by the New York Landmarks Conservancy in 1979 to help find another use for St. Ann and the Holy Trinity Church in Brooklyn Heights, a small parish with a historic past where she oversaw the restoration of its stained-glass windows and began to develop arts programming. She has been there ever since as artistic director, steadily building the institution into a renowned performing arts center that presents productions from all over the world — like the National Theater of Scotland’s “Black Watch” and the Irish play “Misterman” — shepherding the theater from one temporary location to another. And now on Tuesday, Ms. Feldman will unveil St. Ann’s first permanent home, having overseen a hard-earned renovation of the Tobacco Warehouse in Dumbo, Brooklyn. “I feel like we’re finishing the job I started 36 years ago,” Ms. Feldman said, sitting in the industrial, hip new 320-seat theater during a recent interview. After a series of opening events, the season starts with an all-female “Henry IV,” set against the backdrop of women in prison, a production with the Donmar Warehouse of London directed by Phyllida Lloyd — the kind of bold fare that has been a staple of St. Ann’s programming. Next up will be “The Last Hotel,” a new opera by Donnacha Dennehy and Enda Walsh; “Labapalooza!,” from St. Ann’s puppet lab; “Nice Fish,” which Mark Rylance stars in and wrote with the poet Louis Jenkins; “A Streetcar Named Desire,” featuring Gillian Anderson; and “Bianco,” a circus from Wales, which will erect its tent under the Brooklyn Bridge. CreditAlex Welsh for The New York Times With a mop of curly hair and an easygoing warmth, Ms. Feldman, 66, doesn’t immediately come across as a theater maverick. Indeed, she essentially backed into the arts. Having grown up in the countercultural 1960s, she started out working in alternative education programs after graduating from New York University’s uptown campus in the Bronx. In her therapeutic work with former criminals and addicts, Ms. Feldman started using plays and music, which led her toward the arts. Then she started working with Gene Frankel, the director and acting teacher and, in finding new space for him, connected with the conservancy, which enlisted her as a consultant for St. Ann Church. “When I walked into St. Ann’s, something clicked for me,” she said. “It was the perfect combination of history, culture, beauty and inspiration.” As she thought about new uses for St. Ann’s, Ms. Feldman consulted with two theater experts — Harvey Lichtenstein at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Joseph Papp of the Public Theater — both of whom encouraged her to develop arts programming in the church. Artists who have worked with her say that Ms. Feldman has developed a fierce doggedness with which she travels the globe, bringing back daring work. “She responds right from the guts,” Ms. Lloyd said. “It’s not about: ‘Is this a star vehicle? Is it commercial?’ It’s just about, ‘Is this going to change lives?’ ” St. Ann’s operations are modest compared with other major New York arts institutions — its annual budget is 3.5 million and will grow only slightly in the new building to 5 million, because of increased operating staff and programming. (The theater, which used to present from October to May, can now do so year-round; “We have air conditioning,” Ms. Feldman said, triumphantly). The cost of the renovation was also relatively low: 31.6 million, about 16 million of which came from the city. Tom Finkelpearl, the city’s cultural affairs commissioner, said that it was money well spent. “The thing at St. Ann’s that’s been lacking is long-term continuity in one space,” Mr. Finkelpearl said. “They’ve landed in a perfect place that fits in terms of the cultural life of Brooklyn. The many different ways it can be configured is really important — this is going to be able to have small, medium and large events.” The pliancy of the space was essential to Ms. Feldman — keeping the Civil War-era warehouse wide open, using curtains to adjust the stage into different shapes and sizes. “We wanted to recreate that same flexibility that seemed to be the thing that made St. Ann’s useful for the last 36 years in New York,” Ms. Feldman said. This amounted to a tough mandate for the architect, Jonathan Marvel. “It takes a very special designer to not design,” Ms. Feldman said. Mr. Marvel also had to contend with St. Ann’s interest in preserving the 1850s brick walls. “The primary challenge,” Mr. Marvel said, was “how to be respectful of that inspired 19th-century artifact and create a flexible, enclosed 21st-century performance machine.” For Ms. Feldman, the surroundings have fed the work — whether it was the Brooklyn Heights church or the other two buildings St. Ann’s has occupied. “I always loved this idea of taking spaces that had their own character and using them as theaters,” she said. In 2000, the organization left the church to go out on its own, moving into a temporary rent-free space at 38 Water Street, where St. Ann’s Warehouse theater opened in 2001. “We were only going to be there for nine months,” Ms. Feldman said. “We stayed 12½ years.” In 2011, despite having won the right to build in the Tobacco Warehouse at 45 Water Street, St. Ann’s was stymied by a federal-court case in which a few preservation and community organizations contested a decision by the National Park Service to remove the Tobacco Warehouse from classification as federally designated parkland and allow it to be developed. “I know everyone is fighting for what they believe in,” Ms. Feldman said at the time. “We’re just heartbroken. And a little desperate.” So St. Ann’s signed a three-year lease for an interim space at 29 Jay Street, moving there in June 2012, where it remained during the Tobacco Warehouse renovation. Artists say they are looking forward to bringing their projects to St. Ann’s new home. “I would just hope to work there as often as I can,” said Mr. Rylance, whose play opens in February. “It’s one of those theaters that has a family feel.” Ms. Feldman hopes to maintain that feel — by offering snacks at a concession operated by the popular Brooklyn restaurant Vinegar Hill House, turning the adjacent triangular portion of the warehouse into a park and renting out space for community events. The building turned out just as she had hoped. “It’s like a life accomplishment,” she said. “You look back on it and say, ‘So this is what your life was,’ and that’s a great feeling, but kind of a poignant feeling, as well.” “If I want to know what I’ve done for the last 36 years,” she added, “this is what I’ve done.” An article on Monday about St. Ann’s Warehouse, the performing arts organization that is moving into its first permanent home, in Brooklyn, and its artistic director, Susan Feldman, misidentified, at one point, the organization that hired Ms. Feldman in 1979 to help find another use for St. Ann and Holy Trinity Church in Brooklyn Heights. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, it is the New York Landmarks Conservancy, not the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The article also misidentified the first production of the season. It is an all-female “Henry IV” — a hybrid of Shakespeare’s “Henry IV, Part 1” and “Henry IV, Part 2” — not “Henry V.” A version of this article appears in print on October 5, 2015, on page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Housewarming at Long Last.

It is used twice in the phrase, for both \\"keeping the air\\" and \\"holding the heat\\". 2. \\"Vzduchu\\" is the genitive form of \\"vzduch\\", which means 'air' in Czech. Since \\"keeping\\" takes the genitive form in this context, \\"Vzduchu\\" is used. 3. \\"A\\" means 'and', connecting the two parts of the sentence. 4. \\"Udržování tepla\\" translates to 'holding the heat'. \\"Tepla\\" is the genitive form of \\"teplo\\", which means 'heat'.

It has been claimed that Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis had a long-running personal vendetta against Channel 7 and in particular their Sunrise program. Monis spent six years lobbying the Australian media watchdog over what he perceived were breaches of broadcasting regulations involving Sunrise news segments. The hostage-taker died along with two of the 17 hostages he took in the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place just metres from Channel 7's Sunrise studio last week. The attack took place so near 7's offices it prompted speculation the Sunrise studio was his target from the very beginning, but that his initial plans went awry.

Summarize the following: This will ensure you get the best results. Check that the egg is not cracked or misshapen. If the egg is dirty, use room temperature water to carefully wash off the dirt on the egg. If you find the egg, try to guess how long since it has been laid. If it is warm to the touch, it may have been laid within one to three days. Make sure the egg is at room temperature before you put it in the incubator. An egg that has been kept in the fridge will need to be left out to warm up before it goes in the incubator. You may mark the top of the egg with an “x” and the bottom of the egg (the small end) with an “o.” This way, when you turn the egg, you can keep track of how often it is turned. Close the doors of the incubator once the egg is inside. This will keep the humidity inside the incubator. It takes around 26 to 29 days total for Mallard duck eggs to hatch. From day 1 to day 25, the temperature in the incubator should be 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius). The relative humidity should be 86 degrees Fahrenheit (55%). On the first day of incubation, check the incubator regularly to ensure it is at the right temperature and humidity. The first few days are crucial for proper incubation. Turning the eggs is a key step in the incubation process. Use your hand to turn the egg so it is on a different side. Then, wait a few hours and turn the egg so it is on its other side. Do this three to seven times a day to keep the eggs at the right temperature. The more often you turn the egg, the better it will hatch. Get into the habit of turning it an odd number of times each day for the 25 days of incubation. You may write down the times you turn the egg in a log for reference. Do not leave the eggs in the same position every night. Try to turn them during the night or right before you go to bed. Touch the top of the egg with a small bright flashlight. This is called \\"candling the egg.\\" Use the flashlight to check if the egg is growing and progressing. It should not appear clear or cloudy when you touch the flashlight to the top of it. If this is the case, it may not be progressing well. Check the temperature and humidity in the incubator to ensure it is correct. If the egg looks solid in the light, it is fertile and doing well. You can candle the egg again at the end of week 3 of the incubation to make sure it is still growing properly. Put the egg in a hatching tray. Adjust the temperature of the incubator to 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37.2 degrees Celsius). The humidity should be set to 88 degrees Fahrenheit (65%). Make sure the ventilation holes on the incubator are open to their maximum setting to allow the eggs to cool. At day 26 and 27, increase the humidity to 93 degrees Fahrenheit (80%). At day 28 and 29, lower the temperature so it is at 97 degrees Fahrenheit (36.1 degrees Celsius) and the humidity is at 90 degrees Fahrenheit (70%). You do not need to help the duckling emerge from the egg. Let the duckling hatch itself by breaking through the shell on its own. If the ducking makes a hole in the egg and cannot progress because it gets stuck, carefully help the duckling out with clean hands.","completion":"To incubate Mallard duck eggs successfully, first ensure the egg is clean, uncracked, and at room temperature.

(CNN) -- Branden Grace stepped up his bid for back-to-back tournament wins by taking a four-shot lead at the halfway stage of the Volvo Golf Champions tournament at The Links at Fancourt Friday. The 23-year-old South African carded a seven-under-par 66 to set the pace on 12-under 134 after two rounds. Compatriot Thomas Aiken, who shot 70, and England's Lee Slattery, who raced up the field with a best-of-the-day 65, are his nearest challengers. European Ryder Cup captain Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain showed he is still a force at 45 with an impressive 68 to be alone on fourth on 139. Grace only received an invitation to the 35-strong champions-only field by winning last week's Joburg Open and has seized his opportunity in fine style. He was paired with first round leader Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium, who crashed to a 76 to fall six shots off the pace. Home favorite Ernie Els, fellow three-time major winner Padraig Harrington of Ireland and reigning British Open champion Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland are eight shots off the blistering pace being set by Grace. Meanwhile, Colombia's Camilo Villegas and David Toms of the United Stages led after the first round of the PGA Tour's 5.6 million Humana Challenge in California. Villegas carded his nine-under 63 on the Nicklaus Private Course and Toms matched him at La Quinta Country Club. South Korean rooke Bae Sang-moon was in the chasing group on 64 with Ted Potter, Brandt Snedeker and Bob Estes.

This embodies all art forms, the sciences, and philosophies. Historically, different nations or regions of the world have gone through their own independent sequence of movements in culture, but as world communications have accelerated this geographical distinction has become less distinct. When cultural movements go through revolutions from one to the next, genres tend to get attacked and mixed up, and often new genres are generated and old ones fade. These changes are often reactions against the prior cultural form, which typically has grown stale and repetitive.

Spiderland received widespread critical acclaim from music critics, including Spin, NME, and The Village Voice. In a contemporary review for Melody Maker, Steve Albini, producer of Slint's 1989 album Tweez, gave the album ten stars and called it \\"a majestic album, sublime and strange, made more brilliant by its simplicity and quiet grace.\\" Albini found its unadorned production impeccable and said that it vividly captures McMahan and Pajo's playing so well that their guitars \\"seem to hover in space directly past the listener's nose\\", while \\"the incredibly precise-yet-instinctive drumming has the same range and wallop it would in your living room.\\" Select noted that the band's popularity in the college circuit was \\"probably due to the college circuit celebrity status of their drummer – Shannon Doughton, aka Britt Walford, the only male member of the 'all-female' indie supergroup The Breeders\\". Their review noted the multiple listens it may take to appreciate it, acknowledging the album as \\"immediate as a snail trail to hell, 'Spiderland' needs several plays to burn its way into your consciousness, but when it does...\\"In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Mark Deming said that Spiderland is \\"one of the most important indie albums of the '90s\\" and a \\"singular achievement\\" which found the band \\"working with dynamics that made the silences every bit as much presence as the guitars and drums, manipulating space and time as they stretched out and juggled time signatures, and conjuring melodies that were as sparse and fragmented as they were beautiful\\".

The hosts were bowled out for 239, losing their last five wickets for just 43 runs, with Craig Miles taking 5-54. Requiring 315 runs from 70 overs for victory at New Road, Joe Leach struck twice as the visitors fell to 141-5. But Klinger (102 no) hit his second six to reach his ton, sharing 179 for the sixth wicket with Taylor (107 no), his second ton of 2016 against Worcester. Miles' second five-wicket haul in as many matches saw him dismiss Leach, Ed Barnard and Jack Shantry before he had top scorer Ross Whiteley caught for 71 to end Worcestershire's second innings. The home side looked to have gained the advantage when Ed Barnard removed Gloucestershire captain Gareth Roderick (30) and Charlie Morris had Graeme van Buuren caught behind for 42. But Taylor took the attack to the Worcestershire bowlers, while Klinger anchoring the innings from the other end to put the visitors in the ascendency. Having hit 107 off 72 balls - an innings that included 11 fours and six maximums - Taylor left it to Klinger to secure Gloucestershire's second win of the season. There have been a remarkable nine centuries in this season's two Championship meetings between Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. Worcestershire's Joe Clarke recorded his highest first-class score (135) at Bristol in April, before Moeen Ali made an unbeaten final-day 136, to follow the lead of Gloucestershire pair Chris Dent (138 not out) and Jack Taylor (105). Taylor then followed that up with his 107 at New Road in his unbroken partnership with Michael Klinger, which followed Graeme Van Buuren's gritty first-innings 172 not out. But home pair Tom Kohler-Cadmore (169) and Jack Shantry (106) both made career-best hundreds in the Worcestershire first innings. Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes: \\"What a great game. Gloucestershire played extremely well. But we are a young side who will learn a lot from days like this. \\"The aggressive innings from Jack Taylor was outstanding, but possibly more so was Michael Klinger holding them altogether.

Fred started eating junk food and other fatty foods in his 30's. His cholesterol is very high now. Vic became a vegan later,and he is in a very good physical shape. But I can use this background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.

The answer is:","completion":"Fred is the friend who received a decreased oxygen supply to the heart. This is because he started eating junk food and fatty foods in his 30's, which led to high cholesterol levels. High cholesterol is a contributing factor to atherosclerosis.

First he saw the spring tide, which he noted as case A. About a week later he saw the neap tide. He noted that as case B. Rob got curious about the science behind various tidal conditions. But I can use this background: When the Moon is at first quarter or third quarter, the Sun and Moon are separated by 90° when viewed from the Earth, and the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's tidal force. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum; this is called the neap tide, or neaps. Neap is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \\"without the power\\", as in forðganges nip (forth-going without-the-power).Spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, 'slack water' time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average. Neaps result in less extreme tidal conditions. There is about a seven-day interval between springs and neaps. What is an answer for this question: Which case would result in more extreme tidal conditions, case A or case B?","completion":"Based on the information provided, case A corresponds to the spring tide, while case B corresponds to the neap tide. Spring tides are characterized by higher high waters, lower low waters, shorter slack water times, and stronger tidal currents compared to average conditions. In contrast, neap tides are characterized by less extreme tidal conditions. Thus, to answer your question, case A, which represents the spring tide, would result in more extreme tidal conditions compared to case B, which represents the neap tide. To provide a better understanding of the science behind these tidal conditions, the gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun play a significant role in determining the Earth's tides. The gravitational pull from both celestial bodies causes the water in the Earth's oceans to bulge, resulting in the rise and fall of tides. During a spring tide, the Moon, Earth, and Sun are aligned in a straight line (either during full moon or new moon), causing the gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon to combine, resulting in higher high tides and lower low tides than average. Consequently, tidal ranges become larger, and tidal currents become stronger due to the combined gravitational pull. During a neap tide, however, the Moon is at the first or third quarter, and the Sun and Moon are separated by 90° as viewed from the Earth. In this situation, the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's tidal force due to the angular difference. As a result, the tide's range is at its minimum, leading to less extreme tidal conditions. In conclusion, case A, the spring tide, leads to more extreme tidal conditions when compared to case B, the neap tide. This is due to the alignment of the Moon, Earth, and Sun and their combined gravitational forces, leading to larger tidal ranges and stronger currents during spring tides."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose there is increased coal to burn happens, how will it affect MORE electricity being produced. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","completion":"A: more Step-by-step justification: 1. When more coal is burned in a boiler, this results in a higher amount of heat being generated. The reason for this is because coal, when burned, releases energy in the form of heat. 2. This increased heat raises the temperature of the water in the boiler, causing it to evaporate and turn into steam at a quicker rate. Consequently, more steam will be produced under pressure. 3. As more steam flows into a turbine, the pressure and volume of steam increase. This results in a larger force being applied to the turbine blades. 4. This larger force spins the turbine faster due to the greater amount of steam pushing its blades. 5. A faster spinning turbine means that there is an increased conversion of kinetic energy into mechanical energy, which is then ultimately converted into electrical energy through the generator. 6.

Title: Hotel Rwanda Movie plot: Tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples lead to a civil war, in a country where corruption and bribes are routine. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), the manager of Sabena Hôtel des Mille Collines, is Hutu but his wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), is Tutsi. His marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, most prominently George Rutaganda, a friendly supplier to the hotel who also is the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal anti-Tutsi militia.As the political situation in the country deteriorates, Paul and his family observe neighbors being dragged from their homes and openly beaten in the streets. Paul curries favor with people of influence, bribing them with money and alcohol, seeking to maintain sufficient influence to keep his family safe. When civil war erupts and a Rwandan Army officer threatens Paul and his neighbors, Paul barely negotiates their safety, and brings everyone to the hotel. More refugees come to the hotel from the overburdened United Nations camp, the Red Cross, and orphanages. Paul must divert the Hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, be a source of strength to his family, and maintain the appearance of a functioning high-class hotel, as the situation becomes more and more violent, with mobs in the streets just outside the gates.The UN Peacekeeping forces, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), are unable to take assertive action against the Interhamwe since they are forbidden to intervene in the genocide. The foreign nationals are evacuated, but the Rwandans are left behind. When the UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Paul's family, they are ambushed and must turn back. In a last-ditch effort to save the refugees, Paul speaks to the Rwandan Army General, Augustin Bizimungu (Fana Mokoena) and when the bribes no longer work, he blackmails him with threats of being tried as a war criminal. The family and the hotel refugees finally leave the besieged hotel in a UN convoy, and they travel through retreating masses of refugees and militia to reach safety...

The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kant region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former and the . - Etymology. The city's name was historically written as or (both read as \\"Nagoya\\"). One possible origin is the adjective , meaning 'peaceful'. - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market. - Yokohama Pidgin Japanese , Yokohamese or Japanese Ports Lingo was a Japanese - based pidgin spoken in the Yokohama area during the late 19th century for communication between Japanese and foreigners . Most information on Yokohama Pidgin comes from Exercises in the Yokohama Dialect , a humorous pamphlet published in 1879 by Hoffman Atkinson . - Historically a merchant city, Osaka has also been known as the and served as a center for the rice trade during the Edo period. - The earliest written records regarding the region come from the \\"Nihon Shoki\\", which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing in AD 201. For most of its history, the area was never a single political entity, even during the Tokugawa Period, when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa Shogunate. Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889. Its name comes from , an archaic title for supporters of the city's Ikuta Shrine. Kobe became one of Japan's 17 designated cities in 1956. - Yokohama's population of 3.7 million makes it Japan's largest city after the Special Wards of Tokyo. Yokohama developed rapidly as Japan's prominent port city following the end of Japan's relative isolation in the mid-19th century, and is today one of its major ports along with Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, Hakata, Tokyo, and Chiba. - A pidgin , or pidgin language, is a grammatically simplified means of communication that develops between two or more groups that do not have a language in common: typically, a mixture of simplified languages or a simplified primary language with other languages' elements included. It is most commonly employed in situations such as trade, or where both groups speak languages different from the language of the country in which they reside (but where there is no common language between the groups). Fundamentally, a pidgin is a simplified means of linguistic communication, as it is constructed impromptu, or by convention, between individuals or groups of people. A pidgin is not the native language of any speech community, but is instead learned as a second language.

Which brand of milk has lower eutrophication potential per hectare of farmland? Jimmy is currently shopping at his local grocery store during his weekly trip to get food and other necessities. He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk. Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Lakes and Ponds Lakes and ponds can range in area from a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers. Temperature is an important abiotic factor affecting living things found in lakes and ponds. In the summer, thermal stratification of lakes and ponds occurs when the upper layer of water is warmed by the sun and does not mix with deeper, cooler water. Light can penetrate within the photic zone of the lake or pond. Phytoplankton (algae and cyanobacteria) are found here and carry out photosynthesis, providing the base of the food web of lakes and ponds. Zooplankton, such as rotifers and small crustaceans, consume these phytoplankton. At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in the aphotic zone break down dead organisms that sink to the bottom. Nitrogen and phosphorus are important limiting nutrients in lakes and ponds. Because of this, they are determining factors in the amount of phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds. When there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus (from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms, for example), the growth of algae skyrockets, resulting in a large accumulation of algae called an algal bloom. Algal blooms (Figure 44.24) can become so extensive that they reduce light penetration in water. As a result, the lake or pond becomes aphotic and photosynthetic plants cannot survive. When the algae die and decompose, severe oxygen depletion of the water occurs. Fishes and other organisms that require oxygen are then more likely to die, and resulting dead zones are found across the globe. Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico represent freshwater and marine habitats where phosphorus control and storm water runoff pose significant environmental challenges.

WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\\" Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \\"schizoid policy making.\\" Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \\"a horrifically chilling signal\\" that \\"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\\" On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies. \\"This is a fight born out of knowing who we are and fighting for the ideals of our country,\\" she said. Harris spoke after touring a detention facility and speaking with several mothers.​ Trump's call for Congress to postpone action came as House Republican leaders failed to garner enough support for two bills that would overhaul U.S. immigration laws and bolster border security.

Trump believes that Republicans should stop focusing on immigration legislation until after the elections, hoping for a \\"Red Wave\\" to provide an increased majority in both the House and the Senate. Meanwhile, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican from Florida, has criticized Trump's tweets as \\"schizoid policy making.\\" South Carolina Republican Congressman Mark Sanford noted that Trump's reversal on immigration reform sends \\"a horrifically chilling signal\\" that makes it more unlikely.

Nas initially went by the nickname \\"Kid Wave\\" before adopting his more commonly known alias of \\"Nasty Nas\\". In the late-1980s, he met up with the producer Large Professor and went to the studio where Rakim and Kool G Rap were recording their albums. When they were not in the recording studio, Nas would go into the booth and record his own material. However, none of it was ever released. In 1991, Nas performed on Main Source's \\"Live at the Barbeque\\". In mid-1992, Nas was approached by MC Serch of 3rd Bass, who became his manager and secured Nas a record deal with Columbia Records during the same year. Nas made his solo debut under the name of \\"Nasty Nas\\" on the single \\"Halftime\\" from MC Serch's soundtrack for the film Zebrahead. Called the new Rakim, his rhyming skills attracted a significant amount of attention within the hip-hop community. In 1994, Nas's debut album, Illmatic, was finally released. It was awarded best album of 1994 by The Source. It also featured production from Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, LES and DJ Premier, as well as guest appearances from Nas's friend AZ and his father Olu Dara. The album spawned several singles, including \\"The World Is Yours\\", \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\", and \\"One Love\\". Shaheem Reid of MTV News called Illmatic \\"the first classic LP\\" of 1994. In 1994, Nas also recorded the song \\"One on One\\" for the soundtrack to the film Street Fighter. In his book To the Break of Dawn: A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic, William Jelani Cobb writes of Nas's impact at the time: Nas, the poetic sage of the Queensbridge projects, was hailed as the second coming of Rakim--as if the first had reached his expiration date. [...] Nas never became 'the next Rakim,' nor did he really have to. Illmatic stood on its own terms. The sublime lyricism of the CD, combined with the fact that it was delivered into the crucible of the boiling East-West conflict, quickly solidified [his] reputation as the premier writer of his time. Steve Huey of AllMusic described Nas's lyrics on Illmatic as \\"highly literate\\" and his raps \\"superbly fluid regardless of the size of his vocabulary\\", adding that Nas is \\"able to evoke the bleak reality of ghetto life without losing hope or forgetting the good times\\". Reviewing Nas's second album It Was Written, Leo Stanley of allmusic believed the rhymes to be not as complex as those in Illmatic but still \\"not only flow, but manage to tell coherent stories as well\\". About.com ranked Illmatic as the greatest hip-hop album of all time, and Prefix magazine praised it as \\"the best hip-hop record ever made\\". Answer this question \\"What were his hits?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Nas's hits from his debut album, Illmatic, include \\"The World Is Yours\\", \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\", and \\"One Love\\".

York is one of Britain's most successful cyclists of all time. Competing throughout her cycling career as Robert Millar, York won the \\"King of the Mountains\\" competition in the 1984 Tour de France and finished fourth overall. York was the first rider from an English speaking country to have won the Mountains classification in the Tour de France. York was born and raised in Glasgow, Scotland, as Robert Millar. At one time destined for a career as a factory engineer, York attended Shawlands Academy in the south of the city. In 2017, York revealed that she had first felt \\"different\\" aged five, but was unaware that this difference came from discomfort with her gender. She initially began riding for Glenmarnock Wheelers cycling club and quickly established herself as a leading amateur road racing rider. As Robert Millar, she was a relatively small man meaning she had comparatively less weight to carry uphill and she excelled as a specialist hill and mountain cyclist. She won the Scottish junior title in 1976 and was Scottish hill-climb champion the following year. In 1978, York established herself on the British scene. She was twenty-first in the Milk Race, and won the British amateur road race championship. She moved to France in 1979 to join the Athletic Club de Boulogne Billancourt (A.C.B.B.), one of Europe's top amateur teams. York was as ever focused and quickly began winning races such the Grand Prix de la Ville de Lillers. This success brought her the admiration of her A.C.B.B. manager Claude Escalon. In 1979, after retaining her British road title, taking fourth place in the world amateur road championship, claiming five wins in France and winning the French 'Best Amateur' Trophy, she turned professional for the Peugeot cycling team, and as a climbing specialist focused on single-day road races and stage races in hilly or mountainous terrain.

On the other hand, the crew on board the spaceship also perceives the observer as slowed down and flattened along the spaceship's direction of travel, because both are moving at very nearly the speed of light relative to each other. Because the outside universe appears flattened to the spaceship, the crew perceives themselves as quickly traveling between regions of space that (to the stationary observer) are many light years apart. This is reconciled by the fact that the crew's perception of time is different from the stationary observer's; what seems like seconds to the crew might be hundreds of years to the stationary observer.

Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Where does the future appear flattened and slowed according to the crew?","completion":"The question itself is a bit ambiguous, but I'll try my best to provide a meaningful answer by interpreting the scenario. The crew on board the spaceship perceives the outside universe as flattened along the spaceship's direction of travel due to their very high speed compared to the stationary observer. Although the text doesn't explicitly say that the crew perceives the future as being flattened and slowed, it can be inferred from the context that the future might appear this way to the crew, since they are perceiving themselves as quickly traveling between regions of space that are many light years apart from the stationary observer's perspective. This rapid traversal between such distant regions could give the crew the perception of a \\"flattened and slowed\\" future in terms of spatial dimensions and their own perception of time. Based on this interpretation, the future would appear flattened and slowed along the spaceship's direction of travel from the crew's perspective.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Ascension Island is an isolated volcanic island in the equatorial waters of the South Atlantic Ocean, around from the coast of Africa and from the coast of Brazil, which is roughly midway between the horn of South America and Africa. It is governed as part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, of which the main island, Saint Helena, is around to the southeast. The territory also includes the sparsely populated Tristan da Cunha archipelago, some to the south, about halfway to the Antarctic Circle. - Tristan da Cunha, colloquially Tristan, is the name of both a remote group of volcanic islands in the south Atlantic Ocean and the main island of that group. It is the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world, lying from the nearest inhabited land, Saint Helena, and from the nearest continental land, South Africa. It is from South America. The territory consists of the main island, named Tristan da Cunha, which has a northsouth length of and an area of , along with the smaller, uninhabited Nightingale Islands and the wildlife reserves of Inaccessible and Gough islands. As of January 2017, the main island has 262 permanent inhabitants. Meanwhile, the other islands are uninhabited, except for the personnel of a weather station on Gough Island. - Queen Mary 's Peak is the summit of the island of Tristan da Cunha , in the South Atlantic Ocean . It has an elevation of 2,062 metres ( 6,765 ft ) above sea level . It is named after Mary of Teck , the Queen consort of King George V. It is the highest point of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena , Ascension and Tristan da Cunha . The mountain is the peak of the massive shield volcano which forms the island . A 300 m ( 1,000 ft ) wide summit crater caps the peak , and it contains a heart - shaped crater lake . This lake is normally frozen during the winter , and the upper slopes of the volcano are covered in snow . The only recorded historical eruption occurred in 1961 from a vent on the north shore of the island . The island community had to be evacuated . Queen Mary 's Peak was used by sailors on the route from Europe to the Indian Ocean and beyond as a navigational aid . In the 17th century the East India Company instructed captains to sail via Tristan . In 2004 , Ellen MacArthur sighted the Peak on her record - breaking circumnavigation of the world . - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Mary of Teck (Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes; 26 May 1867 24 March 1953) was Queen of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions and Empress of India as the wife of King-Emperor George V. - Saint Helena is a volcanic tropical island in the South Atlantic Ocean, east of Rio de Janeiro and west of the Cunene River, which marks the border between Namibia and Angola in southwestern Africa. It is part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. Saint Helena measures about and has a population of 4,534 (2016 census). It was named after Saint Helena of Constantinople. - A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king (or an empress consort in the case of an emperor). In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch. - Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha is a British Overseas Territory located in the South Atlantic and consisting of the island of Saint Helena, Ascension Island and the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha. - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe.

Max Clifford was jailed for eight years at Southwark Crown Court in May after a jury found him guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against teenage girls and young women between 1977 and 1984. Disgraced PR guru Max Clifford has launched an appeal against his eight-year prison sentence for a string of indecent assaults on four women. In April he became the first person to be convicted under the high profile Operation Yewtree sex crime investigation. He was jailed for eight years at Southwark Crown Court in May after a jury found him guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against teenage girls and young women between 1977 and 1984. The judge said that if the offences had taken place today – since sentencing guidelines were toughened in 2003 – Clifford would have been regarded as a multiple rapist for which he would have been locked up for life. The maximum sentence for indecent assault at the time was two years. The 71-year-old committed the offences after luring and 'degrading' women through his celebrity connections during his high-profile career. Passing sentence at Southwark Crown Court in May, Judge Anthony Leonard told Clifford his personality and position in the public eye were the reasons his crimes were not revealed earlier. He said: 'The reason why they were not brought to light sooner was because of your own dominant character and your position in the world of entertainment which meant that your victims thought that you were untouchable, something that I think you too believed. 'These offences may have taken place a long time ago, when inappropriate and trivial sexual behaviour was more likely to be tolerated, but your offending was not trivial, but of a very serious nature.' For Clifford’s eight offences, the judge gave him a series of sentences of 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, six months, 21 months and 15 months, some to run concurrently and some consecutively, to arrive at a total of eight years. He is now serving his sentence at Category C Littlehey jail in Cambridgeshire. A spokesman for the Judicial Office said Clifford was appealing against the length of his imprisonment which would be heard at the Court of Appeal in London on October 9. The former celebrity agent, who branded his accusers 'fantasists', remained defiant ahead of his sentencing, and said: 'I stand by everything I have said in the last 17 months.' In August, Clifford, pictured kissing a guest on the cheek, was allowed out of prison to attend his brother Bernard's funeral at North East Surrey Crematorium in south west London. A spokesman for the Judicial Office said Clifford, pictured with his former wife Jo, was appealing against the length of his imprisonment which would be heard at the Court of Appeal in London on October 9.

In May, a group of important people called a jury found him guilty, which means they believe he did those bad things. So, the court decided that he must go to a place called prison for eight years as a punishment. Max doesn't think it's fair to be in prison for that long, so he's asking some other important people in a higher court to look at his case again. They will talk about it on October 9th.

Question: suppose the ice cubes will be prepared happens, how will it affect there are less fires. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"To answer the question \\"Suppose the ice cubes will be prepared happens, how will it affect there are less fires,\\" let us analyze the potential impacts of preparing ice cubes on the likelihood of forest fires. Step 1: Consider how ice cubes could potentially influence forest fires - Ice cubes could be used to cool down the air temperature or dampen the vegetation, reducing the likelihood of fires starting or spreading. - If the ice cubes are massive and could cover a large area, they may have a more significant effect on fire reduction. Step 2: Analyze the effectiveness of ice cubes in preventing or reducing forest fires - The effectiveness of ice cubes depends on their size, the area they cover, and whether they can be deployed before or during fire events. - Ice cubes may quickly melt and evaporate under intense heat, especially during fire events or in areas with high temperatures. - If the temperature in the forest is not high enough to start a fire, the ice cubes may have minimal impact on fire reduction. Step 3: Evaluate the other factors that influence the likelihood of forest fires - Forest fires can also be influenced by factors such as human activities, natural occurrences (e.g., lightning), and a changing climate. - If ice cubes are used as a temporary measure, they may not address the root causes of forest fires in the long run. Based on the analysis above, the answer to the question would be: B: Less Preparing ice cubes may have some effect on reducing the likelihood of forest fires, primarily if used strategically to cool down high-risk areas.

However, setting up a hot tub requires proper planning, skilled assembly, and careful preparation. Whether you have purchased a new hot tub or are relocating an existing one, our comprehensive guide will ensure a successful installation process and proper preparation for use. We will break down the crucial steps of planning the delivery route, assembling the hot tub, hooking up the electricity, and preparing the hot tub for use. Step 1: Plan Your Delivery Route of the Tub from the Curb to the Foundation Before your hot tub arrives, it's essential to map out the delivery route from the curb to the foundation carefully. Taking the time to plan will not only make the delivery process easier but will also prevent costly or damaging mistakes. Keep the following factors in mind: 1. Measure Doorways and Gates: Ensure all doorways, gates, and access points necessary for delivery are wide enough to accommodate the dimensions of the hot tub. Don't forget to account for any packaging materials that may add to the tub's size. 2. Check for Obstructions: Identify and clear any potential obstacles along the path. These can include furniture, landscaping, fences, or low-hanging branches. 3. Consider Angles and Turns: Be aware of any tight turns, particularly when navigating through doorways and corridors. Make sure you have adequate space to maneuver the hot tub safely. 4. Surface Conditions: Inspect the ground surface for stability and potential hazards. Uneven terrain, loose gravel, or wet, slippery surfaces may require extra care. 5. Plan Ahead for Equipment: Depending on the size and weight of your hot tub, it may require specialized equipment, such as a crane or forklift, to facilitate delivery. Consult with your delivery service to understand any specific requirements and organize necessary permits. Step 2: Assemble the Hot Tub and Hook Up the Electricity Once your hot tub is safely in place on a level and stable foundation, it's time to begin the assembly process. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully, and enlist the help of a professional technician if necessary. 1. Assemble the Frame: If your hot tub requires a frame, assemble it according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Ensure all components are firmly secured. 2. Install the Shell: Place the hot tub shell into the frame, making sure it is level and properly aligned with the frame. 3. Connect Plumbing: Attach the hot tub's plumbing connections as instructed in the manual. Ensure all connections are secure, and there are no leaks. 4. Hook Up Electricity: To ensure safety and compliance with local electrical codes, hire a licensed electrician to connect your hot tub to the electrical supply. The electrician must install a dedicated GFCI-protected circuit breaker to prevent potential electrical hazards. Step 3: Prepare the Hot Tub for Use With the hot tub assembled and connected to electricity, you are almost ready to relax and unwind. Follow these crucial steps to prepare your hot tub for use: 1. Fill the Tub: Fill the hot tub with water, making sure to follow the manufacturer's recommended water levels. Use a hose filter to ensure the water is clean and free of impurities. 2. Balance the Water: Test the water's pH, alkalinity, and calcium hardness with a test kit, and adjust the chemicals accordingly. It's essential to maintain balanced water chemistry to keep the water clean, safe, and comfortable for bathers. 3. Sanitize the Water: Add a sanitizer, such as chlorine or bromine, to kill bacteria, algae, and other contaminants. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for proper sanitizer levels. 4. Turn on the Hot Tub: Power on the hot tub and activate its heating system. Set the desired temperature, and allow the hot tub to heat the water to the proper temperature before using it. 5. Regular Maintenance: To extend the lifespan of your hot tub and maintain a safe and healthy environment, perform routine maintenance on the water, filters, and other components, as recommended by the manufacturer. Conclusion A hot tub can bring endless hours of relaxation and enjoyment to your home, but proper installation and preparation are vital to its safety and longevity. By following our guide, you can enjoy a stress-free setup process and make the best use of your hot tub for years to come. Remember to consult with professionals and adhere to the manufacturer's instructions throughout the process to ensure the success of your hot tub project."},{"prompt":"Q:I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

After getting the data traced back to Osbourne, who thinks his memoirs have been stolen, Chad and Linda plan to give the disc back to him for a reward, with Linda planning to use the money to pay for plastic surgery. When a phone call and subsequent meeting with Osbourne provoke a furious reaction and go horribly wrong, Chad and Linda turn over the disc to the Russian embassy, offering more information in return for monetary compensation. With no other data to give them, Linda persuades Chad to sneak into the Coxes' home to get more files from their computer.

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Surprisingly, no one knows how many children receive education in English hospitals, still less the content or quality of that education. Proper records are just not kept. We know that more than 850,000 children go through hospital each year, and that every child of school age has a legal right to continue to receive education while in hospital. We also know there is only one hospital teacher to every 1,000 children in hospital. Little wonder the latest survey concludes that the extent and type of hospital teaching available differ a great deal across the country. It is found that half the hospitals in England which admit children have no teacher. A further quarter have only a part-time teacher. The special children's hospitals in major cities do best; general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are worst off. From this survey, one can estimate that fewer than one in five children have some contact with a hospital teacher--and that contact may be as little as two hours a day. Most children interviewed were surprised to find a teacher in hospital at all. They had not been prepared for it by parents or their own school. If there was a teacher they were much more likely to read books and do math or number work; without a teacher they would only play games. Reasons for hospital teaching range from preventing a child falling behind and maintaining the habit of school to keeping a child occupied, and the latter is often all the teacher can do. The position and influence of many teachers was summed up when parents referred to them as \\"the library lady\\" or just \\"the helper\\". Children tend to rely on concerned school friends to keep in touch with school work. Several parents spoke of requests for work being ignored or refused by the school. Once back at school children rarely get extra teaching, and are told to catch up as best they can. Many short-stay child-patients catch up quickly. But schools do very little to ease the anxiety about falling behind expressed by many of the children interviewed.

By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long.

We have this equation: 0 = 414*j - 430*j - 256. First, let's simplify the equation. To do that, we need to combine the two j terms (414*j and -430*j). Imagine you have 414 toy cars and you give away 430 toy cars. The difference will be -16 toy cars. So, we can rewrite the equation like this: 0 = -16*j - 256 Now, we want to isolate the j variable (find out what j is). To do that, we need to add 256 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 256 = -16*j - 256 + 256 256 = -16*j Next, we want to get rid of the -16 that is multiplied by the j.

During construction on the London Underground, workers penetrate an underground cave. A huge dragon emerges from hibernation, incinerating the workers with its breath. The only survivor is a boy, Quinn Abercromby (Ben Thornton), whose mother, Karen (Alice Krige) -- the construction crew chiefâis crushed to death protecting him. The dragon flies out of the Underground, and soon more dragons appear. It is revealed through newspaper clippings and the narration that dragons are the species responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs. They are speculated to hibernate after destroying most living creatures until the planet repopulates. After the dragons reawaken, humanity resists with military force, including with nuclear weapons in 2010. This, however, only hastens the destruction, and within a few years, humans are nearly extinct. In 2020, Quinn (Christian Bale) leads a community of survivors in a Northumberland castle. They are starving while awaiting harvest. Although most trust Quinn, some are restless and defiant. Eddie (David Kennedy) and his group steal a truck to pick tomatoes, though it is too soon for harvest. They are attacked by a dragon; one man is killed, and the rest are surrounded by fire. Quinn, Creedy (Gerard Butler), and Jared (Scott Moutter) rescue them with old fire engines, but the dragon kills Eddie's son before escaping. The Kentucky Irregulars, a group of Americans led by Denton Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey), arrive with a Chieftain tank and AgustaWestland AW109 utility helicopter, the latter of which is piloted by Alex Jensen (Izabella Scorupco). Van Zan has a system for hunting dragons and knows their weakness: poor vision before sunset. He and Quinn kill the dragon who destroyed the crops. Van Zan tells Quinn all the dragons they have found have been female. The Americans believe there is only one maleâif they kill it, the dragons can no longer reproduce. Although Quinn knows about the male dragon, which killed his mother, he refuses to...

The continental crust floats on top of the mantle because the crust is","completion":"less dense than the mantle below. Step 1: Understand the Earth's structure Firstly, we have to understand that the Earth is generally divided into three main layers: the crust, mantle, and core. The crust is the outermost thin layer, followed by the mantle underneath, and then the core at the center. Step 2: Identify the materials making up the crust and mantle The continental crust is composed primarily of less dense, lighter, granitic rocks (including elements like silicon and aluminum), while the mantle consists mostly of denser, heavier, iron- and magnesium-rich rocks. Step 3: Analyze the properties of the materials Denser materials have more mass per unit volume compared to less dense materials. In the case of the Earth's layers, the heavy mantle rocks weigh more, causing them to sink lower in comparison to the lighter continental crust. Step 4: Apply the principles of buoyancy The principle of buoyancy states that an object will float on top of a fluid if it is less dense than the fluid. Since the Earth's mantle behaves like a slow-moving, highly viscous fluid, the lighter, less dense continental crust floats on top of it. Step 5: Relate these properties to plate tectonics This property of density differences and buoyancy plays a crucial role in the Earth's plate tectonics, as it influences the movement of the plates and the phenomena such as subduction, where oceanic plates (being denser) sink beneath the lighter continental plates. In conclusion, the continental crust floats on top of the mantle because it is less dense due to the lighter materials it is made up of, following the principles of buoyancy and related to the Earth's overall plate tectonics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He proposes; she accepts (\\"only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible\\"), and the couple honeymoon in Venice. They travel on to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government lab studying infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriates. Kitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked cholera epidemic sweeping through the area.

Given the question \\"How would Lee feel afterwards?\\", is \\"very proud\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","completion":"Yes. Analyzing the task, we infer that the question is concerning Lee's emotional state after teaching Aubrey how to play the guitar. To decide if the given answer \\"very proud\\" is valid, we need to consider the context of the event. Teaching can typically invoke feelings of pride in the teacher when they manage to successfully impart knowledge to a learner. Given the fact that Lee has taught Aubrey to play the guitar, it is reasonable to assume that Lee would feel some degree of pride after the event. As the intensity of that feeling (in this case being \\"very proud\\") is subjective and can differ from person to person, it could still be considered a valid potential emotional response to this event. However, we should note that the phrase \\"very proud\\" is a specific qualifying detail, which could potentially be an exaggeration, since there's no specific evidence in the context to support the degree of pride Lee might feel. Despite this, as there is no contradicting information given and pride is an expected emotion after teaching skills to another person, \\"very proud\\" can still be considered a valid answer. Therefore, based on the context of teaching and the typical emotions associated with this act, it is justified to say that \\"very proud\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"How would Lee feel afterwards?\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What are the two houses in congress? Answer:","completion":"The United States Congress is a bicameral legislature, which means it consists of two distinct houses. These two houses are the Senate and the House of Representatives. Both houses play a crucial role in the legislative process, representing different constituencies, and ensuring a balanced system of government within the United States. 1. The Senate: The Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress and has 100 members, with two senators representing each of the 50 states. The main function of the Senate is to provide equal representation for all states, regardless of their size or population. Senators serve six-year terms, with approximately one-third of the seats up for election every two years. This staggered term system helps to ensure continuity in the Senate and allows it to act as a more deliberative body. The Senate has exclusive powers not granted to the House, such as the confirmation of presidential appointments, including judges, cabinet members, and ambassadors, and the ratification of treaties. The Senate also plays a vital role in the impeachment process, as it is responsible for trying any impeachments approved by the House of Representatives. A two-thirds majority of senators present is required to convict and remove the individual from office. Some notable Senate committees include the Appropriations Committee, the Armed Services Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, and the Judiciary Committee. These committees play an essential role in shaping public policy by examining, considering, and amending proposed legislation before it is presented to the full Senate for a vote. 2. The House of Representatives: The House of Representatives is the lower chamber of the United States Congress and consists of 435 members who represent the different congressional districts across the country. Representation in the House is based on each state's population, with larger states having more representatives. Members of the House serve two-year terms, with all seats up for election every two years. The House of Representatives is responsible for introducing revenue and spending bills, as all bills raising revenue must originate in the House, according to the Constitution. The House also has the exclusive power to impeach federal officeholders, such as the President, Vice President, or other civil officers, for “high crimes and misdemeanors.” Some significant House committees include the Ways and Means Committee, the Appropriations Committee, and the Energy and Commerce Committee. Just like in the Senate, committees in the House of Representatives work to evaluate, amend, and report on proposed legislation before it is brought to the House floor for a vote. In summary, the two houses of Congress—the Senate and the House of Representatives—serve as the legislative branch of the United States federal government. Both houses are essential for passing laws and ensuring that the country's government operates effectively and efficiently. The Senate represents the states equally, while the House of Representatives provides representation based on population, creating a balanced system for lawmaking and representation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The empire had managed to control nearly all former Byzantine lands surrounding the city, but in 1402 the Byzantines were temporarily relieved when the Turco-Mongol leader Timur, founder of the Timurid Empire, invaded Anatolia from the east. In the Battle of Ankara in 1402, Timur defeated the Ottoman forces and took Sultan Bayezid I as a prisoner, throwing the empire into disorder. The ensuing civil war lasted from 1402 to 1413 as Bayezid's sons fought over succession.

Rick Perry may want to run for president. So let me reintroduce you a former constituent of his, Cameron Todd Willingham Perry, who may soon announce his presidential bid, oversaw the 2004 execution of Willingham, a father of three convicted for the apparent arson murder of his young daughters. Problem was, the evidence used to prove Willingham set the fire that killed his children was based on shoddy science and obsolete investigation techniques, facts that were brought to Perry's attention before Willingham's death. Declaring his innocence to the end, Willingham was executed 12 years after his children's deaths. The New Yorker published a lengthy piece in 2009 detailing the whole affair, a depressing portrayal of a government more interested in self-preservation than in serving justice. Most chilling was the Texas justice system's seeming indifference to condemned killers the moment they land on death row. Here's a disturbing excerpt: The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals was known for upholding convictions even when overwhelming exculpatory evidence came to light. In 1997, DNA testing proved that sperm collected from a rape victim did not match Roy Criner, who had been sentenced to ninety-nine years for the crime. Two lower courts recommended that the verdict be overturned, but the Court of Criminal Appeals upheld it, arguing that Criner might have worn a condom or might not have ejaculated. Sharon Keller, who is now the presiding judge on the court, stated in a majority opinion, “The new evidence does not establish innocence.” In 2000, George W. Bush pardoned Criner. (Keller was recently charged with judicial misconduct, for refusing to keep open past five o’clock a clerk’s office in order to allow a last-minute petition from a man who was executed later that night.) On October 31, 1997, the Court of Criminal Appeals denied Willingham's writ. Without having visited the fire scene, [fire investigator Dr. Gerald Hurstor] says, it was impossible to pinpoint the cause of the blaze. But, based on the evidence, he had little doubt that it was an accidental fire -- one caused most likely by the space heater or faulty electrical wiring. It explained why there had never been a motive for the crime. Hurst concluded that there was no evidence of arson, and that a man who had already lost his three children and spent twelve years in jail was about to be executed based on “junk science.” Hurst wrote his report in such a rush that he didn’t pause to fix the typos.... On February 13th, four days before Willingham was scheduled to be executed, he got a call from Reaves, his attorney. Reaves told him that the fifteen members of the Board of Pardons and Paroles, which reviews an application for clemency and had been sent Hurst’s report, had made their decision. \\"What is it?\\" Willingham asked. \\"I’m sorry,\\" Reaves said. \\"They denied your petition.\\" Perry denied Willingham a stay of execution, an action that may have been forgivable in retrospect had the governor expressed a sincere desire to review the facts of the case given the overwhelming post-execution evidence that Texas made an irreversible mistake. On the contrary, Perry frustrated an investigation by the Texas Forensic Science Commission, replacing three of its members days before the board was set to discuss a report that cast serious doubt on the evidence used to send Willingham to the lethal injection gurney. The meeting was canceled. The Times wrote two editorialsexpressing dismay Willingham's execution and Perry's obstruction of the investigation. Still, the case faded from the national discussion and Perry went on in 2010 to win his third full term as governor. Texas executes far more people than any other state, so it's understandable that Lone Star State Republicans would give their governor a pass. But a Perry candidacy might prod conservatives in less execution-friendly states (such as, say, New Hampshire, which last knotted a noose in 1939) to answer for his apparent indifference to profound injustice. Texas let Perry off the hook; the rest of the nation may not be so forgiving.

In 1929, Lionel Robbins assumed the helm of the London School of Economics (LSE). Eager to promote alternatives to what he regarded as the narrow approach of the school of economic thought that then dominated the English-speaking academic world (centred at the University of Cambridge and deriving largely from the work of Alfred Marshall), Robbins invited Hayek to join the faculty at LSE, which he did in 1931. According to Nicholas Kaldor, Hayek's theory of the time-structure of capital and of the business cycle initially \\"fascinated the academic world\\" and appeared to offer a less \\"facile and superficial\\" understanding of macroeconomics than the Cambridge school's. Who was responsible for bringing on Hayek at the LSE?","completion":"Lionel Robbins was responsible for bringing on Hayek at the London School of Economics (LSE)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Vitis vinifera (common grape vine) is a species of \\"Vitis\\", native to the Mediterranean region, central Europe, and southwestern Asia, from Morocco and Portugal north to southern Germany and east to northern Iran. There are currently between 5,000 and 10,000 varieties of \\"Vitis vinifera\\" grapes though only a few are of commercial significance for wine and table grape production. - Rockpile AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Sonoma County , California , northwest of the town of Healdsburg . Established on February 28 , 2002 , Rockpile AVA was Sonoma County 's twelfth designated wine appellation . The wine region consists of approximately 15,400 acres ( 62 km2 ) in northwestern Sonoma County . All of the AVA has an elevation in excess of 800 feet ( 244 m ) above sea level . Eleven vineyards are currently located within the AVA and there are approximately 160 acres ( 1 km2 ) of planted wine grapes . - Vitis labrusca (fox grape) is a species of grapevines belonging to the \\"Vitis\\" genus in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The vines are native to eastern North America and are the source of many grape cultivars, including Catawba, Concord, Delaware, Isabella, Niagara, and many hybrid grape varieties such as Agawam, Alexander and Onaka. Among the characteristics of this vine species in contrast to the European wine grape \\"Vitis vinifera\\" are its \\"slip-skin\\" that allows the skin of the grape berries to easily slip off when squeezed, instead of crushing the pulp, and the presence of tendrils on every node of the cane. Another contrast with European \\"vinifera\\" is the characteristic \\"foxy\\" musk of \\"V. labrusca\\", best known to most people through the Concord grape. This musk is not related to the mammalian fox, but rather to the earthy, redolent aromas characteristic of the grapes that were known by early American settlers in the New World. The term \\"foxy\\" became a sort of catchall for the wine tasting descriptors used for these American wines that were distinct from the familiar flavors of the European viniferous wines. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer. Question: does jimbob have any friends?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I heard that Robin took his broken car to the shop and they said they would call with an estimate. And I was wondering How would Robin feel as a result? Answer:","completion":"Robin's feelings after taking his broken car to the shop may be quite complex, as different factors will come into play. I will outline some of the potential emotions and thoughts that Robin may be experiencing during this process. Initially, Robin may feel a sense of relief knowing that his broken car is in the hands of professionals who can diagnose and, ideally, repair the issues. This is particularly true if he does not have the technical skills or knowledge to undertake such tasks himself. At the same time, he may be worried about the potential cost of repairs, as car issues can sometimes be quite expensive to fix, depending on the extent of the damage and the car's make and model. While waiting for the estimate, Robin might experience feelings of impatience as he may be dependent on his car for commuting to work, running errands, or fulfilling social obligations. As a result, he may become increasingly anxious to know how long it will take for the car to be repaired and when he can expect to have it back in his possession. Additionally, if Robin relies heavily on his car, he may need to figure out alternative transportation options, which could create additional stress in his life. Upon receiving the estimate from the shop, Robin's emotions may range from relief to frustration, depending on the cost and the extent of necessary repairs. If the estimate is within his budget and accounts for relatively minor repairs, he may feel relieved and satisfied with having made the decision to take the car to the shop. In this case, he could also feel gratitude toward the mechanics for offering a fair price and trustworthy service. On the other hand, if the estimated cost is much higher than expected, or the needed repairs are extensive, Robin may feel overwhelmed, frustrated, and even angry at the situation. In this scenario, he could become stressed about managing the financial burden of the repairs and may need to explore different options, such as getting a second opinion or seeking out alternative transportation solutions. Furthermore, Robin may also feel concern or disappointment if the mechanic informs him that the car has major issues which cannot be easily or inexpensively fixed, or that the car is not worth repairing. In such cases, Robin may need to make a difficult decision regarding whether or not to invest in a new vehicle, which could evoke feelings of uncertainty and apprehension about future expenses and potential debt. In conclusion, Robin's feelings after taking his broken car to the shop will primarily be influenced by factors such as the extent of the repairs, the estimated cost, and the length of time without access to his vehicle. Mixed emotions of relief, worry, frustration, satisfaction, anxiety, and gratitude can all be expected within Robin at different stages of the process, depending on the outcome of the estimate and the ultimate resolution of the car's issues. Over time, once the situation has been resolved, Robin may also reflect on the entire experience, gaining valuable insights and knowledge about car maintenance and how to handle similar situations in the future."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task, you're given a statement, and three sentences as choices.

Determine the connection between the statements: The first statement describes a lady with short hair, her attire, and her position outside a building. The second statement focuses on a rat running inside. There seems to be no clear connection between the two. 2. Consider possibilities: We have no reason to conclude anything about the lady's presence based solely on the rat's actions. It is possible for the lady to be present outside the building while the rat is inside, but we cannot conclude this with certainty without further evidence. 3. Examine the information given: We only have details about the rat's activity inside, and none about the lady. To conclude that the lady is outside leaning against a lamp post, we must have evidence suggesting her presence there. 4.

He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling.

In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.

Question: \\"What is something that not all bird species are able to do?\\" Context: \\"Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \\"fly\\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Not all bird species are able to fly.

Plot title: The Simpsons Movie Movie plot: While performing on Lake Springfield, music group Green Day perished when the lake's pollution dissolves their barge, following an audience revolt after frontman Billie Joe Armstrong proposes an environmental discussion. At their memorial, Grampa Simpson foresees the destruction of the town, but only Marge takes this seriously. Later that day, Homer dares his son Bart to skate naked to the Krusty Burger restaurant and Bart is arrested by Chief Wiggum. Bart considers their neighbor Ned Flanders a better father figure after Homer refuses to take responsibility for the incident. Lisa and a new Irish friend named Colin convince the entire town to clean their lake. Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger and names it \\"Spider Pig\\" (later \\"Harry Plopper\\", and simply \\"Plopper\\"), and stores the pig's feces (and some of his own) in a silo, until Marge tells him to safely dispose of the waste. Homer intends to take his silo to the waste management plant, but after Lenny calls to tell him that Lard Lad Donuts has been shut down and is giving away free donuts, Homer impatiently dumps the silo straight into the lake, polluting it worse than before. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated; Flanders and Bart (who bond after Homer humiliates Bart) discover the creature before the EPA captures it. Russ Cargill, head of the EPA, presents five \\"unthinkable\\" options to U.S. President Arnold Schwarzenegger to keep the town's pollution contained; the slow-witted president, doesn't bother reading number 3 before picking it; enclosing Springfield in a large glass dome. When the police discover Homer's silo in the lake, and his responsibility for sealing Springfield in the dome, an angry mob advances on the Simpsons' home to kill Homer, but the family escapes the town through a sinkhole, which then destroys their house.

What is the language they speak in jamaica?","completion":"In Jamaica, the primary language spoken is Jamaican Patois, also known as Jamaican Creole or Patwa. It is an English-based Creole language that originated in Jamaica and developed through the interaction of West African slaves and their English-speaking masters in the early centuries of European colonization. However, the official language of Jamaica remains English, which is used in all formal settings such as government, business, education, and print media. Jamaican Patois is a unique and lively mix of multiple languages, primarily English, with elements of Spanish, Portuguese, as well as various West African languages, including Akan, Twi, and Yoruba. It reflects the diverse cultural history of Jamaica, having developed as a means of communication among slaves and masters from various linguistic backgrounds in the 17th and 18th centuries. The use of Jamaican Patois is widespread across the island, primarily in informal conversations, popular music, and oral storytelling traditions. It is an integral part of the Jamaican cultural identity, adding a warm and expressive quality to the language. The Jamaican Patois also varies regionally, with different dialects existing across the island, each exhibiting its own unique set of words, phrases, and accents. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to establish Jamaican Patois as an official language alongside English, with some even advocating for it to be taught in schools. This movement aims to empower Jamaicans by legitimizing their Creole language and preserving its rich cultural heritage. Despite these efforts, the Jamaican Patois is not yet recognized as an official language, and English remains the primary medium of instruction in schools and other formal settings. In conclusion, Jamaica has a rich linguistic landscape with Jamaican Patois being the most widely spoken language. However, English is the official language used in formal settings, and Jamaicans are generally bilingual, navigating between the two languages with ease. The uniqueness of the Jamaican Patois and the growing movement to legitimize it demonstrates the strong cultural heritage and pride of the Jamaican people."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Enough With the Teaspoon Approach In The Conversation, David Brooks and Gail Collins talk between columns every Wednesday. David Brooks: Gail, back in the early 1980s, I bought my first computer, a Kaypro. It was big, clunky, slow and by today’s standards, unbelievably primitive. Let’s face it, the State of the Union address is the Kaypro of political events. We ought to totally re-engineer the whole enterprise. Gail Collins: Maybe they could turn it into a computer game that the whole nation would be able to play for just that one night. Every time you successfully matched some candy or thwacked an angry bird, you’d be rewarded with one presidential proposal. David: My model would be the annual letters that Warren Buffett sends out to shareholders or Bill and Melinda Gates send out to everyone. They don’t try to list every little item on their agenda. They just tell us what’s on their minds. Why can’t the president do that once a year? Just pick a topic that he thinks is important and tell the country what’s on his mind? Gail: I do love that idea. The governor of Vermont did that in his State of the State speech this year – he just talked about the growing problem of heroin addiction in Vermont. The address got both national attention and local support. But let’s be honest. No president wants the country to wake up the day after his big speech thinking, “Wow, we’ve got a terrible drug problem.” Or even, “Wow, we should raise the minimum wage.” They want: “Wow, the president has a lot of good ideas.” David: Even though we’ve determined that the format is hopeless, let’s talk about the president’s actual speech. Gail: You mean now that we’ve agreed it has all the drama of the F.B.I. warning on a DVD? I have so much faith in you, David, that I am confident we’re going to make this interesting anyway. David: There were a few aspects that I liked. It was reasonably nonpartisan, especially considering this is an election year, and the president’s party is in some danger of losing the Senate. I expected him to go after Republicans a little more. Gail: Then everybody would have yelled at him for creating bad feelings just when Congress is starting to work together and pass … the farm bill. You have to admit the poor man can’t win. David: Also, it wasn’t very populist. The president has given some speeches that give voice to economic populism. But in front of a national TV audience he decided to go the other way. Instead of attacking big corporations and concentrated wealth, he made nice with them. Gail: The White House is terrified the president will be accused of “class warfare.” Back in the day, they used to yell “Communist!” This is a new McCarthyism created for rich people by spin doctors. David: I thought the whole thing was pretty Clintonian. The mix of modest policies was the same: plans to boost savings, a vague reference to reforming the earned-income tax credit. And so on. The only problem is that Clinton was governing in a time of peace and prosperity whereas we are now in a time when a lot of people think the country is going down the tubes. Gail: Clinton was governing in a time of prosperity partially because he was balancing the budget by raising taxes. Class warfare! David: I wish the president had been more aggressive. Instead he talked about adding a few more tech hubs and reforming patent laws. I well remember those inspiring 2008 speeches on hope, change and modest improvements in our patent law. Gail: I am sorry to have to deliver this message but the hopey-changey Barack Obama is gone, his spirit squashed to smithereens by Congress. David: I know his aides were trying to be realistic. Not much big can get passed, or funded, so let’s at least mention a few things that might actually happen like tech hubs. But if you are going to describe big structural problems — flat mobility, widening inequality, wage stagnation, stagnant human capital — at least you can describe an general approach commensurate with the size. I would have said to hell with realism — we can issue a white paper with our policy agenda. In the speech, let’s try to reframe the debate. Gail: David, I’m so impressed! Obviously I agree totally, but aren’t you the one who has been complaining about anything that smacks of wealth redistribution? David: I would have understood and disagreed with a big lefty populist agenda. I would have supported a big agenda that mixes good ideas from left and right — wage subsidies for poor men combined with a big child tax credit, for example — but I’m frustrated with teaspoon approaches to torrential problems. Gail: Do not imagine that I would oppose wage subsidies for poor men. I just oppose taking money away from poor women with children in order to pay for them. But your point is absolutely right. I’ve been thinking about early childhood education, which everybody likes. But to really pay for it – on a quality level – you have to combine it with big tax revenue. Which nobody wants to talk about. Except our new mayor in New York City, who’s being ignored. David: All this makes me think that we’re in for a bigger and wilder change election than maybe we anticipate. The country is in a sour mood, as, say, the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC poll shows. Pessimism rules everywhere. Gail: Yeah, there’s a limit to how long we can congratulate ourselves for having a Congress that’s capable of passing a budget. David: You certainly got no sense of fresh policy goodness from the Republican response either. There’s a lot of pent-up demand for something new and when it comes I suspect it is going to be wild and woolly. Gail: And then the president could get up and say “the state of the union is wild and woolly?” Works for me. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"In this conversation, David Brooks and Gail Collins discuss the State of the Union address and criticize the current format as being outdated and lacking impact. They suggest re-engineering the address, with Brooks proposing a model similar to Warren Buffett or Bill and Melinda Gates’ annual letters, in which they focus on a single topic. They also address how President Barack Obama's State of the Union speeches have been less aggressive and more cautious, with modest policies. They conclude with a discussion about the country's sour mood and the potential for a wild and woolly change election."},{"prompt":"What is the answer for the question: Who did the men who deserted tell of La Salle's death in 1688? from the following article ? Four of the men deserted when they reached the Neches River. La Salle and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for two months. While the men recovered, the group ran low on food and gunpowder. In August, the eight surviving members of the expedition returned to Fort Saint Louis, having never left East Texas.While La Salle was gone, six of those who had remained on the Belle finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors did not know how to sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.By early January 1687, fewer than 45 of the original 180 people remained in the colony, which was beset by internal strife. La Salle believed that their only hope of survival lay in trekking overland to request assistance from New France, and some time that month he led a final expedition to try to reach the Illinois Country. Fewer than 20 people remained at Fort Saint Louis, primarily women, children, and those deemed unfit, as well as seven soldiers and three missionaries with whom La Salle was unhappy. Seventeen men were included on the expedition, including La Salle, his brother, and two of his nephews. While camping near present-day Navasota on March 18, several of the men quarreled over the division of buffalo meat. That night, an expedition member killed one of La Salle's nephews and two other men in their sleep. The following day La Salle was killed while approaching the camp to investigate his nephew's disappearance. Infighting led to the deaths of two other expedition members within a short time.

A Fullerton, California, police officer charged with second-degree murder in the beating death of a mentally ill homeless man was released from jail Thursday after posting a bond in lieu of 1 million bail, the Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. Manuel Ramos, 37, a 10-year veteran of the Fullerton Police Department, is also charged with involuntary manslaughter in the July death of Kelly Thomas, 37. Ramos' family and friends raised the 100,000 for the bond -- which typically is 10% of the bail -- to secure his release from custody, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County sheriff. Ramos was released shortly after midnight Thursday, Amormino said. \\"By the time they do the paperwork and things of that nature, many times it's that late in the morning,\\" Amormino told CNN. Thomas' father, Ron, 55, of Cypress, California, objected to Ramos' release and said Ramos should have been held without bail. \\"I don't want him released because he brutally murdered my son,\\" said Thomas, who's a safety consultant for the construction industry. He was an Army Ranger in special ops for 10 years; a martial arts master, he now teaches hand-to-hand combat to Marines going to Iraq and Afghanistan, he said. Also charged in the Thomas case is Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli, who is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. He was released last week on 25,000 bail. Both officers have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The two men are among six Fullerton police officers -- all men -- who were involved in the Thomas arrest and have been placed on involuntary, paid administrative leave. The FBI is also investigating the incident for civil rights violations. Ron Thomas, the father, said Thursday he wants criminal charges against each of the other four officers. \\"Even if he just stood there and did absolutely nothing, that's what he should be charged with. He didn't prevent my son's death,\\" Thomas said. The Orange County district attorney's office said this month that no charges were filed against the other four because \\"the evidence does not show knowing participation in an unlawful act on the part of these officers.\\" Kelly Thomas, a 37-year-old homeless man with schizophrenia, was beaten by police during an altercation July 5 and died five days later. The case drew widespread attention to the police department of Fullerton, about 25 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Since then, two other allegations of brutality at the hands of city police have surfaced, both regarding unrelated arrests in 2010. District Attorney Tony Rackauckas and fellow prosecutors viewed 16 minutes of bus depot surveillance video showing what happened in the Thomas case, Rackauckas has said. Thomas suffered brain injuries, facial fractures, rib fractures, and extensive bruising and abrasions, the prosecutor's office said. The Orange County coroner listed his manner of death as a homicide and said he died after having his chest compressed, leaving him unable to breathe. Ramos had made initial contact with Thomas -- whom he knew as a \\"homeless drifter\\" -- after police received a call about a homeless man looking in car windows and pulling on handles of parked cars, Rackauckas said. \\"He lifted his fists to Kelly Thomas and he said, 'You see my fist? Now they're getting to ready to F you up,' \\" Rackauckas said, using \\"F\\" instead of the full profanity. The district attorney said Ramos' conduct was unacceptable and \\"not protecting and serving\\" the public. \\"Ramos had to know that he was creating a situation where Kelly Thomas feared for his life and was struggling to get away from an armed officer who was going to 'F him up,'\\" Rackauckas said. Cicinelli arrived at the scene later. He is accused of using excessive force when he allegedly assaulted and beat Thomas, including using the front end of his Taser to hit the victim on the head and face eight times while the man was pinned to the ground by other officers. At that point, Thomas was making no audible sounds, indicating that he was \\"down and seriously injured,\\" the prosecutor's office said. CNN's Stella Chan contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A police officer in Fullerton, California, was charged with second-degree murder for beating a homeless man named Kelly Thomas, who later died. The officer, named Manuel Ramos, had to pay 1 million for bail and got help from his family and friends to raise the money. Kelly Thomas's father was very upset and thought the officer should stay in jail. Another officer involved in the case was also charged with a crime, and they both said they are not guilty. The police officers were accused of using too much force when arresting Kelly Thomas, who had a mental illness. Kelly's father wants all the officers involved to be charged with a crime, but the people in charge said there wasn't enough evidence for that. This case has caused many people to pay attention to how the police in Fullerton treat people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

For the past few months I ' ve been really sad , exhausted , frustrated with the whole Cameron Wheeler thing blowing up in my face . Why did the narrator and their friend bond so easily ?","completion":"The narrator and their friend bonded so easily in group settings because they share very similar personalities. Being slightly sarcastic and funny in a group creates an environment where both individuals can feel at ease, connect better, and understand each other's jokes and way of thinking. The shared sense of humor helps to build rapport between them and reassures them that their comedic tendencies are appreciated by the other person. In addition, people tend to gravitate towards those who share similar personality traits, as it allows for a more comfortable and predictable social interaction. By being attracted to each other's humor and ambition, the narrator and their friend likely found common ground in their aspirations, which in turn contributed to their bonding experience. However, it is important to note that the bond between the narrator and their friend seems to be more superficial and situational rather than based on deep emotional connection, as they mention having not much to discuss one on one. It is possible that the depth of their relationship is primarily driven by their compatibility in group settings, where they can rely on the energy and support of others to maintain their conversations and camaraderie. Moreover, the emotional state of the narrator could be playing a role in their bonding experience. The narrator has been experiencing sadness, exhaustion, and frustration due to a previous relationship with Cameron Wheeler that did not end well. This emotional background might encourage the narrator to find solace and comfort in a new relationship that seems to be easier and less complex, strengthening their bond with the friend. It is also worth mentioning that the narrator does not seem to be overly invested in the relationship and is not expecting much from it. This lack of pressure to advance the relationship or expose deeper layers of their personalities might create a more relaxed atmosphere, which could contribute to the ease with which they bond in group settings. In conclusion, the narrator and their friend bond easily in group settings primarily because their very similar personalities provide comfort, reassurance, and a shared sense of humor. Their compatibility in these social situations creates a basis for their connection, even if it remains shallow outside of group interactions. The narrator's emotional state and detachment from relationship outcomes may also contribute to their smooth bonding experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered.

All that will now disappear from the EU display cabinet.

Italy too is a huge concern. How will this impact the pockets of hundreds of thousands of families across the continent? The EU also worries Brexit could reverse 70 years of European integration. In all my years watching European politics, I have never seen such a widespread sense of Euroscepticism. Plenty of Europeans looked on with envy yesterday as Britain cast its in-out vote. Many of the complaints about the EU raised by the Leave campaign resonated with voters across the continent. Across Europe leading Eurosceptic politicians queued up on Friday morning to crow about the UK referendum result. \\"Victory for freedom,\\" tweeted Marine Le Pen of France's National Front.

Who was the last Viceroy of India","completion":"The last Viceroy of India was Lord Louis Mountbatten, who served from March 24, 1947, until August 15, 1947, when India gained its independence from Britain. Born on June 25, 1900, Mountbatten was a British naval officer, statesman, and member of the British Royal Family. He was appointed as the Viceroy of India by Prime Minister Clement Attlee with the primary task of overseeing the transition of British India to independent India. Although he had previously held several notable positions such as Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command during World War II, Lord Mountbatten is most remembered for his remarkable role as the last Viceroy of India. In his role as Viceroy, Mountbatten faced numerous challenges, including religious divisions, political tensions, and communal violence. His main task was to facilitate the negotiations between the key Indian political leaders, such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and Mahatma Gandhi, to agree on the terms for the peaceful transition of power to the Indian people. Mountbatten initially planned to come up with a solution for the political impasse by June 1948. However, due to the escalating violence and the increasing demands for a separate state for Muslims, led primarily by Jinnah and his political party, the All-India Muslim League, Mountbatten decided to expedite the process. He then brought forward the formal transfer of power to August 1947, thus creating the countries of India and Pakistan upon independence. During the brief period of his Viceregal tenure, Mountbatten worked towards creating trust and harmony between the different factions, while striving to ensure a smooth separation between India and Pakistan. Despite his efforts, the Partition of India was accompanied by significant violence and the displacement of around 10-12 million people as they migrated between the newly created nations of India and Pakistan. Following the official transfer of power, Mountbatten stayed in India and became the first Governor-General of independent India, serving until June 1948. Concurrently, he also remained the Governor-General of Pakistan until August 14, 1947. As Governor-General, Mountbatten provided stability during the initial months of India's independence but eventually relinquished his position, making way for Indian leadership. Lord Mountbatten's tenure as the last Viceroy of India represents a significant moment in history, as it witnessed the end of British colonial rule in India and the birth of two sovereign nations: India and Pakistan. Although his term as Viceroy was marked by widespread communal violence and mass displacement, Mountbatten's efforts to broker peace and ensure a relatively smooth transition to independence for the people of India and Pakistan cannot be disregarded."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The dominant home side had endured a frustrating time as Nathan Redmond missed from 12 yards before a Charlie Austin strike hit the crossbar. But just past the hour substitute Austin chested down the ball and sent in a rising shot to put Saints ahead. Gylfi Sigurdsson had a late Swansea chance but saw his low shot saved. Relive Southampton's win over Swansea Southampton, who sold forwards Graziano Pelle and Sadio Mane in the summer, started with Shane Long and Redmond in attack but they struggled as the home side failed to turn their superiority into goals. Long did go close when a low curling shot was saved and was unhappy when Redmond sent an effort high instead of squaring to him. Redmond has been switched from a winger role at former clubs Birmingham and Norwich to striker's duties since his summer switch to St Mary's and showed the lack of a finishing touch. He wasted a glorious chance when he gathered a Dusan Tadic ball and cut inside a defender only to shoot horribly high from 12 yards. Puel brought on Austin for Long, who had been booked for diving, and the the move paid off as he added to his two goals in the midweek Europa League win over Sparta Prague. He had gone close when a shot from a Redmond cross hit the bar and bounced to safety off keeper Lukasz Fabianski's head, but he made amends with a clinical finish after a Tadic cross reached him at the far post. \\"I should have had three,\\" said Austin. \\"I'm frustrated, of course, [to be on the bench] as I scored twice in midweek but if the manager wants to rotate then he is the boss. We have a strong squad.\\" Swansea were clearly hoping to frustrate their hosts and catch them on the counter-attack or with a set-piece but Francesco Guidolin's side lacked the quality to do either. Such was their lack of threat, Southampton comfortably kept their first clean sheet in 17 games, their last one having also come against Swansea in February. Visiting forward Fernando Llorente was provided with little service and when he did get a touch to a Modou Barrow cross Jose Fonte was on hand to block his effort. The next noteworthy chance for the visitors fell to Sigurdsson after 86 minutes - and he would have snatched an undeserved draw had Forster not smartly saved before Oriol Romeu cleared the loose ball to prevent Jefferson Montero turning it in. Swansea are now winless in the league since their opening day victory over Burnley and their next three league games are against Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal. Southampton manager Claude Puel: \\"It was a difficult game. I say congratulations to my players - they kept a good spirit and a good attitude. We found the solution to score. \\"It is important for the future. We have to play every few days, many games, and it is hard physically. It is important for the squad to play games and improve and make progress.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin: \\"Southampton deserved to win.

Estranged wife said he kept the money in British account to avoid tax. He was forced to quit French cabinet last year amid claims he also hid money in Singapore and Switzerland. President Francois Hollande expelled him from ruling Socialist Party.

He had a very important job as the Budget Minister of a big and beautiful country called France. His job was to help take care of all the money the country needed to run schools, hospitals, and everything else. One day, Jerome's wife, who was not his best friend anymore, told everyone that he had a secret nest egg. A nest egg is like a little treasure that people keep hidden for a rainy day. Jerome's nest egg was hidden in a British bank account so that he didn't have to pay taxes on it in France. You see, when people pay taxes, it helps the country pay for things like schools and hospitals. Jerome's secret nest egg wasn't very nice, because it meant he was keeping money for himself when other people needed it. When the people in the French cabinet (a fancy name for a group of important people who help run the country) found out about this, they made him quit his job. They were very upset with him because he was hiding money from France, and other countries like Singapore and Switzerland too! The President of France, a man named Francois Hollande, was really mad. He said, \\"Jerome, you can't be in our special club called the Socialist Party anymore!\\" So Jerome was kicked out of the club. This story happened at a time when some people in France were already upset about having to pay more taxes. In fact, some really, really rich people were asked to pay 75% of their money in taxes! That's a lot! And they were not happy about it. So, kids, the lesson here is to always be honest and fair with your money.

His father is a former professional footballer and played for clubs such as Chester City and Everton. Owen was introduced to football at the age of seven by his father who soon saw Michael as the most promising athlete in the family.

Context: Owen scored his first goal for United back from injury in a 7-1 pre-season victory against a League of Ireland XI on 4 August 2010 at the newly built Aviva Stadium. On 22 September 2010, Owen netted his first goals of the season as he netted twice during a 5-2 away win over Scunthorpe United in the third round of the League Cup. Four days later, Owen scored his first league goal of the season as he netted United's second equaliser with his first touch in a 2-2 away draw against Bolton Wanderers. Owen's first goal of 2011 came in United's 2-1 FA Cup victory over Southampton at St Mary's Stadium on 29 January. On 25 February, United manager Alex Ferguson said that Owen was a key part of his squad for the rest of the season. However, he suffered a groin injury and missed his team's next four games. His return match was on 19 March when he returned to the bench for United's game against Bolton. By the time of United's penultimate game of the season, he had reached the number of league appearances required for a title winner's medal - his first in 15 seasons as a professional. The game, on 14 May 2011, only required United to draw with Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park to win the title, and a 1-1 draw secured it for them. Owen was an unused substitute in the game. Owen scored United's final goal in their last league game of the season, at home to Blackpool, in which the Red Devils won 4-2. Owen was an unused substitute in Man United's uninspiring Champions League final defeat to Barcelona, marking the end of his season. He signed a one-year extension to his contract on 1 June 2011.

Jess Claiborne Neely (January 4, 1898 - April 9, 1983) was an American football player and a baseball and football coach. He was head football coach at Southwestern University (now Rhodes College) from 1924 to 1927, at Clemson University from 1931 to 1939 and at Rice University from 1940 to 1966, compiling a career college football record of 207-176-19. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1971. Neely was also the head baseball coach at the University of Alabama (1929-1930), at Clemson (1932-1938) and at Rice (1945 and 1948), tallying a career college baseball mark of 109-108-5. In the second week of the 1921 season the Commodores shut out the Mercer Baptists, 42-0. Neely helped score one of four second-quarter touchdowns with a 55-yard pass to end Tot McCullough, and had a 25-yard punt return in the second half. In the next game, a 21-14 victory over the Kentucky Wildcats, the Wildcats scored against the Commodores for the first time in their history. Kentucky's second possession began with Bob Lavin fumbling the return, which was recovered by Neely on the 10-yard line. On third down, after little gain on first and second, Frank Godchaux ran an end-around touchdown. Rupe Smith scored the other two touchdowns, his first on a drive begun with a 22-yard pass from Neely to captain Pink Wade (father of later Vanderbilt quarterback Bill Wade). One Kentucky touchdown followed a blocked Neely punt. The Wildcats threatened to score late and tie the game, but they turned the ball over on downs at the two-yard line; Neely ran 34 yards, to the 36-yard line. In the season's sixth week, Vanderbilt defeated Alabama 14-0 at Birmingham in line with predictions. Neely played a role in both touchdowns. Early in the first quarter, Vanderbilt had the ball at midfield after an Alabama punt. Two line bucks preceded Neely's connection with Tot McCullough for a 30-yard pass play. Neely ran for about 17 yards more through left tackle, putting the ball on the nine-yard line. After a run by Frank Godchaux, Lynn Bomar bucked over the line for the touchdown and Rupe Smith made the field goal. The second scoring drive began with a pass interception by Paul Stumb. In the second half, quarterback Doc Kuhn invigorated the Commodores after he sat out the first half due to injuries; Neely ran for 21 yards around the right end, and Kuhn passed 25 yards to Tot McCullough. Rupe Smith (or Kuhn) then ran the remaining few yards for the touchdown. For its seventh game, Vanderbilt faced the defending Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) champion Georgia Bulldogs at home. The game, the highlight of Vanderbilt's season, was described by The New York Times as an \\"important clash\\" and would determine the SIAA champion. Georgia scored during the first half; early in the fourth quarter Neely intercepted a pass, weaving for 25 yards to Georgia's 40-yard line before he was tackled by Jim Reynolds. Two long pass attempts failed, and Thomas Ryan lined up to punt. Rupert Smith sneaked behind Ryan; he rushed to recover the 25-yard onside kick, jumping up to get the ball off a bounce from the Bulldogs and racing for a 15-yard touchdown. The game ended in a tie, and the teams shared the SIAA championship. Vanderbilt finished its season against Sewanee in \\"the muddiest game in its history\\"; the Commodores were reportedly knee-deep in mud and water, with the players unrecognizable. The game was scoreless until the fourth quarter, when Sewanee fumbled the snap on a punt; the punter was smothered by the Commodores' Neely, Godchaux and Wade for a safety.

Donald Trump has tweeted another critique about a major defense company -- and the stock immediately fell. Trump tweeted Monday morning that \\"the F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.\\" Shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT), which makes the F-35 fighting jets, plunged 4% following Trump's tweet. According to the fiscal 2017 Department of Defense budget released earlier this year, the Pentagon planned to spend 10.1 billion for F-35s -- 43 F-35As for the Air Force, 16 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps and 4 F-35Cs for the Navy. The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016 It's not clear what prompted Trump to tweet about the F-35. He also didn't elaborate about how specifically he would try and save money on the F-35. But current Defense Secretary Ash Carter is now in Israel in order to help celebrate the delivery of two F-35 jets there. Several stories about Carter's visit have pointed out that the F-35 program costs about 400 billion overall for the next few years, making it the Pentagon's most expensive program. And Trump appears to be a voracious consumer of the news, often tweeting relatively quickly after seeing something reported on TV. The F-35 program has also been criticized by Republican and Democratic members of Congress for delays and cost overruns during the past few years. Sen. John McCain, the Republican from Arizona and 2008 GOP presidential nominee, said in April that repeated problems with the F-35 were \\"both a scandal and a tragedy.\\" Related: Good to be on Trump's blacklist. Stocks he bashed soar Lockheed Martin's F-35 Program Manager Jeff Babione said in Israel Monday that he \\"looks forward to any questions the President-elect might have\\" about the program. \\"I certainly welcome the opportunity to address any question that the President-elect would have about the program,\\" he added. \\"Lockheed Martin and its industry partners understand the importance of affordability for the F 35 program.\\" Trump's attack on Lockheed is just his latest use of his Twitter feed as a means to try and shame big companies into negotiating better terms with the government. Trump tweeted his concerns about the price of Air Force One last week as well. And shares of Air Force One maker Boeing (BA) quickly fell following his attack. But Boeing's stock quickly recovered, largely due to the realization that it and other defense companies could be big winners with Trump in office and Republicans controlling Congress. In fact, Boeing and shares of several other companies that Trump has attacked on social media, TV or in print have actually done well since the election, including Carrier owner and defense contractor United Technologies (UTX) and Ford (F). United Technologies was trading lower on Monday though. Its Pratt & Whitney unit makes the engine for the F-35 Lightning II. Shares of two other defense companies that are also partners in the F-35, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and U.K.-based BAE Systems (BAESY), were lower as well. -- CNN's Zachary Cohen, Ian Lee and Samantha Beech contributed to this story. ||||| Lockheed Martin As a general in World War II, President Dwight D. Eisenhower intimately knew how to lead and manage the armed forces. After years of public service, he prepared to leave his position as the Commander in Chief with a final farewell address to the nation. In this farewell address, he outlined the dangers of what he coined as the \\"military industrial complex.\\" Although Eisenhower could have been unwavering in his argument, one cannot deny the amazing advancements, or the destructive power, that military R&D; has created.

Photo: Getty Donald Trump took aim at the Pentagon’s costliest program on Monday, saying on Twitter the “program and cost” of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter “is out of control.” This is the second defense program in recent days the president-elect has unloaded on for cost issues. Last week, Mr. Trump claimed the government’s second-largest defense contractor, Boeing Co., had run up costs in the development of new Air Force One aircraft. The developer of the F-35 program is the government’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin Corp. ... ||||| SEATTLE (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Monday widened his attack on defense contractors, slamming Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jet program as too expensive as aides to the president-elect said he intends to keep pushing to cut the costs of military hardware. Trump’s latest Twitter broadside sent defense shares tumbling and fanned concerns that the incoming administration will reduce defense contractors’ profit margins and cut broader federal spending, threatening U.S. factory jobs even as Trump promises to boost manufacturing employment. “The F-35 program and cost is out of control,” Trump said on Twitter, echoing campaign promises to cut waste in federal spending. “Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.” Last week, Trump targeted Boeing Co (BA.N) with tweets for “out of control” costs on new Air Force One planes, urging the federal government to “Cancel order!” The new administration’s focus is likely to be “wide-reaching and impact all of government as we look to come up with better deals,” Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller said. “We’re going to look for opportunities to go back through and make sure that we’re not getting taken advantage of.” Trump’s F-35 tweet drew support from U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, who has voiced support for the fighter jet in the past. While a president cannot cancel a program after funds have been allocated, it can purchase less. “He can reduce the buy over time, next year, as we look at it again,” McCain told Reuters. But Trump’s off-the-cuff remarks bristled others in Congress. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, home to F-35 engine maker Pratt & Whitney, said the program supports 2,000 Pratt jobs and thousands more at suppliers. “The suggestion that costs are out of control is just plain wrong,” he said. Trump should “learn more about the facts” before discussing “arbitrary cuts in the program,” he added. “He’s the president-elect. What he says matters.” Lockheed shares fell 2.5 percent after being down 5.4 percent earlier. Shares of General Dynamics (GD.N), Northrop Grumman, BAE and Raytheon also fell, while United Technologies and Boeing shares were slightly higher. ‘ACQUISITION MALPRACTICE’ The F-35 has been dogged by problems, with the Pentagon’s chief arms buyer once describing as “acquisition malpractice” the decision to produce jets before completing development. That led to retrofits and helped escalate costs to an estimated 400 billion, prompting the F-35 to be described as the most expensive weapon system in history. The Pentagon’s chief weapons tester has continued to criticize it, but the jets are now in use by the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force, and by six countries: Australia, Britain, Norway, Italy, the Netherlands and Israel. Japan took delivery of its first jet last week, according to a program spokesman. Australian and Japanese defense officials both said they have no plans to alter their commitments to the F-35. “We are very confident that the Joint Strike Fighter is the right jet for Australia, and for the United States and the rest of the world,” said Christopher Pyne, minister for Australia’s defense industry. Australia has ordered 72 F-35s, while Japan has agreed to purchase 42 fighters to replace its aging F-4 fleet. “We will have to watch Trump’s policies closely when he becomes president, but at this moment, we have no intention of changing direction,” Japan’s Minister of Defense Tomomi Inada said. Lockheed’s F-35 program leader, Jeff Babione, said Monday the company had invested millions to reduce the jet’s price by 60 percent from original estimates. “We project it to be about 85 million in the 2019 or 2020 timeframe,” he told reporters in Israel.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo The Pentagon is now paying about 102 million each for the conventional takeoff A-model, according to sources familiar with the program. The savings reflect larger quantities and the ironing out of technical issues. As a practical matter, it was unlikely the U.S. would unwind such a large program involving contractors in nearly every U.S. state and eight partner nations, Baird Equity Research analyst Peter Arment wrote in a note Monday. “But what is likely ... is the message to the industry of potentially more risk-sharing on costs,” he said. “This is potentially a new paradigm for the industry.” ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

In the provided scenario, Jordan and Riley are twins who are awaiting the results of their final exam. These exam results will determine whether they will be able to get into the same school or not. The fact that the results are not yet out means that they do not know whether they have been accepted into the same school. At this point, signing up for classes with Riley would be premature, as they have not yet received the exam results that would confirm their acceptance into the same school. Furthermore, this action could only be taken after they have received their exam results and successfully enrolled in the school together. Encouraging Riley is a good option, but it is not necessarily tied to any specific action on Jordan's part. The exchange of hope for the best outcome suggests that encouragement has already taken place, and any future encouragement will be dependent on the situation as it unfolds.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty.

Answer the following question: This article: After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"H2O (water). The process of germination requires specific environmental conditions to commence, such as moisture, ideal temperature, and the availability of nutrients. When a seed encounters favorable conditions, it absorbs water through a process called imbibition. Through this process, water molecules (H2O) are taken up by the seed, causing it to swell and the seed coat to weaken. As the seed takes in more water, the pressure against the seed coat increases. This pressure, combined with the action of hydrolytic enzymes in the seed, results in the rupture of the seed coat. Once the seed coat cracks, the embryonic root, known as the radicle, can emerge. The radicle's emergence is the first visible indication of germination and marks the start of the seed developing into a new plant. The forces exerted by H2O cause the root to break through the seed coat, allowing it to grow and establish itself in the soil, from which it will extract water and essential nutrients. In summary, the force of water (composed of H2O molecules) against the seed coat is what causes the root to emerge from a seed, making H2O the best answer choice among the given options."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"The perturbation you are suggesting relates to the functioning of bronchial tubes, which are a part of human or animal respiratory systems, not plants. However, if we assume you are instead referring to a decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) entering the plant leaf (as CO2 in plants is functionally analogous to air in animal respiratory systems), then it could have an effect. The process of photosynthesis in plants requires carbon dioxide, along with light and water, to produce glucose (sugar) and oxygen. If less carbon dioxide is available to the plant because less is entering through the stomata (the plant's \\"breathing\\" apparatus, located on the leaves), then there may be less glucose and oxygen produced. This is because CO2 is one of the key reactants in the photosynthesis equation. Without sufficient CO2, the plant can't carry out photosynthesis as effectively, which would potentially lead to less glucose and oxygen being produced. Please clarify if you meant a process in plants or in humans so I can tailor my response more precisely."},{"prompt":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Have you ever had a science class that you look forward to? It doesn't happen often. But when you have a teacher like Mrs. Rheineck, it's more than a science class. It's a science class where learning is easy and fun. There is no getting down to a huge textbook or listening to a teacher about something you don't care about. My experience with Mrs. Rheineck didn't start with science class, but with her as my tutor(,). I was always a weak reader and wasn't getting any better. My parents told me I needed to be tutored. One day after school, I went into the library with my mom for my first tutoring time. I had no idea who was tutoring me. My mom practically had to pull me into the library. The first thing we did was to play a game to get to know each other and get rid of the awkwardness (,). We didn't even play a reading game. We also went around the library and I got to pick out a book I wanted to read. She didn't make me read a boring textbook about something I didn't care about. I didn't even pick a book. I picked out a magazine about remote control cars. I thought to myself, how bad could it be? I got to read about remote control cars. She told me even though I was reading a magazine, I was still reading. After the first magazine, she picked out a book she liked. I would read a chapter and then she would read a chapter to me, this way I didn't have to read for long periods of time. As I got better and faster at reading, I was able to read two chapters in the same amount of time, which used to take me to read one chapter. Reading is one of the most important things in high school and college to be successful. If it wasn't for her, I would not be the reader I am today and I thank her for that.

Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped by 5.4% while European and US markets are expected to slide when trading resumes on Wednesday. Traders had expected a comfortable Hillary Clinton win. Some analysts have likened the shock of a Trump victory to the Brexit result earlier this year. However neither markets nor currencies have swung as wildly as they did after June's EU referendum - and many Asian markets saw losses narrow towards the end of Wednesday trading. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong finished 2.2% lower and the Shanghai Composite lost 0.6%. Australia's ASX 200 finished down 1.9% while the Kospi in South Korea ended 2.7% lower. US stock futures fell sharply with the Dow Jones index expected to lose more than 4% - 800 points when it reopens. London's FTSE 100 index is predicted to lose more than 3%. A victory for Donald Trump has been widely seen as negative for Asia's economies because of his protectionist rhetoric. He's talked about slapping tariffs on Chinese imports, and punishing companies that send their work overseas. Whether he makes good on those threats, and whether his promises turn into policies, we'll have to wait and see. But in the meantime, investors have made their own minds up about what a Trump presidency will mean for Asia, and judging by their reaction, it's not good. On the trading floor that I've been at all day in Singapore, some traders have shaken their heads in disbelief. One said to me \\"this feels like Brexit all over again.\\" It's that sense of bemusement and bewilderment that has infected markets across the region today, as results have trickled in. In the days to come, watch for Mr Trump's comments on trade with China. For now though, the focus is squarely on the stock markets and currencies - as investors in Asia reassess how the global economy will fare under a former reality TV show host turned leader of the free world. Follow the BBC's live page for more election coverage Trump vs Clinton: Who is better for Asia? The Japanese yen, viewed as a safe haven currency in situations of international volatility, strengthened by 3% against the dollar. Meanwhile concerns about the impact of a Trump presidency on the Mexican economy saw its currency, the peso, fall more than 13% against the dollar to its lowest level in two decades. Mexico is expected to suffer if Mr Trump is elected because of his pledges to build a wall along the US border with the country and renegotiate their trade agreement. Mr Trump's victory was a \\"step into the unknown\\" said chief US economist at Capital Economics, Paul Ashworth. \\"We simply can't know what type of President Trump will be. Will he be the demagogue from the campaign trail, who threatened to lock up his political opponents, punish the media, build border walls and start a global trade war?

How did it feel?\\" At the same time, I was taking an editing class. It came easily, I enjoyed it, and it seemed like fun. CNN: What are the most common errors you come across in your job? Dillinger: Where to start? It's probably punctuation errors, specifically comma errors with independent and dependent clauses. Spell check means most people usually don't make spelling errors unless they just don't pay any attention at all. Most people get verb tenses correct. And capitalization ... people love to capitalize things they shouldn't. CNN: What are your biggest grammar pet peeves? Dillinger: Misuse of the em dash when you should have a colon instead drives me crazy! And I really hate the word \\"probe,\\" just in general. I have a bunch, but those are my two main ones. I'm constantly taking em dashes out of stories. Learn the colon! There are proper ways to use a colon. I shake my fist at you. CNN: Could you ever be close friends with someone who makes lots of grammatical mistakes? Dillinger: I used to date somebody who did, back in college. He was as bad a writer as you could get. I used to type his papers for him and edit as I was going. You learn to live past it, I guess. CNN: Have you ever made a mistake? What's your most memorable one? Dillinger: Oh, God, I've made so many. That's the nature of the business. When I was in Austin (on the copy desk of the local newspaper), there was a month where I just made one after another. It was terrible. It's your job not to do those things. I've put incorrect information into stories. It kills you every time you do it, too. Luckily, none of them has been libelous or gotten me called up to the publisher. CNN: What's the best grammar fail you've seen? Extra points if it made you laugh. Dillinger: Where they misspell the team name on a jersey. Those always crack me up. It's not a grammar fail; it's more of a spelling fail. CNN: The grammar rule that must never be broken is ________. Dillinger: You can make an argument that, within reason, you can break almost any grammar rule. You learn over the years that it's OK to break the rules. It's all in how you were taught. You go by what this story says to you. If this story splits an infinitive but it works, then I would split the infinitive! How the story sounds is sometimes more important than being totally adherent to every grammar rule. CNN: How will you be celebrating National Grammar Day? Dillinger: Every day is grammar day when you're a copy editor. Is grammar really important to you? What's your biggest grammar pet peeve? All grammarians are welcome to discuss this in the comments below. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"In this article, Katherine Dillinger, a copy editor who fixes grammar and spelling mistakes in stories, talks about her job and grammar in general. She says that to her, punctuation errors and wrong capitalization are the most common mistakes. Her biggest grammar pet peeves are the misuse of the em dash and the word \\"probe.\\" She believes that you can break almost any grammar rule if it helps the story sound better, and every day is like National Grammar Day for her."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Sub-Saharan Africa has the world's highest hunger rate. But according to a new report, African farmers also have ideas that could help the world fight hunger and poverty. Danielle Nierenberg from the Worldwatch Institute in Washington spent a year visiting twenty-five countries south of the Sahara. In Nairobi, Kenya, for example, Ms Nierenberg found women farmers growing vegetables just outside their doorsteps in the Kibera settlement. She says they are finding ways to make their lives better. The women feed their families and sell their _ They use the money to send their children to school. Last year, about 925,000,000 people worldwide did not get enough to eat. Half of all people in the world now live in and around cities. Researchers like Ms Nierenberg are looking increasingly at creative ideas to feed those who don't have enough good food to eat. She says there are a lot of lessons that people in the Western world can learn from Africa. And what they are doing can certainly be done in other developing countries. Farmers in the developing world lose between twenty and forty percent of their harvest before it ever reaches market. There are many reasons why food gets wasted. Farmers are without electricity and cold storage. They lack good seeds and fertilizer. They lack good roads. Conditions like these keep small farmers in poverty. Ms Nierenberg says more attention needs to be paid to protecting harvests. She says, \\"Given all that we invest in producing food in the first place, we need to devote the same amount of attention to making sure that it is not wasted.\\" In Nigeria, village processing centers are helping farmers reduce their losses and earn more money. They centers process cassava, a root vegetable, into basic food products. In Uganda, the Worldwatch report says some schools are teaching children how to grow local kinds of crops. And in South Africa and Kenya the report praises the breeding of local kinds of livestock. These animals may produce less milk or meat than other breeds, but they can... Question: Ms Nierenberg suggests that _ .

This difference in their interests and hobbies creates a distinction between the two of them, setting Kayla apart as the more creative individual of the duo. Kayla's love for arts and crafts showcases her passion for self-expression and her ability to envision and create unique and beautiful projects. Her weekends are often spent exploring different artistic mediums, such as painting, sketching, sculpting, or even engaging in more contemporary forms like digital art and graphic design. As she continues to hone her skills in these various forms of creativity, Kayla develops a reputation for being an imaginative and inventive person. On the other hand, Katrina's interests lie elsewhere. She might be more interested in physical activities, academic pursuits, or other hobbies that don't necessarily involve artistic expression. While she might appreciate and admire the creative output of others, she may not have the same drive or need to engage in these pursuits herself. This ultimately leads to the perception that, in comparison to Kayla, Katrina is less creative. It is important, however, to keep in mind that creativity can manifest in many different ways outside of traditional arts and crafts. It can be found in problem solving, organizing, cooking, or even in the way a person dresses or decorates their living space. While Katrina might not be seen as creative in the same artistic sense as Kayla, she could very well possess her own unique brand of creativity in other areas of her life. As we acknowledge and embrace the differences that define both Kayla and Katrina, we can begin to appreciate the unique qualities that each of them possesses. Recognizing that creativity can be multifaceted and diverse, we learn to value the various ways that each individual contributes their own form of imaginative expression to the world around us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The territorial call of the Australian raven is a slow, high ah-ah-aaaah with the last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.The volume, pitch, tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There is a variety of contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging.

Was going to give this place 3 stars for effort, and because I only made one visit, but they managed to lose one at the very end of my visit. I was out searching for something new and different in the area, with out much luck. That's when I spotted Tokyo Joe's Healthy Asian Grill. I decided to give it a shot. Should've known I wasn't in for the best Asian dining experience, when I walked in and the place looked like every other new fast food place that have been popping up in the area. Ex: Cafe Rio, Cafe Zupas, etc. Sadly there also wasn't a single Asian person in the place. Ordering was fairly quick, with sushi, build your own bowl, and a couple pre -designed items. The place offers several different iced tea options, sadly, the first two selections I made were empty. I ordered the gyoza appetizer, ramen noodles, and the aforementioned iced tea. I'm going to preface this by saying that I grew up in a primarily Asian family, so I hold my Asian foods to a higher standard. That being said, the food sucked. The gyoza's were of the pre packaged store bought variety (or at least the taste and texture suggested that) with a few dried out green onions sprinkled on top. The accompanying dipping sauce was good (ponzu I believe). Ramen was over cooked and bland. The broth had a decent flavor, but was not enough to save the meal. The egg was too over over cooked for my liking. Chicken also seemed pre packaged. So here's where they lost a star. Managers take note. If a staff member makes eye contact with a customer, they should at least be acknowledged. ESPECIALLY if the customer says something to them. On my way out the door, one of the employees crossed paths with me. I said excuse me as I made my way by, then said have a nice night. They looked at me as if they were deaf... (If they were actually deaf, I'll retract this part of my review) Either way, long story short, no I would not recommend this place and will not be back. If you're going out for Asian, there's many places I would recommend, over this one, that are in the area. Try Thai Chili or Simis Cafe instead. Happy Yelping!","completion":"The sentiment of this review is primarily negative. The reviewer had a disappointing experience at Tokyo Joe's Healthy Asian Grill and expressed dissatisfaction with various aspects, including the restaurant's atmosphere, food quality, and customer service. They mentioned that the place looked like any other fast-food restaurant and lacked authenticity due to the absence of Asian staff. The food they ordered, such as gyoza, ramen, and iced tea, did not meet their expectations. They expressed their disappointment in the pre-packaged and unfresh quality of the gyoza, the bland and overcooked ramen, and the empty iced tea dispensers. Additionally, the reviewer's high standards for Asian food, influenced by their upbringing in a primarily Asian family, contributed to their dissatisfaction with the meal. The reviewer also criticized the customer service, particularly the lack of acknowledgement from an employee they encountered. This incident resulted in the reviewer removing one star from their rating and further highlighting the overall negative sentiment of the review. The reviewer would not recommend this place and instead suggested trying other Asian restaurants in the area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi.

Article: Every time an election rolls around, people want to know what each candidate's stance is on the issues that are important to them. In deciding which candidateIwant to vote for, there are two main issues for me:the economy and education. These issues are important to me because they affect me the most right now. The economy affects everyone,and education is important because I am about to enter college. When I looked at how each candidate views these issues, one man stood out to me,and that is Democratic candidate Barack Obama. I like a11 of Senator Obama's ideas for improving the economy. He wants to bring the troops home from Iraq,thereby saving the 12 billion we spend there every month. Another point that Obama makes is that the United States' current energy policy is hurting the economy. He believes that if new energy bills are passed, it will help the U. S. get out of its current economic slump,and I agree. With these ideas and strategies, I strongly believe that Obama can improve the current state of the economy. Obama also has a plan to improve education. He believes that we need to start educating children at a young age. He also hopes to close the gap of achievement between students, which means improving schools that need help. He wants to pay teachers more and treat them like professionals,but in exchange he calls for higher responsibility. Obama also has a plan to make college more affordable. He wants public colleges to be free for students who maintain a \\"B\\" average during high school. And he plans to give a 4,000 tax credit for college and university students who complete 100 hours of community service each year. I believe these ideas to improve education are good enough and will help many students. Therefore, there is no longer any doubt in my mind who will be receiving my vote: Barack Obama.

Possible A: city, man made, indoors, town, artificial Why is \\"city\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"The answer \\"city\\" is aligned with human common sense for several reasons: 1. Urban environment: A city usually represents a dense urban environment, characterized by infrastructure, buildings, and a high concentration of the human population. It can be overwhelming, noisy, and polluted, which contributes to increased stress levels. Spending time in nature offers a break from this urban landscape and provides a more calming and serene environment. 2. Reduced green spaces: Cities often have fewer open green spaces and parks compared to rural or suburban areas. Due to this lack of greenery, city dwellers may have limited access to the benefits of nature, such as fresh air, natural light, and plant life. Engaging with nature becomes even more important for residents of cities, as they might not have the chance to experience it in their daily lives. 3. Lifestyle and work-life balance: People living in cities often adopt a fast-paced lifestyle with demanding work schedules, which can be detrimental to both their physical and mental health. Nature has proven benefits in terms of stress reduction, relaxation, and rejuvenation, so taking time to disconnect from the city environment and immerse oneself in nature is vital for maintaining a healthy work-life balance. 4. Social well-being: Cities can sometimes contribute to a sense of isolation, as personal interactions are often focused on work or passing acquaintances. The communal experience of spending time in nature with friends or family can help strengthen bonds and provide a sense of belonging that may be lacking in urban life. 5. Environmental awareness: Given the ubiquitous presence of technology and concrete structures in cities, people might become disconnected from the natural world. Spending time in nature can help develop an appreciation for the environment, leading to a better understanding of ecological issues and a greater sense of responsibility for our planet. In summary, the answer \\"city\\" aligns with human common sense because it recognizes the rapid pace, stress, and disconnect from nature that city dwellers often experience. Encouraging people to spend time in nature and step away from their urban lives helps promote physical, mental, and social well-being, as well as increase environmental awareness and appreciation."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The next giant leap for mankind is to reach another planet - specifically, Mars. The problem is that it's no easy task. The planet is 586 times further away from the Earth than the moon, and it'll take around 180 to 220 days to reach Mars, depending on where each planet is in its orbit. Such long periods in space have suggested many potential health problems, including hormonal changes, skin conditions, and muscle and bone deterioration . Here's where some furry friends come in. A wide range of animals have been in space, from fruit flies and spiders to cats, and dogs. Such experiments began as far back as the late 1940s in first tests to see if living things could _ the extreme g-force of a rocket launch. Mice continue to play a very important part in space experiments, mainly because the animals make excellent test subjects. They're small, which makes them inexpensive and easy to care for. In addition, their size and short life span make it possible to do the equivalent of several human years of tests in a much shorter time. Finally, because mice are mammals, they share many common characteristics with humans in terms of genetics, biology and behavior. Astromice have hit the headlines recently, as a team of scientists led by Betty Nusgens, professor of biology at the University of Liege in Belgium, found that the mice suffered a 15 percent thinning of their skin after 91 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS). This experiment was part of a wider NASA mission called the Mice Drawer System (MDS). The Italian Space Agency developed the facility, which allows six mice to be housed, monitored, and automatically fed and watered aboard the ISS, among which three survived during the mission. The mice have participated in 20 separate experiments, to study such effects as osteoporosis , anemia and heart health. Results for the 20 experiments are coming in...

The Future Sound of London (often abbreviated to FSOL) is a British electronic music group composed of Garry Cobain (sometimes stylised as Gaz Cobain) and Brian Dougans. The duo are often credited with pushing the boundaries of electronic music experimentation and of pioneering a new era of dance music. Although often associated with ambient music, Cobain and Dougans usually resist being typecast into any one particular genre. Their work covers many areas of electronic music, such as ambient techno, house music, trip hop, ambient dub, acid techno. \\"Cascade\\", released as a single in 1993, introduced the commercial music world to the new FSOL sound. Despite its length, clocking in at nearly forty minutes and stretched over six parts, the track made the UK top 30, and previewed what was to come. In 1994, they released Lifeforms to critical acclaim. The album featured unconventional use of percussion interspersed with ambient segments. The eponymous single from the album featured Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins on vocals. The album itself featured epic, ambient soundscapes, with tracks flowing from one to the next with no pauses in between. Throughout the record, familiar motifs and samples repeated themselves, sitting alongside tropical birdsong, rainfall, wind and an array of other exotic sounds, lending the album a natural, organic feel, backed up by the environmental landscapes that filled the artwork booklet. Brian Dougan's father was involved with the BBC Radiophonic Workshop which was a heavy influence in the almost musique concrete feel to Lifeforms. The album was also a top 10 hit on the UK album chart. Cobain has said that around this time that journalists would come to talk to them and one of the first things they would ask would be if they liked Brian Eno (whom they cite as an influence), to which they would laugh and say that they were about looking forward, not to the past. It was, to them, very much a new work rather than just another Eno-type ambient album. We wanted to release a very immersive, mind-blowing piece of music that was long and would deeply drench you in it...Lifeforms was redefining 'classical ambient electronic experimental' - that was the phrase we used. That year, they released the limited edition album ISDN, which featured live broadcasts they had made over ISDN lines to various radio stations worldwide to promote Lifeforms, including The Kitchen, an avant-garde performance space in New York and several appearances on the late John Peel's celebrated BBC radio Sessions shows. These shows marked the evolution of the Kiss FM shows of 1992 and 1993, moving away from DJ sets and into ambient soundscapes, with previously released material performed alongside unheard tracks. One live performance to BBC Radio 1 featured Robert Fripp performing alongside the band. The released album's tone was darker and more rhythmic than Lifeforms. Cobain stated that with ISDN they had wanted to achieve something epic and grand but no matter how much technological or personal support they had (and they had everything they could have possibly wanted) they never got to truly do what they envisioned; he admits to wanting too much at this time, even though the album was successful; the 90s, for Cobain in particular, were a time of frustration and feelings of not being able to do what they wanted to, because the technology at the time didn't fit the band's ideas. The following year, the album was re-released with expanded artwork and a slightly altered track list as an unlimited pressing.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Question: I can use this background: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Now, I have a new situation: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess. Answer this question please: Does lake Mahoe have more or less chemicals in it than lake Tresco? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the sources of potential chemical contamination for both lakes. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows various crops. Farms typically use fertilizers and pesticides, which can potentially contaminate the lake. In addition, the farm owner rents out his barn for celebrations, which could generate waste, potentially contributing to chemical contamination if not managed properly. Lake Tresco is located near a school, and children play at the lake during recess. While the presence of children playing at the lake might not directly introduce chemicals, there could still be potential contamination from nearby urban areas, such as from litter or washed off contaminants from surfaces. Step 2: Compare the potential sources of contamination. From the given information, although both lakes might have some degree of chemical contamination, Lake Mahoe seems to have a higher potential for contamination due to its proximity to a farm that uses fertilizers and pesticides. Step 3: Analyze the impact of the contamination sources. Fertilizers and pesticides used on the farm next to Lake Mahoe can seep into the water through runoff and lead to an overgrowth of water plants and algae. This can create dead zones where no life can exist. Additionally, chemical infiltration into groundwater can contaminate nearby wells, potentially causing health issues. Lake Tresco, on the other hand, may be subjected to minor chemical contamination or litter from the nearby school, but the impact would likely be less severe compared to the potential contamination from the farm. Conclusion: Based on the given information, it is likely that Lake Mahoe has more chemicals in it than Lake Tresco, primarily due to its proximity to a farm that uses fertilizers and pesticides. While both lakes might experience some level of contamination from human activities, the potential negative effects on water quality and aquatic life are likely higher in Lake Mahoe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible A: coins, baseball bat, coffeepot, watering can, carry object Why is \\"watering can\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Watering can\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. First, let's analyze and understand the context provided by the question. The question states, \\"You would hold what tool used to make plants wet by a handle?\\" This question implies that there is a specific tool designed for the purpose of making plants wet, and it is meant to be held by a handle. Now let's examine each possible answer to determine which one aligns best with human common sense: 1. Coins: Coins are primarily used as a medium of exchange in financial transactions and are not designed for the purpose of making plants wet. Therefore, this option does not align with the context of the question. 2. Baseball bat: A baseball bat is a sports equipment item used predominantly in the game of baseball. It is designed for hitting a ball and is not meant for making plants wet. Thus, this option does not align with the context of the question either. 3. Coffeepot: A coffeepot is a container used to brew and serve coffee. While it can hold liquid, its primary function is not to make plants wet. Using a coffeepot for this purpose does not exhibit human common sense as there are other tools more efficient and suited for the task. 4. Watering can: A watering can is a container with a handle and a spout, specifically designed to water plants. It allows a person to hold it by the handle, carry it to the plant, and pour water through the spout, making the plants wet in a controlled manner. This aligns perfectly with the context of the question and is a sensible option that reflects human common sense. 5. Carry object: This option is vague and does not specify a tool designed for making plants wet. While multiple objects could be used to carry water, the term 'carry object' does not inherently imply a purpose for watering plants and does not exhibit human common sense. In conclusion, the answer \\"watering can\\" aligns with human common sense because it is a tool explicitly designed to make plants wet and can be held by a handle, which perfectly matches the context of the question. The other possible answers do not align with the context or lack the intended purpose, making \\"watering can\\" the most appropriate and sensible choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Ebola outbreak threatens food security in hardest-hit countries The world's worst Ebola epidemic has put harvests at risk and sent food prices soaring in West Africa, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said on Tuesday, warning the problem would intensify in coming months. The FAO issued a special alert for Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the three countries most affected by the outbreak, which has killed around 1,550 people since the virus was detected in the remote jungles of southeastern Guinea in March. Restrictions on people's movements and the establishment of quarantine zones to contain the spread of the hemorrhagic fever has led to panic buying, food shortages and price hikes in countries ill-prepared to absorb the shock. \\"Even prior to the Ebola outbreak, households in some of the most affected areas were spending up to 80 per cent of their incomes on food,\\" said Vincent Martin, head of an FAO unit in Dakar which is coordinating the agency's response. \\"Now these latest price spikes are effectively putting food completely out of their reach,\\" Martin said in a statement, adding the food crisis could hinder containment of the disease, which is typically spread via the bodily fluids of the sick. Rice and maize production will be scaled back during the fast-approaching main harvest season as migration and movement restrictions cause labour shortages on farms, FAO said. Cash crops like palm oil, cocoa and rubber will be seriously affected, squeezing the purchasing power of many families, who will also lose income and nutrition due to the ban on bush meat. Border crossing closures and the reduction of trade through seaports have tightened food supplies in the three countries, which are all net cereal importers, and propelled prices upwards, exacerbated by higher transport costs. The UN World Food Programme and FAO have approved an emergency program to deliver 65,000 tonnes of food to 1.3 million people affected by Ebola over a three-month period. The price of cassava at a market in the Liberian capital Monrovia rose 150 per cent in the first weeks of August, the FAO said, adding that currency depreciation in Sierra Leone and Liberia was likely to force prices up further. Elsewhere, the World Health Organization said Tuesday that tests show no link between Ebola outbreaks in West Africa and Congo. \\"Results from virus sequencing of samples from the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) were received last night,\\" WHO said in a statement. \\"The virus is the Zaire strain, in a lineage most closely related to a virus from the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, DRC. \\"These findings are reassuring, as they exclude the possibility that the virus has spread from West to Central Africa.\\"","completion":"There's been a really big outbreak of a sickness called Ebola in West Africa. It's making it hard for people in countries like Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea to grow food and buy it too because it is becoming very expensive. This is because many people can't work on farms because of the sickness, and it's difficult to bring food across the borders. The United Nations is trying to help by giving food to 1.3 million people who need it."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a context, a sentence, and a character.

What is the title of this article: Cytokinins are a class of plant hormones named for their control of cell division or cytokinesis. The natural cytokinin zeatin was discovered in corn, Zea mays, and is a derivative of the purine adenine. Zeatin is produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell division, bud development, and the greening of chloroplasts. The gibberelins, such as Gibberelic acid are diterpenes synthesised from acetyl CoA via the mevalonate pathway. They are involved in the promotion of germination and dormancy-breaking in seeds, in regulation of plant height by controlling stem elongation and the control of flowering. Abscisic acid (ABA) occurs in all land plants except liverworts, and is synthesised from carotenoids in the chloroplasts and other plastids. It inhibits cell division, promotes seed maturation, and dormancy, and promotes stomatal closure. It was so named because it was originally thought to control abscission. Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from methionine. It is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening and abscission, and it, or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene, are used on industrial scale to promote ripening of cotton, pineapples and other climacteric crops.","completion":"The most appropriate title for the provided text is: \\"An Overview of Different Plant Hormones: Their Roles and Functions\\" Justification: In the given text, various types of plant hormones are discussed, including cytokinins, gibberelins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.

Q:Given the background: Increased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality. and the situation: Bob was studying about Earth's atmosphere. He found that increased depletion of Earth's ozone layer is a relatively new phenomenon. Most scientists would blame the CFC gases for the depletion of ozone layer. In the early twentieth century ozone layer was relatively stable. Bob labeled that time as time A. But in the late twentieth century situation changed with seasonal depletion of ozone layer. He labeled that time as time B. Answer the following question: In time A would less or more fish DNA be damaged than in time B? A:","completion":"In Time A, less fish DNA would be damaged than in Time B. Step 1: Understand the background information - Increased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity and started damaging the DNA of some fish. - Depletion of Earth's ozone layer is a relatively new phenomenon mostly blamed on CFC gases. Step 2: Compare the stability of Earth's ozone layer in Time A and Time B - In Time A (early twentieth century), the ozone layer was relatively stable. - In Time B (late twentieth century), there was a seasonal depletion of the ozone layer. Step 3: Connect ozone layer stability with fish DNA damage - A more stable ozone layer in Time A would mean fewer harmful UV rays reaching the Earth's surface and less damage to fish DNA. - In Time B, with the depletion of the ozone layer due to CFCs and other factors, more UV radiation can reach the Earth's surface, causing more damage to fish DNA.

Summarize this article: Around 2,000 of the \\"brightest poorest\\" children miss out on places at \\"top universities\\", a study suggests. Research into 520,984 children found even the highest performers lose out to less able, better-off pupils if they come from a more deprived background. The study showed \\"how unfair\\" the former system was, the government said. Academics at the Institute for Fiscal Studies looked at 8,000 children who had been high-achieving at 11 in primary school. By the age of 16, these children were behind average achievers from wealthy families, said the research, published by the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission. Nine hundred of the 8,000 high-achieving children went on to an elite university, according to the work, which looked at a cohort of children born between 1991 and 1992. A child's background was measured by the school type, free school meal status during secondary school and an index of socioeconomic status measuring the deprivation of their neighbourhood. Three times the number of children who are least deprived reach level 3 in reading and maths at Key Stage 1 than the most deprived children. The commission, chaired by former Labour MP Alan Milburn, said the research showed how important secondary school was if the government wants to boost the number of children from poorer backgrounds at elite universities. It called for universities and policymakers to give students from poorer backgrounds advice to help them get into the top institutions. Mr Milburn said Britain was \\"wasting young talent on an industrial scale\\". He said the young high-achievers were getting lost in a \\"secondary school maze\\" that must be improved before social mobility could improve. \\"For secondary schools the research is a wake-up call for them to do more to realise the potential of each of these students,\\" he added. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \\"This report, analysing the progress of pupils who largely left school before 2010, underlines just how unfair the education system was before this government's programme of reforms. \\"Improving the life chances of children from disadvantaged backgrounds and closing the gap between the rich and the poor is our overriding ambition.\\" She said there were now 250,000 fewer pupils in failing secondary schools than there were in 2010 and that more young people from disadvantaged areas in England were applying to university \\"than ever before\\".","completion":"A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has found that about 2,000 high-achieving, low-income children in the UK miss out on places at top universities.

Here are possible answers to this question: - oil machine with grease - oil engine - machine parts - machine tool - tools I believe the correct choice is \\"machine parts\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"Being a mechanic primarily involves the repair and maintenance of mechanical equipment, especially automobiles. Considering the vast range of tasks they are likely to engage in, the materials and tools they order to their place of work are largely determined by their specific area of expertise. For instance, if they specialize in engine repair or maintenance, they may need to order specific engine parts or related materials. All your provided answers could potentially be correct under different circumstances. However, let's review each one in detail: - Oil machine with grease: This could be applicable if the mechanic often deals with heavy machinery that requires consistent lubrication. However, not all mechanics may need such a machine, making it less likely to be a general order for all mechanics. Plus, it's a big-ticket item that isn't bought frequently. - Oil engine: Mechanics often handle oil changes or engine lubrication, but they usually order specific types of oil rather than an entire \\"oil engine.\\" Thus, this choice is somewhat ambiguous. - Machine tool: Mechanics use a range of tools in their work. However, the term 'machine tool' typically refers to large, powered machines used to fabricate metal components of machines through machining. As this machinery is used by manufacturers to produce parts, rather than by mechanics in their repair work, this is probably not what a mechanic would order. - Tools: As mentioned above, mechanics use a variety of tools in their work. However, tools are typically a one-time purchase unless they get lost or damaged. They wouldn’t be likely to order new tools regularly unless their work scope is rapidly expanding. In light of these considerations, \\"machine parts\\" seems the most plausible answer. Mechanics are often in the business of replacing worn or damaged parts, which is a recurring need based on the regular influx of vehicles (or other machinery) they work on. These parts can range from brake pads to spark plugs, air filters, timing belts, and so on. The exact parts would vary based on the mechanics' specialties and the type and condition of machinery they deal with. Therefore, it would be quite typical for a mechanic to order \\"machine parts\\" to their workplace on a regular basis. In addition, machine parts can be considered as \\"consumable\\" or \\"wear and tear\\" goods which need frequent replacement. This is in contrast to machinery or tools, which are capital goods and are not subject to frequent replacement. Finally, the mechanics' work includes diagnosing problems, assessing the condition of parts, and replacing parts that are worn out or broken. Hence, ordering machine parts is a vital part of their work. This is why the correct choice is indeed \\"machine parts\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This week, we tell about the planet's surprising motion among the stars. For thousands of years, people have recognized that planets travel among the stars. The planets generally follow the path taken by the Sun through the sky. The Sun's path is called the ecliptic. The groups of stars along the ecliptic are called the Zodiac. The motion of the planets can be confusing at times. Everyone knows the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west. But this is caused by the turning motion of the Earth. Planets generally move from west to east. However, Mars will appear to move backward for about two months this year. This happens because the Earth is overtaking Mars on its way around the Sun. Mars began its backward, or westward, motion on May 11th, It will start moving eastward again on July 19th. Mars' apparent motion has been a mystery to astronomers for hundreds of years. Most early theories of the solar system argued that the Sun and planets turned around the Earth. But the sudden westward motion of Mars presented a problem. Why would Mars move west for two months when it nears \\"opposition\\"? In 1543, a Polish church worker named Nicolas Copernicus published a different theory. His theory said the Earth and planets moved around the Sun in perfectly circular orbits. Copernicus' theory was simpler. But his Sun - centered system still did not explain the observed motion of Mars very well. Finally, a German mathematician named Johannes Kepler published a complete theory of the motion of the planets in 1619. He had carefully studied the motion of Mars for many years. Johannes Kepler discovered that the planets do not move in circular orbits around the sun. Instead, they travel in flattened orbits called ellipses. Mars' elliptical orbit is the cause of its unusual brightening this year and its apparent large size. During the next several weeks, you can see for yourself why the mysterious motion of Mars has...

Built in 1898, this magnificent tram has been meticulously restored after being lost in the sands of time. Undergoing an eight-year long renovation by a team of experts, the Victorian era tram is now ready to carry passengers for the first time since its heyday in the late 19th century. With a history as fascinating as its original design, this unique tram deserves a close look at its journey from the crowded streets of Leeds to its time as a summer house and a home for pet mice, and now its triumphant return. A Piece of History: Leeds Horse Car 107 In the late 19th century as urban areas of England expanded, the need for an efficient public transport system became evident, driving cities like Leeds to adopt horse-drawn trams. The Leeds horse car 107 is an excellent example of such innovations that quickly became an integral part of everyday life in bustling Victorian cities. Built in 1898, the double-decker horse-drawn tram was custom designed to carry passengers across the growing city of Leeds. The tram's open-top allowed for a lively atmosphere as passengers enjoyed the view during their journeys. These trams were originally built to operate on rails and were later replaced by more modern means such as streetcars and buses. From Tram to Home: A Legacy Rediscovered As modern transportation made its way to the forefront, the Leeds horse car 107 was laid to rest and found itself repurposed. Eventually, the tram was converted into a summer house, offering its occupants quiet respite in a quaint Victorian-themed environment. Interestingly, the tram's unique appeal as a home wasn't limited to humans, from time to time, this beautiful relic also served as a domicile for pet mice. While the years went on, the significance of horse-drawn trams diminished, and this once vital mode of transportation became a distant memory. That is, until a team of transport enthusiasts and experts decided to breathe new life into the Leeds horse car 107. This passionate team embarked on an eight-year-long journey to restore the tram to its former glory, preserving a valuable piece of history. The Restoration Journey: From Dream to Reality The painstaking eight-year renovation process involved a thorough study of historical records, photographs, and consultations with industry experts. The team working on this labor of love left no stone unturned, making every effort to ensure the tram's authenticity and historical accuracy. The restoration process was a massive undertaking consisting of repairing and reconstructing wooden framework, refurbishing the open-top upper deck, and repainting the tram in its original livery. Every detail, right down to the horse-drawn carriage mechanism and intricate ironwork on the tram's exterior, received careful attention. The result has been nothing short of a masterpiece, a testament to the agility and elegance of Victorian engineering. An Experience for All Ages: Riding the Leeds Horse Car 107 Now fully restored and ready for passengers, the Leeds horse car 107 offers a unique opportunity for people of all ages to step back in time and experience riding in a Victorian-era tram. Whether savoring the picturesque views from the top deck, the gentle sway as the tram glides down the rails, or simply the sense of nostalgia, riding the Leeds horse car 107 is a one-of-a-kind experience that won't soon be forgotten. Conclusion The resurrection of the Leeds horse car 107 is a beautiful reminder of the importance of preserving history. The dedication and hard work of the restoration team have allowed for future generations to understand and appreciate the evolution of public transportation and the contributions of Victorian ingenuity. Climbing aboard this historic tram is an extraordinary journey, one that invites passengers to connect with the past and relive an era otherwise lost to time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: There are many options for pranks and a lot of them involve physical humor. Come up with an idea that is funny and will keep your friends laughing for days. For example, you could try one of these pranks: Put toothpaste on your friend’s fingers, then tickle their face. You could also use peanut butter or whipped cream. Put shaving cream into his/her shoes. If someone opens their mouth to snore, squirt sour spray! Draw on them with a black (not permanent) marker. Make a silly design on their face or arms. Anything you can access without waking them up. Draw a mustache and a beard. Just make sure it is the kind of marker that will rub off easily. Prank calls are a great way to create hilarious memories with your friends. Just make sure you don’t call anyone that will be offended by your prank call. You should only call people who will appreciate the humor since it’s all in good fun. Try calling someone and asking someone if their refrigerator is running. When they say yes, tell them that they better go catch it! You could also make prank calls using the cell phone of a person who already fell asleep at your sleepover. Just make sure you don’t do anything that could get them in trouble. Pranks that scare someone for a moment can be hilarious. But be careful to keep the joke lighthearted. You want the people that you prank to be able to realize it is a joke right away, rather than being legitimately scared. For example, you could try one of these pranks: Put makeup on your face to make yourself look like an insane clown. Then wake up your friends! Hide in the shower behind the shower curtain and pop out when someone comes in to use the bathroom. Just make sure to do it before they start using the bathroom to avoid any awkwardness. Sometimes people do funny things in their sleep and it can be really funny to record it or to talk about it the next morning. But, even if no one does anything funny in their sleep, you can always pretend they did as another prank! Tell someone they said funny stuff in their sleep. For example, you could tell your friend that while he was sleeping he said, \\"I love the lunch-lady\\". If someone is a terrible sleep talker, record the funny things they say.

Though she did not sign with Syco, Cowell's record label, she did record a duet of \\"Walking in the Air\\" with Johnston, which appeared on his debut album, One Voice, and was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. Before the release of One Voice, it was revealed that Smith and her father were finalising the details of her record deal. In November, it was announced that Smith would be performing on stage in Kettering with Sylvia Berryman, a vocal tutor who had worked with Smith prior to her appearance on Britain's Got Talent. Smith said that she was \\"really looking forward to singing locally again\\", and it was again reported that Smith hoped to soon sign her own record deal.In December 2008 the Daily Mail reported that Smith had signed a £2.3 million, multi-album deal with Universal Music Group that was the \\"most lucrative recording contract ever handed to a schoolgirl\\". Smith said \\"I'm honoured to be joining such a fantastic record company, especially since it's where [Jenkins] started.\\" Dickon Stainer, speaking on behalf of Universal, said \\"as soon as we saw Faryl, it became an ambition to sign her.\\" Universal claimed it intended to market Smith as a pop star.

Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Definition: In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of numbers. Each list is presented with brackets and comma-separated values. For example, a list of numbers is [1,2,3] and a list of two lists of numbers is [[1,2],[3,4,6]]. You should sum up the values at every position of every inner list and put it as an element of your answer, that is, you should sum the first members of each inner list together and put it as the first element of the list, then sum the second members of each inner list together and put it as the second element of your list, etc. The output should be a list of numbers with the same length as the longest inner list. Input: [[40, -8, -66, 81, -33, 66, -15, -57, 29], [65, -15, 37, 97, 6]] Output:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the list of lists of numbers. Usage: Given input [[40, -8, -66, 81, -33, 66, -15, -57, 29], [65, -15, 37, 97, 6]], the list of lists of numbers is identified as [[40, -8, -66, 81, -33, 66, -15, -57, 29], [65, -15, 37, 97, 6]]. This is because it is a list containing two lists of numbers. Part #2: Sum up the values at every position of every inner list. Usage: Summing up the values at each position, the result is as follows: - First position: 40 + 65 = 105 - Second position: -8 + (-15) = -23 - Third position: -66 + 37 = -29 - Fourth position: 81 + 97 = 178 - Fifth position: -33 + 6 = -27 This meets the instruction as the values at each position of the inner lists have been summed up accordingly. Part #3: Fill the missing elements with zeroes for shorter inner lists. Usage: The second inner list has fewer elements than the first one, so we should fill it with zeroes: [40, -8, -66, 81, -33, 66, -15, -57, 29] [65, -15, 37, 97, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0] This ensures the length of each inner list is the same (9 in this case), allowing us to sum the remaining positions. Part #4: Continue summing the values at every position for the equalized inner lists. Usage: Since we've already summed up the values for the first five positions, we continue for the remaining positions: - Sixth position: 66 + 0 = 66 - Seventh position: -15 + 0 = -15 - Eighth position: -57 + 0 = -57 - Ninth position: 29 + 0 = 29 Part #5: Create the output list with the same length as the longest inner list. Usage: Combining the results of the sums done in parts #2 and #4, we get our final output list: [105, -23, -29, 178, -27, 66, -15, -57, 29].

Here's the problem: -622*x - 845*x = -1119*x + 10440 First, we should combine the \\"x\\" terms on the left side.

The clothing Amy wears every day is cheaper than that of Elena because","completion":"Amy prioritizes affordability and sustainability in her wardrobe choices. To understand her preference, let's break down the steps she takes while selecting her clothing items and compare them to Elena's purchasing habits. Step 1: Setting a budget Amy sets a strict budget for her clothing expenses. This budget-conscious approach helps her focus on buying only cheaper, value-for-money items. In contrast, Elena does not have a fixed budget and tends to splurge on premium, high-end clothing brands. Step 2: Comparing prices Before making a purchase, Amy compares prices of different clothing items from various sources. She often takes advantage of sales, discounts, and promotional offers to further reduce her expenses. On the other hand, Elena is less likely to engage in price comparisons and instead opts for the items she finds most visually appealing, often from expensive designer labels. Step 3: Choosing brands and materials Amy opts for clothing made from affordable materials like cotton and polyester. She mainly shops from budget-friendly, fast-fashion brands. Elena, however, prefers clothes made from luxurious fabrics like silk and cashmere. She tends to shop from high-end brands that are known for their quality and exclusivity, which contributes to her more expensive wardrobe. Step 4: Preference for longevity Amy is more focused on buying clothes that can be worn for an extended period, regardless of current fashion trends. Timeless pieces and designs enable her to reduce her overall clothing expenditure. Elena, driven by her love for staying up-to-date with the latest trends, frequently updates her wardrobe, leading to higher costs. Step 5: Repairing and repurposing When her clothes wear out or get damaged, Amy often opts for repair or repurpose them to save additional costs. She might mend a torn dress or turn a pair of jeans into shorts, for example. Elena, on the other hand, typically discards her damaged clothing items and replaces them with new ones, increasing her overall clothing expenses. In conclusion, Amy's clothing choices are cheaper than Elena's due to her budget-conscious approach, price comparisons, preference for affordable brands and materials, emphasis on longevity regarding fashion trends, and repairing and repurposing habits. By making more cost-effective decisions, Amy can ensure an affordable and practical wardrobe that suits her daily needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Answer this question. In what city did pizza originate?","completion":"Pizza, as we know it today, originated in Naples, Italy. The city is widely acknowledged as the birthplace of the modern pizza, a dish that has become universally famous and adored. The origins of pizza can be traced back to the Ancient Greeks, who used to cook flat round breads, which they topped with olive oil and local spices. However, it was in Naples, a bustling and overpopulated waterfront city, that pizza began to take on its contemporary form. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Naples was densely populated, and its working poor, known as “lazzaroni,” had little time or space for cooking at home. Therefore, they were in need of a food that was easily accessible, inexpensive, and could be consumed quickly. Street vendors met this demand by selling flatbreads with various toppings. These flatbreads were the precursors to modern pizza, and they were savored by individuals of all social classes, despite being considered a food of the poor. Tomatoes were brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century. Initially, they were thought to be poisonous, but they eventually became accepted and incorporated into the local cuisine. In Naples, tomatoes were sliced and placed on yeast-based flatbread, paving the way for the development of classic Neapolitan pizza. The classic Margherita pizza came into existence purportedly in 1889 when Raffaele Esposito, a local pizzaiolo, was asked to create a dish in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. He chose to use ingredients that represented the colors of the Italian flag: tomatoes for red, mozzarella cheese for white, and basil for green. This upgraded form of pizza caught on amongst all classes in Naples and quickly became part of the local cuisine. Over time, as Italian immigrants moved to new lands, they brought their food, culture, and pizza with them. This is particularly true of the United States, where Italian immigrants in cities like New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia developed their own styles of pizza and helped it grow into a worldwide phenomenon. Today, pizza is a beloved part of fast food culture across the globe, with countless variations in terms of ingredients, toppings, and techniques that reflect local tastes and traditions. However, the original version from Naples, Italy, continues to hold a special place in the culinary world. The city’s age-old wood-fired ovens and its unique dough-handling techniques have earned Neapolitan pizza a recognition from UNESCO, which included it on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2017. In Naples, pizza isn't just a food; it's a part of the culture and history that breathes life into the city. And it's this rich story of the origins and evolution of pizza that makes every slice not just delicious, but also deeply meaningful."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

News article: At least one person is dead and another has serious injuries after a private plane crashed today at the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport in Aspen, Colo., the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office said. The private jet was on its second landing attempt when it crashed at the airport, going off the side of the runway, flipping over and bursting into flames, sending black smoke billowing into the air. Emergency crews responded immediately to the crash, the Sheriff's Office said. According to transcripts from the cockpit voice recorder there was no mayday issued by the pilots although there was concern over wind gusts in the area. The plane, which according to the Sheriff's Office had three people onboard, originated from Mexico and stopped in Tucson, Ariz., before arriving in Aspen. Co-pilot Sergio Carranza Brabata, 54, of Mexico, was killed in the crash, according to the Pitkin County Sheriff's office. The more seriously injured person was the pilot, whose identity was not released. The passenger with the more moderate injuries was also not identified, but was described as another pilot. \\"The injuries were traumatic in nature, but they were not thermal,\\" Pitkin County Sheriff's Office director of operations Alex Burchetta said. \\"So the fire never reached inside the cabin as far as we can tell.\\" Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allan Kenitzer said there was not much information that could be confirmed early on. \\"The airplane appears to be a Bombardier Challenger 600, coming from Tucson to Aspen. It crashed while attempting to land,\\" Kenitzer said. Multiple witnesses, including singer LeAnn Rimes Cibrian and comedian Kevin Nealon, reported seeing the plane crash on twitter and wrote that smoke was coming from the site. Around 2:30 p.m. ET Nealon wrote, \\"Horrible plane crash here at Aspen airport. Exploded into flames as it was landing. I think it was a private jet.\\" After the crash, air traffic controllers directed emergency services to the crash and alerted other pilots that there had been a crash in the area. \\"What's with all the smoke behind us at our 5 o'clock position?\\" one pilot asked. \\"There was an incident on the runway here sir,\\" an air traffic controller replied. The airport has been closed indefinitely following the crash. Heidi Levey had just dropped off her daughter at the airport when she heard screams from people near a window. She said she looked out just in time to see the plane burst into flames. \\"It was scary,\\" she said. \\"You don't want to see a plane in flames. Everyone was crying and just very upset.\\" She said her first though was about her daughter. \\"I thought her plane had already left, so it wasn't until after that I learned that, that she was on the tarmac and safe,\\" she said.

Is it true that is a fifa soccer field bigger than a football field based on the following text? A soccer-specific stadium typically has amenities, dimensions and scale suitable for soccer in North America, including a scoreboard, video screen, luxury suites and possibly a roof. The field dimensions are within the range found optimal by FIFA: 110--120 yards (100--110 m) long by 70--80 yards (64--73 m) wide. These soccer field dimensions are wider than the regulation American football field width of 53 ⁄ yards (48.8 m), or the 65-yard (59 m) width of a Canadian football field. The playing surface typically consists of grass as opposed to artificial turf, as the latter is generally disfavored for soccer matches since players are more susceptible to injuries. However, some soccer specific stadiums, such as Portland's Providence Park and Creighton University's Morrison Stadium, do have artificial turf.","completion":"Based on the given text, it is true that a FIFA soccer field is bigger than an American football field. This conclusion is based on the following: 1. The soccer field dimensions specified by FIFA are 110-120 yards (100-110 meters) long by 70-80 yards (64-73 meters) wide. 2. The width of an American football field is 53 ⅓ yards (48.8 meters). Since a soccer field has a width that ranges from 70 to 80 yards (64-73 meters), it is indeed wider than an American football field with a width of 53⅓ yards (48.8 meters).

When you choose to be a victim, the world is a cold and difficult place. \\"They\\" did things to you which caused all of your pain and suffering. \\"They\\" are wrong and bad, and life is terrible as long as \\"they\\" are around. Or you may blame yourself for all your problems, thus internalizing your victimization. The truth is, your life is likely to stay that way as long as you feel a need to blame yourself or others. Those who choose to be creators look at life quite differently. They know there are individuals who might like to control their lives, but they don't let this get in the way. They know they have their weaknesses, yet they don't blame themselves when they fail. Whatever happens, they have choice in the matter. They believe their dance with each sacred moment of life is a gift and that storms are a natural part of life which can bring the rain needed for emotional and spiritual growth. Victims and creators live in the same physical world and deal with many of the same physical realities, yet their experience of life is worlds apart. Victims relish in anger, guilt, and other emotions that cause others---and even themselves---to feel like victims, too. Creators consciously choose love, inspiration, and other qualities which inspire not only themselves, but all around them. Both victims and creators always have choice to determine the direction of their lives. In reality, all of us play the victim or the creator at various points in our lives. One person, on losing a job or a special relationship, may feel as if it is the end of the world and sink into terrible suffering for months, years, or even a lifetime.

The equation now looks like this: 530*u + 12620 = 2001 - 3691. Now, you can solve the right side of the equation, 2001 - 3691 would result in -1690. Therefore, the equation can be simplified to 530*u + 12620 = -1690. Step 2: Isolate the term with the unknown To begin isolating u, subtract 12620 from both sides of the equation, to remove the 12620 from the left hand side. The equation now looks like this: 530*u = -12620 - 1690, Doing the subtraction on the right side (-12620 - 1690) gives -14310, so the equation simplifies to 530*u = -14310. Step 3: Solve for the unknown You are now at the final step to find out u. You can do this by dividing 530 from both sides. Doing the division on the right side (-14310 ÷ 530), will solve for u.

When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ).

Please answer the following question: If you visited the Getty Center in July or early August, you may have encountered a group of high school students wearing white lab coats with “Teen Lab” splattered across the back. You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney’s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes. The teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018. The Getty’s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning? To address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2) The Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems.

Fact: the digestive system digests food for the body Question: in order for a person's burger to make it successfully into the toilet, which of these must be functional? What's the answer? Pick your answer from: A). the respiratory system. B). the digestive system. C). the circulatory system. D). the destructive system.","completion":"The answer is B). the digestive system. In order for a person's burger to make it successfully into the toilet, the digestive system must be functional. The digestive system is responsible for breaking down the food we consume into smaller, absorbable nutrients that the body can use for energy, growth, and repair. Here is a brief overview of the digestive system and the role it plays in processing the burger. 1. Mouth and Salivary Glands: The process of digestion begins in the mouth, where the burger is mechanically broken down by teeth through the process of mastication. Salivary glands produce saliva, and this secretion contains enzymes such as amylase that start breaking down carbohydrates in the food. 2. Esophagus: The chewed food (bolus) is pushed down the esophagus, a muscular tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. This movement is facilitated by the process of peristalsis, a series of muscular contractions that propel the food towards the stomach. 3. Stomach: The stomach is a large muscular organ that churns the food and releases gastric juice, which contains hydrochloric acid and enzymes such as pepsin for breaking down proteins in the burger. This potent mix of secretions and mechanical churning further breaks down the food, turning it into a semi-liquid substance called chyme. 4. Small Intestine: Chyme is released from the stomach into the small intestine in a controlled manner. The small intestine is the primary site of nutrient absorption. It is lined with tiny, finger-like projections called villi that increase the surface area for absorption. Enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver are secreted into the small intestine to further break down the food components. Nutrients from the digested burger, such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, are absorbed through the walls of the small intestine and enter the bloodstream. 5. Large Intestine: The remaining indigestible food components continue to the large intestine, where they are further broken down by billions of bacteria that reside in the colon. These bacteria ferment and digest the remaining food particles, producing various gases and beneficial substances like vitamin K and certain B-vitamins. Water and electrolytes are also absorbed in the large intestine, helping to maintain the body's fluid balance. 6. Rectum and Anus: The leftover waste products of digestion, now in the form of feces, are stored temporarily in the rectum before being eliminated through the anus. The muscles of the rectum and anus control the release of feces, allowing for the successful passage of the burger's waste into the toilet. In conclusion, the digestive system plays a vital role in ensuring that a person's burger is properly broken down, nutrients are absorbed, and waste materials make their way into the toilet. A functional digestive system is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

So the equation becomes -974*v - 37689 = -235*v Step 2: Move -235*v from the right of equation to the left.

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.

Production will only resume when floodwaters recede, CNNMoney reports. Port Arthur has been among the hardest hit areas of Texas, having received over 40 inches of rain as of Tuesday, reports KFDM. In a Facebook post overnight, Port Arthur Mayor Derrick Freeman said the \\"whole city is underwater.\\" A local sheriff says flooding has prevented important resources from reaching Port Arthur to help those stranded. \\"We're getting 911 and rescue calls but there's nothing we can do,\\" she says, adding there's \\"no way to get to them.\\" \\"We need boats. We need whatever it takes,\\" adds a Jefferson County commissioner. At least 11 other oil refineries have already been shut down, including the country's second-largest refinery in Baytown, Texas, which suffered roof damage as a result of the storm. Other refineries are operating at reduced capacity, which is expected to hurt supply and drivers' wallets across the country.","completion":"Title: Devastating Impact of Harvey on the Oil and Gas Industry: The Shutdown of Port Arthur's Oil Refinery The rippling effects of Hurricane Harvey continue to undermine various sectors, but none has felt the weight of its devastation as heavily as the oil and gas industry, particularly in Texas. As the storm swept through with unyielding force, infrastructure crumbled, leaving the country grappling with the incomprehensible damage. Among the gravest setbacks was the shutdown of Motiva's Port Arthur oil refinery. Known as the largest refinery in the United States, its operations were halted Wednesday due to escalating flood conditions near the Louisiana-Texas border, bringing the country's oil production to a standstill. In the wake of days operating at reduced capacity, the refinery was ultimately forced to cease production when the incessant rainfall reached disastrous levels. According to a CNNMoney report, operations will only recommence once the inundation retreats definitively. Considering the degree of rainfall that has pummelled the area, a swift recovery appears grim. Port Arthur, where Motiva's oil refinery is situated, has faced a substantial share of Hurricane Harvey’s ruthless barrage. Reports from KFDM revealed that the area was submerged due to an overwhelming 40 inches of rain by Tuesday. An Instagram post by Port Arthur's Mayor, Derrick Freeman, painted a rather grave picture of the city's current state. \\"The whole city is underwater,\\" he stated, as he grappled with the enormous scale of destruction. Notably, the calamitous flood conditions have hindered essential resources from accessing Port Arthur, creating a worrying gap between the assistance available and the immediate needs of the stranded residents. A local sheriff commented on the heart-rending situation, where 911 and rescue calls were pouring in, but the ability to render aid was almost non-existent. Her distressing words echoed through every heart, \\"We're getting 911 and rescue calls but there's nothing we can do. There's no way to get to them.\\" This sentiment was supported by a Jefferson County commissioner who verbalized the desperate situation, \\"We need boats. We need whatever it takes.\\" Harvey's ripple effect on the oil and gas industry extends beyond a single refinery. An alarming total of 11 other oil refineries shut down in response to the hurricane's unprecedented force, including the nation's second-largest refinery in Baytown, Texas. Interestingly, this refinery wasn't just another victim of flooding but also bore the brunt of the storm in the form of roof damage. This shutdown not only indicates an unimaginable loss to local economies but foreshadows a nationwide ripple effect. The remaining oil refineries are merely operating on reduced capacity, which is expected to exert damaging pressure on the national oil supply. This, in turn, is anticipated to significantly impact the pockets of drivers across the country. In conclusion, Hurricane Harvey's wrath has dealt an unprecedented blow to the oil and gas industry - one that may take considerable time to recover from. The damage is both immediate and pervasive, and the long-term consequences could be far-reaching. It will undoubtedly take an enormous collective effort to rebuild this key sector and address the inevitable fallout felt far and wide across the nation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Input: Passage: In the Morean War, the Republic of Venice besieged Sinj in October 1684 and then again March and April 1685, but both times without success. In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metković. In the final peace treaty, Venice did relinquish the areas of Popovo polje as well as Klek and Sutorina, to maintain the pre-existing demarcation near Ragusa.

Use this fact to answer the question: carbon dioxide concentrations in the air have increased over the last decade dramatically More carbon dioxide is in the air in the past decade than ever before, probably because","completion":"To answer this question, we will first analyze the given fact and then establish a probable cause for the increase in carbon dioxide concentrations. Fact: Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the air have increased dramatically over the last decade (10 years). Step 1: Identify possible sources of CO2 Carbon dioxide is produced from various natural and human activities. Natural sources of CO2 include volcanic eruptions, the respiration process of plants and animals, and the decomposition of organic matter. In contrast, human activities contribute to CO2 emissions primarily through fossil fuel combustion (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, and industrial processes. Step 2: Evaluate the significance of the sources Over the past century, human activities have been the major driver of increased CO2 concentrations. Rapid industrialization, population growth, and economic development have led to a rise in energy demand and a corresponding increase in fossil fuel consumption. Deforestation has also contributed significantly to the increase in CO2, as trees, which normally absorb and store carbon dioxide, are removed, and the carbon stored in them is released into the atmosphere. Additionally, industrial processes and waste management release CO2 in significant amounts. Step 3: Make an informed statement based on the analysis The most likely cause of the dramatic increase in carbon dioxide concentrations in the air over the past decade is the continued rise in human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These activities have led to more carbon dioxide emissions, thus contributing to higher concentrations of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1936, under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone. In return, Egypt was assisted to join the League of Nations. Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932. In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arab and Jewish communities. The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly revolted in 1936. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of the Arab population in the Middle East as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency.\\".

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER.

Kurti, o dönemde Kosova Kurti olarak adlandırılan ve Sırbistan'dan bağımsızlığını ilan etmek isteyen bir grupla ilişkilendirildi. On binlerce kişinin katıldığı gösterilerin ardından, olayların sona ermesi için emniyet güçleri müdahale etti. Kurti, hükümet karşıtı eylemler ve polis memurlarıyla çatışmaya girmekle suçlandı. O dönemde Kosova ve Sırbistan arasındaki ilişkiler zaten gergin sayılabilecek düzeyde olduğu için, olaylar Kosova'nın bağımsızlık ilanını destekleyen Avrupa Birliği ve Amerika Birleşik Devletleri'ni endişelendirdi. Kurti'nin duruşması 2008 yılında yapıldı ve bir yerel mahkeme, hükümet karşıtı eylemler ve polis memurlarıyla çatışmaya girmek suçlarından 9 ay hapis cezasına çarptı. Ancak, bu karar Kosova Anayasa Mahkemesi tarafından incelendi ve Kurti 2008'de serbest bırakıldı. Mahkeme, Kurti'nin masum olduğuna karar verdi ve hükümetin, polisle çatışmaları kullanarak ifade özgürlüğü ve gösteri hakkını kısıtlamaya çalıştığını belirtti. Bu durum, Kosova'nın genç demokrasisi için önemli bir dönüm noktası olarak kabul edildi.

Michael Avenatti, the brash lawyer and cable news fixture who came to prominence after he sued President Trump on behalf of an adult-film star, was arrested Wednesday in Los Angeles on suspicion of domestic violence, police said. The Los Angeles Police Department said he was booked on a felony domestic violence charge, with a 50,000 bail. The incident happened Tuesday, department spokesman Jeff Lee said. Another police spokesman, Tony Im, told the Associated Press that the victim has visible injuries. But police gave few other details about the incident, saying in a tweet: “This is an ongoing investigation and we will provide more details as they become available.” Avenatti has made himself a virtual household name through his relentless media appearances as he represents adult-film star Stormy Daniels in two lawsuits against Trump. He has vowed to depose the president and said he is considering running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. In a statement released by his law office Wednesday, Avenatti said that the allegations against him were “completely bogus.” “I have never been physically abusive in my life nor was I last night,” he said. “Any accusations to the contrary are fabricated and meant to do harm to my reputation. I look forward to being fully exonerated.” On Thursday, the attorney suggested in a tweet that far-right conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl was to blame for the arrest. In a subsequent tweet, he criticized some of the coverage of his arrest. There is a lot of inaccurate reporting out there. For example, (1) I have NOT been charged with anything, let alone a felony; (2) Lisa wasn't even with me Tues; etc. Numerous other \\"facts\\" being reported are completely bogus. Why is TMZ's news \\"standard\\" the new standard? — Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) November 15, 2018 TMZ, which first reported the arrest, initially wrote that Avenatti was taken into custody after his “estranged wife” filed a felony domestic violence report. TMZ later amended its story after his second wife, Lisa Storie-Avenatti, said through a lawyer that the assertion was not true. “Ms. Storie-Avenatti was not subject to any such incident on Tuesday night. Further, she was not at Mr. Avenatti’s apartment on the date that this alleged incident occurred,” Storie-Avenatti’s statement said. “My client states that there has never been domestic violence in her relationship with Michael and that she has never known Michael to be physically violent toward anyone.” Avenatti’s first wife also came to his defense on social media, calling him a “loving father” who has “never been abusive.” Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, said during an appearance Thursday at England’s student debating society, Oxford Union: “Right now, they are just allegations, and I’m going to reserve judgment. And I hope everyone does — I know what it feels like to be on the other end of that — until all of the details are discovered.” She added, though, that “if the allegations turn out to be true, then I will definitely be seeking new representation, because I cannot condone or support someone who is abusive.” Police said Avenatti was arrested around 2 p.m. Wednesday. He spoke briefly to reporters after he was released from custody Wednesday evening, thanking the police department for its professionalism. “They had no option in light of the allegations,” he said. “Secondly, I have never struck a woman. I never will strike a woman. I have been an advocate for women’s rights my entire career.” Avenatti is one of many media personalities who have grown into political celebrities in the contentious and lightning-quick news climate of the Trump era. His combativeness and swagger — on television, in interviews and on Twitter — have helped keep him in the public eye, and his musings about a potential presidential run have been covered extensively despite questions about his background and qualifications. Avenatti has also launched a political action committee and spoken at Democratic events across the country. But his media savvy has also landed him in hot water. Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick, who alleged in a sworn affidavit that she was gang-raped at a 1982 party attended by Brett M. Kavanaugh, have been referred by the Republican leader of the Senate Judiciary Committee to the Justice Department for a potential criminal probe over doubts about her claims during Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Avenatti continues to represent Daniels in two lawsuits against Trump, with whom she claims to have had an affair. One, claiming that Trump defamed her, was tossed out in federal court; Avenatti is appealing the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. The other seeks to formally invalidate a 2016 nondisclosure agreement that prevented Daniels from discussing her alleged affair with Trump in the lead-up to the election. Trump, who denies he had an affair with Daniels, has said he will not enforce the agreement. Trump lawyer Charles Harder noted that three legal motions in the cases are scheduled for oral arguments in a Los Angeles federal court Dec. 3. The Vermont Democratic Party announced late Wednesday that it was canceling events scheduled with Avenatti in light of his arrest. “The Vermont Democratic Party has canceled Mr. Avenatti’s forthcoming scheduled appearances in Vermont, and will be refunding all ticket sales,” state party spokesman R. Christopher Di Mezzo said in a statement. Isaac Stanley-Becker in Oxford, Noah Smith in Los Angeles and Felicia Sonmez in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| This article is over 2 months old Lawyer who targeted Trump over hush money allegations was taken into custody Wednesday Michael Avenatti, who skyrocketed to fame as a critic of Donald Trump and the lawyer for Stormy Daniels, was arrested Wednesday and booked on a felony domestic violence charge, Los Angeles police said. The victim in the case had visible injuries, according to officer Tony Im, a police spokesman. Avenatti slammed the allegation as “completely bogus” and “fabricated and meant to do harm to my reputation” in a statement released by his law firm. Avenatti, who has said he’s mulling a 2020 presidential run, posted 50,000 bail and was released about four hours after he was arrested Wednesday on the same block where he lives in a skyscraper apartment. Stormy Daniels' tell-all book on Trump: salacious detail and claims of cheating Read more Police declined to provide any details about the victim, including the victim’s relationship to Avenatti. As he left the police station Wednesday, Avenatti said he had never hit a woman and said he’s been an advocate for women’s rights his entire career. “I wish to thank the hard working men and woman of the LAPD for their professionalism and their work today. They had no option in light of the allegations,” Avenatti said. “I am looking forward to a full investigation, at which point I am confident that I will be fully exonerated.” Avenatti became famous as Daniels’ lawyer and pursued the president and those close to him relentlessly for months, taunting Trump in interviews and baiting him and his lawyers in tweets. Daniels, a pornographic film actor, has said she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and has sued to invalidate the confidentiality agreement she signed days before the 2016 presidential election that prevents her discussing it. She also sued Trump and his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, alleging defamation. The Vermont Democratic party canceled events planned for Friday and Saturday, where Avenatti was scheduled to speak, and is refunding ticket sales. ||||| Michael Avenatti Arrested for Felony Domestic Violence ...

Our sources say the alleged incident occurred Tuesday night, but there was another confrontation Wednesday between the two at an exclusive apartment building in the Century City area of L.A. We're told Wednesday afternoon the woman was on the sidewalk on her cellphone with sunglasses covering her eyes, sobbing and screaming on the phone, \\"I can't believe you did this to me. I'm going to get a restraining order against you.\\" We're told security brought her inside the building, took her upstairs and Michael showed up 5 minutes later and ran into the building. He screamed repeatedly, \\"She hit me first.\\" We're told he angrily added, \\"This is bulls***, this is f***ing bulls***.\\" We're told he tried getting into the elevator but security denied him access. Cops showed up and escorted Avenatti into a corner of the apartment lobby and spoke with him for 5 to 10 minutes and then took him into custody. A law enforcement source says on Tuesday, Avenatti \\"kicked her out of the apartment\\" and that's when the alleged domestic violence occurred. We're told she went back to the apartment on Wednesday to retrieve her belongings and called police to stand by in case things got heated. We're told Avenatti is currently in custody.

I always wish the animals could be free. I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe?

One morning, Jan was in a lift of a high building with his window cleaning tools when the building was on fire. There were five other passengers in the lift. All of a sudden the lift stopped. Although they didn't know what had happened outside, they had only 100 minutes to get out of the building before it would fall into the dust. Soon smoke began coming into the lift. The men knew that something was wrong. They tried to open the door but found a wall in front of them. The wall had the number 15 on it and they knew they were on the 15th floor. But their lift usually didn't stop there, so there was no opening for them to escape. Jan decided they would have to make their own. Knowing that the wall was made of a material that could be cut through, Jan took out his window cleaning tools, and began knocking a hole through the wall. When he felt tired, others helped. Starting with one small hole, they cut through the three-inch-thick wall. Then they kicked hard at the wall. The wall cracked apart. They saw before them a tile wall! Refusing to give up, they knocked a hole through the tile, then made the opening big enough to get through. Surprisingly, the fire-fighters were outside the hole, they took Jan and his partners to the nearest stairs and they ran down the stairs as quickly as possible. By 10:23, Jan and the others ran out of the building. Five minutes later, the building burned down. Question: According to the passage, how many people were in the lift?

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Who is offered as a sacrifice to Kong? Ann The answer is:","completion":"Title: \\"Kong's Sacrifice\\" Our story begins in the bustling city of New York in the 1930s. Ann Darrow is a struggling theater actress, desperate to make ends meet amidst the economic troubles of the Great Depression. She's an alluring young woman with a dream to see her name up in lights. However, her ambitions are continuously dashed due to the closing of theaters and the scarcity of roles. One day, she's discovered by a charismatic, yet opportunistic filmmaker by the name of Carl Denham. Denham is intrigued by her beauty, resilience, and charm. He recognizes and exploits her desperation by offering her the leading role in his upcoming film. Lured by the chance of garnering fame and fortune, Ann accepts. Unbeknownst to Ann, the film shoot isn't taking place in any conventional studio. Denham has a far grander, adventurous and highly perilous plan in mind - his film is set on the mysterious Skull Island, a place steeped in local legend, known for its vicious wildlife and the enigmatic Kong. Once they reach the Island, they are greeted by a tribe of indigenous people preparing for a ceremony. In the course of the celebrations, they spot Ann. The tribe considers her to be the perfect offering for Kong — their god, a giant, intimidating gorilla who rules the island. Overwhelmed by her visage, they capture Ann, bypassing the disoriented movie crew. Ann is presented to Kong, scared, alone yet filled with a determination to survive. Kong is immediately captivated by his pale, frightened prisoner— unlike anything he has seen before on his island. He does not kill Ann but instead, showing a depth of character no one anticipates, he becomes her protector. As time passes, a bond begins to form between Ann and Kong, one forged through mutual respect and a shared sense of otherness. Ann, initially terrified, begins to see Kong not as a monster but as an innocent trapped in a world where he doesn't belong. Equally, Kong is fascinated by Ann, protecting her from the dangers of Skull Island. Meanwhile, Carl Denham and his crew plan a daring mission to save Ann and capture the legendary Kong to bring back to America, convinced of the fortune the unique creature would bring. Jack Driscoll, a sailor who had formed a close bond with Ann during their journey, is especially invested in rescuing her from her plight. The battle between Kong and the humans intensifies, ultimately leading to Kong's capture and transportation back to New York City, where he's put on display for people's amusement. Kong, distraught and desperate to find Ann, manages to break free, leading to a citywide rampage. In the climactic finish on top of the Empire State Building, Ann and Kong are reunited, their connection humanizing Kong in the eyes of the fearful observers. Jack, Carl and the spectators watch as fighter planes approach to take Kong down, tearing Ann away from him. \\"Kong's Sacrifice\\" then becomes a tale of love, survival, and redemption, exploring how the fear of the unknown drives us to act in ways that can have irrevocable consequences. It's an emotional exploration of humanity's connection, manipulation, and often tragic relationship with the natural world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In 624, the great-grandfather of Banu Qaynuqa tribe is Qaynuqa ibn Amchel ibn Munshi ibn Yohanan ibn Benjamin ibn Saron ibn Naphtali ibn Hayy ibn Moses and they are descendant of Manasseh ibn Joseph ibn Jacob ibn Isaac son of Abraham . They were expelled during the Invasion of Banu Qaynuqa, after breaking the treaty known as the Constitution of Medina. - Muhammad (c. 570 CE 8 June 632 CE) is the central figure of Islam and widely regarded as its founder by non-Muslims. He is known as the \\"Holy Prophet\\" to Muslims, almost all of whom consider him to be the last prophet sent by God to mankind to restore Islam, believed by Muslims to be the unaltered original monotheistic faith of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity and ensured that his teachings, practices, and the Quran, formed the basis of Islamic religious belief. - The Battle of Khaybar was fought in the year 628 between Muslims and the Jews living in the oasis of Khaybar, located from Medina in the north-western part of the Arabian peninsula, in modern-day Saudi Arabia. According to Muslim sources, the Muslim soldiers attacked the Jews who had barricaded themselves in forts. - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God. - Ar-Rab' bin Ab 'l-Huqayq was a Jewish poet of the Banu al-Nadir in Medina, who flourished shortly before the Hegira (622). - The Banu Nadir were a Jewish tribe who lived in northern Arabia until the 7th century at the oasis of Madinah. The tribe challenged Muhammad as the leader of Medina, planned along with allied nomads to attack Muhammad and were expelled from Medina as a result. The Banu Nadir then planned the battle of the Trench together with the Quraysh. They later participated in the battle of Khaybar. Early History. In early Medina, in addition to the Banu Nadir, there were two other major Jewish tribes: the Banu Qurayza and the Banu Qaynuqa. They were joined earlier by two non-Jewish Arab tribes from Yemen, Banu Aus and Khazraj. - The Battle of the Trench also known as the Battle of the Confederates, was a 27-day-long siege of Yathrib (now \\"Medina\\") by Arab and Jewish tribes. The strength of the confederate armies is estimated around 10,000 men with six hundred horses and some camels, while the Medinan defenders numbered 3,000. The battle coincided with harsh winter weather of January/February AD 627. What is the relationship between 'kenana ibn al-rabi' and '628'? A:","completion":"Kenana ibn al-Rabi' and the year 628 are related through the events that transpired in the early Islamic period in Arabia. Kenana ibn al-Rabi' was a Jewish Arab tribal leader and an opponent of Muhammad, the founder and central figure of Islam. He was the son of poet al-Rabi ibn Abu al-Huqayq and a member of the Banu Nadir tribe, one of the three main Jewish tribes residing in Medina during the 7th century. The year 628, on the other hand, marks the Battle of Khaybar. This battle occurred between the Muslims, led by Muhammad, and the Jews living in the oasis of Khaybar, which is located northwest of Medina in present-day Saudi Arabia. The Banu Nadir tribe, to which Kenana ibn al-Rabi' belonged, played an influential role in this battle. The Muslims eventually emerged victorious, subsequently affecting the fates of many Jewish tribes, including the Banu Nadir, in the Arabian Peninsula. Although Kenana ibn al-Rabi' died prior to the Battle of Khaybar, his opposition to Muhammad and his membership in the Banu Nadir tribe makes his story and the year 628 related.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I have seen the movie at the Viennale a few years ago, where the audiences liked it. I liked it as well, Summer Phoenix performance still haunts me, that´s why I decided to write a comment. The story unfolds in London around 1900, where a jewish girl decides to become an actress. She tries desperately to become one, but it isn´t before a man treats her badly that she realizes on stage, that she has talent and that she connects with the audience and emerges as a stronger human being. There were certain reviews, were her performance was smashed, they accused her of being dull, not able to bring life to her character. I think that´s her strong point, that´s exactly what Esther Kahn should be and Phoenix makes a brave decision to make her Esther a rather boring girl. So her transformation at the end is more powerful than it could have been otherwise. The cinematography is great, the images of London around the turn of the century are very dark and sad, you can see how unpleasant life was back then. The only fault in my opinion is the length of the movie, you loose touch with the characters, after all it´s only about finding the actor in yourself, so there are no dramatic actions in the film. It´s Phoenix credit that we don´t loose the interest in the movie after the first hour.","completion":"The sentiment of the given review is predominantly positive, with a few minor criticisms.

They appreciate the portrayal of London around the turn of the century, which they describe as dark, sad, and an accurate reflection of an unpleasant time in history. However, there is one critique that the reviewer brings up: the length of the movie. They feel that the extended runtime can cause the audience to lose touch with the characters since there is no dramatic action throughout the film. Yet, they credit Summer Phoenix for maintaining the audience's interest despite this issue. Overall, the sentiment leans heavily towards the positive side, as the reviewer clearly appreciates the film and its artistic choices, with only a minor concern about the length of the movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Game Plan Context: In the last game of the American Football Federation between the Boston Rebels and the New York Dukes, Rebels quarterback Joe Kingman (Dwayne Johnson) scores a touchdown after ignoring an open wide receiver, Travis Sanders (Morris Chestnut). The next morning, an 8-year-old girl named Peyton Kelly (Madison Pettis) arrives on Joe's doorstep saying that she is his biological daughter, and that his divorced wife sent her there to meet him. Kingman's agent, Stella Peck (Kyra Sedgwick), thinks this will be bad for his image and distracts him with the upcoming playoffs. At the opening of his own restaurant, Joe leaves without Peyton, and is on the cover of a tabloid the next day. Stella decides Kingman needs a new fatherly image. At a later press conference, the reporters make Joe miserable, until Peyton comes to his defense, saying that he is new to this and trying the best he can, and that she thinks he is the best father in the world. Peyton then says that Joe has to repay her, so she has him take her to a ballet academy run by Monique Vasquez (Roselyn SÃ¡nchez). Monique has Joe join their ballet performance to show him that ballet takes just as much athletic ability as football. Joe and Peyton begin their relationship after Peyton calls his arrogant and selfish behavior to his attention. Joe takes Peyton and her new friends to the mall where he begins to develop romantic feelings for Vasquez. The Rebels march through the playoffs via three road games: Denver in the Wild Card round, Indianapolis in the Divisional round and finally Baltimore in the Conference round. They eventually make it to the championship game held in Arizona in a rematch with the New York Dukes.

Does vote mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"Yes, the word \\"vote\\" carries the same meaning in both sentences. However, the context in which \\"vote\\" is used in each sentence suggests different aspects of the voting process and different scales of applying this principle. A \\"vote\\" in general is a formal indication of a selection between two or more candidates, issues or preferences. It is a way for a group of people to make a decision where majority rule applies. In democratic societies, this is a fundamental right given to citizens to allow them to have a say in the way their society or country is governed. In sentence one: \\"They allowed just one vote per person\\", the word \\"vote\\" refers to the individual action taken by a citizen to express their preference in an election or decision-making process. Each person gets just one chance to vote, ensuring fairness in the representation of individual's views or preferences in the final decision. This might be referring to a specific instance or event, like an election, a legislation vote, a poll, survey or other types of decision-making procedures where people are only allowed to vote once. In sentence two: \\"The Supreme Court upheld the principle of one person, one vote\\", the word \\"vote\\" takes on a broader philosophical and legal meaning. The principle of \\"one person, one vote\\" is a fundamental premise in democracies that ensures every vote has equal weight. This means that the principle that each person's vote should count equally in an election, preventing certain groups obtaining an unfair advantage through systems like gerrymandering or biased districting. Upholding this principle preserves the democratic value of equality in political representation. The Supreme Court here represents the judicial institution that can make rulings or decisions to preserve this rigorous rule. So, while the word \\"vote\\" has the same meaning as an individual casting their selection, the context differs. The first sentence showcases a more tangible, action-oriented perspective, while the second provides a larger-scale legal and societal perspective on the value of voting. No matter the context, the underlying meaning of \\"vote\\" as an expression of individual preference remains constant."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I don't know what my future will bring.\\" Mrs Merkel replied that \\"politics can be tough\\", adding: \\"You are an extremely nice person but you also know that there are thousands and thousands of people in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon.\\" Germany could not manage if all wanted to move there, she said. Germany says it expects 400,000 asylum applications by the end of 2015 - more than double the amount if received in 2014. The right-wing Pegida group has marched against what it calls the Islamisation of Germany, and the country's newest political party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), has called for tighter immigration control. \\"The mistakes in the government's refugee policies can't be patted away,\\" Katrin Goering-Eckardt, a Green Party MP, said. \\"This week has been fantastic for German public diplomacy. All that was missing was Merkel making refugee children cry,\\" the Belarus-born writer Evgeny Morozov said. Summary:","completion":"At a forum, Mrs. Merkel explained to a Palestinian girl named Reem that not all migrants can stay in Germany and some might have to go home, making Reem cry, and people shared their different opinions about it on social media."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: The Warriors guard’s grace on the basketball court draws bravos from all around. By SCOTT CACCIOLANOV. 24, 2015 Taras Domitro was not a basketball fan when he joined the San Francisco Ballet as a principal dancer in 2008. “But I became one,” he said. Domitro, who was born in Havana, happened to arrive in the Bay Area one year before the Golden State Warriors drafted Stephen Curry. That fortunate turn of events goes a long way toward explaining how Domitro grew to enjoy watching the game. “What I see the most when I watch Steph is the incredible coordination he has with his arms, his legs and the way he handles the ball,” Domitro, 29, said before drawing a comparison between their respective disciplines and referring to the way male dancers support women as they execute a lift or a jump. “We don’t use a ball, you know. We use a woman. But the way he dribbles the ball is the way we handle a woman on stage.” The defending champion Warriors are at it again — scoring points, winning games and setting ridiculous standards. On Tuesday night, the Warriors (15-0) could break an N.B.A. record for the best start to a season by defeating the Los Angeles Lakers at Oracle Arena in Oakland, Calif. Curry, the N.B.A.’s leading scorer and last season’s most valuable player, has been at the center of it all, having added a new title to his résumé: the N.B.A.’s unofficial artist-in-residence. “It’s beautiful to watch,” said Graham Lustig, 61, the artistic director of the Oakland Ballet Company. With each 3-pointer and every spinning layup, Curry somehow seems to transcend the sport, turning the game into theater. Domitro and Lustig said that much of Curry’s aesthetic appeal was rooted in what ballet dancers seek most: to make their art look effortless. “We don’t want to see any pain when dancers are finishing their final variation of something,” Lustig said. “You don’t want to see them screwing up their faces and giving the impression they can hardly make it through to the end of a solo.” In a league full of behemoths who sweat and strain on every possession, the 6-foot-3 Curry has been operating on a different plane — one that has struck Lustig as deeply familiar. “Steph doesn’t really look like he’s putting in a lot effort, does he?” Lustig said. “I’m not suggesting at all that he doesn’t use effort. It’s just that he doesn’t display it, and I think that’s probably at the core of what this is about.” Lustig said he was particularly impressed by Curry’s body control, citing a move that Curry made against the Detroit Pistons this month. After dribbling past his primary defender, Curry launched himself at the rim before he managed to rotate his torso away from a second defender. He proceeded to flip the ball off the glass and through the hoop. “He’s like a magician, juggling the basketball while he’s four feet off the ground,” Lustig said. When dancers jump and twist and glide across the stage, they rely on centripetal force — essentially the energy that pulls toward a center — for balance, Lustig said. But they must also possess remarkable core strength to be able to spin and soar at such dizzying heights. Lustig sees that type of strength whenever Curry leaves his feet, and especially when he lands, as strange as that might sound. “It’s a lot easier to throw yourself up in the air and try to do something than it is to come down with control,” Lustig said. “And he’s not even trying to do something beautiful. His coach isn’t telling him how to land, but he does. It’s innate. His whole body knows what to do both in the air and in the return.” Every movement in ballet involves a great deal of skill, but the aerial theatrics are always rooted in the same foundation: bending at the knees, a movement known as plié. Dancers bend their legs before they leap, and they bend their legs before they land — all of it designed to ensure balance and to make their bodies more elastic. “That is the baseline that everyone is working from,” Lustig said. It seems safe to suggest, then, that few players in the N.B.A. have a more graceful plié than Curry, whose long and lean physique also lends itself to a certain elegance. “The thing about ballet is that you don’t want to look bulky on stage,” Domitro said. “Steph is not a bulky guy.” Any extraordinary moment in a performance — athletic or artistic — is the product of years of training and preparation, Lustig said. The act itself might look spontaneous, but little happens by accident. Domitro often trains from six to seven hours a day. Lustig danced professionally for 19 years before he succumbed to the effects of age and effort. Like dancers, basketball players use their bodies as their instruments. The behind-the-scenes work is painstaking. “That knee, that foot, that shoulder, that wrist joint — that’s what they have,” Lustig said. “So they have to take care of their bodies because they’re going to push it to the limits.” With that in mind, Lustig noted one element of Curry’s pregame routine, which involves sprinting from halfcourt to one of the baselines immediately before the opening tip. That simple act provides a small window into the physical maintenance that Curry must do on a daily basis. “That’s something dancers do all the time,” Lustig said. “They’re in the wings about to come on stage, and they’re jumping around, they’re stretching and they’re going over their moves — some of the stuff that challenges them the most. That happens quite a bit. And then I see Steph preparing: Zoom!” But while Domitro and Curry both rehearse (Curry would call it practice), Domitro and Lustig marvel at Curry’s ability to improvise — the quick wit to lull a defender into a state of paralysis by dribbling the ball between his legs, over and over, before dashing past him. Curry must create something new nearly every time he touches the ball. “There’s a certain sense of musicality to the way his body works,” Lustig said. “It looks like he’s moving in a slightly different dimension as everyone else, and I think that ties into his sheer speed and power and control — incredible, unbelievable control. And that’s what you want in a dancer.” Domitro explained how it takes an entire community to make a production work — the dancers, the orchestra, the stagehands, the audience. Much like a basketball game, he said, everyone involved plays a role in creating a theatrical experience. “We principals are nothing without the corps,” Domitro said. “We wouldn’t be able to do what we do.” The same is true of Curry, whose dance partner is often his defender. There are moments when he seems acutely aware that he is performing before a crowd. Lustig observed how, after the Warriors’ Harrison Barnes raced in for a dunk in that same game against the Pistons, Curry stood in the backcourt and celebrated by flapping his arms like a bird — three, four, five times. “I’m flying!” Lustig said. “Even the way he does that is graceful.” The Oakland Ballet Company has been at work on a seasonal production of “The Nutcracker,” set to debut next month at the Paramount Theatre. Lustig said he had no doubt that with the proper training from an early age, Curry would have been a fine dancer. Lustig was asked how he would have cast him. “Oh, he’d have to be the cavalier, right?” Lustig said. “He has to be the leading man.” Produced by Bedel Saget, Evan Grothjan and Sam Manchester A version of this article appears in print on November 25, 2015, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Point Guard With the Grace of Baryshnikov.

How to put in contact lenses Care for your contact lenses properly, whenever they're not in use. This basically means two things : Always store your contacts in contact lens solution, unless you're wearing daily disposable lenses. Contact lens solution helps to clean, rinse, and disinfect your lenses.","completion":"Step 1: Thoroughly wash and dry your hands Before handling the contact lenses, ensure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, and dry them with a clean, lint-free towel. This step is crucial to remove any dirt or bacteria that may be on your hands, as they can transfer onto the lenses and cause eye infections or discomfort. Step 2: Check if the contact lens is clean and not inside-out To determine if the contact lens is clean and in the correct orientation, place the lens on the tip of your index finger and inspect it. The lens should have a slight bowl shape with smooth edges. If the edges seem to flare outwards, the lens may be inside-out and needs to be flipped. Also, examine the lens for any debris, rips, or tears. If there's any damage or dirt, clean the lens with the contact lens solution before putting it in. Step 3: Hold the upper eyelid Using the other hand, gently hold the upper eyelid by the lashes, to prevent blinking and keep the eye as open as possible. Step 4: Hold the lower eyelid With the middle or ring finger of the hand holding the lens, pull down the lower eyelid to maximize the size of the eye opening and make it easier to insert the lens. Step 5: Place the lens on the eye While looking straight ahead or slightly upwards, gently place the lens onto the cornea. Don’t press too hard, as that may cause discomfort. Once the lens is placed, slowly release the eyelids. Step 6: Blink and adjust Blink a few times to allow the lens to center itself on your eye. If the lens feels comfortable, it's likely in the correct position. If it feels off-center, you may need to gently slide it to the right position with your finger. If there's any discomfort, remove the lens, inspect it for debris or damage, and reinsert it. Step 7: Repeat for the other lens Complete the same process for the other lens, and make sure both lenses feel comfortable and sit correctly on your eyes. Remember to always remove lenses at the end of the day, and follow proper cleaning and storage procedures to ensure they stay in good condition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The workers walked right past Emily and up to Betty because","completion":"Betty was their team leader and the one usually in charge of overseeing their duties. Emily, though a skilled worker, had not been in the company long enough to earn the trust and respect that Betty had. The workers had come to rely on Betty's direction and decisiveness, trusting her instincts unconditionally. They had experienced firsthand that she was someone who made everyone feel heard and acknowledged while keeping the work environment efficient and productive. Emily shifted slightly as the workers gathered around Betty, whose calm and poised demeanor radiated confidence. She addressed their concerns, listened to their suggestions, and clarified the day's goals with her trademark air of patience and understanding. Emily observed the exchange intently, as she had for weeks now, hoping to learn from Betty's excellent leadership skills. Emily, though slightly envious of her position, admired Betty greatly. She always knew that she had a lot to learn from people like her, and she also wanted to be a leader one day. So she made sure to observe Betty's actions, her words, and the way she addressed the workers. The day was progressing as usual, with the workers completing the assigned tasks diligently. As challenges arose throughout the workday, Emily paid close attention to how Betty managed the situations. It seemed as though she had an almost innate ability to motivate, inspire, and cultivate collaboration among team members. Emily observed that just as the sun started to set, their crew was almost through with the day's assignments. Under Betty's watchful eye and guidance, they had managed to complete their work with efficiency, a testament to her leadership style. Noticing that Emily had been attentively watching her from the sidelines, Betty walked up to her during an unexpected break. While Emily may have anticipated a reprimand for not participating in the tasks at hand, she was instead met with a warm smile and a few guiding words. \\"I see how closely you've been watching our team's dynamics, Emily,\\" Betty said kindly, \\"It's obvious to me that you want to be a good leader someday.\\" Taken aback, Emily stammered, \\"I-I just... It's not that I don't like what I'm doing now, but I want to be able to make a difference, you know?\\" Betty nodded, understanding Emily's ambition. \\"Seeing that you have such aspirations is commendable. I want to let you know that I really appreciate the hard work and effort you've been putting into our team. Keep learning, be patient, and always help others where you can, and I am sure you'll be a great leader someday.\\" Emily felt a surge of determination swelling in her chest. With Betty's encouragement and assurance echoing in her ears, she was more motivated than ever to reach her full potential. As ready as Emily was to seize the reins of leadership when the time was right, she decided to commit herself to learning from the best and embracing the wisdom of those who had come before her. Betty and Emily continued working together for months, their mutual respect and professional trust growing stronger by the day. Gradually, Emily took on more responsibilities within the team and proved herself as a valuable asset. She collaborated closely with Betty to improve processes and create a better work environment for everyone. Before Emily knew it, the company recognized her leadership potential and promoted her to a team leader. Though she knew she had come a long way, Emily never lost sight of the guidance she received from Betty and the importance of being an empathetic, understanding, and empowering leader. But as Emily settled into her new role, the workers who had once walked right past her now gathered around her confidently, just as they had done with Betty. And so, the cycle of mentorship and leadership continued, as each new generation of eager and ambitious individuals learned from those who came before, all the while sculpting the team's future and emboldening the spirit of collaboration, growth, and excellence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Ninja Assassin Context: The Ozunu Clan, led by the ruthless Lord Ozunu (Sho Kosugi), trains orphans from around the world to become the ultimate ninja assassins. One of these orphans, Raizo (Rain), was enrolled in the clan's brutal training to become its next successor. The only kindness he was ever shown was from a young kunoichi named Kiriko, with whom he eventually develops a romantic bond. As time goes on, Kiriko becomes disenchanted with the Ozunu's routine and wishes to abandon it for freedom. One rainy night, Kiriko decides to make her escape and encourages Raizo to join her; however he decides to stay. Branded as a traitor, Kiriko was caught and later executed in front of Raizo by their elder ninja brother Takeshi, impaling her through the heart. As a result of Kiriko's death, Raizo begins to harbor resentment and doubt towards the Ozunu. Some time later, Raizo is instructed by Lord Ozunu to complete his first assassination. Afterwards, Raizo meets the rest of his clan atop a city skyscraper in Berlin. There he is instructed by Lord Ozunu to execute another kunoichi traitor like Kiriko. He rebels against Lord Ozunu by cutting his face with a kyoketsu-shoge and engages in combat against his fellow ninja kin. Barely surviving, he falls off the roof of the skyscraper and into a river. Raizo recovers from his ordeal and begins to intervene and foil subsequent Ozunu assassination attempts, including a disguised female assassin at a laundromat. Meanwhile, Europol agent Mika Coretti (Naomie Harris) has been investigating money-linked political murders and finds out that they are possibly connected to the Ozunu. She defies her superior, Ryan Maslow (Ben Miles), and retrieves secret agency files to find out more about the investigation. Mika meets Raizo and convinces him to see Maslow for protection as well as to provide evidence against the Ozunu. However, Raizo is arrested by Maslow and abducted by agents from Europol for interrogation. Although feeling betrayed, Mika is assured by Maslow that he is still on her side and gives her...

Question 1: Can we do a calculus like differentiation and integration of data from incoming records using scan and rollup component in abinitio or even in PL/SQL? Question 2: I know Unix, SQL, pl SQL . What next should I learn to move ahead in my career? Should I learn some reporting tool or data warehouse tool? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answering the questions step-by-step: Question 1: Step 1: Assess if calculus operations like differentiation and integration can be performed on data in Abinitio and PL/SQL. Abinitio is a data integration and processing tool that provides various components for extracting, manipulating, and loading data. It can perform arithmetic operations and aggregations on data, while PL/SQL is a procedural language for managing data in Oracle databases. Step 2: Identify relevant components for calculus-like operations in Abinitio. While Abinitio doesn't have built-in components specifically for calculus operations like differentiation and integration, you can develop a custom solution using existing components. For example, you can use the \\"Scan\\" and \\"Rollup\\" components for iterative and cumulative calculations, respectively. It would require designing a custom solution that mimics the behavior of differentiation and integration using these and other components. Step 3: Assess if calculus-like operations are possible in PL/SQL. PL/SQL allows you to define custom functions and procedures, which can be used to implement differentiation and integration algorithms for incoming records. In summary, while there are no native calculus-specific features in Abinitio and PL/SQL, custom solutions for differentiation and integration can be developed through the creative use of existing components and language features. Question 2: Step 1: Evaluate current skill set (Unix, SQL, PL/SQL) and potential areas for growth. You already have a solid foundation in Unix, SQL, and PL/SQL, which is great for data management and manipulation tasks. To further your career, you can consider learning new tools and technologies that complement your current skill set. Step 2: Identify suitable tools and technologies. Considering your background, it would be beneficial to learn tools related to data analysis, data warehousing, and reporting. These skills will allow you to gain insights from the data, which is crucial in data-driven decision-making. Step 3: Provide suggestions for learning. Some relevant technologies and tools to explore include data warehousing tools like Abinitio, Informatica, or Talend, and reporting tools like Tableau or Power BI. Additionally, learning programming languages like Python or R for data analysis can be valuable for your career growth. For the final prompt: No, the answers to the two questions are not the same. The first question is about the feasibility of performing calculus operations in Abinitio and PL/SQL, while the second question is about career growth suggestions in the context of the user's current skill set."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Mircea Eliade (Romanian: ['mirtSea eli'ade]; March 9 [O.S. February 24] 1907 - April 22, 1986) was a Romanian historian of religion, fiction writer, philosopher, and professor at the University of Chicago. He was a leading interpreter of religious experience, who established paradigms in religious studies that persist to this day. His theory that hierophanies form the basis of religion, splitting the human experience of reality into sacred and profane space and time, has proved influential. After completing his primary education at the school on Mantuleasa Street, Eliade attended the Spiru Haret National College in the same class as Arsavir Acterian, Haig Acterian, and Petre Viforeanu (and several years the senior of Nicolae Steinhardt, who eventually became a close friend of Eliade's). Among his other colleagues was future philosopher Constantin Noica and Noica's friend, future art historian Barbu Brezianu. As a child, Eliade was fascinated with the natural world, which formed the setting of his very first literary attempts, as well as with Romanian folklore and the Christian faith as expressed by peasants. Growing up, he aimed to find and record what he believed was the common source of all religious traditions. The young Eliade's interest in physical exercise and adventure led him to pursue mountaineering and sailing, and he also joined the Romanian Boy Scouts. With a group of friends, he designed and sailed a boat on the Danube, from Tulcea to the Black Sea. In parallel, Eliade grew estranged from the educational environment, becoming disenchanted with the discipline required and obsessed with the idea that he was uglier and less virile than his colleagues. In order to cultivate his willpower, he would force himself to swallow insects and only slept four to five hours a night. At one point, Eliade was failing four subjects, among which was the study of the Romanian language. Instead, he became interested in natural science and chemistry, as well as the occult, and wrote short pieces on entomological subjects. Despite his father's concern that he was in danger of losing his already weak eyesight, Eliade read passionately. One of his favorite authors was Honore de Balzac, whose work he studied carefully. Eliade also became acquainted with the modernist short stories of Giovanni Papini and social anthropology studies by James George Frazer. His interest in the two writers led him to learn Italian and English in private, and he also began studying Persian and Hebrew. At the time, Eliade became acquainted with Saadi's poems and the ancient Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh. He was also interested in philosophy--studying, among others, Socrates, Vasile Conta, and the Stoics Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, and read works of history--the two Romanian historians who influenced him from early on were Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and Nicolae Iorga. His first published work was the 1921 Inamicul viermelui de matase (\\"The Silkworm's Enemy\\"), followed by Cum am gasit piatra filosofala (\\"How I Found the Philosophers' Stone\\"). Four years later, Eliade completed work on his debut volume, the autobiographical \\"Diary of a Short-Sighted Adolescent\\" translated into English and published by Istros Books in 2016. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What school was he attending during his adolescence?","completion":"Mircea Eliade attended the Spiru Haret National College during his adolescence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related.

After sight-seeing in Sydney, they head for the Outback to attend the Vampire Rock Music Festival. Legend says that Vampire Rock is the home of the Yoweeyahoo, an ancient Australian vampire.The events of last year's festival are making Malcolm, Daniel, and co-promoter Russell very nervous. Following the festival, one of the bands called Wild Wind went camping on Vampire Rock and were never heard from again. Rumor has it that all three were kidnapped by the Yoweeyahoo and turned into vampires. Now, strange things are happening at this year's festival--sounds, lights, and smoke are issuing from Vampire Rock. And last night three vampires (who look like the members of Wild Wind) swooped down and carried off the band members of Matt Marvellous. Most of the finalists have pulled out of the contest and are going home.When Scooby and his party arrive at Vampire Rock, they are warmly greeted by their friends, the Hex Girls, who are scheduled to open the show. Sensing a mystery to be solved, Fred, Daphne, and Velma decide to form a rock group themselves and go undercover as The Meddling Kids.Next band to arrive is the Bad Omens and their rather shady manager, Jasper Ridgeway. Fred immediately suspects them, as Jasper Ridgeway also managed Wild Wind. Fred, Daphne, and Velma go nosing around Jasper's motorhome, where they find the costumes worn by Wild Wind. Scooby and Shaggy are chased by the three vampires, who also show up during rehearsals and carry off The Bad Omens.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Great Australian Bight is a large oceanic bight, or open bay, off the central and western portions of the southern coastline of mainland Australia. - The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean, comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica. As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters. - The Northern Territory (abbreviated as NT) is a federal Australian territory in the central and central northern regions of Australia. It shares borders with Western Australia to the west (129th meridian east), South Australia to the south (26th parallel south), and Queensland to the east (138th meridian east). To the north, the territory is bordered by the Timor Sea, the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Despite its large areaover , making it the third largest Australian federal divisionit is sparsely populated. The Northern Territory's population of 244,000 (2016) makes it the least populous of Australia's eight major states and territories, having fewer than half as many people as Tasmania. - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi. - Western Australia (abbreviated as WA) is a state occupying the entire western third of Australia. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the north and west, the Great Australian Bight and Southern Ocean to the south, the Northern Territory to the north-east and South Australia to the south-east. Western Australia is Australia's largest state with a total land area of 2,529,875 square kilometres (976,790 sq mi), and the second-largest country subdivision in the world however, a significant part of it is sparsely populated. The state has about 2.6 million inhabitants, around 11% of the national total. 92% of the population lives in the south-west corner of the state. - The Blackwood River is a major river and catchment in the South West of Western Australia . The river begins at the junction of Arthur River and Balgarup River near Quelarup and travels in a south westerly direction through the town of Bridgetown then through Nannup until it discharges into the Southern Ocean at Hardy Inlet near the town of Augusta . The river has 41 tributaries including Dinninup Brook , Balingup Brook , St John Brook , Boyup Brook , Tweed River , Ti Tree Gully , Christmas Creek and Tanjannerup Creek . The upper or larger catchment area of the river is in agricultural areas , while the middle catchment area passes through forest areas , and the lower portion of the river passes into mixed forest , agricultural and residential lands . The river emerges into Flinders Bay at Augusta . It was discovered in 1827 by Captain James Stirling and named by Stirling after Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Blackwood , under whom he served as a Midshipman on HMS Warspite in 1808 -- 1909 during the Napoleonic Wars , in the North Sea and the Mediterranean . Historically it was of considerable importance in the early days of the Swan River Colony , and more recently of importance in the ecology of the Augusta - Margaret River region due to conflicts in land use policy . The upper catchment contains Toolibin Lake , a nature reserve and Ramsar site . Hardy Inlet has a number of islands -- namely Molloy Island and Thomas Island . The mouth of the river has attracted interest in its various points of opening and closing over the last 100 years , Duke Head at the west side being a benchmark location for the shifting mouth . The river is prone to occasional flooding . In 1945 it rose to the highest level recorded to that date , running 1.1 metres ( 3.6 ft ) over the Russell Street bridge in Nannup . The river flooded again in 1946 and 1947 closing roads but not causing any significant damage to towns along the river .

FriendFinder Networks Inc., owner of Penthouse adult magazine, plans to submit a bid for Playboy Enterprises Inc., following a 123 million offer from Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. FriendFinder Chief Executive Officer Marc Bell said in an interview the company is “looking at alternatives” and later wrote in an e-mail it will probably make the bid today. Playboy said yesterday that Hefner wants to take the company private, and offered to purchase the shares he doesn’t already own in Playboy, which includes the namesake men’s magazine, merchandise, and television and video content. Hefner plans to offer 5.50 apiece in cash for the Class A and Class B shares, Chicago-based Playboy said in a statement. Hefner, 84, is partnering with Rizvi Traverse Management LLC for the transaction. The offer, at a premium of more than 30 percent, values Playboy at about 185 million. Playboy said Hefner, who controls its voting shares, isn’t interested in a merger or sale to a third party out of concern for the company’s brand and Playboy magazine’s editorial direction. Playboy has combined units and slashed jobs to cope with a circulation plunge caused by Internet competition. After Hefner founded the company in 1953, Playboy magazine garnered a following for its photos of nude women, its satirical cartoons, and its fiction. The first issue of the magazine included photos of Marilyn Monroe, and authors such as Vladimir Nabokov were published in Playboy’s pages.

Close Open Photographer: Rick Maiman/Bloomberg Playboy magazines are displayed on a news stand in New York, on Nov. 12, 2009. Expansion Years The company expanded around the globe in the 1960s and ‘70s with Hefner at the helm. The company went public in 1971 and circulation peaked at 7.2 million in 1972. In June, the company hosted parties around the country to mark the 50th anniversary of the once-famous Playboy membership nightclubs that dotted the globe. Playboy’s revenue has declined for the past two years as it has lost more than 200 million. At the beginning of this year, the company reduced Playboy magazine’s rate base, the total of newsstand and subscription sales guaranteed to advertisers, to 1.5 million from 2.6 million. In addition to the magazine, Playboy creates videos for its website and cable-television networks, and licenses products with its bunny-ear brand. ‘Girls Next Door’ The company last year hired Scott Flanders as chief executive officer, replacing the founder’s daughter, Christie Hefner. Christie Hefner had served as CEO for 20 years, as her father continued to personify the brand with his lifestyle at the Playboy mansion. The Los Angeles mansion, which the company uses for television shows, photo shoots and events, is “an enormous asset to us,” said Playboy spokeswoman Martha Lindeman. “It’s a huge part of our brand.” Hefner is currently most recognized for squiring voluptuous young women around the mansion while clad in one of his trademark silk smoking jackets. Some of the octogenarian’s most recent girlfriends star with him in the TV show, “The Girls Next Door,” and related online videos. Hefner was sued in 2009 by an investor who said the Playboy founder scuttled potential acquisitions so he could maintain his residence at the mansion. Lindeman said she didn’t know the status of the lawsuit because it was filed against Hefner personally. ‘Billion-Dollar Brand’ Bell said that if he successfully purchases Playboy, he wouldn’t require Hefner to move out of the Los Angeles mansion. Bell, whose company includes the AdultFriendFinder.com website, said he is interested in Playboy for its online potential. “Our interest is mostly the digital assets,” Bell said. “We have no desire to throw him out.” Hugh Hefner couldn’t be reached for comment, according to Lindeman. Christie Hefner declined to comment, according to her spokeswoman, Deb Parry. In a conference call last month, Flanders said that Playboy’s new strategy is to change from being an “inefficient operator of small segments of media” to becoming more of a brand management company. Playboy, based in Chicago, is seeking partners to increase revenue from licensed goods and expand branded clubs and casinos. The moves are part of a restructuring plan that Flanders has said will result in a profit in 2011. On last month’s call, Flanders said that investors were undervaluing Playboy stock. “You could own the company for an enterprise value of 200 million, and we believe we have a billion-dollar brand,” Flanders said at the time. Declining Magazine Sales Last week, the company announced that it would downsize its organizational structure, resulting in a 3 million charge in the second quarter of this year. In recent days, Michael Dannhauser, Playboy’s senior vice president and controller since 1998, said that he was leaving the company. His duties were given to Christoph Pachler, according to Lindeman. Hugh Hefner owns 69.5 percent of Playboy’s Class A voting stock and 27.7 percent of the Class B non-voting stock. The company said it hasn’t received a definitive offer from Hefner, and the board has made no decision about the proposal. Playboy B shares fell 14 cents to 5.41 at 10:29 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after jumping 41 percent yesterday. The B shares had gained 23 percent this year before yesterday. The A shares advanced 3 cents to 5.56, after climbing 36 percent yesterday and closing at 4.06 on July 9. Playboy magazine’s U.S. sales fell 48 percent to 7.1 million in the first quarter, reflecting the company’s decision to lower the magazine’s rate base and combine some issues. The company’s Print and Digital group lost 1.1 million in the first quarter, compared with a loss of 3.6 million in the 2009 quarter. The group’s revenue fell 30 percent to 18.2 million.

Process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - Question: suppose animals on a flood plain happens, how will it affect less animals sinking to the bottom. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"The formation of fossils is a complex process influenced by various factors such as type of sediment, rate of deposition, presence of decomposers, and environmental conditions. When a flood event occurs on a floodplain, the impact on the number of animals sinking to the bottom can vary depending on these factors. However, compared to typical situations, more animals would likely sink to the bottom during flood events in a floodplain. Let's break down the reasons for this outcome in detail. 1. Deposition of sediments: Floods can carry a large amount of sediment with them. In a floodplain, the water flow can rapidly deposit these sediments, leading to a higher chance of animals being quickly buried in soft soil or mud. Rapid burial increases the chances of the remains to be preserved by minimizing the time for scavengers to find the remains and preventing decomposition by limiting exposure to oxygen. 2. Higher number of carcasses: Flooding events cause a higher mortality rate among the animals living in the floodplain due to drowning, habitat destruction, and other related factors. This means there would be a higher number of carcasses available for potential fossilization. 3. Different animal behavior: Floods can force animals to behave differently than they would under normal circumstances. Some might seek refuge on higher grounds, while others may become trapped in watery environments or mud. These behavioral changes can make it more likely for an animal to become buried in the sediment, increasing the chances of fossilization. 4. Change in environmental conditions: Floods can alter the existing environmental conditions, creating situations that may be more favorable for fossilization. For instance, anoxic conditions (lack of oxygen) can develop in waterlogged soils during a flood event. These conditions slow down the rate of decomposition, increasing the chances of fossilization. 5. Variation in water flow: During flood events, the flow of water varies significantly with high-energy currents able to carry larger sediments such as gravel and sand. This allows for deeper burial of animal remains, potentially protecting them from both scavengers and decomposers. To summarize, more animals are likely to sink to the bottom during flood events in a floodplain due to the rapid deposition of sediments, a higher number of carcasses, altered animal behavior, changes in environmental conditions, and variability in water flow. These factors contribute to a higher likelihood of animals becoming trapped in the sediment, leading to a greater chance of fossilization in the long term."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Vehicles carrying the South Korea's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon and other delegations arrive at Unification Bridge, which leads to the Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone in Paju, South Korea,... (Associated Press) Vehicles carrying the South Korea's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon and other delegations arrive at Unification Bridge, which leads to the Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone in Paju, South Korea, Tuesday, Jan. 9, 2018. North and South Korea were set to hold rare talks at their tense border Tuesday... (Associated Press) SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea agreed Tuesday to send a delegation to next month's Winter Olympics in South Korea, Seoul officials said, as the bitter rivals sat for rare talks at the border to discuss how to cooperate in Olympics and improve their long-strained ties. The Koreas' first talks in two years were arranged after North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un recently made an abrupt push for improved ties with South Korea after a year of elevated tensions with the outside world over his expanding nuclear and missile programs. Critics say Kim may be trying to divide Seoul and Washington in a bid to weaken international pressure and sanctions on the North. During the talks, the North Korean delegation said it would send an Olympic delegation, which includes officials, athletes, cheerleaders, journalists and others, South Korea's Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae-sung told reporters, according to media footage from the border village of Panmunjom, the venue for the talks. The South Korean delegation, for its part, proposed North Korea send a big delegation and conduct a joint march during the Feb. 9-25 Game's opening and closing ceremonies, Chun, one of the five South Korean negotiators, said. He said South Korea also suggested resuming temporary reunions of families separated by war and offering military talks designed to reduce animosities in frontline areas. South Korea also stressed the need to achieve denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, Chun said. North Korea responded by saying the two Koreas must try to promote peace and reconciliation through dialogue, he said. The two sides were to continue their negotiations later Tuesday at Panmunjom, the only place on the tense border where North and South Korean soldiers are just feet away from each other. A North Korean soldier late last year defected to the South across Panmunjom amid a hail of bullets fired by his comrades. He was hit five times but survived. The meeting began with an amicable atmosphere Tuesday morning, with chief North Korean delegate Ri Son Gwon saying he hopes the talks would give \\"a New Year's first gift — precious results (of the talks) to the Korean nation.\\" Ri's South Korean counterpart, Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon, said he also hopes they would come up with a \\"good gift\\" for people in both Koreas. The overall prospect for the negotiations was still unclear. The two Koreas have a long history of ending key talks without any agreement and failing to follow through with rapprochement accords. An agreement on the North's Olympic participation had been widely expected before the talks began, but the Koreas remain sharply at odds over how to improve their overall ties. North Korea is expected to demand rewards in return for South Korea's offer for family reunions and military talks, like Seoul halting propaganda broadcasts and scaling back or halting military drills with the U.S., observers say. Suspension of the military drills would be unacceptable for Seoul because that would seriously undermine the alliance with its chief ally the United States, which wants to put more pressures on Pyongyang. The North views the drills as a rehearsal for a northward invasion. President Donald Trump on Saturday expressed hope for some progress from the talks and said he was open to talking with Kim himself. But U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley later said the U.S. administration isn't changing its conditions regarding talks with North Korea, saying Kim would first need to stop weapons testing for a \\"significant amount of time.\\" In his New Year's Day address, Kim said there is an urgent need to improve inter-Korean ties and that he is willing to send a delegation to the Pyeongchang Games. He urged Seoul to halt the military drills with the U.S. and said he has a \\"nuclear button\\" to launch missiles at any target in the United States. South Korean liberal President Moon Jae-in, who favors dialogue as a way to defuse the North Korean nuclear standoff, welcomed Kim's outreach and proposed talks at Panmunjom. Kim quickly accepted. \\"As President Moon has said, the improvement of relations between North and South Korea cannot advance separately from resolving North Korea's nuclear program,\\" Brian Hook, a chief adviser to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, told reporters in a conference call late Monday Washington time. \\"And so, we remain focused on our global pressure campaign. That campaign is designed to bring Kim Jong Un to the table for meaningful negations.\\" The Trump administration agreed last week to delay springtime military drills with South Korea until after the Games. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis insisted the delay was a practical necessity to accommodate the Olympics, not a political gesture. Trump and Kim traded bellicose warlike rhetoric and even crude insults last year, as the North conducted it sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation and three tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The International Olympic Committee said Monday it has \\"kept the door open\\" for North Korea to take part in the Games.

The U.S. State Department said Washington would be interested in joining future talks, but stuck to its insistence that they must be aimed at denuclearization, showing that a diplomatic breakthrough remains far off. In a joint statement after 11 hours of talks, North and South Korea said they had agreed to hold military to military talks and that North Korea would send a large delegation to next month’s Winter Olympics in South Korea. However, North Korea made a “strong complaint” after Seoul proposed talks to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. “Clearly this is a positive development,” a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, Steve Goldstein, said of the joint statement, while adding: “We would like nuclear talks to occur; we want denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. This is a good first step in that process.” North and South Korea said they agreed to meet again to resolve problems and avert accidental conflict, amid high tension over North Korea’s program to develop nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States. “All our weapons, including atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs and ballistic missiles, are only aimed at the United States, not our brethren, nor China and Russia,” Pyongyang’s chief negotiator, Ri Son Gwon, said. “This is not a matter between North and South Korea, and to bring up this issue would cause negative consequences and risks turning all of today’s good achievement into nothing,” Ri said in closing remarks. The White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment on the United States being the only potential target of North Korea’s nuclear weapons. U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have exchanged threats and insults in the past year, raising fears of a new war on the peninsula. The United States, which has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War, initially responded coolly to the idea of inter-Korean meetings, but Trump later called them “a good thing” and said he would be willing to speak to Kim. “At the appropriate time, we’ll get involved,” Trump said on Saturday, although U.S.-North Korean talks appear unlikely any time soon, given entrenched positions on both sides. The United States has warned that all options, including military ones, are on the table in dealing with North Korea. Washington agreed with Seoul last week to postpone joint military exercises that Pyongyang denounces as rehearsals for invasion until after the Olympics, but the North-South thaw has not altered the U.S. intelligence assessment of North Korea’s weapons programs. The consensus, according to U.S. officials familiar with the classified analysis, is that Kim remains convinced the United States is determined to overthrow him and that only a nuclear arsenal that threatens America can deter that. One official said the North-South talks were likely to follow the pattern of past diplomatic efforts, in which the North has benefited from additional food and other aid without making any concessions on the weapons front. The additional danger now, said a second official, was that Kim would seek to use the talks to take advantage of Trump’s sometimes bellicose rhetoric to try to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the talks, particularly the agreement to hold military-to-military talks, calling this “critical to lowering the risk of miscalculation”. He also welcomed North Korea’s decision to send a delegation to the Olympics and said he hoped for the resumption of dialogue leading to denuclearization. In spite of the North Korean negotiator’s remarks, South Korea’s Unification Ministry said it believed Tuesday’s talks could lead to discussion of a “fundamental resolution” of the nuclear issue.

Yonhap via REUTERS “We will closely coordinate with the United States, China, Japan and other neighbors in this process,” it said, adding that Seoul had asked Pyongyang to halt acts that stoke tension. Tuesday’s meeting followed a year of ramped-up North Korean missile test launches, some of them over Japanese territory, and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, which prompted a U.S.-led campaign to toughen U.N. sanctions. The U.S. State Department said later in the day that it had approved the sale of anti-ballistic missiles to Japan to defend itself. North Korea-South Korea talks: tmsnrt.rs/2Ar8lUu North Korea revealed: reut.rs/2z4KDPt Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2miGPDI ‘HIGH HOPES’ Earlier on Tuesday, Seoul said it was prepared to lift some unilateral sanctions temporarily so North Koreans could visit for the Olympics. North Korea said its delegation would include athletes, high-ranking officials, a cheering squad, art performers, reporters and spectators. Talks to work out details would be held soon, the South’s Unification Ministry said. Tuesday’s talks were the first between the two Koreas since 2015 and were held at the Peace House on the South Korean side of Panmunjom truce village. Seoul said it proposed reunions of divided families in time for February’s Lunar New Year holiday, but the joint statement made no mention of any agreement on this. Seoul said North Korea had finished technical work to restore a military hotline, with normal communications set to resume on Wednesday. North Korea cut communications in February 2016, following South Korea’s decision to shut down a jointly run industrial park. Seoul also said North Korea responded “positively” to the South’s proposal for athletes from both sides to march together in the Olympic opening ceremony. Such a joint parade has not happened since the 2007 Asian Winter Games in China. China’s Foreign Ministry said it was happy to see talks between North and South Korea and welcomed all positive steps. Russia echoed the sentiment. “This is exactly the kind of dialogue that we said was necessary,” a Kremlin spokesman said. Some U.S.-based analysts have hailed the talks as an opening for diplomacy, but others see an attempt by North Korea to weaken U.S. pressure so that it is eventually accepted as a nuclear-armed state. Slideshow (16 Images) Evans Revere, a former senior U.S. diplomat for East Asia, said that by engaging Seoul, North Korea was clearly seeking to weaken the U.S.-South Korean alliance and it was important that Seoul had raised the nuclear issue to show it was not just a U.S.-North Korea matter. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption North and South Korea had a warm meeting in the DMZ North Korea is to send a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympic Games taking place in South Korea in February, officials from the South say. The breakthrough announcement came as the countries met for their first high-level talks in more than two years. The delegation will include athletes, officials and a group of cheerleaders. A military hotline between the nations, suspended for nearly two years, will be reinstated from Wednesday, the South's officials said. What's happened at the talks? They have continued all day and the developments have been conveyed by officials from the South: Vice unification minister Chun Hae-sung told journalists: \\"The North side proposed dispatching a high-level delegation, National Olympic Committee delegation, athletes, supporters, art performers, observers, a taekwondo demonstration team and journalists\\" to the Games The South proposed that athletes from both Koreas march together at the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang as they did at the 2006 Winter Olympics The South pushed for the reunion of family members separated by the Korean War - a highly emotional issue for both countries - to take place during the Lunar New Year holiday, which falls in the middle the Games The South also proposed resuming negotiations over military issues and the North's nuclear programme The South said it would consider temporarily lifting relevant sanctions, in co-ordination with the UN, to facilitate the North's participation in the Olympics The North's response to all of the South's proposals is not yet known. The opening remarks of head of the North Korean delegation, Ri Son-gwon, were fairly neutral. He said he hoped the talks would bring a \\"good gift\\" for the new year and that the North had a \\"serious and sincere stance\\". Where are the talks and how did they come about? They are being held in the Panmunjom \\"peace village\\" in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) at the border. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption North Korea first expressed interest in joining the Pyeonchang Games during the New Year There are five senior officials on each side. The leaders of both nations are said to be watching the talks via a CCTV feed. In his New Year address, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had said he was considering sending a team to the Olympics. South Korea's Olympics chief had said last year that the North's athletes would be welcome. Following Mr Kim's overture, the South then proposed high-level talks to discuss the North's participation, but the North only agreed to the talks after the US and South Korea agreed to delay their joint military exercises until after the Olympics. The North sees the annual drills as a rehearsal for war. Some critics in the US see the North's move as an attempt to divide the US-South Korea alliance. Dramatic change Analysis: BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Seoul A little over a week ago North Korea was threatening nuclear war - this morning a delegation from Pyongyang strode across the demarcation line that divides North and South Korea and agreed a North Korean delegation would attend the Pyeongchang Games. It is a sudden and dramatic change after months of tension. But few in the South believe any of this demonstrates a fundamental shift in Pyongyang's position. Experts say North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has become increasingly fearful that the US is planning a military strike against him, and has decided he must do something to de-escalate tensions. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has been thrust in the delicate position of trying to engage the North in genuine dialogue, while not upsetting his very sceptical American ally. When were the last talks? Back in 2015. Relations then broke down after Seoul suspended a joint economic project at the Kaesong Industrial complex in North Korea following a rocket launch and nuclear test by the North. The incident led to North Korea ending all communication with Seoul, including cutting off the military hotline.

The North's development of its nuclear programme has continued unabated and has created a huge diplomatic conflict with the US administration of President Donald Trump. Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un have conducted a personal feud, with the US leader dubbing Mr Kim \\"Rocket Man\\" and boasting that his nuclear button is \\"much bigger\\". North Korea's regular missile tests have brought a tightening of UN and US sanctions. The latest test of a ballistic missile on 28 November sparked another raft of measures from the UN, targeting petrol shipments and travel for North Koreans, among other things.

Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - \`\` When the People Fell '' is a science fiction short story by Cordwainer Smith , set in his \`\` Instrumentality '' universe . It was originally published in Galaxy Science Fiction magazine in April , 1959 , and is most recently collected in The Rediscovery of Man , and in the collection of which it is the title story . The story takes place relatively early in the Instrumentality timeline , and a \`\` scanner Vomact '' appears both in this story and the classic story \`\` Scanners Live in Vain '' . The story recounts , in \`\` flashback '' form -- an interview between a reporter and a crusty old - timer -- a risky attempt by a future Chinese government to claim and settle the planet Venus , at a time when China is the only ethnic nation on Earth which has survived as a separate entity through a global nuclear war and a long dark age which followed . The story implicitly compares Western and Chinese approaches to solving an impossible problem and has the Chinese solution succeed , but at a cost Westerners would find repugnant . - In the science fiction of Cordwainer Smith, the Instrumentality of Mankind refers both to Smith's personal future history and universe and to the central government of humanity. \\"The Instrumentality of Mankind\\" is also the title of a paperback collection of short stories by Cordwainer Smith published in 1979 (now superseded by the later \\"The Rediscovery of Man\\", which collects all of Smith's short stories). - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - East Asia is the eastern subregion of the Asian continent, which can be defined in either geographical or ethno-cultural terms. Geographically and geopolitically, it includes China, Hong Kong, and Macao; Mongolia and Taiwan; North and South Korea; and Japan; it covers about , or about 28% of the Asian continent, about twice the area of Europe. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - A science fiction magazine is a publication that offers primarily science fiction, either in a hard copy periodical format or on the Internet. - Horace Leonard \\"H. L.\\" Gold (April 26, 1914 February 21, 1996) was an American science fiction writer and editor. Born in Canada, Gold moved to the United States at the age of two. He was most noted for bringing an innovative and fresh approach to science fiction while he was the editor of \\"Galaxy Science Fiction\\", and also wrote briefly for DC Comics. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Galaxy Science Fiction was an American digest-size science fiction magazine, published from 1950 to 1980. It was founded by an Italian company, World Editions, which was looking to break into the American market. World Editions hired as editor H. L. Gold, who rapidly made \\"Galaxy\\" the leading science fiction (sf) magazine of its time, focusing on stories about social issues rather than technology. - NESFA Press is the publishing arm of the New England Science Fiction Association, Inc. The NESFA Press primarily produces three types of books: - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith (ISBN 0-915368-56-0) is a 1993 book containing the complete collected short fiction of science fiction author Cordwainer Smith. It was edited by James A. Mann and published by NESFA Press. - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis. Among its occasional nicknames are \\"Old Line State\\", the \\"Free State\\", and the \\"Chesapeake Bay State\\". The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England. - Cordwainer Smith was the pen-name used by American author Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger (July 11, 1913 August 6, 1966) for his science fiction works. Linebarger was a noted East Asia scholar and expert in psychological warfare. (\\"Cordwainer\\" is an archaic word for \\"a worker in cordwain or cordovan leather; a shoemaker\\", and a \\"smith\\" is \\"one who works in iron or other metals; esp. a blacksmith or farrier\\": two kinds of skilled workers with traditional materials.) Linebarger also employed the literary pseudonyms \\"Carmichael Smith\\" (for his political thriller \\"Atomsk\\"), \\"Anthony Bearden\\" (for his poetry) and \\"Felix C. Forrest\\" (for the novels \\"Ria\\" and \\"Carola\\"). He died of a heart attack in 1966 at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, at age 53. - Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - \\"Scanners Live in Vain\\" is a science fiction short story by Cordwainer Smith (pen name of Paul Linebarger), set in his Instrumentality of Mankind future history. It was originally published in the magazine \\"Fantasy Book\\" in 1950. It was judged by the Science Fiction Writers of America to be one of the finest short stories prior to 1965 and was included in the anthology \\"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 19291964\\". A revised text, based on Linebarger's original manuscript, appears in the 1993 NESFA Press collection \\"The Rediscovery of Man\\" (where it is accompanied by a facsimile of his original cover letter) and the 2007 collection \\"When the People Fell\\". The story was nominated for a Retro Hugo award in 2001. It has been published in Hebrew, Italian, French, German and Dutch translations. - The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 19291964 is a 1970 anthology of science fiction short stories, edited by Robert Silverberg. It is generally considered one of the best of the many science fiction anthologies. Author Lester del Rey said that \\"it even lives up to its subtitle\\", referring to the volume's boast of containing \\"The Greatest Science-Fiction Stories of All Time\\". - Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from ) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Its abundance in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars, where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a supernova, which scatters the iron into space. - A future history is a postulated history of the future and is used by authors in the subgenre of speculative fiction (or science fiction) to construct a common background for fiction. Sometimes the author publishes a timeline of events in the history, while other times the reader can reconstruct the order of the stories from information provided therein.

Canfield is renowned for developing the Canfield Ocean hypothesis, which postulates that the mid-Proterozoic ocean (1.8 to 0.8 billion years ago) was rich in hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which would change our understanding of Earth's early environment and its habitability.

It is a highly regarded source of scientific information and often publishes groundbreaking studies that significantly impact our understanding of the world. If we consider that Canfield has published an article in \\"Science,\\" it likely means that he's made a significant contribution to our understanding of the Earth's past environments. Although without specific details on the article, it's hard to elaborate more on the content, typical themes might include the analysis of certain rock formations or sedimentary layers, the discovery and interpretation of new or unique physical or chemical signatures in rocks, or the proposal of new hypotheses or theories that better explain Earth's environmental history. The name \\"Danmarks Grundforskningsfond\\" refers to the Danish National Research Foundation, an organization that supports scientific research in Denmark. It is known for its long-term funding of centers of excellence. If mentioned in relation with Canfield's publication, it might indicate that this foundation funded the work or the research center that Canfield is part of. Together, the fact that Canfield is publishing in Science journal, and that the Danish National Research Foundation is mentioned, suggests a high level of support and recognition for this research work in the field of Earth's evolution. In conclusion, without access to the actual article, it's not possible to elaborate on the specific contribution Canfield has made in his most recent publication. However, given his track record and his affiliation with the respected Nordic Center for Earth Evolution, it's safe to say it likely offers considerable insights into our ongoing quest to unravel the secrets of Earth's early environment and how it influenced the emergence and evolution of life."},{"prompt":"Q: Wind is one method for dispersal of what, ensuring a new generation?

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: When you don’t like someone you work with, you might be forced to interact with them more than you like; however, whenever you have an ability to influence your situation, try to avoid working directly with them. This might be an active choice that you are able to make or a request you may have to put forward in order to create a better working situation for yourself. If you get to choose what projects you work on at work or what groups you are in at school, actively choose an option that doesn’t involve the person you don’t like. If you are placed on a team with someone you dislike, you might consider respectfully asking your boss to move you to another team. But make sure you keep your focus on your work/productivity, not just on your personal feelings. Try saying something like, “I think I could be much more productive if you would consider placing me on a team with Sam instead. We have already proven to be an effective team when working together.” While it is true that socially you aren’t obligated to have long conversations with anyone you don’t want to, sometimes this isn’t the case at work or school. You may be required to interact with people you don’t like in a professional setting. In cases like these, keep conversations as brief as possible. Don’t engage in small talk or ask questions about the person’s personal life. To end a conversation gracefully, have an exit line ready. Try saying, “I’ve got a lot of work to do, so I don’t have time to talk right now.” When possible, choose to correspond via email or over the phone rather than face-to-face. One way to avoid people you don’t like is by being proactive about knowing where that person will be at certain times. Figure out what their schedule is and adjust yours so that you will cross paths as little as possible. Before you start rearranging your life to avoid someone, take some time to evaluate what is important to you. Is it worth it to rearrange your schedule just to avoid this person? If you cherish every last second of sleep in the morning, ask yourself if it's worth sacrificing that time to go in early just to avoid someone annoying. Think about if there is a respectful way you can assertively deal with the person that doesn't require you to alter your entire schedule. Start coming in to work a little early so you can finish your day a little bit earlier if it will help you avoid them. Try to find out what classes they are taking and choose different classes. If you are encountering someone you don’t like during activities at school, you might want to try some different activities so that you can avoid this person without causing a scene. This is a respectful way to remove yourself from the situation without making it obvious that you dislike the person. This may be a good idea if you are already looking to branch out and try other things, but before you stop your activity, you need to consider what you are giving up to avoid this person. Are you willing to sacrifice a hobby or activity you really enjoy? If you start avoiding all the things that you enjoy in life to get away from a temporary discomfort/dislike, you may end up creating a life that is unfulfilling. Carefully consider what is worth giving up just to avoid this person. Consider taking a more assertive approach rather than avoidance. If you are in the same yoga class and you want to avoid the person, try going to Pilates instead. If you both go to the same trivia night at the local bar, try trivia night at a different spot. If you are both rushing for the same sorority or fraternity, consider joining a different one. One reason you keep encountering a person you dislike could be because you hang out with the same people. If this is the case, consider expanding your social circle to include new people so that you at least have an outlet away from the person that you don’t like. If you are in the same study group, try to expand your social circle and find a new study group to join. Summary:","completion":"To handle situations where you don't like someone at work or school, try to avoid working directly with them when possible by actively choosing projects or groups that don't involve them. If placed on a team with the person, consider respectfully requesting a change. Maintain your focus on work and productivity, keeping conversations brief and using alternative communication methods like email. Be proactive about knowing the person's schedule and adjusting yours to minimize interaction, but carefully evaluate what is worth giving up to avoid them.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 90*k - 576 = 466 - 232 for k.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this step by step: 1. First, let's simplify the equation by combining the numbers on the right side of the equation. 90*k - 576 = 466 - 232 90*k - 576 = 234 2. Now, we want to find the value of k. In order to do that, we need to get k all by itself on one side of the equation. 3. Let's add 576 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -576. 90*k - 576 + 576 = 234 + 576 90*k = 810 4. Finally, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 90 to find the value of k. 90*k / 90 = 810 / 90 k = 9 So, after solving the equation step by step, we find that the value of k is 9."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who bought a series of lots in the area on Peter Brooks' behalf? ? The Monadnock was commissioned by Boston real estate developers Peter and Shepherd Brooks in the building boom following the Depression of 1873–79. The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission. Burnham and Root would become the architects of choice for the Brooks family, for whom they would complete the first high-rise building in Chicago, the 10-story Montauk Building, in 1883, and the 11-story Rookery Building in 1888. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 had destroyed a 4-mile (6.4 km) by 0.5-mile (0.80 km) swath of the city between the Chicago River and Lake Michigan, and subsequent commercial development expanded into the area far south of the main business district along the river that would come to be known as \\"the Loop\\". Between 1881 and 1885, Aldis bought a series of lots in the area on Peter Brooks' behalf, including a 70-by-200-foot (21 by 61 m) site on the corner of Jackson and Dearborn streets. The location was remote, yet attractive for several reasons. The construction of the Chicago Board of Trade Building in 1885 had made nearby LaSalle Street the city's prime financial district, driving up property...

Fact 2: Folds are especially well defined in layered, or stratified rock. Given the two facts above, stratified rock forms what?","completion":"Given the two facts above, it can be concluded that stratified rock plays a significant role in the formation of various geological structures such as folds, specifically in the context of mountain building processes that led to the formation of the Himalayas. To provide a detailed analysis, let's define the key terms and the process that contributes to the formation of the Himalayan mountain range. Stratified rock, also known as sedimentary rock, is formed by the deposition of mineral and organic particles at the Earth's surface and within water bodies. Over time, these deposited materials accumulate in layers, forming distinct strata. The continuous deposition and compaction of materials, followed by cementation, causes the individual grains to bind together, ultimately resulting in a solidified, layered sedimentary rock. Folding, on the other hand, refers to the geological process that results in the deformation of the Earth's crust due to the compression and stresses generated by tectonic forces. When the forces acting on the stratified rock exceed the rock's strength, it undergoes deformation, and layers bend and fold. The Himalayan mountain range, an outcome of such geological processes, was formed due to the collision of the tectonic plates. The Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate converged approximately 50 million years ago, leading to rock folding. As the two plates pushed against each other, intense pressure caused the sedimentary layers to buckle, eventually creating numerous folds and thrust faults. Stratified rock, in particular, forms an essential component of the folding process because of its characteristics: 1. Layered structure - The distinct bedding planes of stratified rock allow the identification and analysis of individual layers, folding patterns, and the overall geometry of the fold. 2. Variable resistance - Different layers of sedimentary rock possess varying degrees of resistance to stress and compression. This results in some layers being more prone to deformation, which in turn contributes to the folding process. Thus, given the two facts above, together with the explanation of how stratified rock and folding play a role in mountain building processes, it can be concluded that stratified rock forms the complex and diverse geological features in the Earth's crust, particularly contributing to fold formation in immense mountain ranges like the Himalayas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If In an odd way, the more similar products become, the more telling the little differences among them end up being., can we conclude that \\"Now that products are virtually identical, prices have coalesced across the board.\\"?","completion":"While it is true that increasing similarity between products can lead to a highlighting of small differences among them, it is not reasonable to directly conclude that \\"Now that products are virtually identical, prices have coalesaled across the board.\\" Several factors give rise to this conclusion, and they can be examined through the lens of various aspects, including market dynamics, perceived quality and value, differentiation, competition, and consumer behavior. 1. Market dynamics: Market dynamics play a critical role in determining the prices of products. Factors such as supply and demand, production costs, economic conditions, and government regulations can all have significant impacts on a product's pricing. Even if products are virtually identical, these factors can still lead to differences in prices. 2. Perceived quality and value: Even if products are technically identical or very similar, the perceived quality and value may vary due to intangible factors. These factors may include the reputation of the brand, marketing efforts, product packaging, or other facets that contribute to the overall perception of a product. As a result, consumers may be willing to pay different prices based on these perceived differences. 3. Differentiation: While products may become more similar overall, product differentiation is still an essential strategy for companies looking to distinguish themselves in the market. Successful differentiation can lead to preferences among consumers even if there are only small differences in features or benefits. Differentiation can manifest itself in various ways, such as innovation, customer service, or accessibility, and as a result, can influence price disparities. 4. Competition: The level of competition in a particular market can contribute to variations in product prices. For instance, in markets where competition is fierce, companies might have a higher incentive to reduce prices in an effort to gain market share. Conversely, in industries with less competition, prices may not be as subject to these downward pressures, which can result in higher price variability. 5. Consumer behavior: The perceptions, preferences, and reactions of consumers to various products ultimately determine the success of pricing strategies. Different consumers may place different values on the subtle differences between similar products, resulting in varied levels of willingness to pay. Moreover, consumer behavior can be influenced by a variety of factors, including personal beliefs, cultural influences, and past experiences. In summary, while an increased level of similarity between products may emphasize the importance of small differences among them, it does not necessarily lead to a coalescence of prices across the board. Many factors, such as market dynamics, perceived quality and value, differentiation, competition, and consumer behavior, still contribute to the formation of varied pricing structures, even when products may appear virtually identical. It is important for businesses to consider these elements in their pricing strategies to ensure they continue to remain competitive and successful in their respective markets."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you ever notice the colors of your dreams? Do you dream in black and white or do you dream in yellow, red and green? New research suggests that the type of television you watched as a child has a great effect on the color of your dreams. While almost all people under 25 dream in color, thousands of people over 55, all of whom were brought up with black and white TV sets, often dream in monochrome . \\"It suggests there could be a critical period in our childhood when watching films has a big impact on the way dreams are formed\\", said Eva Murzyn, a psychology student at Dundee University in Britain who carried out the study. Research from 1915 through the 1950s suggested that the vast majority of dreams are in black and white. But the tide turned in the sixties, and later results suggested that up to 83 percent of dreams contain some color. Since this period also marked the transition between black-and-white film and TV and Technicolor ,an obvious explanation was that the media had been painting people's dreams. However, there weren't any firm conclusions. But now Miss Murzyn believes she has proven the link. She made a survey of more than 60 people, half of whom were over 55 and half of whom were under 25. She asked the volunteers to answer a questionnaire on the color of their dreams and their childhood exposure to film and TV. She then analyzed her own data. Only 4.4 percent of the under-25s' dreams were black and white. The over-55s who had had access to color TV and film during their childhood also reported a very low proportion of just 7.3 percent. But the over-55s who only had access to black-and -white media reported dreaming in black and white about a quarter of the time. Even though they would have spent only a few hours a day watching TV or films, their attention and emotion would have been heightened during this time, leaving a deeper imprint on their mind, Miss Murzyn told the New Scientist. \\"The crucial time is between three and ten when we all begin to have the ability to dream\\", she said.

Here is a hypothesis: The smell of cedar brought back fond memories. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To establish whether the hypothesis follows from the premise, it is essential to break down both statements and identify their key components. This will help to determine if the hypothesis is a valid conclusion derived from the premise. Premise: The smell of burning cedar brought back memories of a childhood long lost. Key Components: 1. Smell of burning cedar 2. Memories of a childhood long lost Hypothesis: The smell of cedar brought back fond memories. Key Components: 1. Smell of cedar 2. Fond memories Based on the key components of both the premise and the hypothesis, let's compare and contrast their elements. 1. Smell of burning cedar vs. Smell of cedar: The premise refers to the smell of \\"burning cedar,\\" whereas the hypothesis refers to the smell of \\"cedar\\" without mentioning the burning aspect. While it is highly plausible that the smells could be similar, they are not necessarily identical. Burning cedar has a distinct aroma compared to cedar in its unburnt form. 2. Memories of a childhood long lost vs. Fond memories: The premise states that the smell of burning cedar evokes memories of a \\"childhood long lost,\\" while the hypothesis refers to \\"fond memories.\\" It is important to note that \\"childhood long lost\\" does not inherently imply \\"fond\\" memories. A long-lost childhood could be comprised of various experiences, positive or negative. Therefore, it is a leap to automatically associate it with fond memories. Given the differences between the key components of the premise and the hypothesis, it is not possible to definitively conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. However, it is essential to mention that the given hypothesis could still hold some truth. When exposed to the smell of cedar, the individual might indeed recall fond memories. Nevertheless, this connection is not sufficiently established by the premise alone, as the premise does not explicitly state that the memories brought back are fond or that the specific smell of cedar (not burning cedar) is responsible for the recollection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: Take the long U.S. policy wobbles because it is always responding to the crisis du jour--the Cox report, WTO, the latest suppression of dissidents, etc. Hypothesis: US policy is constantly responding to the latest crisis. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. To understand the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let us first analyze them individually. Premise: The premise states that the U.S. policy wobbles because it is always responding to the crisis du jour (the crisis of the day). This includes specific examples of crises, such as the Cox report, WTO, and the latest suppression of dissidents. The term \\"wobbles\\" suggests that the U.S. policy is not consistent and is always shifting in response to these crises. Hypothesis: The hypothesis posits that US policy is constantly responding to the latest crisis, aligning with the premise's sentiment regarding the U.S. policy's lack of consistency. Connection between premise and hypothesis: Both the premise and hypothesis convey a similar idea – U.S. policy is reactive and consistently shifting in response to the most recent crisis. Consequently, the hypothesis can be considered as entailed by the premise. The premise discusses the U.S. policy's wavering nature due to the ongoing response to different crises, which has weakened its consistency and stability. Similarly, the hypothesis puts forth that U.S. policy's constant reaction to the latest crisis reinforces the premise. Furthermore, the examples provided in the premise, such as the Cox report, WTO, and the latest suppression of dissidents, illustrate specific instances of crises that the U.S. policy had to deal with. These examples further support the hypothesis that U.S. policy is continuously responding to the latest crisis. In conclusion, the hypothesis stating that US policy is constantly responding to the latest crisis aligns with and is entailed by the premise that U.S. policy wobbles due to its reactive nature and continuous response to the crisis du jour."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Apache Indians hid inside the wagons to gain access to the fort. General Blackwell is blamed for the incident and court-martialed. Denying that he sent any such order, the general has a stroke and dies on the witness stand. No written evidence of the order is presented. One of his sons, Rufe, a captain from West Point, travels west to find out what happened. His brother, Cash, reads of their father's death in a Kansas City newspaper and also heads toward Furnace Creek in search of answers. Using an alias, Cash learns that Capt. Walsh has become a drunkard. A mining boss, Leverett, is impressed by the stranger in town and hires him, not knowing Cash's real name or intent. Rufe arrives in town and also assumes a false identity. Cafe waitress Molly Baxter, whose father was killed at the fort, still considers General Blackwell the man to blame. But the real villain is Leverett, who bribed Walsh and organized the Apache raid. A guilty conscience causes Walsh to write a confession. Leverett sends one of his henchmen to do away with Walsh, but the confession is found by Cash. Rufe is framed, arrested and tried, but escapes.

Earlier a CDU activist urged Mrs Merkel to resign, condemning her \\"laissez-faire\\" refugee policy as \\"a burden that we will not get rid of any time soon\\". There was applause when the Afghan boy, called Edris, said in German: \\"I would like to thank you, Mrs Merkel\\". He was tearful when she shook his hand. The emotional moment was reminiscent of Mrs Merkel's controversial encounter with a tearful Palestinian girl, whom she comforted on German TV in July 2015. The girl, Reem, feared deportation to a camp in Lebanon. Last year, 890,000 asylum seekers arrived in Germany - an unprecedented influx. And in January-October this year the German authorities received 693,758 asylum requests. The largest groups in January-October were: Syrians (38%), Afghans (18%) and Iraqis (13.5%), the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) reported. Many can settle in Germany as refugees fleeing war and persecution. But the influx has put pressure on housing and the welfare system. The crisis also triggered criticism of Mrs Merkel, including within CDU ranks. The nationalist, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) is now a serious rival to the CDU in some regions. Mrs Merkel plans to run for a fourth term as chancellor in elections next year. She insists that Germany has a humanitarian and historic duty to help refugees. There were boos when a veteran CDU member, Ulrich Sauer, told a regional CDU conference in the western city of Heidelberg: \\"Madame Chancellor, step down. \\"With your truly unparalleled 'laissez-faire' refugee policy you have burdened us with something that we will not get rid of any time soon.\\" The mood changed when Konrad Reuter, a retired teacher who helps refugees, introduced Edris and the boy's proud father. Edris was lifted up to say \\"thank you, Mrs Merkel\\" on a big video screen, drawing applause. \\"I am very, very happy,\\" the boy said. On the podium Mrs Merkel, smiling broadly, told him: \\"Okay, you learned a lot of German already. Do you sometimes speak German?\\" Edris said: \\"I only speak [German] to my dad.\\" Mrs Merkel replied: \\"You speak German to your dad? That's pretty good already. Is your mum here too? No, oh well then keep on practising.\\" Edris was heard saying \\"I wanted to touch your hands once\\" - prompting Mrs Merkel to go over to the side of the hall, where she met Edris and his father. Edris wiped away tears as she shook his hand, surrounded by photographers.

Many CDU activists have demanded her resignation, considering the policy a \\"laissez-faire\\" approach, and arguing that it will negatively impact Germany in the long-term. The surge of asylum seekers arriving in Germany has also intensified the pressure on housing and welfare systems. Furthermore, the article notes that the nationalist, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) has become a rival to the CDU in certain regions.

On 6 June, Philip had announced his renunciation of the French throne; the British Tory government now offered the Dutch a revised Barrier Treaty, replacing that of 1709 which they rejected as overly generous. It was a significant improvement on the 1697 Barrier but ultimately subject to Austrian approval and the final terms were less beneficial.Charles withdrew from the Conference when France insisted on a guarantee that Austria would not seek to acquire Mantua or Mirandola; he was supported by George, Elector of Hanover, who wanted France to withdraw their support for the Stuart heir James Francis. This meant neither Austria or the Empire signed the Treaty of Utrecht of 11 April 1713 between France and the other Allies; Spain made peace with the Dutch in June, then Savoy and Britain on 13 July 1713. Fighting continued on the Rhine but Austria was financially exhausted and after the loss of Landau and Freiburg in November 1713, Charles came to terms. The Treaty of Rastatt on 7 March 1714 confirmed Austria's gains in Italy, returned Breisach, Kehl and Freiburg, ended French support for the Hungarian revolt and terms for the Dutch Barrier fortresses. France acquired Strasbourg and Alsace while Charles agreed to reinstate the Wittelsbach Electors of Bavaria and Cologne, Max Emmanuel and Joseph Clemens. On 7 September, the Holy Roman Empire joined the agreement by the Treaty of Baden; although Catalonia and Majorca were not finally subdued by the Bourbons until June 1715, the war was over.

Q: Objective: To evaluate the scientific basis for the use of Kang 601 heji (K-601) as an anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agent using appropriate animal models. Methods: Carrageenan-induced rat paw and xylene-induced ear oedemas were models used to investigate anti-inflammatory actions of K-601. Lipopolysaccharide-induced pyrexia model was used to evaluate antipyretic activity in Wistar rats. The antiinflammatory and antipyretic mechanisms were evaluated by detecting prostaglandins E 2 , nitric oxide, interleukin-1b and tumour necrosis factor-a levels using appropriate reagents and ELISA kits. Results: The results revealed that K-601 reduced the level of inflammations in both antiinflammatory models in a dose-dependent manner. The same was true for the antipyretic model. The possible mechanisms of actions were through the inhibition of prostaglandins E 2 , interleukin-1b, tumour necrosis factor-a and nitric oxide. Conclusions: K-601 has proven anti-inflammatory and antipyretic actions. The findings provide a scientific basis for the use of K-601 as anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agent in traditional Chinese medicinal practice.

These were Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. The youngest sister, Anne, was also a gifted novelist, and her books have the same extraordinary quality as her sisters'. Their father was Patrick Bronte, born in Ireland. He moved with his wife, Maria Bronte, and their six small children to Haworth in Yorkshire in 1820. Soon after, Mrs. Bronte and the two eldest children died, leaving the father to care of the remaining three girls and a boy. Charlotte was born in 1816. Emily was born in 1818 and Anne in 1820. Their brother Branwell was born in 1817. Left to themselves, the children wrote and told stories and walked over the hills. They grew up largely self-educated. Branwell showed a great interest in drawing. The girls were determined to earn money for his art education. They took positions as teachers or taught children in their homes. As children they had all written many stories. Charlotte, as a young girl, alone wrote 22 books, each with 60 to 100 pages of small handwriting. Therefore, they turned to writing for income. By 1847, Charlotte had written The Professor; Emily, Wuthering Heights; and Anne, Agnes Grey. After much difficulty Anne and Emily found a publisher , but there was no interest shown in Charlotte's book. (It was not published until 1859.) However, one publisher expressed an interest in seeing more of her works. Jane Eyre was already started, and she hurriedly finished it. It was accepted at once; thus each of the sisters had a book published in 1847. Jane Eyre was immediately successful; the other two, however, did not do so well. People did not like Wuthering Heights. They said it was too wild, too animal-like. But gradually it came to be considered one of the finest novels in the English language. Emily lived only a short while after the publication of the book, and Anne died in 1849. Charlotte published Shirley in 1849, and Villette in 1853. In 1854 she married Arthur Bell Nicholls. But only a year later, she died of tuberculosis as her sisters had. Answer: Jane Eyre was published in 1847","completion":"Question: In what year was Charlotte Bronte's novel, Jane Eyre, published?

Insert sticky side of post it notes in between keys.; B). Insert dry side of post it notes in between keys.;","completion":"To determine the best solution for the goal of cleaning keyboard keys, let's analyze the options step-by-step: 1. Assess effectiveness: The primary goal of cleaning keyboard keys is to remove dust, debris, and any residue from their surfaces. The sticky side of post-it notes may be more effective at grabbing and holding onto the dust and debris between keys, while the dry side would likely only push the dirt around or temporarily trap it before it falls back onto the keyboard. 2. Assess potential harm: Neither option presents a significant risk to the keyboard or the user. However, using the sticky side might be slightly more likely to leave behind a residue, which could attract more dirt in the long run. Considering these factors, option A (inserting the sticky side of post-it notes in between keys) seems initially more effective in achieving the goal of cleaning keyboard keys. Despite the potential risk of residue, it is more likely to remove dust and debris compared to option B. However, it should be noted that this method may not be the best or most thorough way to clean a keyboard, and other methods (such as using a compressed air duster) might yield better results overall."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Typically, all member universities in a university system share a common component among all of their various names. Usually, all member universities of a university system are governed by a system-wide governing body, such as a board of trustees or a board of regents. In fact, university systems are so common in post-World War II United States that most states have one or two state university systems under which many of their publicly funded universities are aligned, both in name and in governance. Additionally, for-profit universities, such as DeVry University, often have multiple campuses which share the same name; these may be, but are not always, described as a university system (not necessarily accurately, see below). - The University of the Philippines Manila (also referred to as UPM or UP Manila) is a coeducational and public research university in the Philippines. Located in Manila, the country's capital city, it is the oldest of the seven constituent universities of the University of the Philippines system.

Step 1: Assess the situation Sandra decided to assess the situation carefully. She measured the air purifier's dimensions and the doorway's width. The air purifier was 36 inches wide, while the doorway was only 32 inches. That left her with a 4-inch difference that she needed to overcome.

She considered disassembling the air purifier, but she wasn't sure if she could put it back together correctly.

She made sure all the connectors were secure and the screws were tightened properly. Step 7: Test the air purifier With the air purifier reassembled, Sandra plugged it in and turned it on to make sure it was functioning correctly. She was relieved to see that the appliance was working perfectly, and the LED indicator showed that the air quality in the living room was rapidly improving.

This house would make physical education compulsory What argument could one make about this debate topic?","completion":"In the debate surrounding whether physical education should be made compulsory or not, there are various arguments that present a strong case for implementing it as a mandatory component within the educational system. One such argument can be founded on the basis of the numerous and significant benefits that physical education offers for the overall wellbeing and development of students. 1. Health Benefits: In a world where an increasing number of people are leading sedentary lifestyles, obesity and other health issues are becoming persistent concerns. Introducing compulsory physical education helps students engage in regular physical activity, consequently lowering the risk of obesity, diabetes, heart diseases, and other lifestyle-related issues. Moreover, fostering active and healthy habits from an early age can lead to a lifelong commitment to a healthier lifestyle. 2. Academic Achievements: Research has shown that regular physical activity can lead to better academic performance and cognitive development in students. Engaging in physical exercise can help students improve their concentration, memory, and overall focus, thus aiding them in their academic pursuits. Ensuring compulsory physical education can result in students attaining better grades and being more prepared for higher education and career options. 3. Emotional Wellbeing: Physical activity is known to have a positive impact on mental health, including reducing stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression. By making physical education compulsory, students will have a designated time to engage in activities that can enhance their emotional wellbeing, thereby alleviating the strain caused by academic pressure and daily stressors. 4. Social Skills Development: Participating in team sports and group activities within physical education classes promotes a sense of belonging and allows students to develop crucial social skills. They learn the importance of teamwork, communication, and sportsmanship, which are essential for maintaining healthy relationships and leading successful lives in the future. 5. Personal Growth and Discipline: Engaging in regular physical activity encourages students to set personal goals, persevere through challenges, and develop a sense of discipline. These skills can be easily transferred to other areas of their lives, such as study habits and work ethic, fostering well-rounded individuals who possess the determination to achieve their objectives. 6. Inclusivity and Adaptation: Compulsory Physical Education programs can be tailored to incorporate students of all physical abilities and needs, ensuring that no one is left behind. This approach encourages inclusivity, fosters a supportive atmosphere, and helps students understand the importance of respecting the diverse needs and abilities of others. 7. Lifelong Enjoyment of Physical Activity and Sports: By participating in a variety of sports and activities in a supportive and positive environment, students can discover their interests and develop a lifelong appreciation for physical activity. This, in turn, can lead to a healthier and more active adult population that continues to engage in fitness-related activities throughout their lives. In conclusion, making physical education compulsory can contribute significantly to the overall health, growth, and personal development of students, along with fostering essential skills and habits that will support them throughout their lives. It is crucial for educational policymakers to recognize the importance of incorporating physical education as a mandatory component to nurture well-rounded, successful individuals who lead fulfilling, healthy lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the woman shows her audience how to initiate the haircut, she is meticulous about preparing the hair for the next steps. First, she ensures that the hair is clean and free from tangles by thoroughly washing the hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner. She pats the hair dry with a soft towel, leaving it slightly damp which helps in the cutting process. The woman proceeds to use a wide-toothed comb so that the hair separates evenly without any snags or tangles. With the hair successfully prepped, the woman carefully sections the hair into manageable parts, utilizing hair clips or ties to maintain a neat workspace. She starts with the hair at the nape of the neck, the thickest point, as that will be an essential guide throughout the haircut. The woman then demonstrates the safe handling and proper grip of the hair-cutting scissors, advising her audience to invest in a quality pair for precise cuts.

How do you do this: Fix damage to hair caused by exposure to chlorine in swimming pools.","completion":"Fixing damage to hair caused by exposure to chlorine in swimming pools can be achieved by following a comprehensive hair care routine that focuses on preventing further damage, repairing existing damage, and maintaining overall hair health. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you restore your hair's vitality after exposure to chlorine. 1. Rinse your hair immediately after swimming: After you've finished swimming, it's important to thoroughly rinse your hair with clean, fresh water to remove as much chlorine as possible. This helps prevent further damage by minimizing the time your hair is in contact with the harsh chemicals found in the pool. 2. Use a clarifying shampoo: Washing your hair with a clarifying shampoo specifically designed to remove chlorine and other chemical residues can help further minimize the damage. You may want to look for a shampoo containing sodium thiosulfate, a powerful dechlorinator, to remove chlorine effectively. Use the clarifying shampoo at least once a week, or more often if you swim frequently. 3. Apply a deep conditioner: Chlorine can strip your hair of its natural oils, leaving it dry and brittle. To help combat this, apply a deep conditioner to your hair, focusing on the ends, after washing it with the clarifying shampoo. Look for conditioners with ingredients like coconut oil, olive oil, or shea butter to help restore moisture and nourish your hair. Leave the conditioner in for a minimum of 20-30 minutes (or as instructed on the product) before rinsing it out thoroughly. 4. Use a leave-in conditioner: A leave-in conditioner can provide additional protection by forming a barrier between your hair and pool water. It helps to restore moisture and improve hair manageability. Apply a small amount of the leave-in conditioner to your towel-dried hair, focusing on the mid-lengths to ends. Do not rinse out. 5. Avoid heat styling: Heat styling tools like hair dryers, straighteners, and curling irons can worsen the damage caused by chlorine exposure. To minimize further damage, let your hair air dry whenever possible, and limit the use of heat styling tools. 6. Get regular trims: Regularly trimming your hair can help prevent split ends and remove damaged sections of your hair. Try to get a trim every 6-8 weeks to keep your hair in good condition. 7. Use a swim cap: To prevent chlorine damage in the future, wear a swim cap while swimming. Although a swim cap might not keep your hair completely dry, it will significantly reduce chlorine exposure. 8. Pre-treat your hair: Before getting into the pool, wet your hair with clean water and apply a small amount of conditioner. This will help create a barrier against chlorine absorption, and help minimize damage. 9. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water keeps your entire body, including your hair, hydrated. Dehydration can contribute to dry, brittle hair, compounding the effects of chlorine exposure. Aim to drink about 8-10 glasses of water per day, depending on your activity level and individual needs. 10. Maintain a healthy diet: Nourish your hair from within by eating a well-balanced diet including lean proteins, healthy fats, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. This will supply your hair with the nutrients it needs for optimal health and growth. Consider taking biotin or a hair, skin, and nails supplement to further support hair health. By following these steps, you can help repair and prevent further damage to your hair caused by exposure to chlorine in swimming pools, restoring its health and shine. Stay consistent with your hair care routine, and in time your hair should look and feel much better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

She was my second-grade teacher, and I was going to marry her when I grew up. I would sit in my seat for the entire morning. I wouldn't miss one moment for her presence by leaving the room. My hand was always the first to be raised when Miss Benson called for volunteers to clean the blackboards or gather papers. I would arrange and rearrange the papers. They had to be in perfect order before I went back to my seat unwillingly. Early in the term, I started asking my mother to put an extra apple or peach in my lunch, but I never quite worked up the courage to hand my gift to her directly. Each day the delicacy found its way unobserved to the corner of her desk. And each day the response was the same. ''Why, how nice! '' She would pick up the offering and asked: ''What thoughtful little boy or girl brought me this? '' No one claimed the honor, least of all me. I kept my head down, looking at my desk. ''Can it be that I have a secret admirer? '' she added. I would feel the red rising in my face. I was certain that everyone was looking at me, and I would sigh with relief when Miss Benson put the fruit away and started the lesson. Friday was Miss Benson's birthday. Everyone wanted to get her a present. I would give her something, openly. That afternoon was spent combing the fields for wild flowers. Not many were in bloom at that time of year, but finally I managed a patch of beautiful flowers... In the morning I went to the desk and gave the beautiful flowers to Miss Benson. She accepted them happily and held them to her cheek for a moment. My reward was a smile and a pat on the head. The next Monday, Miss Benson was not in class.

Question: How do affirmative action programs disincentivize poor white people to work harder? Context: Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147 Answer:","completion":"According to libertarian economist Thomas Sowell, affirmative action programs may disincentivize poor white people in several ways. These programs, as described by Sowell, tend to benefit mostly the fortunate among the preferred groups, such as upper and middle-class blacks. This can result in disadvantages for the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups, including poor whites or Asians. Furthermore, affirmative action reduces the incentives for both preferred and non-preferred groups to perform at their best. The preferred because they may not feel the need to work hard due to the benefits received, while the non-preferred because their effort can prove futile in the face of group preference policies. This, Sowell suggests, results in net losses for society as a whole. Lastly, these programs can engender animosity toward preferred groups."},{"prompt":"Given the question: I'm Kate.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. I will provide detailed answers for both questions. Question 1: What are the latest women rights regarding divorce? Women's rights in divorce have evolved significantly over time and can vary depending on the country or jurisdiction. In general, there has been a shift towards a more equitable distribution of assets and child custody rights, as well as a focus on women's economic independence. To understand the latest women rights in divorce, it's important to look at different aspects: 1. Asset Distribution: Marital assets are now typically distributed more equally between spouses. In some countries and states, the principle of community property applies, meaning that any assets, property, or income acquired during the marriage are divided equally upon divorce. In others, there is a principle of equitable distribution, where the division of assets is based on fairness and need rather than strict equality. 2. Alimony/Spousal Support: In many cases, women may be entitled to alimony or spousal support after a divorce. This financial support can allow women to maintain their standard of living, especially if they have been out of the workforce for an extended period, to care for children. The amount and duration of alimony payments can depend on factors such as the length of the marriage, each spouse's income and earning capacity, and whether the recipient spouse can eventually become financially self-sufficient. 3. Child Custody and Support: Women's rights regarding child custody have also become more balanced in recent years. Whereas mothers were traditionally awarded primary physical custody, many countries now uphold the concept of shared parenting, where both parents are granted equal parental rights and responsibilities. Child support payments often depend on factors such as the incomes of both parents, the number of children, and the time each parent spends with the children. 4. Legal Representation: Women have the right to legal representation in divorce proceedings. It is crucial to have a knowledgeable attorney by one's side to help navigate the complexities of divorce law and ensure that a fair and equitable settlement is reached. Question 2: What are the most touching quotes on Women's rights? Many quotes touch on the importance of women's rights and the ongoing struggle for gender equality. Here are some notable quotes: 1. 'There is no limit to what we, as women, can accomplish.' - Michelle Obama 2. 'The education and empowerment of women throughout the world cannot fail to result in a more caring, tolerant, just and peaceful life for all.' - Aung San Suu Kyi 3. 'Freedom cannot be achieved unless the women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression.' - Nelson Mandela 4. 'Human rights are women's rights, and women's rights are human rights.' - Hillary Clinton 5. 'Here's to strong women: May we know them, may we be them, may we raise them.' - Unknown 6. 'To all the little girls watching: Never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your dreams.' - Hillary Clinton 7. 'Women belong in all places where decisions are being made. It shouldn't be that women are the exception.' - Ruth Bader Ginsburg 8. 'The future depends entirely on what each of us does every day; a movement is only people moving.' - Gloria Steinem These quotes emphasize the importance of women's rights, gender equality, and female empowerment. They serve as a reminder that progress has been made, but the struggle for women to achieve true equality and equal opportunities in all aspects of life is still ongoing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Charles Campbell, 64, is representing Todd 'MJ' Schnitt who is suing Bubba 'The Love Sponge' Clem for comments he made about him and his wife. Campbell arrested 'after young paralegal for Clem's side bought him drinks' Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Charles Campbell, Attorney Representing Todd Schnitt, Arrested After Paralegal Buys Him Drinks Introduction: Prominent attorney Charles Campbell, 64, who is representing radio personality Todd \\"MJ\\" Schnitt in a high-profile lawsuit against Bubba \\"The Love Sponge\\" Clem, was recently arrested in an unusual incident involving a young paralegal from the opposing side. Background (step 1: provide context for the lawsuit): Campbell is representing Schnitt in a defamation suit against Clem, a controversial radio host known as Bubba \\"The Love Sponge\\"\\". The lawsuit stems from disparaging comments Clem made on-air about Schnitt and his wife, which Schnitt claims have caused significant damage to both his and his wife's reputations. Incident (step 2: describe the incident leading to Campbell's arrest): According to reports, Campbell was arrested after the young paralegal, who works for Clem's legal team, allegedly purchased several drinks for him at a local bar. While the exact circumstances of the arrest have not been made public, it has raised questions about the ethical implications of the encounter between the legal professionals from opposing parties. Debate (step 3: discuss the ethical issues surrounding the arrest): Campbell's arrest has led to a heated debate among legal professionals and the public alike, with some arguing that the paralegal's actions may constitute an ethical breach. Given her connection to Clem's legal team, it has been suggested that her purchasing drinks for Campbell could be an attempt to compromise his ability to effectively represent his client. Others, however, have come to the defense of both Campbell and the paralegal, arguing that the incident may be entirely innocuous. These individuals maintain that it is not uncommon for legal professionals to socialize outside of the courtroom and that there may be no malicious intent behind the paralegal's actions. Impact (step 4: consider the potential impact on the case): Regardless of the motive behind the encounter, it remains uncertain how Campbell's arrest may impact the ongoing defamation suit. With tensions already high in this high-stakes legal battle, this latest development could either delay the proceedings or potentially cause further complications in an already heated case. Conclusion (step 5: wrap up the article): As new details emerge surrounding the circumstances of Campbell's arrest, it will be interesting to see how this situation develops and what consequences may arise for both legal teams. Until then, observers of the case are left to speculate on the potential implications of this unexpected turn of events in the highly publicized lawsuit between radio personalities Todd \\"MJ\\" Schnitt and Bubba \\"The Love Sponge\\" Clem."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice, and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age. The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November. One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them. Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fiancée Astrid Kirchherr, who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.During the next two years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used Preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances.

Article: Dieters' who eat meals high in protein might lose a bit more weight than those who get less protein and more carbohydrates all other things being equal, a new analysis of past studies suggests. Researchers found that over an average of 12 weeks, people having a highprotein diet lost about 1.8 extra pounds, and more body fat, than those having a standard-protein diet. Wycherley from the University of South\\" Australia in Adelaide, the lead author on the study says it's possible that the body may spend more energy and bum more calories while dealing with protein, compared to carbohydrates. Another explanation for the link his team observed is that eating protein helps preserve muscle mass and muscle mass bums more calories, even when the body is resting, than other types of mass. He says people in the studies tend to get protein from a variety of animal and vegetable sources. Vegetable sources of protein include beans. It is not obvious why a higher protein-to-carbohydrate ratio might help people lose more pounds----and one obesity researcher not involved in the new analysis questioned whether the trials were strong enough to make that conclusion. \\"The studies are generally far too short to tell effect,\\" Dr. James Levine from the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, told Reuters Health in an e-mail. But given the limitations of the present evidence, Levine said, \\"It makes no real difference which of the weight-loss ways one chooses.\\" Question: What can we learn from the studies?
