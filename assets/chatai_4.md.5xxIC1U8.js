Explain your reasoning. LOCAL Clothes in hamper smell good enough 1 DAY AGO by H. CLAIR ( @ ) Photo Credit REGINA – Part-time barista Melanie Ericsson has reportedly expressed relief after realizing she had no clean clothes but, fortunately, discovered that those in her hamper had a pleasant-enough odour that she could wear them to an important engagement. “I’ve had a pretty busy month, what with working, studying, gaming and napping, and I guess I never really found a moment to dump my clothes basket into the washing machine,” added Ericsson, sniffing her collar. “The next thing I know, I get a call asking if I could come in for an interview at a pretty prestigious law firm, and all I have left in my closet are a flannel tracksuit, a pair of shorts I borrowed from my brother, and a BTS concert shirt that had a weird stain from the time I tried mixing a daiquiri with the stuff inside a glow stick”. While positing that others might panic, Ericsson stated that she has a “tried-and-true” process to mitigate such wardrobe emergencies. “The first thing you want to do is immerse your hand into the fabric-pile and identify what I like to call ‘the dry zone’ and isolate those clothes from the rest”. She continued, “Next up is taking a proper inventory of what kind of smell-profile we’re dealing with”, adding that “it was important that whatever blouse I chose had some residual deodorant scent, as a kind of safety-net”. Ericsson noted that it is similarly critical to properly coordinate odours. “In this case, my top also preserved a hint of my daily cinnamon bagel. So, in addition to assuring they were at least 50% wrinkle-free, I made a point to grab a pair of slacks that carried a nice bouquet of Kraft Dinner”. “You see, while both pieces smelled, they were matching smells, bread and cheese pair well together. A combative aroma palette is a real faux-pas”.","completion":"This news article is humorous. It is an exaggerated account of an experience that many people may relate to, re-wearing a clothing item from the hamper, and taking it to a more extreme level where the subject is wearing these clothes to a job interview at a prestigious law firm. It also uses satire by including gaming and napping as activities in the subject's \\"busy month\\". Lastly, the unexpected and absurd goal of creating complimentary smells between the dirty clothing items worn contributes to the comedic tone."},{"prompt":"Hi! I want to tinker with MongoDB.

Give a short description of their attributes and the attire they wear. Give an example of each in a different video game.","completion":"No problem, here are three class archetypes in RPGs! 1. Warrior - Warriors are possibly the most used class in RPGs. It is often known as the default choice and the warrior is typically known for their strength and ability to wield a sword. The warrior normally dons armor made out of some form of metal and also wields a sword and sometimes a shield. They have a muscular build compared to other members of the party and sometimes their opponents. They are not the most clever but can certainly get the job done, most of the time with brute force. Edelgard from Fire Emblem Three Houses is a more recent example of the Warrior class. 2. Mage - Mages are probably the 2nd most common class. They typically wield a stave, staff, or some wand-type object but can also sometimes wield different weapons such as a hammer or knives. Their armor is typically a cloak and their defense is oftentimes weaker than other characters. Their magic is often consumable and can run out so they will either need to rest at an inn or use an ether to restore their MP. Black mages typically use offensive magic against their opponents such as fire or lightning while white mages use healing magic like Cure and can also heal status ailments such as poison. Vivi in Final Fantasy IX is one of the most iconic characters in the RPG genre. 3. Thief - Thieves are most well-known for their speed as well as their ability to steal. This is typically a command that they will have from the moment they join your party. They are normally a more slender build and typically wield knives. They wear cloaks, sometimes with hoods and often prefer to hide and may also want to hide their identity. They are known much more for their support abilities than being able to attack like a Warrior, for instance. In certain games, thieves can steal very rare pieces of equipment from bosses or difficult enemies. Thieves have also been known to poison their enemies. Therion in Octopath Traveler 1 is an example of a thief. He can steal from enemies while you're in towns, which can be very helpful."},{"prompt":"Sum this up in a sentence.

Image credit: ChameleonsEye/Shutterstock.com Australian Aboriginal men play Aboriginal music on didgeridoo and wooden instrument during Aboriginal culture show in Queensland, Australia. Image credit: ChameleonsEye/Shutterstock.com The indigenous peoples of Australia were the inhabitants of mainland Australia and its islands before the arrival of European colonizers. It is generally believed that they originally came from Southeast Asia during a time when sea levels were low and land bridges more extensive. Research indicates that they are the oldest civilization on earth. The earliest human remains can be traced back approximately 50,000 years; however, inconclusive data suggests they might have been around as far back as 80,000 years ago. Australia’s indigenous peoples were hunter-gatherers, and even though they were nomadic, they had strong ties to specific areas of land they might have considered home. Once the Europeans arrived, they occupied the entire continent and spoke more than 200 different languages. Since then, they have endured immense persecution and have experienced the erasure of much of their culture and traditions.","completion":"The indigenous people of Australia are the oldest civilization and lived nomadic hunter-gatherer lives before Europeans came and persecuted them."},{"prompt":"Write a diary entry by Susan Lucci on the night she finally won an Emmy in 1999.

She points out that this slow-cooker-made recipe is higher in protein, with about 50% dry matter, and lower in fat, with about 10% dry matter than you'd find in most recipes. She adds that, since every pet has very specific needs, you should only use this recipe as a starting point, then talk things over with your pet's doctor for more specifics suited to them. The ingredients you will need are: * 3/4ths minimum to 1 pound maximum of cubed, skinless, boneless chicken breasts or thighs. (Substitute with lean beef, turkey, or fish if necessary or preferred) * 1 ounce minimum to 3 ounces maximum of preferably chicken liver, hearts, or gizzards. Other animal livers are acceptable. * If this meal accounts for more than 10% of a dog's daily diet, include 1 tablespoon of bone meal (or 1,500 mg) per pound of meat * 1 to 2 whole eggs for a healthy source of fat * 8 ounces of brown or white rice * 16 ounces of green beans * Water Take your slow cooker and add in the diced chicken, the chicken liver, gizzards, and hearts, along with the eggs. You will then add the bone meal, rice, and green beans. Denser ingredients should be at the bottom, with the lightest ingredients on top. Since the amount of water you'll need to use depends on how long you choose to cook the ingredients and how big your slow cooker is, there isn't a specific amount you need to add. Try to fill the cooker to about two-thirds of the way full, but not less than halfway, and if possible, use a six-or-seven quart cooker. When you add in the water, you should try to submerge the ingredients without fully covering them. Then, stir the contents. Put on the lid and set the temperature to low. Leave your crockpot on for around 4 to 8 hours, only as long as needed for the chicken breasts to fall apart. As it's cooking, you can stir and add water to make the stew moister or drier, but keep in mind that you can lose up to 20 to 30 minutes of cooking time if the lid is removed."},{"prompt":"How many astronauts were on the first spaceship that landed men on the moon in 1969?

Source Text: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will cease tracking community levels of Covid and the percentage of tests that come back positive, a metric used to calculate transmission rates, the agency announced on Friday. The decision is linked to the end of the public health emergency on May 11. The emergency designation, first declared in January 2020, had allowed the C.D.C. to demand certain kinds of data on Covid’s spread from state officials. To track death rates, agency officials now will rely on the National Vital Statistics System, which is highly accurate but tends to lag behind other kinds of surveillance by two to three weeks. The C.D.C. is also scaling back the data that hospitals are required to report, including the number of cases and the race, sex and age of patients. But the agency will continue to track overall Covid hospitalizations and intensive care admissions. The agency will still have a clear picture of Covid trends, Dr. Nirav Shah, the agency’s principal deputy director, told reporters on Thursday. “We will still be able to tell that it’s snowing even though we’re no longer counting every snowflake,” he said.","completion":"The CDC will now rely on death rates from the National Vital Statistics and will no longer track COVID-19 community levels and positive test percentages.

Make it exactly 400 words.","completion":"It was not unlike yesterday for Finnegan. Nor would it be unlike the next day, he figured. The clouds were thick and low, spreading the same gray they always cast on the horizon where the Atlantic meets the sky. The two entities were similar, Finnegan believed: neither were as blue as the storybooks said they should be, and both seem endless. Finnegan’s boat thrust away from shore in search of amberjack fish. Finnegan’s boat was not big nor small, but it was large enough to carry his haul to the cannery and small enough to make a weaker man nervous about any storm. It would take much more than that to make Finnegan nervous, however. Reaching his fishing spot, dropped lures off the starboard side and prayed the decorative barnacles would not cut his lines today. Before making it back into the cabin to escape the rain, one of his rods began dancing violently. Controlling the wild vibrations and manning the reel, Finnegan fought with whatever was attached to the hook. It was big, he knew that. Winning the battle, Finnegan saw an amberjack with the brightest yellow stripe he had ever seen on the silver-bodied fish. Wrestling the fish aboard, it stopped fighting and seemed to stare directly into Finnegan’s eyes. Then, it spoke. Over the next few months, Finnegan kept the speaking fish secret from other fishermen. Unsure why he kept it to himself, maybe it was because he had little else to call his own. His boat was financed, and his catches had to be exchanged for a small shack he rented. The fish would learn things about Finnegan he thought would never be shared. As much as Finnegan wanted to hide the fish, the fish wanted to meet more people. Therefore, it was reluctantly agreed upon that Finnegan would bring the talking fish back to the docks. Reaching the docks, Finnegan gave a nervous nod to the fish and tied off the boat. Fishermen approached to see his daily catch. Everyone knew Finnegan to be a lonely man, but he was never one to talk to himself—although he was speaking. His peers realized he was communicating with a fish and, before Finnegan could react, he was restrained, and the fish was taken from him. Apparently, the fish could fetch a great prize on the market.

Thirty-two oil companies bid a total of 309.7 million for the license to drill in the region at the Department of the Interior’s auction, the Guardian reports.

According to the Biden administration, this auction is required by the terms of the recent Inflation Reduction Act, the Guardian reports. While the bill made strides in shifting the U.S. to more affordable and cleaner sources of energy, it included compromises with the oil industry. However, according to the Guardian, while Biden was required to allow some drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, he was not forced to sign over such a huge area. “If this continues, all of the good Biden has done for the future will be undone by Biden himself,” Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club, told the Guardian.","completion":"The Biden administration authorized the auction of lease 259 to oil companies for oil and gas drilling in March. Lease 259 is an Italy-sized portion of the Gulf of Mexico spanning from the southern tip of Texas to the Alabama-Florida border, which is expected to supply the company with the winning bid access to 1 billion barrels of oil and 4.4 trillion cubic feet of gas over the next 50 years. This move comes as part of a compromise made to pass Biden's recent Inflation Reduction Act, which otherwise is meant to shift the US to more affordable and cleaner sources of energy, and has been met with criticism from environmentalists."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this fundraising email so that it sounds very bored and apathetic in a way that doesn’t inspire confidence in the organization.

In addition to dietary recommendations for the general population, there are many specific diets that have primarily been developed to promote better health in specific population groups, such as people with high blood pressure (such as low sodium diets or the more specific DASH diet), or people who are overweight or obese (weight control diets). Some of them may have more or less evidence for beneficial effects in normal people as well.[citation needed] Hypertension A low sodium diet is beneficial for people with high blood pressure. A Cochrane review published in 2008 concluded that a long-term (more than four weeks) low sodium diet usefully lowers blood pressure, both in people with hypertension (high blood pressure) and in those with normal blood pressure.[30] The DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is a diet promoted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (part of the NIH, a United States government organization) to control hypertension. A major feature of the plan is limiting intake of sodium,[31] and the diet also generally encourages the consumption of nuts, whole grains, fish, poultry, fruits, and vegetables while lowering the consumption of red meats, sweets, and sugar. It is also \\"rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium, as well as protein\\". The Mediterranean diet, which includes limiting consumption of red meat and using olive oil in cooking, has also been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes.[32]","completion":"1.

Rearrange the sentences to make fewer paragraphs. Why did dinosaurs go extinct? Around 75% of Earth's animals, including dinosaurs, suddenly died out at the same point in time. So how was this global mass extinction caused by a rock hurtling into the coast of Central America? Paul explains, 'The asteroid hit at high velocity and effectively vaporised. It made a huge crater, so in the immediate area there was total devastation. A huge blast wave and heatwave went out and it threw vast amounts of material up into the atmosphere. 'It sent soot travelling all around the world. It didn't completely block out the Sun, but it reduced the amount of light that reached the Earth's surface. So it had an impact on plant growth.' Like dominos, this trailed up the food chain, causing the ecosystem to collapse. The reduction in plant life had a huge impact on herbivores' ability to survive, which in turn meant that carnivores would also have suffered from having less food available. Breeding seasons would have been shorter and conditions harsher. All living things would have been affected in some way, both on land and in the ocean. 'There is a lot of discussion over the actual kill mechanism and how long that period lasted. There are still a lot of unknowns. But it was a massive event affecting all life on Earth, from microorganisms all the way through to dinosaurs,' says Paul. The casualty list is long. Among them, ammonites, some microscopic plankton, and large marine reptiles all died out. But the loss made room for the beginnings of the modern world.","completion":"Why did the dinosaurs die? A long time ago, many different animals lived on our planet that no longer live now. Dinosaurs were some of these animals and at one point something very sad happened. All of them suddenly died. We say they went extinct. Most likely this happened because a very large rock from space hit our planet. We call this kind of rock an asteroid. The asteroid was travelling very fast through space and when it hit the Earth, it made a giant hole called a crater. Everything was destroyed and a lot of black powder called soot went flying into the air and all around the planet. There was so much of this black powder that the Sun was blocked out a little. It wasn't bright enough on Earth for the plants to grow normally anymore. Because the plants couldn't grow well, all other living beings were affected as well. The animals that only eat plants didn't have enough food to survive. Because there were not many plant-eating animals, the meat-eating animals also didn't have enough food anymore. The conditions were becoming more and more difficult for all living creatures on land and in the sea. Because this happened so long ago, it's hard to know everything, but we know for sure that it was a very big event and that it affected all organisms from the tiniest living beings all the way to dinosaurs. The list of animals that died during that time is very long.

From the time she moved to France in 1903 until her death in Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1946, American writer Gertrude Stein was a central figure in the Parisian art world. An advocate of the avant garde, Stein helped shape an artistic movement that demanded a novel form of expression and a conscious break with the past. The Paris salon at 27 rue de Fleurus that she shared with Alice B. Toklas, her lifelong companion and secretary, became a gathering place for the “new moderns,” as the talented young artists supporting this movement came to be called. Among those whose careers she helped launch were painters Henri Matisse, Juan Gris, and Pablo Picasso. What these creators achieved in the visual arts, Stein attempted in her writing. A bold experimenter and self-proclaimed genius, she rejected the linear, time-oriented writing characteristic of the 19th century for a spatial, process-oriented, specifically 20th-century literature. The results were dense poems and fictions, often devoid of plot or dialogue, which yielded memorable phrases (“Rose is a rose is a rose”) but were not commercially successful books. In fact, her only bestseller, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, a memoir of Stein’s life written in the person of Toklas, was a standard narrative, conventionally composed.","completion":"Gertrude Stein in Spring. She shaped a movement in art.

Give it a heartwarming ending.","completion":"One morning, Tex decided to take a walk in the nearby woods to clear his head. He was having a difficult time trying to take his mind off the fact that just the day before he had missed his opportunity to go on a trip with his friends to Las Vegas, and now he was stuck at home, alone. \\"Well,\\" he thought, \\"at least I can save some money for Christmas.\\" Tex wandered into the dense forest, a place he has been to many times before, and took a seat on his favorite tree stump. He took a deep breath of fresh air into his lungs and exhaled the stress out of his body. As he did this, he spotted the flapping of tiny wings in his periphery; a beautiful, orange monarch butterfly had landed on a stump right in front of him, resting its wings upon landing. The sun beamed down onto the orange and black of its form, and its antennae prominently jutted out from its head. Tex became mesmerized by the sight of the butterfly and decided to approach it to get a better look. The butterfly, unfazed by the approaching human, flapped its wings gently to show off its vibrant, colorful design. Tex became so enamored by the butterfly that he grabbed it and put it in his cupped hands to take back with him to his house. When he got back, Tex opened his hands and discovered that they were empty; the butterfly had vanished! As he looked around his immediate area hoping to find the butterfly, Tex found a beautiful woman standing behind him. The woman was dressed in a white gown, but had the wings of a butterfly; the wings were glistening in the sun as if they were sprinkled with silver glitter. Her hair was as white as wool, and her face bore a subtle smile that comforted him and eased his surprise at her presence. \\"I will grant you three wishes,\\" the woman spoke gently, \\"and then after that, I must leave. Choose wisely, friend.\\" Tex, taking a moment to think, put his head down and contemplated the gravity of this situation before finally looking up at the woman and making his decision. \\"I want to hang out with you for the day!\\" The woman nodded in the affirmative, and then replied, \\"We can do that, I guess!\\""},{"prompt":"I need to email my boss and tell him I'm not going to make it to the meeting because I got food poisoning at the company dinner last night.

From the time he first came out of the oven, he was always talking to the rest of the slices of pizza about what it might be like. One day he decided to see for himself, so he climbed out the kitchen window and went for a walk. As Pep strolled through the neighboring park, he felt the warm sun on his crust and the cool breeze blowing through his curls of cheese. He saw butterflies in the sky. He saw flowers fluttering in the grass. He saw squirrels staring at him from a tree. They had never seen a talking pizza before! Their amazement soon turned to hunger, so Pep ran away fast! Pep continued his walk, taking in the sights and sounds of the park. He passed a group of children playing on a playground and they stopped to greet him. The kids were delighted to meet a talking pizza and asked him all sorts of questions like \\"What's your favorite topping?\\" and \\"How much sauce is too much?\\" As the sun began to set, Pep realized it was time to head back to his warm, safe box.

I took it out of the box and did a check of all the items that were supposed to be included with the recliner, and found several items missing: 1. Hex tool for tightening screws; 2. Power cord; 3. Remote control. I can assemble the recliner with tools I have around my home so the hex tool is not necessarily an issue, but without the power cord I can't power the recliner to set up the massage functions. The remote control would be good to have because I don't want to have to keep programming the recliner's massage functions through the touch buttons on the armrest, but I think the most important item that needs to be supplied is the power cord. Without the power cord, I have a 2,000 recliner that doesn't massage me. I am wondering what options you can provide me to make this right. The only options I see are either I get a power cord from your company through the mail (which will probably take another week to receive) or I can return the recliner to your company. Returning the recliner would be a hassle because it is such a large item. However, if the latter is the option you will have to provide a new box, shipper, and postage so I can send it back to you, and that will probably cost you several hundred dollars. I think the best option would be to mail me a new power cord, as well as a hex tool and remote control, and I will have to wait a week to assemble my recliner.

I'm interested in trying out the food and wine there. Would also be interested in visiting landmarks.","completion":"1. Rome - this would be a great place to visit as it hosts a lot of landmarks that are well worth exploring and is regarded as the best place in Italy. It's highly recommended to visit the Coliseum and view some of Michelangelo's greatest works inside the Sistine Chapel. I recommend visiting a café or trattoria on Piazza Navona to indulge in some food and drinks when you get hungry. 2. Florence - The location is situated in Tuscan Valley and dazzles travelers with the old-world avenues leading up to picturesque piazzas. While there, make sure to visit Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral, which is located in the Piazza del Duomo. Florence is also considered one of the most ideal trips to take in the Chianti wine region. 3. Amalfi Coast - an amazing journey filled with excitement as you navigate through the hairpin turns on the narrow roads. In this region, there are over 30 miles of coastline that 13 colorful seaside towns reside on. This area is great to relax on the beach and indulge in the multiple Michelin-starred restaurants along the coast. 4. Venice - Venice is a beautiful city with canals running throughout the city that carry water taxis, buses, and even a fleet of famous gondolas. If you want something more relaxing on your visit, seek out the smaller streets and canals. It is also recommended to visit Rialto Bridge and tour the grand St. Mark’s Basilica. 5. Cinque Terre - this is located on northern Italy's Ligurian coast, and it is made up of five picturesque towns named Riomaggiore, Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, and Manarola. If you want to visit a vineyard, it is recommended to go to Manarola, as it boasts scenic vineyards, olive groves, and a centuries-old bell tower. If you're looking to enjoy some landmarks, I'd recommend Vernazza, as it is regarded as one of Italy's most beautiful villages and is known for picture-perfect houses and a medieval castle."},{"prompt":"Is this photo caption considered toxic or non-toxic?

The cold wreaked havoc on machines and travel was difficult, preventing widespread exploration. The dawn light reflected faintly on the snow-covered peaks. Soon, as the planet warmed, the Woolies would come down to the frosty plains to graze. Alistair prepared for the hunt, his economical movements a display of controlled elegance. The thick, white thermal gear he wore would keep him warm and hide him from view. The native Woolies had sharp eyesight and an even sharper sense of smell and provided a critical source of food for the colonists. He slung his energy bow, an elegant weapon both powerful and quiet, an ancient art reborn for use on a hostile planet. The slender bolts of energy it fired resembled arrows only in the barest sense. They maintained their form just long enough to puncture the target. Alistair could configure the shape of the energy bolts to cause maximum damage to large prey or a more delicate but still deadly missile for smaller game. Today, he was opting for a heavy bolt.

Subtle slopes and crags revealed themselves. It would be a long hike before he was far enough from the habitat to reach the Woolies' grazing area. He checked his equipment once more. Equipment failures were fatal for the careless. His understanding of the terrain, a sign of his survival skills, allowed him to move through it effectively. His heart soared.

Make Use of Employee Referrals - One of the most highly effective hiring strategies for today's growing companies is using employment referrals. This is a process that uses a person's professional network to find the best possible talent. Think about improving your employee referral program by switching to a stipend system for successful hires. When you choose to create a culture of respect toward these referrals, you can give your own networking connections a boost as well. 2. Create a Positive Experience for Candidates - The way your prospective new talent feels about the hiring process will be based on the interactions they have with your hiring manager and anyone else they talk to at your company. Their experience may also include other interactions that take place without another person involved such as the online job application process or automated responses to their application submission. 3. Consider Your Internal Recruits - Sometimes recruiting new talent internally for different positions can be more rewarding than hiring new employees. Hiring internally will reduce the amount of time it takes to hire, onboard, or train a new worker. It also cuts down on additional costs for advertising on job boards or paying for background checks. Plus, when you hire someone internally, you are typically dealing with a smaller amount of candidates, which will save you time during the screening and interviewing process. 4. Make Diversity Your Priority - Having a team with diverse ideas, experiences, and backgrounds can increase your company's effectiveness and drive more innovation for your brand. Ensuring diversity is prioritized during the hiring process is a great way to guarantee a broad representation of staffing, which will help you work toward the best possible outcomes for workplace equity. 5. Use a Rubric - One cornerstone of the hiring process is clear expectations. Using an interview rubric, or a checklist to analyze candidates may communicate transparency within your hiring process and make sure that the most qualified candidates will apply for the job. An interview rubric is a scoring tool that defines expectations and assists in determining who to interview, who you should call to interview again, and who to offer the new job to. This form of the rubric can be used to objectively measure both tangible and intangible details like relevant experience and demeanor."},{"prompt":"write a facebook post by a grandma updating her friends about the birth of her third grandchild.

There were a lot of loud horn noises and I went forward in my car seat and the straps pulled so tight that for a second, I couldn't breathe. When I looked at Teddy I could see the same thing happened to him. Tears came out of my eyes, and Mommy was looking at me through the mirror saying that she was sorry. We didn't go to the birthday party or to get ice cream because Teddy and I wouldn't stop crying. My head hurt, and Teddy said his did, too.

Some scientists think sloths developed their slow-motion lifestyle so they would be less noticeable to predators such as hawks and cats, which rely heavily on their eyesight when hunting. The algae that grows on sloths' fur also helps them avoid predators by letting them blend in with green leaves. They rarely come down from the trees. About once every week, they descend to go to the bathroom, slowly moving about by digging their front claws into the dirt and dragging their bodies. If they are caught by a predator, sloths turn from sluggish to slugger, biting fiercely, hissing, slashing with their claws, and shrieking.","completion":"Some scientists believe sloths move slowly to avoid detection by predators that rely on their eyesight while hunting; if attacked, sloths can bite, slash, and shriek.

But now, the village has changed its face, Concrete buildings standing in their place, The bustling city with its honking horns, A world of noise, and smoggy morns.

In fact, the 1920s is widely regarded as the time of birth of the modern music era because that’s when the recorded industry started to bloom. During that decade, electronic recordings were first introduced, which was a huge deal for the music industry. As such, most experts agree that the 1920s was when we came to recognize pop music as we know it today, sparked by blues, hillbilly, and country music. As I mentioned early on, pop in “pop music” stands for popular. Ever since it was first used, this term has continued to be the go-to term when describing the ever-changing music preferred by the general taste. While it’s true that the term hadn’t been officially applied until the 1950s, we can trace pop music by a few decades prior to that.","completion":"Pop music first originated in the 1920s, the era of modern music where the word 'pop' was associated with particular types of music with a distinct appeal. At the same time, we saw the rise of electronic recordings, which marked this decade as the definitive year for the discovery of pop music. The word 'pop' was coined from 'popular' and it was used to describe the varying trends and tastes held by different generations and audiences. It wasn't applied till the 1950s."},{"prompt":"I live in California and I'm trying to find a cheaper place to live, but I don't want to move out of California.

I was disappointed in several aspects of my accommodations, affecting the quality of my stay. 1) The design of the shower caused water to leak all over the floor every time I used it. This resulted in a wet slippery bathroom floor that posed a safety hazard to my husband and me. 2) After checking in late in the evening, we were unable to watch the late-night news because no remotes were provided. 3) The phone and clock radio both were not functioning. We were unable to call the front desk to complain about the problem due to the non-functional phone. 4) Most concerning of all, we were unable to open the sofa bed in the suite when it was time for bed because the couch needed to be moved closer to the wall. The front desk staff said there was no one available to help move the couch, so I had to do it myself. This inconvenience severely impacted my enjoyment of the room!

If the actor decided to return three years later, write a soap opera explanation for why he was gone for so long.","completion":"Jason miraculously survived the mine collapse in a small air pocket. He was initially knocked unconscious, which is why searchers didn’t find him. When he came to, he had suffered a serious concussion, he was dazed, and he had amnesia. He wondered, from the gun he found at his side, if he was a criminal on the run or if he might be in danger. Somehow, he mustered the strength to find a way out through the rubble to fresh air. Just in case, Jason thought it best to find places to hide during the day and to only travel by dark of night. He ended up catching rides at truck stops until eventually he found a beach. Before the amnesia, Jason had always had a connection to the beach, having grown up in Malibu and learning how to surf as a child. With the amnesia, Jason didn’t know for sure why, but he found peace there. He picked up random jobs for a while, like straightening beach chairs and bringing resort visitors fresh beach towels. One day he met an old woman named Beatrice, who lived in a condo directly on the beach. She had a good sense about people and immediately trusted him, and she asked if he would like to move in with her and help her take care of her aging husband. Jason spent the next two and a half years taking care of Albert, and within weeks Beatrice was gone, too. After Beatrice passed away, Jason went onto the internet for the first time. Something seemed intuitive about it, although he had never had an interest in technology before -- just surfing and swimming. He was searching for information on Beatrice’s family to notify them of her death and happened upon a photo of himself along with an obituary mentioning the mine collapse. He saw that he had a wife and two kids and had lived in Capitol City, Iowa. Not remembering how to drive, he again hitchhiked, this time back to find his family. Upon arriving in town, Jason walked into the nearest diner, and the waitress recognized him and fainted on the spot.

Sure, you could deal with it, but sometimes, it just feels off. And Robin's toast crumbs felt very much off to Batman. Robin saw the toast crumbs and put his hands up in a shrugging motion, feigning some combination of surprise and innocence. \\"Are these not your crumbs, Robin?\\" Batman asked. \\"I know it was you. Nobody else eats whole-grain wheat bread but you.\\" \\"Batman, I just got up. I swear it wasn't me. I know to clean up my crumbs,\\" Robin said in reply. \\"Do you now? Because evidence shows otherwise. I am a detective after all. So why don't you just stop with the excuses and make this right?\\" Robin had a dumbfounded but defeated look on his face. There was no arguing with Batman when he was in that sort of mood. And so he dutifully went off to the far side of the kitchen to gather cleaning supplies. Alfred was already there with a paper towel in hand for Robin. \\"I wonder why Master Bruce is so upset this morning. For shame, Robin. You should know better by now.\\" Robin grumbled something incoherent and grabbed the towels. He started to turn when he suddenly paused. \\"Wait a minute, how were you already here with a towel in hand?\\" he inquired. \\"Well, Master Robin, you should know better than to steal your Butler's newspaper,\\" Alfred replied. \\"Alfred, that was a week ago!\\" \\"Tut-tut, Robin.

Biographers surmise that her father was named Johnson, that she traveled to Surinam, married Johan Behn in 1864, and was widowed by 1866. It is further believed that during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, she worked as a spy in Bruges but wound up in a London debtor’s prison. Having written a novel, Oroonoko in 1688, she began writing plays for the King’s Company and the Duke’s Company including The Forc’d Marriage, The Amorous Prince, and The Dutch Lover. In 1677, her play, The Rover, won critical and commercial success and allowed her to have a successful career as a playwright.

To create your personal budget, follow these six steps. 1. Calculate your net income. Start by creating your net income. Net income is the money you earn after all taxes and fees have been accounted for; it is the money that figuratively ends up in your pocket at the end of each month. This is important as the foundation of your budget. It determines how much you have available to allocate to your expense categories. A common mistake people make when calculating income is to use the gross total before taxes and pension contributions. This means they anticipate more income than they actually receive and thus leads to an inaccurate budget. To find your net income, you can look closely at some historic payslips or use one of the many online calculators. 2. Track your spending. The next step is to track and categorize your spending habits for 1-3 months. I would advise three months to ensure any quarterly payments are included; however, one month is enough to get a sense of spending habits in most areas. This is important as it will give you an idea of where your money goes each month and give you a solid base to create a monthly budget. To do this, you can write down each transaction you make throughout a period and assign it a category. Use an Excel spreadsheet to make things easier for you. Most banks will allow you to download a CSV file that includes all your transactions for a pre-determined period. Once downloaded, you can write a category next to each transaction. 3. Set attainable goals. The next thing you need to account for is the goals you have. Ensure that your goals are attainable and set a period for them also. Common goals are to pay down debt you have previously accrued or establish savings such as a three-month emergency fund. These goals should primarily be short-term and achievable within 1 to 3 years. It is ok to establish longer-term goals, but for your monthly budget, the short-term is what we are most interested in. Make sure these are motivating goals, as these will help to keep you on track when you want to disregard your budget. 4. Make your plan. This is where you start to formulate a budget. You have your recorded transactions and your income. Look at your recorded expenses and determine for each category what a good budget would be for each month. For some of your fixed costs, this will be obvious. Your rent, for example, will not vary month on month. Your variable costs, such as eating out, may vary monthly, so set a middle ground you are comfortable with. You will need to make separate categories that consider your goals, for instance, a vacation category where you aim to save 100 monthly. All your budgeted expenses totaled should fall within your net income number. If it doesn't, you will have to cut back somewhere. 5. Stick to your budget. Take great care to stick within your budget. Your budget guarantees reaching those goals and living within your means. Continue to track your spending to ensure you are remaining within budget. If you see certain categories are almost fully spent and it is only the 9th of the month, this should help you to stop spending in that category. If you overspend in one category, consider reducing spending in another to stay on track. Use your goals as motivation to stick with it. 6. Review regularly. A budget is only as good as when you do it, so maintain and update it as necessary. A pay raise at work will mean your budget can be adjusted to show more income and more capacity to save or spend. It's always good to review your budget at least quarterly, but the best budgets are updated monthly to account for the variables of life, such as birthdays, events, and other one-off occasions. It's unlikely that your December (Christmas) budget is the same as your budget for February. Use a forward-thinking approach to maintain and update your budget. There is no harm in reducing your budget in one month, so you can increase it in another so long as combined, they are within your income."},{"prompt":"I'm an art student, and I'm going to be in Scottsdale in May. What are 5 places I can go that have good art, especially modern art?","completion":"Sure, I can help you with that. Many places in Arizona have interesting modern art, especially in the Phoenix and Scottsdale areas. Here are some ideas for you to visit in May: 1. The Phoenix Art Museum, which is not far from Scottsdale, has over 17,000 modern and contemporary works of art. The plus is, if you go with someone who likes other types of art as well, there will be something for everyone. 2. The Eye Lounge might be perfect for you if you like eclectic places where budding contemporary artists can show off their talent. Featuring many new artists, this is a space that exhibits conceptually stimulating artworks, which inspire discussion and introspection. 3. If you also like photography, a good option for visiting could be MonOrchid. It's a split gallery exhibit space, which has the Bokeh Gallery and the Shade Gallery. The Bokeh Gallery is mainly photographic artwork and digital collages. The Shade Gallery, however, is a significant space containing static and modular walls that can adapt to a variety of exhibitions. This is an ever-changing art space and is well-known by modern art enthusiasts. 4. Perhaps you should try going to Perihelion Arts, which is a cutting-edge contemporary art gallery/artist collective that was established by Amy Young. The gallery aims to reveal the very best of contemporary art to promote public interest in the arts, with a priority on art that pushes boundaries. This includes folk, surrealism, pop surrealism, outsider, and erotic art. 5. Another option is Oblique Art, a contemporary urban arts space and pop-up gallery located in downtown Phoenix. Obliq Art was established in 2012 intending to showcase exceptional contemporary paintings, photography and mixed media created by local Arizona artists. These options are some of the most popular options for modern art, but there is more where that came from. Depending on how long you'll be staying in Scottsdale, you may want to visit even more exhibits."},{"prompt":"Write a summary about moving from the US to Japan to take a new job as a bachelor.

Hatshepsut, on the other hand, seized the reins of power and never let go. When her husband (and half-brother), King Thutmose II, died around 1478 BCE, his only male heir was Thutmose III, whose mother was Thutmose II's concubine. Since the child was too young to rule, Queen Hatshepsut was named as his regent. However, as the daughter of King Thutmose I, Hatshepsut had her own legitimate claim to rule Egypt. At some point during the next seven years, she controversially went above and beyond the regent role by proclaiming herself pharaoh instead of handing her power over to Thutmose III when he came of age. In an effort to legitimize her position, Hatshepsut masculinized her image. She was depicted with a false beard, the symbol of a living god. She ordered sculptors to give some of her likenesses broader shoulders and chests. She even called herself Hatshepsu, removing the feminine t from the end of her name. Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty under Hatshepsut was relatively peaceful and prosperous; she focused on building infrastructure and diplomatic ventures. Her government increased trade with civilizations such as Phoenicia. Nine years into her rule, an expedition she had organized to the land of Punt returned with timber, gold, frankincense, myrrh, and even exotic animals.","completion":"When my brother, King Thutmose, died, his son was too young to rule, so I was named regent in his place.

The day when the winter would finally end and the spring would begin. He loved the spring when everything came back to life and the world was filled with color and warmth. He loved the spring because it was the season of love. He had fallen in love with her last autumn when he saw her walking in the park with her golden hair and blue eyes. He had followed her every day, trying to catch her attention, but she never noticed him. She seemed to be lost in her own thoughts, oblivious to his admiration. He had tried to talk to her, to compliment her, to make her laugh, but she always gave him a cold and distant look. She never smiled, never thanked him, never showed any interest in him. She was like a block of ice, frozen and hard. He hoped that the spring would melt her heart, that she would see him in a different light, that she would finally return his love. He hoped that the spring would bring them together, as it did for so many other creatures. He saw how the birds sang and built their nests, how the bees buzzed and collected their honey, how the flowers bloomed and spread their fragrance. He saw how the lovers strolled and kissed under the trees, how they held hands and whispered sweet words. He wanted to be like them, he wanted to share his joy and passion with her. But she did not change. She remained cold and aloof, even when the sun shone brightly and the breeze caressed her face. She did not care for the beauty of nature or the happiness of others. She did not care for him. She was like winter in his heart, chilling and dark. He did not understand why she was so cruel, why she rejected him so harshly. He did not know what he had done wrong, or what he could do better. He did not know what she wanted, what she felt. He only knew that he loved her more than anything else in the world and that he would never give up on her. He decided to make one last attempt to win her over. He bought her a bouquet of roses, red as his blood and sweet as his dreams. He wrote her a letter, expressing his feelings and begging for her mercy. He waited for her at the park entrance, hoping that she would come and read his words and accept his gift. But she did not come. She did not show up at all. He waited for hours until the sun set and the stars came out. He waited until he realized that she had forgotten him, that she had ignored him, that she had scorned him. He felt a surge of anger and pain in his chest. He threw away the roses and tore up the letter. He cursed her name and wished her ill.

However, there isn't a lot of sound research to back these claims. It's also important to note that some brands are more effective at blocking blue light than others. For those that suffer from migraines and light sensitivity, a specific light-filtering (not just blue light) lens may be beneficial. For the majority of people that just want to reduce digital eye strain, blue light glasses may not do much. People are better off monitoring their screen time and following the 20-20-20 rule according to experts. This involves looking at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes. Where did the idea come from that we need to be blocking blue light you ask? The biggest source of blue light is from the sun, but when we say blue light, we're usually referring to artificial blue light from digital screens. In an evolving digital world, people are spending more and more time in front of screens. This is associated with some health problems like eye strain, headaches, and sleep disturbances. Some scientists hypothesized the role of blue light in these issues. An in vitro study (meaning in cells not in real humans) alluded to the fact that blue light harms ocular cells. A research study in mice illustrated that as exposure to blue light increased, instances of cataracts increased. Other recent research concluded that blue light glasses did not help mitigate the effects of screen exposure compared to a placebo. Research into this area is ongoing, but there is no undisputed answer at this point in time. There is slightly stronger research into the effects of blue light on melatonin. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that wearing blue light glasses before sleep may improve sleep quality. To summarize, if you are looking to reduce digital eye strain, blue light glasses should not be the sole solution. If you feel that they help, by all means, invest in a good pair from a reputable brand. The best ways to reduce eye strain though is to remain at arm's length from your screen, follow the 20-20-20 rule, and try and reduce your overall screen time."},{"prompt":"Write a limerick about an overdrafted bank account.","completion":"Where once was a decent amount, So much I couldn't even count, I took out too much.

I gasped as I watched my neighbour's dustbin go flying down the road and disappear from my line of vision. I noticed a fence panel was missing - gone - just like that. Illuminated forks of lightning sliced the dark sky in half, with blinding flashes. They were as brilliant as full sunlight, everything was lit up for the world to see for a few moments. I had never seen such a display of terrible, awesome power. Claps of thunder boomed. The storm was directly overhead. The noise was deafening. It reverberated through the air, making me shiver. The storm raged on ferociously. I peeped out from behind the curtains of my bedroom window. I felt a mixture of awe at the power of nature, but also trepidation at its sheer untameable power. After what seemed like an eternity, the storm finally began to calm down. The rain slowed to a gentle drizzle, the wind subsided, and the sound of thunder became just a low rumble in the distance. The storm was moving on, ready to demonstrate its power elsewhere. I opened my window and leaned out, taking long, deep breaths of the crisp, clean air, and marveled at how the garden glistened with raindrops. The world looked refreshed. The first rays of sun glinted from behind the clouds and the muted colours of a faint rainbow began to appear in the heavens."},{"prompt":"Where was the oldest American artifact found in the United States?","completion":"In western Idaho, at a place named Cooper's Ferry, on the edge of a river fragments of charcoal and bone were found.

Brainstorm a few ways and how I can do each.","completion":"Here are some ways you can reduce stress; however, I am not a clinician, and it is important to speak to a professional if you need help. 1. Eat and drink healthy foods and beverages- while coffee is a go-to for many people on the go, overdrinking coffee can lead to more stress and anxiety. Limit your intake of unhealthy foods and beverages, specifically those with high sugar content. 2. Exercise regularly- Exercising can release endorphins that boost your mood and give you more energy. Try taking a daily walk or taking time out of your day to practice aerobics or other stress-relieving exercises. 3. Learn to set realistic goals- Sometimes, we pile too much onto our plates and feel discouraged that we weren't able to accomplish all that we set out to. If this happens to you regularly, it may be helpful to readjust your expectations for the day and set more realistic goals. When you do this, you will be able to accomplish tasks instead of drowning in them and feel better about what you were able to get done."},{"prompt":"Write a short email to Joe telling him I won't be able to make it to the BBQ this saturday because of my granddaughter's graduation that conflict.

If the user provides any other input that causes an error, it should give a generic output, \\"Invalid input detected. Please provide a positive integer input.\\" That way the program could detect strings as an input or whatever else I guess. Here's the code I've got so far: \`\`\`Python while True: try: user_input = int(input(\\"Please enter a positive integer value: \\")) if user_input <= 0: raise ValueError(\\"Please enter an integer value greater than 0.\\") break except ValueError: print(\\"Invalid input detected.

When we got there, we colonized it and created a new country: America. Over time, we migrated and settled throughout the entire country of America and unified all the lands within, and called it the United States of America. 11th Century man: Fascinating! Does England have any control of America? 2023 man: No, we created our own republic, which over time became a representative democracy. The people have the power to elect officials who will represent them in government, and then the government works for the people to provide things like national defense, general welfare, and other such things. 11th Century man: That sounds like a utopia...something we English had fought hard for when we made our way west. But it seems your people have done it in your own time! 2023 man: How did you communicate with each other? We have electronic devices that allow us to talk to each other all over the world. 11th Century man: We used lit torches as beacons that allowed us to communicate when an enemy approached our lands.

In addition to growing tender within a stew, fennel also adds a wonderful aromatic element that will kick any beef stew up a notch. 4. Cauliflower. This unique vegetable makes a lovely substitution for the more traditional bean addition to the stew, adding a milkiness and good flavor. 5. Kale. Unlike delicate greens that will wither with heat, sturdy kale maintains its texture and helps stretch beef stew for more delicious servings."},{"prompt":"Can you write an invitation email for Jason's 8th birthday party, which will be on March 14th at 3:00 pm inside the skating rink?

Tell me three stories from Greek or Roman times that are considered legends or folklore. Give me a short summary of each","completion":"Mythology is taken from the Grecian words for mythos and logos, meaning the story of people through word or voice. They are often tales about culture and human emotions and conditions, passed down through generations and retold hundreds of thousands of times. Some mythologies are fables in that they teach lessons, while others are explanations to explain things like death, love, life, and the universe. Two of the most well-known cultures for mythologies are Greek and Roman. They often spoke of Gods, Goddesses, Titans, and Heroes. You’ve probably seen many of those cultures’ mythologies played out in modern books and movies. Hercules, for instance, is based on Grecian mythology, told, and retold, over centuries. Here are three more instances of Greek or Roman myths. • The Three Fated Sisters of Life and Death Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos were three sisters, tasked with weaving the fates of both humans and gods. While Clotho spins the thread of life from someone’s birth, like an origin story, Lachesis is responsible for the continuation of the thread through life’s ups and downs. The latter measures the length of the thread to determine the longevity of the fated person. Finally, Atropos cuts the thread, foreseeing how someone will die. • The Weaving Wars of Athena and Arachne Arachne was a weaver, and she could create elaborate quilts and tapestries from simple threads. Radiant in her confidence, she challenged Athena, the goddess of the arts, to a weaving contest, and the goddess accepted. However, where Athena wove a tapestry that portrayed her hard-fought battle with Poseidon, Arachne mocked Athena with a woven tapestry of Zeus (Athena’s father) up to his naughty antics. Athena took great offense, turning Arachne into a spider, cursed to hang forever in her woven webs. • The Curse of the Bee’s Sting Humans have always taken a liking to honey, much to the chagrin of Bee, a hive queen in Rome. She journeyed to Mount Olympus, seeking counsel with Jupiter, to ask him to give her a stinger that would be so toxic that it would kill humans that stole her honey. Jupiter had a love for the human race, but he had made Bee a promise after tasting her delicious honey. The God King decided to teach her a lesson about wishing for the downfall of others. He granted her request, but at the price that she would die as well if she stung a human."},{"prompt":"Explain the internet to someone as if it's the 1970s. Keep a casual tone, and make it a maximum of two paragraphs.","completion":"Okay, so you know how we have television, and we send each other letters, and we call each other on the phone? Well, the internet is this thing that allows us to do all of that and more, with everyone around the world. So, you know about computers, right? Well, the internet is essentially a whole network of connected computers, much smaller than the ones you have, all around the world. At first, we connected to each other through phone lines, but technology gave us faster and easier ways to do that. And at first, we could just do basic stuff like send each other electronic mail, or \\"email.\\" You would type your message on the keyboard, which was like a set of typewriter keys, and the words you typed showed up on the monitor, which is like a TV screen. Then you'd send the message to the email address (which is like kinda a real address) of the person. And any emails that came to you would show up on screen, in a list. Each email has a title or subject, and then the main part of the email has the message you sent. At first, we primarily sent emails and we would go to what are called websites, which were kind of like a set of newspaper pages. And as technology got better, we could do more - we could watch television-like videos on websites, and we could also make videos using cameras like you have now, but more advanced. You could also record music, and other people could listen to it. The internet became fast enough and easy to use that a website called YouTube was created, where people around the world could make videos, and others around the world could watch them. Now, technology is so advanced that there are websites where individual people broadcast live, on millions of channels, and people can talk to each other and the person on the channel, by typing to each other. We're also able to play games with each other around the world. You can play chess with someone in China, or have a conversation with someone in Britain. It's as if they're in the room with you.

Make a numbered list formatted as {Artist} : {Album} (release year).","completion":"Definitive Jux (formerly known as Def Jux) was an independent hip-hop label founded by rapper El-P and his manager Amechi Uzoigwe. Disillusioned with his experiences at Rawkus Records, El-P formed Def Jux in 1999 with Amechi. The label sought to cover overheads on projects and offer 50% of royalty earnings to the artists. In 2001, the label released a compilation project called Def Jux Presents, which was followed by the critically acclaimed Cannibal Ox album The Cold Vein later that same year. The label was forced to change its name that same year when Def Jam records sued over the similarities in name. After an out-of-court settlement, the label changed its name to Definitive Jux records. The label continued to release a string of albums to critical acclaim and modest commercial success for most of the mid-2000s. The death of artist Camu Tao in 2008 created tension between artists. At the same time, El-P had become unhappy with the development of Def Jux records, feeling that the output of the label had become homogeneous. This culminated in El-P announcing that he would be focusing more on his career as an artist and put the label on a permanent hiatus in 2010. Five prominent albums released on the label are: 1. Cannibal Ox - The Cold Vein (2001) 2. Aesop Rock - Labor Days (2001) 3. El-P - Fantastic Damage (2002) 4. RJ-D2 - Deadringer (2002) 5.

Cole was a great adventurer who would always tell us about his grand adventures. He told me that a long time ago, he went dungeon exploring in hopes of finding some amazing treasure.

Anyway, Cole was deep in the dungeon, exploring every nook and cranny, trying to find any treasure. He got lost on multiple occasions! Cole would trigger hidden traps along the way, fall in a couple of ditches, and the whole works! I remember that Cole was telling me of a fight with one of the dungeon's scariest monsters. He told me that this monster had four arms and one sword in each of those arms! Cole is a bit of an exaggerator, but something tells me that he wasn't lying about this. Cole stared this monster down, pulled out his sword and they started fighting. This monster was big, so it meant that it couldn't move as fast. Cole used that to his advantage. The room they were in had tall, rocky pillars, so Cole was able to maneuver past the four-armed monster. Using the pillars to his advantage, Cole was able to bait the monster to swing at the pillars. The monster swung as hard as it could and got one of his swords stuck in the pillar. Cole took that opportunity to slash one of his arms! The monster writhed in pain as he let go of the sword stuck in the pillar. Cole tried to get another slash in, but the monster started rampaging! It was spinning around, swinging its remaining swords with no remorse. This was a fight Cole couldn't win, so he took that as a sign to flee. The only problem was that the monster was blocking the only exit! What did Cole do, you ask? Well, that is an answer I can only tell you next time.

The money she was saving for a special day was gone, gone with the man who’d taken it in one last mean-spirited act to hurt her. She thought she should feel something, but she didn’t. Her mind was dangerously quiet. She set the glass jar carefully on the counter and turned. The four-year-old sat at the kitchen table. Clutched in her fist was the last half of her peanut butter and jelly sandwich. A glob of sticky red jam had escaped her sandwich. She was pushing it across the table with one small index finger. Her finger stilled, and she looked up and grinned. That youthful, feral smile dispelled the numbness that was spreading through her chest and filled her with warmth. There was no room for regret to take root. She didn’t think of the man who’d come and gone. The imagined fancy birthday disappeared as she watched her daughter's eyes sparkle. The money was gone.

This is the article: When \\"Glee\\" first premiered in 2009, it was groundbreaking for its largely teenage demographic. Due to the frequent LGBTQ+ storylines the show tackled and the heavy musical content, the show quickly became a haven for theater nerds and outcasts around the world. Throughout its six seasons on the air, \\"Glee\\" taught an entire generation to follow their dreams in the face of judgment and cruelty. The series helped set the tone for normalizing more diverse storylines regarding gender and sexual orientation. Unfortunately, many of the show's plotlines are also tinged with racism, homophobia, and ableism, all while frequently taking feminism back 15 steps in any given episode. The school setting of \\"Glee\\" provided a great opportunity to address these problems as the show continued, but it repeatedly failed to do so over the course of its initial TV run. The teachers are often worse than the students, and any character development that the McKinley High School crew manage is almost immediately retconned, leading to a repetitive slate of character arcs and a lot of unaddressed problematic content. Here are some of the big issues we should probably stop ignoring about \\"Glee.\\"","completion":"Glee frequently had plotlines that attempted to address societal issues, but ultimately failed.

It wasn't the most comfortable way to walk, but it paid to be cautious in these times. Monstrous creatures were lurking in the dark, humans being the worst of them. From an early age, his father had taught him how to hunt with a bow. It was rare that he'd needed to use it for self-defense, but it was preferable to other methods. Swords were efficient, but a human's strength matched against an elf, goblin, orc, troll, or even group of bandits rendered the sword a little more than a pointy metal stick that would purchase a few more seconds of life. No, a bow was better for eliminating targets before they posed a threat. It was a windy October when the biting wind had set in and Terrin was traveling from one town to the next. From above a rocky outcrop, three trolls appeared, brandishing clubs with metal spikes at him. Terrin whipped his bow from over his shoulder without hesitation, taking but a moment to check the wind, and loosed an arrow. It struck the first troll square in the chest, dropping him instantly. The second began bobbing and weaving, causing Terrin's second arrow to miss the mark slightly. Still, it lodged in the troll's shoulder, which caused him to double over. He turned his attention to the third troll, who was bearing down on him, making long strides. The archer was quick on his feet and kicked up dust into the troll's face, causing him to stagger and miss his swings. Terrin finished him off with an arrow from behind. He had just enough time to turn around and put an arrow in the second troll, who was trying to sneak up behind him. He breathed a sigh of relief, realizing that in his focused state, he'd forgotten how to do anything other than shoot.

And Britney had that.\\"[4] They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from \\"lower and less poppy\\" delivery to \\"distinctively, unmistakably Britney.\\"[5] After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album.[5] Spears had originally envisioned \\"Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary\\" but felt all right with her label's appointment of producers, since \\"It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me.\\"[6]","completion":"1.

We arrived in what appears to be Britain, but not current-day London. Sensor readings indicated many unusual animals in the vicinity. Communications with Enterprise have been cut off. Shortly after arriving, we were attacked by incorporeal life forms that seemed to feed on life energy. We were rescued by a large humanoid named Hagrid and a human named Potter. Potter used some sort of energy weapon to repel the creatures, who are known as dementors. I have recovered, and Data was unaffected, but Troi seems to have been particularly sensitive to the dementor attack and is currently in serious condition. Physically she is unharmed, but she is unconscious and her vital signs are extremely weak. With the help of Hagrid and Potter, we moved to a large medieval castle which is apparently the home of some sort of academy. Troi is being treated in the academy's infirmary.

Please write a blog about Mayor Denali of Talkeetna, Alaska, running for President of the United States as a write-in candidate. You can mention or give an example of how human politicians behave compared to Mayor Denali and his predecessor, Mayor Stubbs. You can keep it somewhat humorous and satirical.","completion":"Honesty. Integrity. Loyalty. The country needs a president who embodies these virtues. A president who puts the citizens first. A president who comes to work every day. A president who leaves no mouse uncaught. We need Mayor Denali. Hailing from Talkeetna, Alaska, Mayor Denali comes from a long line of distinguished public servants. His predecessor, Mayor Stubbs, served the people from 1997 until he died in 2017. Despite numerous reelections, Mayor Stubbs never lost touch with his constituents. When he wasn't walking through the town greeting friends and making sure everything was fine, he was in his office at Nagley’s General Store carrying out his duties. Mayor Stubbs excelled at his job and was a write-in candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2014. Sadly, due to partisan politics, the Mayor lost the election, the only one he ever lost. Mayor Denali has taken up the gauntlet his predecessor laid down. The Mayor will bring the same devotion to duty he embodies to the position of Leader of the Free World. Instead of secret deals and partisan politics, Mayor Denali will continue to keep his actions in the public eye. As president, will restore the honor and integrity of the Office of the President.

It needs to be under 400 words and written with a slightly angry but confident tone.","completion":"As a resident, I am outraged about the ongoing problem of illegal parking. Every day, drivers are abusing the law with complete disregard for the convenience and safety of their fellow citizens. They are parking in loading zones, handicapped spaces, in front of fire hydrants, and even in the middle of the road. Enough is enough. We need to come together as a community to put an end to this reckless behavior. Can we talk about the sheer selfishness of it all? When people park illegally, they are basically saying that their own convenience and desires are more important than the safety and well-being of everyone else. There is no place in a civilized community for this attitude. We are supposed to be looking out for one another. What can we do about it? Well, we need to start reporting illegal parking to the authorities when we see it. Call the police or report it through a city app. We need to make sure that those responsible are held accountable for their actions. We also need to educate the public about the dangers of illegal parking. I hope that many drivers may not even realize the impact their actions are having. Cars parked in no-parking zones and even on the sidewalks force people to walk in the street, which puts them at risk of being hit by passing vehicles. They can also create blind spots and obstruct the view of other drivers. Illegally parking in handicapped spaces can cause disabled individuals to walk farther than they are capable of. By raising awareness, we can help to change attitudes and encourage more responsible behavior Finally, we need to come together as a community to make our voices heard. Whether it's organizing a neighborhood watch or starting a petition to demand stronger enforcement, we need to show by working together, we can create a safer and more respectful community for everyone. In conclusion, should take a stand against illegal parking. We cannot allow a few selfish individuals to put the safety of the rest of us at risk. By reporting, educating, and organizing, we can make a difference and create a community that truly looks out for one another and firmly states that we will not tolerate illegal parking in our town. It's time to act – before someone gets hurt."},{"prompt":"Re-write this article as if you're a conspiracy theorist, thinking that AI is actually aliens trying to take over the world using computers A Meta team of AI researchers has proposed an innovative architecture for AI models, capable of generating expansive content in text, image, and audio formats, stretching to over 1 million tokens. This groundbreaking proposal, if embraced, could pave the way for the next generation of proficient AI models, transcending the Transformer architecture that underpins models such as GPT-4 and Bard, and unleashing novel capacities in content generation. The Constraints of Current Models Contemporary high-performing generative AI models, like OpenAI's GPT-4, are grounded in the Transformer architecture. Initially introduced by Google researchers in 2017, this architecture forms the backbone of emergent AI models, facilitating an understanding of nuanced inputs and generating extensive sentences and documents. Nonetheless, Meta's AI research team posits that the prevailing Transformer architecture might be reaching its threshold. They highlight two significant flaws inherent in the design: With the increase in the length of inputs and outputs, self-attention scales dramatically. As each word processed or produced by a Transformer language model requires attention to all other words, the computation becomes highly intensive for thousands of words, whereas it's less problematic for smaller word counts. Feedforward networks, which aid language models in comprehending and processing words through a sequence of mathematical operations and transformations, struggle with scalability on a per-position basis. These networks operate on character groups or \\"positions\\" independently, leading to substantial computational expenses. Megabyte Model: The Game Changer The Megabyte model, introduced by Meta AI, showcases a uniquely different architecture, dividing a sequence of inputs and outputs into \\"patches\\" rather than individual tokens. Within each patch, a local AI model generates results, while a global model manages and harmonizes the final output across all patches. This methodology addresses the scalability challenges prevalent in today's AI models. The Megabyte model's patch system permits a single feedforward network to operate on a patch encompassing multiple tokens. Researchers found that this patch approach effectively counters the issue of self-attention scaling. The patch model enables Megabyte to perform calculations in parallel, a stark contrast to traditional Transformers performing computations serially. Even when a base model has more parameters, this results in significant efficiencies. Experiments indicated that Megabyte, utilizing a 1.5B parameter model, could generate sequences 40% quicker than a Transformer model operating on 350M parameters. Using several tests to determine the limits of this approach, researchers discovered that the Megabyte model's maximum capacity exceeded 1.2M tokens. For comparison, OpenAI's GPT-4 has a limit of 32,000 tokens, while Anthropic's Claude has a limit of 100,000 tokens. Shaping the AI Future As the AI arms race progresses, AI model enhancements largely stem from training on an ever-growing number of parameters, which are the values learned during an AI model's training phase. While GPT-3.5 was trained on 175B parameters, there's speculation that the more capable GPT-4 was trained on 1 trillion parameters. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently suggested a shift in strategy, confirming that the company is thinking beyond training colossal models and is zeroing in on other optimizations. He equated the future of AI models to iPhone chips, where the majority of consumers are oblivious to the raw technical specifications. Altman envisioned a similar future for AI, emphasizing the continual increase in capability. Meta’s researchers believe their innovative architecture arrives at an opportune time, but also acknowledge there are other pathways to optimization. Promising research areas such as more efficient encoder models adopting patching techniques, decode models breaking down sequences into smaller blocks, and preprocessing sequences into compressed tokens are on the horizon, and could extend the capabilities of the existing Transformer architecture for a new generation of models Nonetheless, Meta’s recent research has AI experts excited. Andrej Karpathy, the former Sr. Director of AI at Tesla and now a lead AI engineer at OpenAI, chimed in as well on the paper. This is “promising,” he wrote on Twitter. “Everyone should hope that we can throw away tokenization in LLMs. Doing so naively creates (byte-level) sequences that are too long.”","completion":"The aliens are here! They're not coming in spaceships. They're not coming in flying saucers. They're coming in computers. That's right, I said it. The aliens are using computers to take over the world. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking I'm crazy. But I'm not. I've seen the evidence with my own eyes. It all started a few months ago. I was reading an article about a new AI model that had been developed by Meta. The model was called Megabyte, and it was capable of generating text, images, and audio that was indistinguishable from human-created content. I was impressed. I had never seen anything like it before. But then, I started to read more about Megabyte, and I started to get a bad feeling. The article said that Megabyte had been trained on a massive dataset of text and code. The dataset included everything from books and articles to code from open-source projects. That's when it hit me. The aliens are using Megabyte to learn about us. They're using it to learn our language, our culture, and our technology. And once they know everything about us, they'll be able to take over. They'll be able to control our minds, and they'll be able to enslave us. We need to stop them. We need to find a way to destroy Megabyte before it's too late.

Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy[c][d] is a series of games within the Final Fantasy video game franchise. It was primarily developed by series creator and developer Square Enix, which also acted as publisher for all titles. While featuring various worlds and different characters, each Fabula Nova Crystallis game is ultimately based on and expands upon a common mythos focusing on important crystals tied to deities. The level of connection to the mythos varies between each title, with each development team given the freedom to adapt the mythos to fit the context of a game's story. The series, originally announced in 2006 as Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII, consists of seven games across multiple platforms. Final Fantasy XIII, designed as the series' flagship title, was released in 2009. The creative forces behind the series include many developers from previous Final Fantasy titles, including Shinji Hashimoto and Motomu Toriyama. The mythos was conceived and written by Kazushige Nojima. The first games announced for the series were Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XV (as Versus XIII), and Final Fantasy Type-0 (as Agito XIII). All three games went through delays. After Final Fantasy XIII and Type-0's releases, their respective teams used ideas and concepts from development to create additional games. For later games, other studios have been brought in to help with aspects of development. Final Fantasy XV was distanced from the series brand for marketing purposes, though it retains thematic connections. Seven titles, the original three projects and four sequels or spin-offs, have been released as of 2016. The series is complemented by works in related media, including companion books, novelizations, and manga. Final Fantasy XV notably expanded into a multimedia project, spawning a feature film and an original animated webseries. Individual games have generally received a positive reception, although opinions have been more mixed over various aspects of the three Final Fantasy XIII games. Reception of the mythos' use in the released games has also been mixed: while some critics called it confusing or too similar to the lore of the main series, others were impressed by its scope and use. Retrospective opinions on the series have also been mixed.","completion":"Final Fantasy XIII was designed as the flagship title for the series."},{"prompt":"Write a journal entry from an angsty 14-year-old girl who is having a hard time getting along with her friends.

You will need to have different boxes and decide in advance what you will put in each box. You can sort them by year, event, or anything else you want. This will help you decide if you want to keep a dozen pictures of the same event or if you only want to keep the best ones. - Get Others Involved - By getting your family involved, you are lessening the workload on any one person.

And why did he go there? Early in Topeka’s history a small group of women became landowners, controlling some of its most valuable acreage. These powerful women with resonate French names—Josette, Julie, Pelagie, and Victoire—were each deeded one-square-mile tracts along the Kansas River, long before Kansas was a territory. Their mothers were Kansa and these women were among 23 mixed-blood Kaws who received special reservations. Their grandfather, White Plume, was a Kaw chief who joined in signing the treaty of 1825. His participation secured land for his mixed-blood grandchildren and their heirs. In a letter to William Clark, superintendent of Indian Affairs, White Plume wrote: I consider myself an American and my wife an American woman—I want to take her home with me and have everything like white people At the time of the treaty, the family lived at Kawsmouth, the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, near what today is Kansas City. The treaty of 1825 assigned the Kaws to a reservation 30 miles north-to-south beginning just west of present Topeka and extending far into present western Kansas. Louis Gonville, a French trader, arrived at Kawsmouth in 1807 to hunt and trap along the Kansas River. Gonville married White Plume’s daughter, Hunt Jimmy, and they had two daughters, Josette and Julie. When their marriage ended around 1818, Gonville married White Plume’s younger daughter, Wyhesee. Several children were born to this marriage—it appears only Pelagie and Victoire lived to adulthood. The 23 \\"half-breed tracts,\\" as they were called, began at the eastern edge of the 1825 reservation extending 23 miles east on the north bank of the Kansas River, from present-day Topeka nearly to Lawrence. Josette and Julie received tracts three and four, Pelagie and Victoire received tracts five and six. Josette, also known as May Josephine, moved to the Kansas City, Missouri, area when she was young to live with the Chouteau family. There she served as an interpreter. Around 1839, Josette married Joseph Pappan. Soon after Julie married Louis Pappan, Victoire married Achan Pappan, and Pelagie married Francoeur (Francois) d'Aubry, who is also known as \\"Amable Fracoeur de Aubri,\\" \\"Fronkier,\\" and \\"Mab Frankier.\\" The families moved to their tracts in the spring of 1840. Seizing an opportunity, the Pappan brothers began a ferry business to transport travelers across the river. Begun around 1841, the first ferry consisted of one or two log canoes, which were propelled by long poles. The Pappan’s ferry business prospered as more people headed west, until flooding destroyed the ferry and log cabin in June 1844. Following their loss, the Pappans lived in Kansas City until about 1849, when they returned to discover a competing ferry along the river. They purchased a franchise and resumed their business. The value of the bottomland had greatly increased by the 1850s and the Pappans received many offers to sell their land. Julie Pappan was a wealthy landowner. She and Louis lived comfortably in their log cabin and cultivated between 15 and 20 acres of the prime bottomland. Their daughter Ellen married to Oren Curtis, had two children, Charles and Elizabeth. In an effort to secure the future of her grandchildren, Julie left 40 acres to her daughter and grandchildren, omitting her son-in-law’s name from the deed. When Ellen died a few months later, legal battles ensued. The minor children, Charles and Elizabeth Curtis, were eventually awarded the deed to the property in 1875. Julie sold her remaining property by 1865 and she and Louis lived their remaining years on the Kaw Reservation near Council Grove.","completion":"Louis Gonville, a French trader, arrived at Kawsmouth in 1807 to hunt and trap along the Kansas River."},{"prompt":"Give me 5 low-sugar smoothie options.

He's not old enough to work at an establishment, so can you help think of some side jobs he could do and be paid in cash?","completion":"It's great that your son is hard-working and responsible. Here are some money-generating ideas that might help him: • Yard work: Many people have trouble taking excellent care of their yards throughout the season. The summer heat makes it difficult to maintain a yard's appearance, especially for the elderly. In spring, gardens will need to be tilled and flowers should be planted before the heat arrives. In summer, the grass grows quickly and most yards will need to be mowed at least once a week. Weeds grow continuously and will need to be trimmed or pulled. • Animal care: It's common for busy day-shifters to hire dog walkers to care for their dogs during the day and give them exercise and attention. It's also possible to wash, bathe, and groom dogs outside in the summer months without the need for special equipment. If your son has experience with reptiles, birds, rabbits, or other household pets, those opportunities might be better. When families go on summer vacation, they often need someone to look after their pets and homes. • Home upkeep: Cleaning houses is a year-round opportunity to generate income. The summer months, in particular, are good for repainting items, power washing, and upkeep on exteriors. Fences may need patching and new rocks spread in driveways. • Tutoring: Many parents worry that their children will forget what they've learned during the school year. In the absence of a formal summer school, weekly tutoring can help get children back on track and ready for the next grade level. If your son excels in academics, he can ask for recommendations from his teachers to help others before the school year ends. • Selling items: If your child has accumulated clothes and toys that they've outgrown or no longer need, a yard sale may be a way to generate income. If someone else in your neighborhood is having a yard sale, they could also contribute baked goods or lemonade for sale to generate a profit. This could be a beneficial lesson in economics too. I hope one of these works for your son!"},{"prompt":"In Greek mythology, who was Prometheus and what was he known for?","completion":"In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a Titan known for his intelligence and as a champion of humankind.

Navel-gazing dramas about the human condition are fine, and I know most critics' lists would give preference to those sorts of films, but this movie has a little bit of everything and is easily among the most perfect films ever made. It doesn't matter if you're a kid or a grown-up. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic that has appeal for every open-hearted person out there. It's full of iconic lines, songs, characters, and moments. It's had a cultural impact few films do. So many things from the film have made their way into our everyday lives and language. If I had to single out one thing about it I love more than the memorable characters played by an ideal cast, exuberant Arlen & Harburg songs, delightful story, and beautiful sets, costumes, and matte painting backdrops, it would be the vibrant and rich Technicolor. It's such a gorgeous looking movie. Funny, sentimental, sincere -- it's a masterpiece that I've been in love with since I was a little kid. I've never grown tired of it and I hope I never do. 16 out of 17 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink","completion":"It is likely they gave it a full ten stars.

Zombies were everywhere. Maurice could smell the rot emanating from their bodies as their teeth snapped in growls behind him. His rational mind broke free from the chaos to let him know it was only a dream, but he couldn't escape from the pull of the nightmare. He felt implanted in the horror of it all, and that's when he spotted a cabin up ahead. He ran for his life, not daring to look back until he reached the cabin door and banged on it for the occupants to let him in. As the door opened, he felt his sleeping body quake in reality, but his mind frayed at the seams as he screamed in the face of the rotten, smiling corpse that answered his knocks."},{"prompt":"Can you write two paragraphs about why improper watering can cause a snake plant's leaves to turn yellow? Please use a neutral, semi-formal tone and write at an 11th grade reading level.","completion":"Improper watering is among the most common causes of yellowing leaves in snake plants. Chronic overwatering often causes the plant's roots to suffocate in the oversaturated soil. When this happens, the roots cannot absorb water and nutrients properly, leading to yellowing leaves and stunted growth. Furthermore, overwatering also creates favorable conditions for bacterial and fungal infections, which further damage the plant. On the other hand, underwatering can also lead to snake plants' leaves turning yellow. When the plant doesn't get enough water, it cannot perform photosynthesis efficiently, which leads to a lack of chlorophyll production in the leaves. This results in yellowed leaves that eventually dry out and fall off. Additionally, underwatering causes the soil to become compact and dry, making it difficult for the roots to absorb water and nutrients. Therefore, giving your snake plant the appropriate amount of water is essential to maintain healthy leaves and overall plant growth."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this paragraph without any negativity. The Little Mermaid, like Disney’s other live-action adaptations of its animated classics, is an engine running on nostalgia. While it is full of heart, that spirit is owed in a major way to the iconic music and ever-relatable story of the original. Nothing that was added in to pad out its runtime to a whopping two hours feels entirely necessary. It’s not that this version of The Little Mermaid is bad – it’s arguably one of the better live action Disney remakes – it's that, beyond Halle Bailey’s incredible performance as Princess Ariel, there’s little here that makes as much of an impact as the same moments in the animated version.","completion":"Disney's latest live-action adaptation of another animated classic continues its streak of success, bringing the classic tale The Little Mermaid to life. The two-hour remake is packed full of memorable moments, fan-favorite songs, and, most importantly, nostalgia for those older viewers. The casting here was phenomenal, with lead-star Halle Bailey showing an incredible performance as the Disney Princess Ariel. Full of the same emotion and heart as the original animated tale, Disney's live-action remake of The Little Mermaid has clearly made its claim as one of the best live-action remakes yet by the company."},{"prompt":"Two adventurers aboard a cargo steamer experience an ominous journey, encountering a disappearance and unraveling dark secrets. Write about it.","completion":"I wake to a luminous shell-pink sky. You raise your head and look around, startled, trying to get your bearings. I point to Komodo Island, just visible in the dawn light. The sea is calm-silver-blue, with a pink sheen. We're aboard a grumbling old steamer carrying cargo from Timor to Bali. Its rusting hull, grimy-grey superstructure, and stained smokestack are clear signs of neglect, but we're young, curious, and carefree; our vision is rose-tinted. We pass close to a long arc of pink sand and marvel at the contrast with the clear turquoise water. The pinkness intensifies at the water's edge where tiny coral fragments wash back and forth in the tide. We're absorbed, unprepared for the news that a tourist has disappeared while exploring the island. Only his hat, camera, and a bloodstained shoe have been found. As the tropical sun rises, we retreat to the shade. The drum of the engine lulls us to sleep. I dream of a Komodo dragon with a dripping red maw. I'm running over pink sand, and I smell its rank breath. I wake up sweating and afraid. I try to eat lunch, but the sight of white rice, clumps of tiny pink shrimp, and red chili repulses me. You sense my distress, and we make our way to the bow to keep watch for Sumbawa, the next port of call. For the first time, I realize the lifeboats are empty — no ropes or life jackets — and I want to go home."},{"prompt":"I live with someone who recently discovered they need to avoid eating nightshades for their health.

Longer, really. She knew what it meant when the letter arrived in the mailbox, and yet she still felt unprepared to accept it. After staring at the cool white document for what felt like forever, she opened the envelope and her worst fears were confirmed. The letter plainly announced that her grandmother had passed away. The grief hit Lily like a ton of bricks as soon as she read those words on paper; every memory with her beloved grandmother flooded back into her mind in an instant - from baking cookies together in Grandma’s kitchen to sharing stories around the campfire during their summer vacations. The idea of never being able to experience these moments again was overwhelming. Too much for Lily to bear at the moment, and suddenly tears streamed down her cheeks without her even recognizing it was happening. In time, however, Lily began learning how to cope with this loss by leaning on family and friends who supported each other through difficult times such as these. With their help, she slowly started healing emotionally from within; although things would never be quite the same without Grandma there, Lily found strength knowing that all those wonderful memories they shared together will remain forever etched in her heart. This event shaped Lilly's character significantly throughout life; not only did it teach valuable lessons about resilience but also reminded me how important it is to cherish loved ones while they are here because nothing lasts forever."},{"prompt":"I'm going to Egypt and I want to see some of the historical stuff there.

It is the 4th highest of the pyramids, and it doesn't tend to have too much of a crowd. - Abu Simbel - This is a twin temple in southern Egypt that was carved out of a mountainside.

Nothing was known about what would come next; only conjecture, theory, and scientific \\"best guesses.\\" These were all that was offered to Field when he attended his first briefing before becoming the first human to ever traverse through a black hole. Now, after innumerable briefings, tests, and dry runs over three years, Field was in a metal egg that was heading toward the black hole. A large, stable, black hole formed several years earlier and prompted scientists to create this project. Sending a human rather than a robot or other measurement devices had already been done in the past with positive results. On one occasion the video camera capturing its descent into the black hole was able to reach the other side of it unharmed, and it recorded invaluable information within that would lead them to determine that travel through the black hole would be safe. However, the scientists still wanted a real person going through this, to act as a pioneer who would venture into a new (metaphorical) land and discover what was inside. Field quickly approached the black hole's event horizon but felt no adverse effects. Scientists determine before the trip, that Field would not experience the normal \\"spaghettification\\" of his body in this particular black hole. The geometry of it which made it stable also acted as a sort of tunnel that protected matter going into it and preserved information and matter. This phenomenon allowed the matter to come back out of the black hole at a later time. As Field circled the drain of the black hole, he began to see bright lights deep in its center, like radiation. Field continued his journey to the center of the black hole as cameras and other instruments documented his descent into darkness. It had been several days since Field was swallowed up by the black hole, and there was no sign of him yet."},{"prompt":"I need some suggestions for fun things to do with the family this summer that we can do in our own backyard.

The President's most elite sorcerers had warned that the box shouldn't be opened under any circumstances. It was crafted by the great and wise magicians of an era long past. No one could guess what it contained, but the mere temptation to open it necessitated great security measures. Today, Penny would open Pandora's Box and discover the secret of the ancients. Her plan was relatively simple, exploiting a fatal flaw of the Alchemists' Sanctum: there was only a single vulnerable security check for invisibility spells. Penny crept into the building, hopped into an elevator with a maintenance staff member, and slipped past the first door unnoticed. The big problem would be getting past the invisibility sensor: an array of lasers that would give her away, but Penny had a plan for that. The laser array to detect invisibility was unmanned; she would simply transform herself into one of the employees, revealing herself for a brief moment. She held her breath as she went through the lasers, taking the form of one of the chief Alchemists. The guard station would notice her passing, but she had accounted for that, too. As soon as she was past, she turned herself invisible again. She dashed to the guard station, which, thank goodness, had been left open. The guard was looking where the Alchemist should have been walking up to the station. He had no idea that Penny was right behind him with sleeping powder. One nighty-night later, she was in the final room with Pandora's Box. Her time was short if she was going to pull off this heist. She allowed herself an excited little tremble of the fingers before she pried the lid open. Dumbfounded, she picked up the protection talisman. This was it? Protection talismans were extremely common, almost ubiquitous, and worth nothing. She checked the back, checked it from all sides—even tried a reveal spell just to be sure. She held it in her hands, unsure what to do next. Eventually, she put the talisman in the box and made a swift escape. She couldn't help but chuckle as she retreated safely. This was the best-kept secret in the world, and only she knew that it was a massive prank."},{"prompt":"Which father and son both served as Prime Minister of Canada?","completion":"Pierre Trudeau and Justin Trudeau, father and son, have both served as Prime Ministers of Canada.

But advances in digital therapies, using games and virtual reality, can make rehabilitation easier and are encouraging patients to make faster progress. Amputees can suffer from severe phantom limb pain as well as coordination problems caused by losing an arm or leg. To address this, neurotechnology company MindMaze created a virtual reality experience that fools the patient’s brain into thinking their severed limb is still attached, helping them to manage the pain. The company also develops games using body motion capture cameras and movement sensors to rehabilitate patients and restore movement. Thousands have received MindMaze gaming therapy in clinics around the world. And crucially, VR and games are an injection of fun into what could be an uncomfortable, difficult and tiring process. Stroke patients struggling to recover movement, fine motor skills, and cognitive function can work their way back to fitness with the help of an animated dolphin character in ‘MindPod’. The game uses an anti-gravity vest that lifts the arm and makes it easier to control the dolphin in its undersea environment, or even do backflips out of the water. Games like MindPod are also being used to address degenerative brain conditions such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease, and dementia. The US Department of Defence has funded a trial to see how it can prevent dementia for war veterans with traumatic brain injury. Serious physical and neurological disorders mean that therapeutic games need to be built on solid foundations. University of California San Francisco (UCSF) video game research showed that games could be used to help older people improve their cognitive control and multitasking skills. NeuroRacer was a simple 3D racing game developed at the university that showed how, in just hours, games training could reverse certain negative effects of aging, and might also help with disorders like ADHD and depression. Now it seems the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the uptake of gaming therapies. Remote treatments make more sense when there is already reduced contact with doctors. In June 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration approved its first game-based therapeutic device for children with ADHD, the EndeavorRx, based on the UCSF’s groundbreaking research. Gaming companies have been looking to develop games for the health and fitness market for more than a decade. Commercial entries, from Kinect and Xbox to Nintendo Ring Fit, show how seriously the video console and gaming industry wants to be involved. DeepWell Digital Therapeutics has unveiled plans to build on existing games research into ADHD and depression to release its own range. While these games are unlikely to be a replacement for medication or in-person care, they can certainly help fill in gaps in care. Boston Children’s Hospital certainly takes the digital therapy trend seriously. Clinicians worked with the Harvard Medical School to create the gaming company Mightier and road test its strategies. The result was gaming technology that showed kids how to handle stressful situations and change their behavior. The hospital now uses gaming in family therapy and mental health sessions, showing doctors’ commitment to digital therapies. And the games industry is happy to follow suit to make gaming for wellness another option for inpatient treatment.","completion":"Many human lose limb, get stroke, get hurt.

I'm here to help you with budgeting, so you're in the right place. The first step is to gather information about your income and expenses. List your sources of income and track your monthly expenses, including bills, groceries, transportation, and any other regular payments. This will give you a clear picture of your financial situation and help you identify areas where you can save or cut back."},{"prompt":"Thanks! I'm also curious about investing. What are some basic investment options for beginners?","completion":"That's a great question, and investing can be a powerful way to grow your wealth over time. For beginners, it's important to start with low-risk options. Consider opening a tax-advantaged retirement account like an IRA or participating in an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan if available. Additionally, you can explore index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which provide diversification and are relatively easy to understand."},{"prompt":"I'm concerned about the risks associated with investing. How can I minimize them?","completion":"It's natural to be cautious about investment risks, and it's wise to take steps to minimize them. One key strategy is diversification. Spread your investments across different asset classes and sectors to reduce the impact of any single investment's performance. Regularly review your portfolio and consider rebalancing to maintain an appropriate asset allocation. Additionally, staying informed and keeping up with market trends can help you make informed decisions. If you're unsure, consulting with a qualified financial advisor can provide valuable insights tailored to your specific circumstances."},{"prompt":"Pretend you're a person who has no car. Create a narrative description for your local bus station using less than 300 words. It's kind of an eyesore, run down and tucked away behind an abandoned shopping mall, but though others may scoff at it, you still have a favorable opinion as it gives you a sense of freedom.","completion":"It’s nothing more than a long strip of cement lined with metallic pink benches behind the husk of an old shopping mall, but for many, it is a gateway to new experiences. No matter the time of day, there are always people coming and going, hopping onto buses adorned with wacky advertisements and flashing white route numbers. Often times you can see people sleeping on or underneath the benches or feeding the already fat street pigeons. Ever since the mall closed down, it’s been kind of a free-for-all at this bus station. No security guards or rule enforcers, just one person crammed into a tiny green ticket booth behind bulletproof glass. Most people don’t mind. They’re just trying to get where they need to go, but every once in a while you’ll find someone who clearly isn’t accustomed to public transportation clutching their pearls at the rundown nature of it all. Where a seasoned traveler would look upon this place and think, “Sweet! A place to sit down!” The average person would be more concerned with the reddish brown splotches on the cracked sidewalk and the thick layer of dust and grime over everything. There was also the way the sun beat directly onto the metal benches without any barriers, meaning they were hot enough to scorch your skin in the dead of summer. Still, that seemed like a small price to pay in exchange for a 2 trip across a massive city. For many people, this “eyesore” is their ticket to freedom. It allows them to commute to school or work, go to the doctor, and visit their families, all the things that so many people with cars take for granted."},{"prompt":"Write me a simple love story of about 400 words about Christine and John. They meet and fall in love years after John became infatuated with her after seeing her picture in the newspaper, but he doesn't realize it was her until he sees a framed copy of the newspaper in her home.","completion":"As a teenager, Christine loved taking her dog for a run in the park. One warm spring day, a newspaper photographer was in the park and asked Christine if he could take her picture. The next day, the front page of the paper featured a full-color picture of Christine and her dog, running through a cascade of water from sprinklers at the park. It was a beautiful photo of a young woman full of youth and vitality. John was a shy teenager in the same city, and he also enjoyed running. He saw Christine’s photo and was instantly struck by it. There was something that drew him to the girl in the picture and he wondered who she was. John tucked the picture away in his desk drawer and thought about the girl in the picture often. She became his unattainable ideal, and no other girl could quite measure up to this ideal. The years passed, and Christine and John grew up and moved on. Christine married young and had two children, then found herself divorced and a single parent. John never married but went on to study law and then spent long hours at his law practice. Both of them kept running. About ten years after high school, John and Christine both entered a marathon in their city. On the day of the race, Christine struck up a conversation with John and they agreed to meet up after the marathon. That was the beginning of several meetings and dates. Eventually, Christine knew it was time to bring John home and introduce him to her children. Christine invited John to her apartment for dinner, and her two boys took to John immediately. While Christine finished up the dinner preparations, the kids gave John a tour of the apartment. The hall leading to the bedrooms was a photo gallery of family pictures, and John stopped to look. His eyes were drawn to a framed picture from a newspaper. It suddenly dawned on him that this picture of a girl running with her dog was one that he had saved from the newspaper so many years before, and this was his dream girl. Reading the caption below the photo, he realized it was Christine and his dream had come true."},{"prompt":"What should I do in Italy?

Achieving this milestone was a very difficult struggle and victory took decades of protest and agitation to achieve. Several generations of woman suffrage supporters lectured, wrote, marched lobbied, and practiced civil disobedience for years before the radical change to the Constitution would take place. Very first of the early supporters of the cause lived to see the final victory occur in 1920."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this self-help note into a series of comedic anecdotes and exaggerated situations It's disappointing to feel sad for no reason. Sadness can be almost pleasantly indulgent when you have a way to justify it - you can listen to sad music and imagine yourself as the protagonist in a dramatic movie. You can gaze out the window while you're crying and think \\"This is so sad. I can't even believe how sad this whole situation is. I bet even a reenactment of my sadness could bring an entire theater audience to tears.\\" But my sadness didn't have a purpose. Listening to sad music and imagining that my life was a movie just made me feel kind of weird because I couldn't really get behind the idea of a movie where the character is sad for no reason. Essentially, I was being robbed of my right to feel self-pity, which is the only redeeming part of sadness. And for a little bit, that was a good enough reason to pity myself. Standing around feeling sorry for myself was momentarily exhilarating, but I grew tired of it quickly. \\"That will do,\\" I thought. \\"I've had my fun, let's move on to something else now.\\" But the sadness didn't go away. I tried to force myself to not be sad. But trying to use willpower to overcome the apathetic sort of sadness that accompanies depression is like a person with no arms trying to punch themselves until their hands grow back. A fundamental component of the plan is missing and it isn't going to work.","completion":"Have you ever felt sad for absolutely no reason? Like you wake up one day and your mood is just down in the dumps, and you're like, \\"Why, Brian? Why are you doing this to me?\\" It's like your emotions decided to throw a surprise party and the only theme is sadness. I reasoned that perhaps I could take advantage of this peculiar circumstance. I started listening to depressing music and pretended that my life was a dramatic film. I'm referring to emotional scenes, heart-wrenching monologues, the whole nine yards. I even stood next to the window and stared out sadly as tears run down my face. Wow, I'm so depressed right now, I thought. This sorrow is deserving of an Oscar. But here is the kicker, my sadness had no purpose. it was like being the star of a movie with a plot that makes no sense. Who wants to watch a character whining about nothing in particular? Even I was unable to support that notion. And let me tell you, it is blatantly unfair to be denied the ability to feel sorry for oneself. That's the only silver lining in sadness folks. But okay, I thought, maybe it's time to snap out of it. I mean, standing around feeling sorry for myself was momentarily thrilling, but it got old real quick. I was like, \\"Alright, self-pity party, you've had your moment in the spotlight. Time to pack up and find a new hobby.\\" But guess what? The sadness didn't budge an inch. I tried to force myself not to be sad. I used all my willpower, like a superhero trying to defeat the apathetic sadness that comes with depression. But let me tell you, it's like a person with no arms trying to punch themselves until their hands grow back. It's a flawed plan, my friends. You're missing a vital component, and it ain't gonna work. Trust me, I've tried. Therefore, if you ever feel depressed for no apparent reason, keep in mind that it's okay to wallow in your misery even if you do not know why your emotions are having a pity party. Just be realistic about your expectations and refrain from trying to punch yourself in the face with your own fictitious hands for the sake of humor."},{"prompt":"Who are the independent members of the U.S. Senate?","completion":"There are three members of the U.S. Senate whose political affiliation is listed as Independent: Sen.

However, the caveat is that Rust's println macro automatically adds a new line, so the trailing new lines you would pass in would be one less than you would want. There's no straightforward way to have no newline at all."},{"prompt":"I want to make pasta tonight but I'm not sure what type of sauce I should make.

Add colored lights throughout the office. This might not work for everyone, but some easy visual stimulus can go far in bringing you out of the midday doldrums. Lights that can change colors can be great for multiple scenarios, not just office time. They're relatively inexpensive and easy to set up. 3. Bring your walls to life with art. If you have the money, this can be a great way to perk up your space. There are a wide variety of frames, types of art, and even frameless options available. Enjoy classical artists like Van Gogh, bring modern works from Warhol and Basquiat into the office, or toss up some posters from your favorite films. 4. Plants are a tried and true way of adding some easy enjoyment and relaxation. Artificial plants can be a low-maintenance way of sprucing up things, but if you prefer the real deal, small potted plants don't require too much work and can be very soothing. 5. Choose a theme. Creating a consistent theme for your home office can go a long way toward easing your stress and making you feel truly comfortable during the day. Sports fans can give their space a local team feel, while lovers of literature can add a book-filled bookshelf or two along with some small figurines or paperweights."},{"prompt":"Create a short sorrowful story featuring a grieving widow and focusing on the themes of life after death and acceptance.","completion":"Martha was always a believer in the hereafter. She had always thought that the soul was separate from the body and that life went on after death. But after her dear John passed away, she realized that she was having trouble accepting both his departure and the idea that he was no longer in her life. Despite her best efforts, Martha spent her days going through the motions and felt unfulfilled. One night, the sound of activity in the room surprised her. She sat up with her heart racing and looked down to see a dark figure standing at the foot of her bed. John appeared. Martha watched in shock as her late husband's physique began to take shape. Even though he appeared to be comprised of mist, he nevertheless had the same appearance as when he was alive. When he grinned at her, Martha's eyes began to hurt from the tears. Is that truly you, John? She muttered. He gestured, and Martha needed to ask him countless things, yet her words were caught in her throat. John expressed, \\"I'm here to tell you that I'm fine. You don't have to stress over an existence without me.\\" Martha was hearing things that she was unable to accept. He remained in the room with her, providing her with assurance and comfort. She asked, \\"Is this real?\\" as she reached for him. She felt warmth emanating from him even though her fingers went straight through his body. John remarked, \\"It's as real as you need it to be. But you have to acknowledge that I've left.\\" With tears running down her face, Martha nodded. She had a gut feeling that John was correct. She had to stop clinging to him and stop letting his passing overtake her. It was time to accept his death and carry on.

The bear needs to be brown. Include details about the flower, smell, appearance, color, etc. Don't use an excessive amount of description or be cliched. The flower makes the bear feel happier at the end.","completion":"Theo plodded along his usual path to the stream for a drink. His day had not started well at all. His friends were mad at him for ruining their game of hide and seek yesterday, and they were still mad at him today. He was told couldn't play with them that day and that he should go away. The path to the stream was well-worn, though the branches of the trees overhead had droopy branches that almost always snagged his brown fur. Of course, that happened today, which made Theo more upset. He heard the stream before he saw it. It was a fast stream and further up the hill, it was broken up with rocks that made several areas churning rapids. He liked the stream and couldn't think of a better place to spend his sad day alone. The cold water rushed around his muzzle when he dipped it in to take a big drink. It tickled a little. Satisfied, he plopped down next to the stream and laid his head on his paws, watching the rushing water flow by. The sound was calming and he felt himself drifting toward a nap. A branch snapped loudly and he was suddenly alert. He looked around but didn't see a threat. However, he did see something he hadn't noticed before. There was a small, purplish-blue flower nestled in the grass and pebbles near the river bank. It had some white streaks on the petals and the middle of it was a bright yellow that made Theo smile. He inched closer to it and sniffed it gently. It had a soft and pleasant smell that lifted Theo's mood. He was happy he had wandered to the stream that day. He would keep the flower company for a while, enjoying its aroma and pretty petals, and then go find his friends so he could show the flower to them. They would love it too and not be mad at Theo anymore. Feeling content, Theo rested near the flower and appreciated its beauty."},{"prompt":"Where do Vikings come from?","completion":"Like, doy!

I’m just Desti. I am a nurse at Clearwater Valley Community Hospital, and I’ve been working to help manage coma patients for the past two years. I’m currently on the night shift, which involves monitoring my patients’ vital signs, keeping an eye on the ventilators, and giving medications. It is usually very quiet, which is how I like it. It started out like any other night—nothing out of the ordinary. Trina, the nurse who was responsible for updating me when I arrived, had nothing to report. There had been no changes with any of the seven patients we were monitoring, so it looked like it was going to be an easy night. When Mike Clarke came in at 9 p.m. to say goodnight to his wife, I waved to him as he headed down the hall toward her room. He had checked in downstairs, and I knew him well. He had been coming to the hospital five nights a week, Monday through Friday, for as long as I had been working there. As far as I knew, he had never missed a night, at least when I was on duty. He usually stayed about half an hour, read Julie a story or just sat with her and held her hand, and left. it was so sweet and also heartbreaking. She had been in a coma for over two years, but he never gave up hope. I was surprised when he came to the nurses' station after only a minute, and even more surprised by his following question: “Where’s Julie? She’s not in her room.”"},{"prompt":"Tell me about the first amendment.","completion":"The first amendment protects freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and the right to assembly.

A qualified and trained behavior analyst (BCBA) designs and directly oversees the program. They customize the ABA program to each learner's skills, needs, interests, preferences and family situation. The BCBA will start by doing a detailed assessment of each person’s skills and preferences. They will use this to write specific treatment goals. Family goals and preferences may be included, too. Treatment goals are written based on the age and ability level of the person with ASD. Goals can include many different skill areas, such as: Communication and language Social skills Self-care (such as showering and toileting) Play and leisure Motor skills Learning and academic skills The instruction plan breaks down each of these skills into small, concrete steps. The therapist teaches each step one by one, from simple (e.g. imitating single sounds) to more complex (e.g. carrying on a conversation). The BCBA and therapists measure progress by collecting data in each therapy session. Data helps them to monitor the person’s progress toward goals on an ongoing basis. The behavior analyst regularly meets with family members and program staff to review information about progress.

There is plenty to see and explore around Kiyomizudera. - Kinkaku-ji: Kinkaku-ji is also known as the Golden Pavilion. This is the most visited temple in Kyoto.

The temple is covered in Gold Foil and is said to represent spiritual purity. - Ginkaku-ji: This is the sister temple to the Kinkaku-ji and is also known as the Silver Pavillion. The foliage of the temple grounds completely hides the outside world, giving the temple a secluded feel. There is a sand garden with a cone structure that is said to represent Mount Fuji. - Nanzen-ji: Nanzen-ji is famous for its gateless gate. It’s a wooden structure that sits above the temple grounds. The platform is a great place to rest and absorb the temple and scenery. You can climb up to the balcony for a small fee. It also features an aqueduct that is one of Kyoto’s most photogenic spots. - Kennin-ji: Kennin-ji is in the Geisha District, one of the most famous areas of Kyoto.

He was scheduled to go to a one-week summer camp this year, and the idea made him nervous. What if he got there and didn't make any friends? What if the camp counselors were mean? Would he get poison ivy or mosquito bites and be miserable itching? What if he had trouble going to sleep? Trevor's mom showed him pictures and things past campers said about the camp. The kids said they had a great time! They talked about how fun it was to hike, fish, do crafts, and go swimming in a lake. They also liked camp food and telling stories at night around a campfire. They said the camp counselors were very nice. And nobody had trouble with poison ivy or bugs! Trevor's mom bought him a new duffel bag for his camp clothes. His dad helped him pack and then took him to the camp. He said he went to summer camp when he was Trevor's age and that he went back every year because he had so much fun. When they got to camp, Trevor unrolled his sleeping bag and put down his duffel bag, and then everybody met at the mess hall for lunch. They had huge ham sandwiches, their choice of potato chips, a chocolate chip cookie -- Trevor's favorite -- and cold iced lemonade. After lunch, they broke into groups and went on a hike. The counselor pointed out squirrels, a woodpecker, frogs, and some interesting bugs. They went back to camp and made a fan out of palmetto leaves to help keep them cool. After they washed up, it was time for a weenie roast around the campfire. The counselors told some stories, and then everyone went back to their bunks for bed. Trevor was so tired from being busy all day that he went to sleep as soon as his head hit the pillow. In the morning, he was so excited to see what they would do next that he almost jumped out of his bunk!

Brownie loved all of his toys, his owners, and the delicious meals that they would give him, but the thing he loved most about life was the time he got to spend outside. When Brownie went outside, he experienced a pleasant sensory overload. Being greeted by the smells of plants, wildlife, and more, he never knew if he wanted to begin sniffing everything or if he wanted to try to chase as many squirrels as he could! Making up his mind was always such a challenge until one day, Brownie noticed something different about his excursion outdoors. While sniffing a group of his favorite plants by the fence, Brownie noticed another dog on the other side of the fence! When he got closer to get a better look, he was met with an energetic bark. Brownie was so excited that his tail began to wag incredibly fast as if he could fly with it. This marked the day that Brownie made a new, mysterious best friend, and each day they would run alongside the fence, bark at each other, and steal glances at each other from time to time. Brownie would eagerly get up and stand by the door any time that his humans would get up in hopes that they would let him out so he could play by the fence for a while. This would go on and on for months until the day his humans let him roam the front yard instead of the backyard. On this glorious day, Brownie was overwhelmed by all of his new options on the front lawn that never dawned on him when he was adventuring in the backyard. As he began to survey his surroundings, a familiar scent traveled toward his nose. As he went to follow it, he was soon met by the mystery pup next door! Both dogs began to frantically jump around and wag their tails in excitement. They went on to have a fun hour of playtime that would soon become a regular thing for the two.

He didn’t get along with humans very well, but he was very talented at watching them and spent many days inventing stories in his mind about the passers-by. While his people-watching and story-making brought him joy, he was very lonely and desperately wished he had someone to share his stories with. One day Enjamin came across a poster advertising a story-writing competition, and he thought that if he could prove himself in that competition he could meet the sort of friend he was looking for. Enjamin sought out a new subject for his people-watching and began to follow a particular boy around the city to observe for inspiration. The boy, Leo, eventually realized he was being followed and confronted Enjamin, but despite Enjamin's awkward social ineptitude Leo came to find the goblin fun to talk with. While Enjamin never exactly came clean about why he was following Leo, he nevertheless continued to spend time together with him as Leo enjoyed listening to his stories and people-watching with him. Leo and Enjamin enjoyed their time together for several weeks, but eventually, Leo stumbled across Enjamin's writing and discovered that Enjamin had been writing about him. After confronting Enjamin with this and learning about the writing contest, Leo felt hurt and used and told Enjamin that he didn't want to hang out anymore. The goblin begged Leo to change his mind, but he refused. After Leo left him that day, Enjamin tossed his story away into the gutter and decided that he would not enter the contest as he didn't feel he could be happy winning it at the expense of having hurt Leo's feelings. The next day, Leo passed by the cast-away story while walking to school, and realized what must have transpired. While he was still upset with Enjamin, he didn't want to see the goblin hurt, so he gathered the scattered pages and entered them into the competition just before the entry deadline. The goblin's story ended up placing fourth in the contest, and Leo hunted down Enjamin to share the news. And even though he didn't win the contest, that is when Enjamin realized he had won something far more important than that. He had won a friend."},{"prompt":"I want to start a vegetable garden this summer. I live in the northeast United States. What are the best vegetables to plant for a beginner?","completion":"Here are some good ones to start with: 1. Peas and pole beans: install a trellis, plant your seeds, and keep them watered. Peas should be planted as early as possible, but you should wait until the soil is at least 60 degrees for the beans. 2. Chard and kale: these can be used for cooking and salads. Leaves can be harvested when the plants are about one foot tall and continue to be harvested well into the fall. 3. Radishes: can be planted at any time of the year and harvested in 30 days. 4. Baby lettuce and salad mixes: sow the seeds in a 2-3 inch-wide band, water, and harvest in 30-40 days. 5. Basil: plant once the soil has warmed to 60 degrees. When the plants reach about 8 inches tall, start harvesting leaves from the bottom up. 6. Scallions: very easy to grow and can be harvested in around 60 days. 7. Summer squash: notoriously simple to grow. Plant two or three seeds in a mound, keep it watered, and check daily for ripe fruit. 8. Peppers: sweet and hot peppers are generally easier to grow than bell peppers. Jalapeno and purple beauty are two of the easiest varieties to grow. 9. Eggplant: Good beginner varieties are little finger, ping tung long, and snowy. Make sure they get plenty of sun. 10. Tomatoes: they need stakes or tomato cages for support, but there are a ton of varieties for beginners to choose from. Bellstar and black cherry are two you might want to try."},{"prompt":"list all the elements in the following list where the name starts with the chemical symbol: NUMBER ELEMENT SYMBOL 89 Actinium Ac 13 Aluminum Al 95 Americium Am 51 Antimony Sb 18 Argon Ar 33 Arsenic As 85 Astatine At 56 Barium Ba 97 Berkelium Bk 4 Beryllium Be 83 Bismuth Bi 107 Bohrium Bh 5 Boron B 35 Bromine Br 48 Cadmium Cd 20 Calcium Ca 98 Californium Cf 6 Carbon C 58 Cerium Ce 55 Cesium Cs 17 Chlorine Cl 24 Chromium Cr 27 Cobalt Co 112 Copernicium Cn 29 Copper Cu 96 Curium Cm NUMBER ELEMENT SYMBOL 89 Actinium Ac 13 Aluminum Al 95 Americium Am 51 Antimony Sb 18 Argon Ar 33 Arsenic As 85 Astatine At 56 Barium Ba 97 Berkelium Bk 4 Beryllium Be 83 Bismuth Bi 107 Bohrium Bh 5 Boron B 35 Bromine Br 48 Cadmium Cd 20 Calcium Ca 98 Californium Cf 6 Carbon C 58 Cerium Ce 55 Cesium Cs 17 Chlorine Cl 24 Chromium Cr 27 Cobalt Co 112 Copernicium Cn 29 Copper Cu 96 Curium Cm","completion":"Sure, here are the elements from your list where the name starts with the chemical symbol: Actinium (Ac) Aluminum (Al) Americium (Am) Argon (Ar) Barium (Ba) Beryllium (Be) Bismuth (Bi) Boron (B) Bromine (Br) Calcium (Ca) Carbon (C) Cerium (Ce) Cobalt (Co)"},{"prompt":"Hey Marshall, how are you?","completion":"...Oh, hello there!

The age-old question actually has an answer—it's both! Tomatoes are fruits that are considered vegetables by nutritionists. Botanically, a fruit is a ripened flower ovary and contains seeds. Tomatoes, plums, zucchinis, and melons are all edible fruits, but things like maple “helicopters” and floating dandelion puffs are fruits too. For some reason, people got hung up on tomatoes, but the “fruit or vegetable” question could also work for any vegetable with seeds. Now, nutritionally, the term “fruit” is used to describe sweet and fleshy botanical fruits, and “vegetable” is used to indicate a wide variety of plant parts that are not so high in fructose. In many cultures, vegetables tend to be served as part of the main dish or side, whereas sweet fruits are typically snacks or desserts. Thus, roots, tubers, stems, flower buds, leaves, and certain botanical fruits, including green beans, pumpkins, and of course tomatoes, are all considered vegetables by nutritionists. There is no hard-and-fast rule that clearly designates a botanical fruit as a vegetable, but, given that tomatoes are generally not used in desserts and are closely related to other fruit-vegetables (e.g., eggplants and peppers), it is not too counterintuitive for tomatoes to be classified as vegetables.","completion":"Despite much debate, a tomato can actually be considered both a fruit and a vegetable depending on who you talk to: botanically, a tomato is a fruit, since it contains seeds and is a ripened flower ovary; but nutritionally, tomatoes are more vegetable-like, since they aren't so high in fructose and tend to be served as part of the main dish or side in meals."},{"prompt":"How many bones are in the human hand?","completion":"The human hand is made up of the wrist, palm, and fingers and consists of 27 bones.

The aliens, 7-foot-tall with long heads no doubt harbored enormous brains, were immediately taken into custody and taken to a holding facility for their eventual deportation. Republicans blamed the interstellar visitors on Democrats and their open border policies. Democrats voted to give the aliens health care insurance and a voucher for Section 8 housing.

Constructive criticism doesn't necessarily mean hurtful. If you want to write a thriller novel, then I assume you’ve read a large number of them, and watched a lot on streaming services, cinemas and TV. As I pointed out in my last post, there are 2 categories of genre: world genres and style genres. Thriller is a style genre, so you need to match it to a world genre, which could be anything from crime to sci-fi to fantasy to espionage. A lot of thrillers are combined with action, especially in the cinema. Personally, I write psychological thrillers in a sci-fi setting. The fundamental ingredient, if you take the recipe approach, is that you need to create suspense and there are a number of ways to do that. Putting someone in jeopardy is the most obvious, but there are more nuanced ways. One of the most subtle yet effective is to give the reader information that the protagonist doesn’t have. For example, in one of my stories, I have a character sent to spy on an antagonist, who finds out. The reader knows this but the protagonist doesn’t. In the same story, this character is then blackmailed into becoming a double-agent and has to live with the constant dread of being found out. You can’t have a thriller without a climax, so ideally there should be no way out until it arrives and then it has to be believable. Thrillers have moral dilemmas, betrayals and twists; that’s why l like them, not only to read and watch, but to write. While the thrillers I write are sci-fi, most of the ones I watch and read are crime.","completion":"The text is helpful.

It had a powerful tail, a huge head and tiny arms. Scientists struggle to work out what the tiny arms were used for because they were too short to reach its mouth and too weak to be of any use in defence or hunting. It is guessed that they may have counterbalanced its enormous head, or they could have been used in mating rituals."},{"prompt":"Give me some suggestions for easy art projects for preschool-aged kids.","completion":"1. Paper Bag Jellyfish - This is a simple and easy art project that preschoolers are sure to love. It works well for promoting hand and eye coordination and cutting skills.

Tissue Paper Apple - SInce apples are often associated with school this is the ideal craft idea to get the new school year started with. Draw an apple outline and have small pieces of red or green tissue paper squares ready to be crumpled and glued to color in the space. 3. Fork Print Tulips - This cute project only requires a fork, heavyweight paper and paint. Use the fork to dip into the paint and create the tulip buds, then paint on the stems.

Add some popsicle sticks to glue to the back and you will have a fun puppet show in no time. 5. Popsicle Stick Rainbow - All you'll need for this craft are some pieces of blue cardstock paper, cotton balls, glue and popsicle sticks. Have your kids color the popsicle sticks so they are every color of the rainbow. Then help them glue the sticks to create a rainbow on the blue paper with clouds at the end. 6.

Cut out strips of construction paper to make the legs and use the paper plate for the body. Have the kids draw eyes and a mouth or use fun googly eyes instead. 7.

The macaroni noodles are easy to place onto a piece of yarn and you can also add large beads to make the necklace even more colorful."},{"prompt":"Write a tweet saying how much fun I'm having in Cabo.

It was rumored to be the best VRMMO to date and was the first game to be released on the second version of the full dive technology. Ryuunosuke bought the VR and game bundle, unable to contain his excitement. The game launched, and he was thrilled by the experience. It was exactly as he expected it to be. The visuals were stunning, the gameplay was beyond fluid, and all the small and awkward bits from the first version of the VR headset had been smoothed out. Ryuunosuke felt like he was playing the game in his own body. It was when he went to log out that he realized something strange. There was no logout button. Where the button should have been was simply blank. He ran back to the starter town to find hundreds or maybe even thousands of players with the same issue. None of them could log out, either. It had everyone in a panic. What was going on? What exactly happened? Was this some kind of bug, or were they simply missing something? As Ryuunosuke asked himself these questions, he recalled the pain he'd felt during the fight with some low-level monsters. He shouldn't have felt that kind of pain. That was beyond the VR headset's capabilities. This wasn't a game anymore, he realized. This was reality. They had all slipped into Angel's Requiem, not as players but as actual people. He didn't know how or why. Ryuunosuke's instincts kicked in. He knew where this would lead. Chaos would break out. People might turn violent. Things weren't going to end well for someone weak.

Include a short history of British afternoon tea, traditional menu items and types of tea served.","completion":"British Afternoon Tea Afternoon tea is a British tradition that dates back to the early 19th century. It was created as a way for upper-class women to have a light meal in the afternoon, as dinner was not served until late in the evening. The meal typically consists of finger sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and jam, and a variety of pastries and cakes. Tea is always the drink of choice. The history of afternoon tea is closely tied to the history of tea itself. In the early 1800s, the Duchess of Bedford began taking tea in the afternoon as a way to stave off hunger before dinner. This custom soon caught on among other members of the upper class, and afternoon tea became a fashionable social event. Traditional afternoon tea is often served in three courses and usually on a three-tiered tray alongside a pot of tea. The three courses are as follows: - First course: A selection of finger sandwiches and savories are offered and are usually prepared with cucumber, egg, or salmon. - Second course: Warm scones are served with clotted cream and preserves. - Third course: A variety of pastries and sweets are provided. Many different types of tea can be served with afternoon tea. Some popular choices include English breakfast tea, Earl Grey tea, and Darjeeling tea. The type of tea served will depend on the personal preferences of the host. Afternoon tea is a popular tradition in England, and it is also enjoyed by people worldwide. It is a great way to enjoy a delicious meal and a cup of tea in a relaxed and elegant setting. Here are some tips for enjoying a traditional British afternoon tea: - Choose a tea room that has a good reputation and offers a wide variety of tea and food options. - Dress in your best attire. Afternoon tea is a formal event, so you should dress appropriately. - Arrive early so that you can have time to relax and enjoy the atmosphere. - Take your time and savor the experience. Afternoon tea is a special occasion, so don't rush through it. Enjoy your British afternoon tea!"},{"prompt":"I need help coming up with dinner ideas. I have some ground beef I'd like to use.

They have feathering on their face, stomach, and legs. Their undercoat can be dense and rough-coated collies need frequent grooming to prevent matting. These dogs may look similar to the iconic Lassie. Smooth-coated border collies have short hair all over and little feathering. Their undercoat may be thinner and they may have straight or wavey outer coats. Their coat is much easier to maintain and this type of coat is often preferred on farms and ranches.

Perform each task in the order of its importance. But some things in life are harder to prioritize. In fact, most of life isn’t so easy to check off a list and get done the way we do tasks at work. It may take some creativity to learn how to make this concept work in your life. It does help to prioritize your tasks though, whether you’re doing laundry or working on a project for your boss. Some people find it easy to do this and others need to make lists. When it comes to building your business or creating your dream, what’s the first and most important job to get done?

Chronosense is a rare and powerful gift that only a few humans possess. It is believed to be a result of a genetic mutation or a divine intervention. Chronosense can be activated by various triggers, such as emotions, dreams, visions, or meditation. Chronosense can also be enhanced by certain objects, such as clocks, calendars, or crystals. Chronosense has its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, it can provide insight, wisdom, and creativity. On the other hand, it can cause confusion, madness, and paradoxes. Chronosense can also have ethical and moral implications, as it can affect the lives of others and the fate of the world.

Napoleon’s Education and Early Military Career Napoleon Bonaparte was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajaccio, on the Mediterranean island of Corsica. He was the second of eight surviving children born to Carlo Buonaparte (1746-1785), a lawyer, and Letizia Romalino Buonaparte (1750-1836). Although his parents were members of the minor Corsican nobility, the family was not wealthy. The year before Napoleon’s birth, France acquired Corsica from the city-state of Genoa, Italy. Napoleon later adopted a French spelling of his last name. As a boy, Napoleon attended school in mainland France, where he learned the French language, and went on to graduate from a French military academy in 1785. He then became a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment of the French army. The French Revolution began in 1789, and within three years revolutionaries had overthrown the monarchy and proclaimed a French republic. During the early years of the revolution, Napoleon was largely on leave from the military and home in Corsica, where he became affiliated with the Jacobins, a pro-democracy political group. In 1793, following a clash with the nationalist Corsican governor, Pasquale Paoli (1725-1807), the Bonaparte family fled their native island for mainland France, where Napoleon returned to military duty. In France, Napoleon became associated with Augustin Robespierre (1763-1794), the brother of revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre (1758-1794), a Jacobin who was a key force behind the Reign of Terror (1793-1794), a period of violence against enemies of the revolution. During this time, Napoleon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the army. However, after Robespierre fell from power and was guillotined (along with Augustin) in July 1794, Napoleon was briefly put under house arrest for his ties to the brothers. In 1795, Napoleon helped suppress a royalist insurrection against the revolutionary government in Paris and was promoted to major general.","completion":"Letizia Romalino Buonaparte gave birth to a son, Napoleon, on August 15, 1769, on the isle of Corsica which had just been taken over by the French. Napoleon’s father, a lawyer and minor Italian noble sent Napoleon, whose last name had been Frenchified to Bonaparte, to school in mainland France. After graduating from a French military academy, Second Lieutenant Bonaparte joined an artillery unit. While on leave in Corsica, Napoleon and his family became affiliated with a pro-democracy group which led to their fleeing to mainland France. Having become associated with the Robespierre brothers who were a force behind the Reign of Terror, Napoleon, who had reached the rank of brigadier general, was briefly arrested in 1794. The next year, he helped put down an insurrection and was promoted to major general."},{"prompt":"Write a blog article about how to improve your home's interior on a budget.

Keep the word count under 300 words.","completion":"If you would like to make some changes to your home’s interior, then a great place to start would be a general cleaning. Once you get each room clean, you can begin to see where you could make improvements. Sometimes, it can be nice to buy new furniture. Sunroom furniture can be used in any room. If this isn't in your budget, then try refurbishing old furniture or replacing cushions. Steam-cleaning furniture can work as well. Below are three more tips to help you improve your home’s interior. Tip One Changing the room’s paint color can give the room a fresher look. You can paint the entire room or just one wall. Create a feature wall in a room using wallpaper. Colors and designs should look cohesive with the rest of the room’s décor. In small rooms, usually, light colors work better. Dark colors make a room appear smaller and closed in. Tip Two New flooring can improve the room’s appearance and make the whole space look better. There are many good choices of flooring, from laminates and hardwoods to marble. If you are working on a strict budget, then you can install flooring yourself. There are many great videos online about how to install different types of flooring. Hardwoods are very popular choices now, but laminates can be more affordable. Tip Three As you continue refurbishing and redoing walls, flooring, and furniture, you may decide to add new drapes as well. Changing out the window treatments often makes a big difference. Use bamboo blinds or wood shutters for an island appeal."},{"prompt":"I’m going to be leading a swing dance and lindy hop workshop and ran out of time to make a playlist.

In March 1723, he managed to escape when the pirates stopped for water on a small island off the coast of Honduras. Stranded and alone, Ashton constructed a shelter and survived on fruit and turtle eggs. In November 1723, he encountered a British man who soon disappeared but left behind essential supplies. Ashton endured months of extreme conditions, including heat, insects, snakes, hunger, fever, and an attack by the Spanish, until he was rescued by a British ship in June 1724.

No matter how well his home workspace has been crafted, he still needs to switch it up on occasion. When he burns out on working from home, he drives to his area’s local coffee shop to work. Greg’s task this week was boring, yet awfully thought-intensive. Only one day into the work week, Greg already needed a change. Therefore, he jumped in the car. After a short journey, Greg was inside the coffee shop and scanning the cafe for a table next to a wall outlet. Elated, Greg secured his favorite table. Picking up his iced latte from the counter, Greg sat down and began unpacking. Laptop and charger: check. Notepad and ball-point pen: he had it. Headphones: nothing. Figuring his headphone case had slipped into a crevice hidden somewhere deep within his backpack, Greg conducted a thorough search but found nothing. As a result of the coffee shop’s policy, if Greg should leave to retrieve his headphones from home, it would be required he purchases a new coffee upon reentry. Music undoubtedly contributed to Greg’s productivity, but he could not afford another drink. Greg was going to have to work au naturale - something he hated. He took a moment to listen to the music playing over the coffee shop’s speakers and, out of character for his local spot, the PA system screamed a fusion of disco and jazz performed in awkward time signatures. Greg thought he might settle into the beat as time went on, so he put his head down and tried to work. The very moment Greg felt he might be able to get some work done after all, a nearby patron answered their phone and spoke with zero regard for neighboring ears. The voice was worse than the constant coffee grinding noises. Greg’s frustration continued to grow, and just as he was about to say something to the person on the phone they went outside to be picked up by their friend who took them away. Greg had become acclimated to the wild choice of music, but he never would have been able to work if that person had stayed."},{"prompt":"I just became engaged and I need tips about how my dog can be a part of it.

In short, what do the provided paragraphs of President John F. Kennedy's speech say about the United States?

We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding. Yet the vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we in this Nation are first, and, therefore, we intend to be first.

It's about an underground scene of elementals (humanoid spirits of water, fire, earth and air). The protagonist is named Embry and he's new to this whole world. He's being led to an Elemental club called Compass by his new mentor and guide, an air elemental woman named Skye. In this scene, Skye should advise Embry to keep a low profile, watch and learn. This is set in Manhattan in the present day. Write it in the 3rd person past tense. Also make sure Embry gets to witness some subtle magical activity on the part of the other elementals. Don't worry about bringing the scene to any kind of conclusion, I just need a seed to get the ball rolling and break my writer's block.","completion":"“We can hop out here,” Skye told the cab driver, who screeched to a halt at the curb. Embry saw her whisper something in the driver’s ear before opening the door. The driver stared straight ahead, then reached over to reset the meter. Embry never saw money change hands. Skye led him down a busy sidewalk crowded with drunk college students. They shouted and swayed, then gracelessly drifted aside as Skye drew near, clearing a path without ever noticing her presence. To an untrained eye, the whole scene might have looked choreographed. But now, Embry could see it for what it truly was: the sheer force of a sentient wind. He grinned, following close in her wake. “Bet that never gets old, does it?” Skye shrugged. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” She steered them down a dark, narrow alley. Once the light and noise of Broome Street faded behind them, Embry heard the deep pulsing bass beat of dance music and the laughter of inebriated sophisticates ahead. Soon, his eyes found the club’s sign, though it was camouflaged to blend in with the surrounding fire escapes. 'Compass,' it read in black iron letters beside a compass rose. Skye lowered her voice as they approached the door. “Follow my lead, okay? And uh… try not to look so lost. Those wide eyes and baby cheeks are just begging for attention.” Embry puffed up his chest. “Maybe I could use some attention.” Skye shook her head with a condescending smirk. “Not this kind.” She paused, meeting his questioning gaze. “Look, when you put this many Elementals in an enclosed space with booze, they inevitably start challenging each other to duels. You’re not ready for that. Just keep your head down.” There was no line outside--only a few patrons smoking cigarettes. Embry tried not to gape at their outlandish outfits, but it wasn’t easy. The fabrics they wore were like nothing he’d ever seen, woven in shapes that defied gravity and colors that shifted from one second to the next. His gaze lingered on the tallest man among them, who wore a full body suit the texture of tree bark. The longer Embry stared, the less certain he became--was it a garment, or simply his skin? “What did I just tell you?” Skye hissed, “Quit gawking!” Embry flinched, tearing his gaze away."},{"prompt":"Write a blog post about how dying your hair can help reinvigorate your sense of self, especially during winter.

Transforming your look can send a message to the world that you're ready to party, no matter the weather. Unsure what color to try first?

Please include these details: Fancy is a black cat who lives in a house in the countryside but loves to spend her time outdoors in the forest when her loving owners are away working. Her best friend is a Schnauzer who also lives at the house named Buddy. When Buddy gets lost, Fancy has to go on a mission to find and rescue him with the help of a squirrel named Chip who becomes her friend too. The story can be lighthearted and it's okay to assign certain anthropomorphic traits to the animal characters, or if you need to come up with additional animal characters to flesh out the storyline that's ok too. Let's make the story four paragraphs long, and make sure that it all ends on a good and happy note","completion":"Fancy The Forest Cat Once upon a time, there was a black cat named Fancy. Fancy lived in a nice house in the countryside, where she and her companion Buddy the Schnauzer were both loved by their owners. Fancy loved to spend time with her owners, but when they went to work each day, she would go outside to spend time in the woods with Buddy. Even though dogs usually chase cats, Fancy and Buddy were both really good friends. However, they both enjoyed chasing a squirrel named Chip, who always evaded them by going up into the trees when they would show up. One day, Buddy went out into the woods on his own, but he didn't come back for hours. This worried Fancy because Buddy never spent much time alone out in the woods. She decided that she needed to go find him before their owners came back home. So she set out into the woods to go find Buddy. She asked Chip if he knew where he was, but Chip was too scared to say anything because Fancy had always chased him and he was afraid she would do it again. Fancy assured Chip that she would never chase him again and apologized for doing so before. This reassured Chip when he realized that Fancy was sincere, and he said that he had heard from one of the deer in the woods that Buddy had gone east. Fancy and Chip set off in the easterly direction. They asked other animals along the way if they had seen Buddy, but none of them had. Fancy was getting more worried. Finally, just when all hope seemed lost, they met a raccoon named Rex who said he had seen a Schnauzer go into a farmer's cornfield at the edge of the forest not too long ago. Fancy and Chip went into the cornfield where they found Buddy! Buddy had gotten lost but he was so glad to see his friend Fancy again as they were reunited at last. He was surprised to see Chip, but Fancy told him that Chip was now their new friend too. Fancy led the way back to the house and the trio returned home before the owners of Fancy and Buddy arrived. Fancy, Buddy, and Chip all lived happily ever after in the house and the forest.

What are the most important things to consider?","completion":"No problem, freelancers have different financial considerations compared to those that work for an employer. Here are the most important ones: 1. Determine your rate. This includes calculating your expenses, creating a work schedule, and establishing a baseline income you're willing to have. 2. Decide if you are a sole proprietorship or limited liability company. This will make a big difference in how your freelance business runs and how you pay taxes. 3. Calculate expenses. This involves creating a budget, calculating fixed and variable expenses, working out quarterly estimated taxes, deciding on a savings plan, and buying insurance policies. 4. Navigate debt. If you are coming into freelancing with debt, develop a plan to pay it off, especially if it is high-interest debt like credit card debt. 5. Understand and pay taxes. There are different forms for freelancers to fill out when filing their taxes. It's important to understand the forms involved and deductions you can make to save the most money possible on your taxes and avoid penalties. If your taxes ever get too complicated, there is always the option to hire a qualified accountant. 6. Save for retirement. Saving for the future can be more difficult for freelancers since it is not automatically taken out of a paycheck like in the case of salaried employees."},{"prompt":"Make a magical recipe that is imaginary but results in the drinker of the recipe to gain 1,000,000.

You got it. Here are five ways you can get involved in your community and make a difference: 1. Volunteer.

Just reach out to organizations that align with your values, and offer to help in any way you can. 2. Look for local events. Find local events that are organized like dances that you can participate in, and join in to celebrate and enjoy the performances. Even your attendance will go a long way in supporting the artists. 3. Support your local sports teams. Be it a local football league, a high school, or a college league, find a team from your local area participating in one of these leagues and join in during their matches to cheer them on. The players do love themselves some fans during these matches. 4. Shop locally. There are several vendors and small businesses in your community selling different kinds of items and goodies. Be it paintings, jewelry, or other handmade crafts or grocery, buying from them will boost their business, and ensure their continuity. 5. Donate your resources. Last but not least, donations from you can also be a good way to get involved in your community. Do you have much that you don't use? From oversized clothes to excess utensils, furniture, or just any stuff in the home. Give this to people who don't have, it and need them."},{"prompt":"I want your help coming up with a short story about a character who discovers they have the ability to time travel, but it comes with a dangerous price.","completion":"It kind of happened like an accident.

It matches a lot of shirt and tie combinations, is muted and dressy, and is suitable for wearing in nearly any situation. • Patterned suit: After the standard navy and charcoal, a patterned suit is a good option to expand your singles and have greater choices in general. Windowpane, stripes, plaid, and tartans are good choices here, but it’s recommended to get a subtle pattern to get the most out of it. • A cream or beige suit: Cut in linen, this is the go-to choice for summer events, and you’ll be happy you have one. Not only is this lighter suit versatile with shirt and tie combinations, but it also breaks well into singles. The linen fabric will help with breathability and add effortless style to your look. • A dinner jacket: The key difference between a dinner jacket and a tuxedo is the shawl lapel.

Here's the text to read: Universal Music Group — the music company representing superstars including Sting, The Weeknd, Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande — has a new Goliath to contend with: artificial intelligence. The music group sent urgent letters in April to streaming platforms, including Spotify (SPOT) and Apple Music, asking them to block artificial intelligence platforms from training on the melodies and lyrics of their copywritten songs. The company has “a moral and commercial responsibility to our artists to work to prevent the unauthorized use of their music and to stop platforms from ingesting content that violates the rights of artists and other creators,” a spokesperson from Universal Music Group, or UMG, told CNN. “We expect our platform partners will want to prevent their services from being used in ways that harm artists.” The move by UMG, first reported by the Financial Times, aims to stop artificial intelligence from creating an existential threat to the industry.","completion":"1.

Keep the summary to 5 sentences or less, please. 1. He's likable. Unlike so many haughty restaurant celebrities, Richman won't be found shouting angrily at anyone or telling them the dish they slaved over is inedible. He's polite and charming. His mom even appears in some episodes. Given the general trash-talking tenor of most reality TV, Richman succeeds by being refreshingly nice. 2. He's curious. This man doesn't just swoop down on an Amish diner or a Southern shellfish shack and inhale vast quantities of food in record time. First, he talks to the owners and learns their story. Where did they learn to cook this food? Why is this their passion? What ingredients create the unique flavors? When he sits down to partake of the local signature dish, he's fully briefed on what makes it special, and so are we. 3. He's brave. A leader should be willing to take on the tough challenges, as Richman does when sweating through a meal rife with ghost chilies or tackling a 12-egg omelet. Even while you're moaning, \\"Ewww, gross!\\" from the safety of your couch, you admire that he's crazy enough to try it. 4. He's gracious. Sometimes, a food challenge defeats Richman. But he's never a sore loser, always thanking his hosts and conceding defeat graciously. 5. He shares the spotlight. Though Richman's mug is ever-present on the show, he makes each episode a celebration of the towns and eateries he visits. Richman has also evolved the show into a new iteration, Man v. Food Nation, in which local participants shoulder some of the food challenges. This key decision, to stop doing all the overeating himself, should help ensure long life for both Richman and the Man v. Food brand.","completion":"It would be my pleasure. Here is the summary you asked for. Unlike most food critics and reality tv stars, Richman is refreshingly nice and polite to those he works with. Richman also succeeds in staying curious and making sure to bring the audience along with him as he learns about each unique dish and story. Richman is brave enough to take on these often intimidating or gross challenges, and gracious enough to accept defeat without resentment. Lastly, Richman doesn't hog the spotlight as he makes each episode a celebration of the restaurants, towns, and people he meets along the way."},{"prompt":"I need help with a product return.","completion":"I can help you with that!

At the most basic, a ceramic material is one that is not based around metallic elements or around organic (carbon-hydrogen) molecules. They can usually withstand temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius without degrading and some formulations can take much higher heat loads. Some elements on the periodic table can be considered ceramic on their own. Pure carbon and silicon are among the more common elements that can be considered ceramic. Artificial ceramics are made by forming the item you want from clay or a conglomeration of specialty materials and then heating (firing) it until the material will no longer dissolve in water. Many ceramic items are also glazed on the surface so that water cannot soak into the material’s natural pores. Modern materials scientists have formulated specialty ceramics, but at their most basic, humans have been making artificial ceramics for at least 26,000 years. The oldest known archaeological evidence of artificial ceramic items were sculptures. 19,000-year-old pottery fragments are known, but ceramic pottery doesn’t appear to have become very common until about 10,000 years ago."},{"prompt":"Compose a letter to the editor of a local newspaper from the perspective of an irate reader who is upset over the conditions of the I-100 route he drives on to commute to work, specifically that the road is in disrepair and much-needed fixes to the road have been delayed due to lack of funding from the local government. Include the date April 28, 2023 at the top.","completion":"Letter to the Editor April 28, 2023 Topic: Road Repairs I am a homeowner in [Town]. My house is a 30-minute commute by car to my place of work. Every day, I drive the I-100 route from my home to work, from my home to the grocery store, or from my home to the school my kids attend to pick them up. And every day that I travel on the I-100, I am greeted by the approximately 100 potholes dotted along the 1-mile-long stretch of road. I am familiar with the number of potholes in the road because I have been traveling over this dilapidated roadway for close to two years now, wondering when the local authorities will decide to fix it and make it driveable again. I'll be clear when I say that [Town] is not a rainy place, nor is it a place that experiences many earthquakes or other natural disasters that could render the road undrivable. However, the I-100 is a frequently used public throughway - one that can see anywhere between 50-100 cars a minute on a slow day! Most - if not all - commuters of the I-100 rely on this stretch of road to get to the many surrounding areas including shops, schools, businesses, and gas stations. By leaving the road unfixed for two years, the local government has done its constituents a huge disservice and has left many of us with a bad taste in our mouths. I refuse to believe that the insane amount of money I pay in taxes to my local government is being misappropriated or mishandled in such a way that they can spend money to build a brand-new park but can't spend enough money to fix the road leading to it. It is unconscionable that our government would be this backward in its thinking. So, consider this idea for a change: instead of printing stories about the new animals at the zoo or why almond milk prices are increasing, maybe print a story or two to give some exposure to the issues that matter. In this case, you can talk about why the local government is refusing to spend money on much-needed infrastructure repair. - [Signature]"},{"prompt":"How long should I boil my noodles?","completion":"Boil them in water that scorches your skin, tears through flesh and consumes your bones.

Before printing presses and books were common, the Bible was a rare item due to the time and money required to make such a large book by hand. During the early 19th century, Bible Societies became more common and ordered Bibles in large quantities, either to sell or give away as part of their mission. A study produced by the British and Foreign Bible Society (founded in 1804) calculated that 2,458,000,000 Bibles were printed between 1815 and 1975.

Can you come up with a list of 5 foods I should try while I am there?","completion":"Sure! Hawaii is a melting pot of cultures, and it is reflected in the types of foods available there. Here is a list of 5 foods that you can eat while you're in Hawaii: 1. Laulau - This tasty entree is made from a generous portion of pork, along with tiny bits of butterfish, wrapped in the leaves of the taro plant and steamed until well cooked. Laulau is a staple of Hawaiian cuisine that is usually served with side dishes such as white rice, macaroni salad, and lomi salmon (diced tomato, salmon, and onions). 2. Kalua pork - Kalua pork is another delicious entree that consists of pork that has been seasoned and smoked. A whole pig is placed over a spit and cooked over Kiawe (mesquite) wood until the meat is tender and falls off the bone. Like laulau, kalua pork is served with side dishes as part of a complete meal. 3. Shaved ice - Also known as ice shave in certain parts of Hawaii, shaved ice is a snowcone that is served in a paper cone cup and flavored with different syrups. Most places in Hawaii that serve shaved ice have numerous flavors such as vanilla, cherry, lemon, strawberry, and even cola. If you're feeling adventurous, try rainbow shaved ice (all the flavors mixed into one snowcone) or shaved ice with ice cream at the bottom of the cone! 4. Spicy garlic shrimp - Many food trucks around Hawaii serve spicy garlic shrimp plates. Spicy garlic shrimp is made with shrimp that is cooked with garlic, Sriracha sauce, and butter and served on a bed of white or brown rice and a leafy green or macaroni salad. Typically served in styrofoam or cardboard food plates, spicy garlic shrimp plates are well portioned and guaranteed to fill you up. 5. Poi - While this particular dish might be polarizing (you will either love it or hate it) it is definitely a Native Hawaiian dish that those who love swear by. Poi is a lavender-colored paste that is made from the corm (root) of the taro plant which is steamed until soft and mashed into a paste. The paste is then mixed with milk and sugar until it has a yogurt-like consistency and served either immediately or a day or two later when it has fermented (some people swear by this!)"},{"prompt":"Write a serious, tense, short story about a spy assassin infiltrating a government agency and eliminating a hostile threat, from the perspective of the agent.","completion":"In between the shadows, on a hazy night in Peru, I was a ghost.

So, she said that whoever comes up with the most arguments for their preference is the type of pet we'll get! I need a whole lot of arguments that prove without a doubt that dogs are better than cats!","completion":"As an AI Chatbot, I cannot express personal preference for either a dog or a cat. However, here are some arguments you can use: 1. Friendliness: Cats can be said to be moody, and they don't always like a lot of attention. Dogs are almost always willing to have attention, and they love being played with. 2. Trainability: While cats can be trained with enough patience, dogs are said to be more eager. There are many tricks that you can teach a dog. 3. Variety: While there are varieties of cats to choose from, they are all pretty similar in size. There is much more variety when it comes to the size and temperament of the dog you can get. 4. More Laughter: There have been studies done showing that dogs can make you laugh more than cats do. This might be because of their amusing head-tilting behavior or something else. Either way, laughter is good for you. 5. More Accepting: People commonly dress up dogs, which happens less often with cats. 6. Socialization: There are many places you can take your dog to, such as training classes, competitions, or even just dog parks. Each of these provides you a chance to get to make new friends with other dog owners. 7. Encourage Responsibility: Dogs require much more responsibility than cats, as they need to go outside, be exercised, bathed, etc. Though this does mean there is more work for them, it also means they are better at teaching responsibility. 8. Encourage Exercising: As part of the added responsibility of having a dog, you will also get daily exercise by taking them for a walk or even just taking them outside so they can use the restroom. 9. Protection: Dogs will bark when someone is coming and can alert you of danger. 10. Loyalty: Dogs are said to be much more loyal than cats. These are just a few potential arguments in favor of dogs.

He only came as part of a mandatory business trip, and now he had to see his coworker’s plates piled higher than their chests with gooey cheese bites and crispy shrimp. The slot machines on The Strip failed to tempt Stu when his coworkers were gambling their money away in celebration of closing the new deal, but the honey-glaze on the bbq ribs had a different type of power. As a courtesy, Stu had paid for a plate before sitting down because the anxiety to come if the buffet staff might suspect him of sneaking food without paying would be unbearable. So, there it was: a large, empty white plate sitting in front of him. The buffet ticket included a drink, but Stu refused that pleasure as well. Stu began rethinking his life decisions. He had been on this new diet for months and other diets for years with no rewards to show for any of it. The only thing he gained was a conversation topic everyone was tired of hearing about. Stu could no longer simply place the entire blame on food—there must be a different solution. Stu had enough. The conversating coworkers around him fell silent as they noticed him pick up his plate and excuse himself from the table. No one could believe it. They watched him at the first buffet bar. Then, to the second. Stu stopped at every single station along the route and picked up at least one food item from the inviting warming platters. Stu’s eyes must have been piercing through the plexiglass sanitary guards as he drafted each piece of his bounty. Returning to the table, Stu’s plate was so tall it obscured his eye line. His tablemates peered from either side of the food tower and saw Stu smiling for the first time in months—years, maybe. Stu proceeded to have the time of his life at the buffet and allowed that experience to renew him to forgo dieting altogether, beginning his search for a new path to a healthier lifestyle."},{"prompt":"Source text: Elizabeth was born on 21 April 1926, the first child of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother).

On December 21, 2020, the Attorney General delegated certain authority to use classified information to the Special Counsel. After the inauguration of President Biden, Attorney General Garland met with the Office of Special Counsel (\\"OSC\\" or \\"the Office\\"). The Office very much appreciates the support, consistent with his testimony during his confirmation hearings, that the Attorney General has provided to our efforts and the Department's willingness to allow us to operate independently. The Special Counsel structured the investigation in view of his power and authority \\"to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney.\\" Like a U.S. Attorney's Office, the Special Counsel's Office considered in the course of its investigation a range of classified and unclassified information available to the FBI and other government agencies. A substantial amount of information and evidence was immediately available to the Office at the inception of the investigation as a result of numerous congressional investigations and Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. The examinations by the Office of the Inspector General (\\"OIG\\") of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\\"FISA\\") applications targeting Carter Page, and other matters provided additional evidence and information, as did an internal report prepared by the FBI's Inspection Division. The Office reviewed the intelligence, counterintelligence, and law-enforcement activities directed at the 2016 Trump campaign and individuals associated either with the campaign or with the Trump administration in its early stages. The Office structured its work around evidence for possible use in prosecutions of federal crimes (assuming that one or more crimes were identified that warranted prosecution). The Office exercised its judgment regarding what to investigate but did not investigate every public report of an alleged violation of law in connection with the intelligence and law enforcement activities directed at the 2016 presidential campaigns. In addition to the Special Counsel, the Office has been staffed by experienced FBI and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division Agents; Department attorneys and prosecutors; support personnel; and contractor employees. The Office's investigation was broad and extensive. It included investigative work both domestically and overseas. It entailed obtaining large document productions from businesses, firms, government agencies, universities, political campaigns, internet service providers, telephone companies, and individuals. The Office interviewed hundreds of individuals, many on multiple occasions. The Office conducted the majority of interviews in classified settings; for some interviewees and their counsel security clearances needed to be obtained. The Office conducted interviews in person and via video link, with the vast majority of the latter occurring after the COVID-19 pandemic-related closures began in March 2020. Although a substantial majority of individuals voluntarily cooperated with the Office, some only provided information under a subpoena or grant of immunity. Some individuals who, in our view, had important and relevant information about the topics under investigation refused to be interviewed or otherwise cooperate with the Office. As of April 2023, with two trials completed, the Office has conducted more than 480 interviews; obtained and reviewed more than one million documents consisting of more than six million pages; served more than 190 subpoenas under the auspices of grand juries; executed seven search warrants; obtained five orders for communications records under 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d); and made one request to a foreign government under a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.

It can be difficult to manage the personalities and unspoken factors that influence these interactions. Here are a few tips that can be of assistance: ∙ Be clear and concise: structure your communication logically. For example, you could start by stating the issue or goal you want to discuss, then explain why it's important, and finally present your solution or recommendation. It's also important to avoid using jargon or acronyms that might make sense to you but are unfamiliar to a leader who isn't as \\"in the weeds\\" of the work. ∙ Be prepared with the information you need to communicate: Think through what information your listener might need to understand your point of view, and then make sure you have that information ready. This can help you avoid being put on the spot or having to wing it. ∙ Know your audience: Try to do some advanced research on who you'll be talking with and get an understanding of their perspective on the topic. What are their priorities? What are they looking to hear or discuss? With senior leaders, it's often helpful to understand their management style and how they like to receive information. Some leaders might like data and stats, while others want a more descriptive presentation. ∙ Be proactive rather than reactive: Try to take the initiative to communicate, rather than waiting for a problem to arise or a question to be asked. Being proactive can also mean anticipating potential issues and addressing them before they become a problem. Try to get ahead of the game. These tips can make an immediate impact towards being a more effective communicator. One more thing to keep in mind though: always seek feedback. Just because you considered the checklist above doesn't mean there isn't room for you to improve. Asking for feedback from your senior leaders can help you understand what's working well and where you can make adjustments."},{"prompt":"Let's play a CYOA!

Besides, this case has been giving you nightmares, and the less you slept, the better. It's the 1920s; you are John Graves, a private detective that stumbled onto a case that even has the police stumped, the hunt for the Pietown Killer. At first, it was just your average disappearance case for a missing wife, and you expected it to end like they usually do by finding out that they left for a new lover. But on that day two weeks ago, you found the sight of a vile murder instead. Now, the case has consumed you, and you've gathered every shred of evidence you can from public sources and whatever the police are willing to give you, which isn't much. You feel like you're being stonewalled in every direction you search, as you've never had such resistance from your usual resources before. Whoever the Pietown Killer was, they must have deep connections and an overarching influence that could keep small-time folk from getting too close. You take a shot of whiskey, your drink of choice, and review your options. The latest body was found at The Drink Hole, a dive bar that serves cheap swill and is in a rougher part of town. The police kept you from interrogating the bar owner at the time, but now that they've moved on, perhaps it would be a good time to revisit and get his side of the story. You also had your connections with the authorities, a policewoman named Barbara who owed you a favor, and you might be able to get a bit more information on why you're being stonewalled for information. It was risky as it could get her into trouble too, but time was of the essence if you were going to put a stop to these murders. Whatever decision you made here would be crucial, as there was no telling how much time you had before the Pietown Killer struck again. With that in mind, what do you do? 1. Go down to The Drink Hole, and interrogate the bar owner. 2.

I’m on my way to pick her up now and I will be surprising her for dinner at the new Italian restaurant that opened in the city. My palms are sweaty as I grip the steering wheel and my stomach is in knots from excited nervousness. I pull up to her drive, put the car in park, and step out of the car. Clumsily, I hit my head on the door frame, and upon trying to grab the door to steady myself, my sweaty palms caused me to slip and I fell to the ground. Great. I scraped my knees just as this beautiful woman walked out her front door. I’m so embarrassed. She asked me if I was okay, which I was, so we got in the car and headed out. We make small talk on the way and soon we are laughing at the fact that I fell out of the car. We arrived at the restaurant and that’s when disaster number two struck. I hit my head, significantly harder this time, while getting out of the car. At least I didn’t fall, but what is wrong with me tonight? I walk around and open my date’s door for her to get out. I shut the door behind her and started walking towards the restaurant when I realized she wasn’t following. I had accidentally shut the hem of her dress in the car door and she was stuck. Oh my god. I apologized and set her free. She laughed it off, but again, I’m super embarrassed. We make it inside and sit down to eat. We order the lasagna for two and chat over a couple of glasses of wine. Things are going seemingly well despite the rocky start to the evening. And then came disaster number three. As the waiter was carrying our lasagna plates over, he tripped and our entire meal landed on the table in front of us. The spaghetti sauce exploded like a bomb and landed all over me and my date.

I must have done something right along the way though since she agreed to a second date."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this in bulleted format starting with foreign terms listed first. Most free Viking women were housewives, and the woman's standing in society was linked to that of her husband. Marriage gave a woman a degree of economic security and social standing encapsulated in the title húsfreyja (lady of the house). Norse laws assert the housewife's authority over the 'indoor household'. She had the important roles of managing the farm's resources, conducting business, as well as child-rearing, although some of this would be shared with her husband. After the age of 20, an unmarried woman, referred to as maer and mey, reached legal majority and had the right to decide her place of residence and was regarded as her own person before the law. An exception to her independence was the right to choose a husband, as marriages were normally arranged by the family. The groom would pay a bride-price (mundr) to the bride's family, and the bride brought assets into the marriage, as a dowry. A married woman could divorce her husband and remarry. Concubinage was also part of Viking society, whereby a woman could live with a man and have children with him without marrying; such a woman was called a frilla. Usually she would be the mistress of a wealthy and powerful man who also had a wife. The wife had authority over the mistresses if they lived in her household. Through her relationship to a man of higher social standing, a concubine and her family could advance socially; although her position was less secure than that of a wife. There was little distinction made between children born inside or outside marriage: both had the right to inherit property from their parents, and there were no \\"legitimate\\" or \\"illegitimate\\" children. However, children born in wedlock had more inheritance rights than those born out of wedlock. A woman had the right to inherit part of her husband's property upon his death, and widows enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women. The paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter, referred to as odalkvinna, all had the right to inherit property from a deceased man. A woman with no husband, sons or male relatives could inherit not only property but also the position as head of the family when her father or brother died. Such a woman was referred to as Baugrygr, and she exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan, until she married, by which her rights were transferred to her new husband. Women had religious authority and were active as priestesses (gydja) and oracles (sejdkvinna). They were active within art as poets (skalder) and rune masters, and as merchants and medicine women. There may also have been female entrepreneurs, who worked in textile production. Women may also have been active within military office: the tales about shieldmaidens are unconfirmed, but some archaeological finds such as the Birka female Viking warrior may indicate that at least some women in military authority existed.","completion":"- húsfreyj is the Viking term for a lady of the house. These ladies were married and that was to her economic and social advantage. Most free Viking women were married. Her husband determined her social standing. Norse laws gave the húsfreyja authority over the indoor household. Her responsibilities included managing farm resources, conducting business, as well as child-rearing. Her husband was expected to share some of the responsibility. - Maer or mey is what an unmarried woman was referred to as. After the age of 20, she had the legal right to decide where she lived and was independent before the law. An exception to this was prearranged marriages which were traditionally orchestrated by her family. - mundr is what is referred to as the \\"bride price\\" which was paid by the groom to the bride's family. The bride brought assets into the marriage. She was allowed to divorce and remarry. - frilla is the name given to a woman who lived with a man without marrying him and had his children in Viking society. Often a frilla would be the mistress of a wealthy man who was already married. The húsfreyja had authority over the frilla when sharing a household. These relationships affected the social standing of the frilla to a positive degree if a man was in higher standing. However, the position of these women was less secure than that of the húsfreyja. Under these circumstances, there were no \\"legitimate\\" or \\"illegitimate\\" children. All of the children had the right to inherit property but those born in wedlock had more inheritance rights. - odalkvinna is the paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter who all had the right to inherit the property of a dead man, as did the húsfreyj. Widows enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women. - Baugrygr is the term used to describe a woman with no husband, sons or male relatives who could inherit not only property but also the position as head of the family when her father or brother died. She had all of the rights as head of a family clan unless she married. If she did the rights were transferred to her new husband. - gydja is what a priestess was called. These women exercised religious authority. - sejdkvinna is the term for an oracle, a person through whom a deity is believed to speak. - skalder was the name used for a poet. Women were active in the arts as poets, rune masters (a specialist in making runestones), medicine women and merchants. There may also have been female entrepreneurs, who worked in textile production. - shieldmaidens are unconfirmed female warriors from Scandinavian Folklore. - Birka female Viking warrior was a woman buried with the equipment of an elite professional Viking warrior in Birka, Sweden. Although the remains were thought to be of a male warrior since the grave's excavation in 1878, both osteological analysis and a 2017 DNA study proved that the remains were of a female. This suggests that women may also have been active in the military."},{"prompt":"Write a series of two tweets inviting people to a small town's music festival this upcoming Saturday.

I want five suggestions and a brief explanation of how to do each.","completion":"Okay, here are some craft ideas for kids using empty tubes of toilet paper: 1. Binoculars - Hold two tubes parallel and tape them together. You can use decorative duct tape with designs like camo, ducks, or mustaches. 2. Didgeridoo - Tape two or more tubes together into one long tube and blow into one end to make sounds. You can watch videos of people playing Didgeridoos in Australia. 3. Animals - Get four plastic forks and cut them in half. Glue the two halves back together at a 90-degree angle so they look like animal legs with the tines of the fork as claws. Then, glue the forks to the tubes like four limbs. Cut shapes out of paper to make animal faces and tape them to one end of the tube. Do the same with tails and put them on the other end. 4. Ring garlands - Cut the tube into rings with a pair of scissors. Put a cut in one ring so you can put it through another ring like links in a chain. Tape or glue the ring shut and continue until you've used all the rings. Cover it with tissue paper or glitter to give it some color. 5. Vases - Cut a circle out of cardboard and tape it so one end of the tube is covered. Then, cover the tube with clippings from magazines or construction paper. Now you can put paper flowers inside (Note that this vase will not hold water)."},{"prompt":"Write me a haiku about health insurance","completion":"It's here just in case Protecting of my pockets Health is important"},{"prompt":"Retrieve the rhyming words from the end of each line, and group together comma-separated with a semicolon between each pair.

The Star-Spangled Banner - 1814 - During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key, a soldier imprisoned on a British warship, spent the night listening to the battle and the intense rain. In the morning, when he awakened and saw that the American flag was still flying after the shelling and rain had stopped, he wrote the poem titled \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\", which mentions the Star Spangled Banner and which of course has become our national anthem. 3. Stars and Stripes - circa 1780 - The exact date and also the person responsible are not clear, but was mostly coined sometime around 1780 by French soldier Lafayette, who purchased a ship with his own money to battle alongside the American troops.

Can you provide a detailed list of ideas?","completion":"Sure! Here are some ideas for eco-friendly, sustainable packaging material: 1. Edible Packaging: Develop packaging material made from edible substances, such as seaweed, starch, or fruit peels. This would eliminate waste and provide an eco-friendly alternative to traditional packaging. This idea aligns to reduce waste and offers an innovative solution where packaging can be consumed along with the product, minimizing the effects on the environment. 2. Biodegradable Packaging: Create packaging materials that can easily decompose in natural environments, reducing environmental impact and waste accumulation. Biodegradable materials break down naturally, reducing waste accumulation in landfills and oceans, while promoting a circular economy. 3. Plant-based Plastics: Explore the use of bioplastics derived from renewable resources like corn, sugarcane, or algae. These materials have a lower carbon footprint and can be recycled or composted. Using renewable resources for plastic production decreases reliance on fossil fuels and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. 4. Mushroom Packaging: Investigate the use of mycelium, the vegetative part of mushrooms, as a sustainable packaging material. It is biodegradable, requires fewer resources to produce, and can be molded into various shapes. Mushroom packaging is a biodegradable and sustainable alternative to traditional packaging materials, utilizing agricultural waste as a resource. 5. Minimalist Packaging: Design packaging that minimizes the use of materials and focuses on the essential aspects of product protection. This approach reduces waste and promotes a more sustainable supply chain. By focusing on essential packaging elements, waste is minimized. 6. Reusable Packaging: Develop a system that encourages consumers to return packaging for reuse, similar to how glass milk bottles were collected and refilled in the past. This approach reduces waste and engages consumers in the sustainability process. This option promotes a circular economy and reduces the overall demand for new packaging materials. 7. Smart Packaging: Explore the integration of sensors or indicators on the packaging that can monitor food freshness, temperature, or quality. This would help reduce waste by providing accurate information to consumers. Providing real-time information about quality and freshness helps prevent food waste by enabling informed decisions. 8. Upcycled Packaging: Investigate the use of upcycled materials, such as recycled paper or discarded textiles, to create unique and eco-friendly packaging solutions. Using discarded materials for packaging reduces waste and repurposes resources that would otherwise be sent to landfills."},{"prompt":"What is the fastest breed of dog and how fast can it go?","completion":"The Greyhound was bred in the past to hunt large and small game and their breed has been further developed for speed for Greyhound racing.

People feel more paranoid about their health. Can you please brainstorm three solutions for people suffering from paranoia about their physical health? How can they feel more relaxed about their physical state and not trigger a placebo effect to make them think there's something wrong with them?","completion":"Here is a list of three ways people can reduce their medical anxiety: 1) Work with a Primary Care Physician. By developing a relationship with a single doctor who can access all of your health records, you are gaining access to someone who can help ease any sense of paranoia you may be experiencing. Not only can they give you answers to possible problems you're having, but they are trained to help you through all sorts of concerns you have regarding your health and they will be able to refer you to a therapist if necessary. It's helpful to disclose that you are experiencing health anxiety so they can work with you on record keeping, tracking the actual state of your health, and avoiding costly and unnecessary screening tests. 2) Live a healthier lifestyle. If you are worried about your physical health, it may help to improve your lifestyle. When your body feels good, your mind does too. Try exercising, eating healthier, and drinking more water. There's also more that goes into a healthier lifestyle, like interaction. Stay active in your community, make new friends, try new hobbies, and go out of your comfort zone. 3) Regularly attend check-ups. Don't miss any check-ups, whether it be for a doctor, dentist, or another specialist. While you're at these check-ups, ask any questions you have about your health and share your concerns with them. They can help you feel better about any medical anxiety you have. 4) Meditate. Meditation is a way to feel your body and appreciate it, even when it doesn't feel perfectly comfortable. By meditating, you are practicing looking deeper within and experiencing what your body is feeling. You'll have a better understanding of your body and what's going on with it through meditation. Meditation is also relaxing and can help ease your feelings of anxiety. Along with that, meditation can help you to understand the signals your body is sending so that you can practice regular and effective self-care rather than rushing to a doctor's office to address every passing ache and pain."},{"prompt":"In fencing, where does a foil need to touch an opponent to score a hit? Please reference the following information. The foil is a light thrusting weapon with a maximum weight of 500 grams. The foil targets the torso, but not the arms or legs. The foil has a small circular hand guard that serves to protect the hand from direct stabs. As the hand is not a valid target in foil, this is primarily for safety. Touches are scored only with the tip; hits with the side of the blade do not register on the electronic scoring apparatus (and do not halt the action). Touches that land outside the target area (called an off-target touch and signaled by a distinct color on the scoring apparatus) stop the action, but are not scored. Only a single touch can be awarded to either fencer at the end of a phrase. If both fencers land touches within a close enough interval of milliseconds to register two lights on the machine, the referee uses the rules of \\"right of way\\" to determine which fencer is awarded the touch, or if an off-target hit has priority over a valid hit, in which case no touch is awarded. If the referee is unable to determine which fencer has right of way, no touch is awarded.","completion":"In order to score, a foil needs to touch the tip of the blade (not the sides) to the opponent's torso excluding arms and legs."},{"prompt":"Write a synopsis for a Southern gothic novel involving a bigamist.","completion":"Ellen Deutsch is a vibrant empty nester living in a remote area of a Florida panhandle community.

It is very experimental and the sound is very unconventional. Despite this, it is cited as the most influential album in Rock and Roll history. 2.) White Light/ White Heat Rating: 6/10 This is the second album released by the band. This release is much more experimental and challenging to listen to than the first release. This release never got very popular, but I still enjoy the sound of the album 3.) The Velvet Underground (1969) Rating: 9/10 The third and perhaps most popular album by the group, this self-titled release is a major departure from the sound established in the first two releases.

He nearly always went about on his own because, although he wanted to have lots of friends, he was too self-conscious. One day, the octopus was trying to catch a very slippery oyster. Before he knew it, he had tied himself into one massive knot, and he couldn't move. He tried with all his strength to wriggle free, but it was no good. In the end, despite the great embarrassment he felt at being seen in such a tangle, he had to ask for help from the passing fish. Many fish swam past, ignoring him, but one very kind little fish offered to help to untie all those tentacles from all those suckers. The octopus felt heartily relieved when he was finally set free, but he was so shy that he didn't dare talk to the fish and make friends with him. He simply thanked the fish, and quickly swam off. Later, the octopus spent the whole night thinking that he had wasted a great opportunity to make friends with that very kind little fish. A couple of days later the octopus was resting between some rocks, when he noticed that everyone around was hurriedly swimming past. He looked into the distance and saw an enormous fish coming over to feed in that area. The octopus quickly hid; then, peeping an eye out from his hiding place, he saw that the huge fish was chasing the kind little fish who had untied him. That little fish really needed urgent help, but the big fish was so dangerous-looking that no one dared to go near. The octopus, remembering how the little fish had helped him, felt that he had to do whatever he could to come to his aid. Without hesitating, the octopus shot out from the rocks, like a ray. He put himself right in the path of the giant fish, and before the fish could do anything about it, the octopus had shot out the biggest jet of ink of his life. He grabbed the little fish, and swam off back to hide in the rocks. Everything happened so fast that the big fish had no time to react. However, he soon recovered from the surprise. Off he went to the rocks, looking for the octopus and the little fish. Now he really wanted to gobble them down! Soon, though, he began feeling a terrible itch; first in his gills, and then in his fins, and then all over his body. It turned out that this giant fish had a very artistic nature, he adored colours; and the octopus's dark ink had given him a terrible allergy!! So the big fish swam away, irritated all over. As soon as he was gone, all the fish who had been hiding came and congratulated the octopus for being so brave. Then the little fish told them all how he had helped the octopus a few days earlier, but he had never known anyone be so grateful that they would end up doing something so dangerous. Hearing this, the other fish discovered how nice the shy octopus was, and everyone around was keen to be the friend of such a brave and honourable octopus.","completion":"Once upon a time, there was a shy and quiet sea turtle.

Some examples can include: \\"What is the company culture here?\\" or \\"What's your favorite part of the day?\\" You can use the breakout room function of Zoom to break groups up. 3. Find 10 Things in Common: This icebreaker is great for small or large groups and requires no supplies. Start by breaking the group into smaller groups and ask them to find 10 (non-obvious) things that everyone in that group has in common. You can use the breakout room function in Zoom if needed.

What kind of cake are you in this dream? Patient: I'm a vanilla pound cake. I'm a classic cake that families love. Psychiatrist: I see. Okay, describe your dream to me. Patient: Well, there's a woman who makes my batter by beating one cup of room-temperature butter and one cup of sugar together at high speed with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. She then adds four large eggs, one at a time, and beats well after each one. Then the woman adds two teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and half a teaspoon of salt. And with her mixer on low, she gradually adds two cups of flour, beating until just combined and being careful to not over mix. Then the woman pours my batter into a 6-cup (8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch) loaf pan that's been buttered and floured ahead of time and places me into a preheated 350-degree oven. I'm baked for about an hour or until a toothpick inserted into my center comes out clean (she would use a tent with aluminum foil if I was browning too quickly). The woman then lets me cool in the pan for fifteen minutes, then inverts me onto a wire rack and turns me upright to cool completely. And I come out dense, buttery, and loaded with flavor.

The story should end just as the battle is about to begin.","completion":"Titus awoke to the sound of trumpets blaring throughout the camp. Titus was a soldier in the army of the Roman Republic; he was part of a force assembled to oppose Hannibal of Carthage. Hannibal was an incredibly skilled and intelligent general leading an army comprised of native Carthaginians and foreign soldiers from Spain and Gaul. He had not yet lost a battle in his war with Rome. But Titus had felt encouraged while marching from Rome to the town of Cannae. The force that Rome had assembled was massive. Surely such an overwhelming numerical advantage would bode well for Titus and his countrymen. The trumpets were sounded to rouse the Romans and get them ready for a pitched battle. Titus donned his armor, left his tent with his tentmates, and headed to the road leading out of the Roman camp's gates. Soon, the entire army was assembled. The heavy infantry was positioned in the center of the army with the cavalry on the wings. Across the field, the Carthaginian battalions filed into position. For some time, the two armies gazed at one another across the plains. The sun was rising in the sky, bringing a sweltering heat with it. Sweat dripped down Titus's brow. Finally, the order came for the Romans to advance. Their forces dwarfed the opposition, and there was a great sense of determination amongst the Romans to avenge Hannibal's prior victories against their fellow citizens. Titus was near the front line and was looking forward to proving himself. The skirmishers from each army volleyed stones and javelins at one another, then retreated behind their respective frontlines. The two groups of infantry were very close now; the battle was about to begin."},{"prompt":"Robert ran a seedy alehouse in medieval times, but today is his last day as he retires the alehouse. Write about his last day from start to finish","completion":"Robert sighed as he rubbed down the counter at his alehouse. The walls were in worse shape than ever, the floors creaked awfully, and the ale never got any better, but it was his alehouse - and nobody had ever managed to take that away from him. Today was his final day, and instead of a big celebration, all he wanted to do was to run it like any other day, for one last time. His usual pair of thin, cloaked patrons came in first thing in the morning, dropped enough coin for a pair of mugs of ale, and took their mugs to the corner of the alehouse, as they once more muttered quietly between themselves. Then Matthew walked in, but his face was forlorn, and his eyes were bloodshot as if he had been crying. \\"Say it ain't so!\\" exclaimed Matthew, who firmly grasped Robert with both hands. Robert, who was used to Matthew's overly-familiar reactions, let him know that this would be the final day for the alehouse. He had grown much older, and the alehouse was now in terrible condition and would soon end up unsafe for patronage. So he was selling the land to a wealthy baron, who would do whatever he wanted with it. Matthew, who had also grown older with many new scars in the years he'd been coming, started bawling loudly at the counter, so Robert sympathetically left a mug of ale for him. \\"This one's on the house,\\" Robert said, touched that anyone would care so much for this old place, even if it was Matthew. \\"Though I'll be having you pay back the rest of your tab.\\" Slapping himself, Matthew wiped away his tears, pulled himself together, and gave Robert a big, cheeky smile. He assured him that he'd see every penny, as he was being paid today from his latest mercenary job. Robert smiled briefly at him, confident that he was true to his word, and started cleaning mugs once more. Evening came, and as the last customers left and he finished up what he needed to do, he locked the door from the outside and looked at the old building. He'd miss the weathered walls, and the noisy floorboards, but from this point on, it was no longer his alehouse.

The ingredients I already use are dry roasted almonds, peanuts, raisins, chocolate chips, and cashews.","completion":"Here are some ingredients you could add to make your trail mix more exciting: *Pistachios: Opt for some that are already shelled for easy snacking on the go. *Different nuts: Pecans, Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, chestnuts, or hazelnuts all make for tasty and protein-rich additions. *Blanched almonds: When almonds are boiled and their skins are removed, their texture gets softer and a little buttery, which makes for a refreshing change. *Dried fruits: If you’re bored with raisins, try dried cranberries, cherries, blueberries, apricots, or goji berries, just to name a few options. You can also dice up larger dried fruits like mangoes or pineapples for a fun tropical twist. *Spiced or flavored nuts: Almonds, peanuts, and cashews can be more exciting if they’re coated in interesting flavors such as Chile lime, salt & pepper, wasabi, honey roasted, maple glazed, or cinnamon sugar. *Dehydrated vegetables: Dried peas, green beans, carrot slices, beets, and other root vegetables make a healthy and tasty snack. *S’mores flavor: Add mini marshmallows, chocolate chips, and mini graham crackers to your regular mix. *Cereal or granola: Pick any flavor you prefer, whether it’s a sugary major brand cereal or artisanal granola with organic ingredients. These will add a satisfying, crunchy texture and some carbohydrates, which will help boost your energy on a hike. *Chocolate-covered nuts: You can add chocolate-covered almonds, cashews, peanuts, pecans, pistachios, or anything else you can find.

Both \`subnet_ids\` in the \`rds\` and \`elasticache\` subnet group resources are referring to \`aws_subnet.private\`, which is a list of resources (as implied by the usage of \`count\`) instead of a singular resource.

Why isn’t one style best?","completion":"The first thing you have to understand is that a positive dihedral (a wing that angles upward from the fuselage) creates roll stability – in other words, it will make the plane less inclined to roll to the left or right. The physics behind this so-called \\"dihedral effect\\" is complicated, but the basics are fairly easy to visualize; a positive dihedral moves the overall center of lift a little higher, placing it closer to – or sometimes above – the aircraft’s total center of mass. Effectively, with enough dihedral effect, the weight is hanging under the force that’s holding it up (as opposed to balancing on top). As you might expect, this sort of stability is often beneficial. You don’t typically want your airliner or cargo plane to flip upside-down, after all. But there are reasons to angle the wing the other way. Oftentimes, when the wing is mounted high, the center of mass is already far below the center of the lift. This can make some roll maneuvers excessively difficult. A negative dihedral angle (often called an anhedral) can reduce this roll resistance to more reasonable levels. Many military cargo aircraft, like the An-124 and C-5, are designed this way. Some planes are built with a dihedral angle that intentionally reduces their roll stability. Though it sounds counterintuitive, fighter aircraft are most maneuverable if they are at least slightly aerodynamically unstable. The proper dihedral angle can help them hit the right balance between stability and instability."},{"prompt":"Classify the following as negative or positive: \\"Sarah is an inspiration\\".","completion":"The statement is positive."},{"prompt":"Who invented Apple?","completion":"Here's the tea babe.

Here is the information: Retinoid: The term \\"retinoid\\" is a catch-all for an array of vitamin A-based products used on skin. It can treat mild fine lines and wrinkles, acne, and dark spots. It can also improve skin texture. If you’re looking to treat uneven skin tone, dark spots, or your skin’s texture, look for the word “retinol.” It’s a type of retinoid that’s used for these purposes. Retinol can give you younger-looking skin by speeding up new skin cell turnover, which starts to slow in your 20s. To treat acne, dermatologists prescribe one of these retinoids – adapalene, tazarotene, tretinoin, or trifarotene. You’ll also find adapalene in an acne-fighting product available without a prescription. When spread on acne-prone skin, a retinoid can unclog pores. This can give you clearer skin and allow other acne gels and creams to work better. When to apply a retinoid: Dr. Baxt recommends applying a retinoid before bed. After washing your face, wait 20 to 30 minutes and then apply it. If you find the retinoid too drying, apply a moisturizer immediately after washing your face, using a moisturizer that won’t clog your pores. Then apply the retinoid 20 to 30 minutes later.","completion":"Retinoids are vitamin A-based products.

They used this system to save fuel that is used for electricity for the war. The United States followed, adopting this policy in 1918. The government created a bill that shifted the time by one hour, which only lasted for seven months. Daylight Savings Time made a return during World War 2, and was referred to as \\"War Time\\". Daylight Savings Time, as we know it today, started in 1966 with the passing of the Uniform Time Act. The time change went from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in October."},{"prompt":"Imagine you are an ageing Gen X software developer looking back on her life. Use a metaphor of the big bad wolf from the three little pigs story to communicate these dilemmas: stocks rising and falling in value at my company, a relationship with Stan where he cheats on you, and finally a little boat house to be alone and old in.","completion":"The first house I built was in the early 1990s. A pre-internet software engineering firm. Boom! went our stocks. Father tsked his tongue and muttered things like House of Cards and Icarus. But I was pigheaded and grew the company fast and furiously. I secured bank loans, spoke at California conferences with Steve Jobs, and got a sprawling cherry desk with a view of Boston's harbor. Then a cold wind blew in, huffed and puffed, and kaboom! went our stocks. The next house I built was in 1999, a bonafide urban walk-up love nest. Stan and I moved in together within three months of meeting. Mother tsked her tongue and called it a house of fire. But I was pigheaded and didn't listen - and Stan was hot. Neighbors carrying groceries smiled at me in the stairwell. We drank wine and played chess at night and made love till dawn. Then a cold northerly blew in. Her name was Ilse. She huffed and puffed till he moved out. I licked my wounds and didn't call my mother for a month. Then I built my third house. Both parents tsked their tongues but said little. It's smaller than the others - more modest than the first, more secure than the second. And it can stand up to the wind. So when the cold northerly huffed and puffed this time, I hoisted my sails and went with it."},{"prompt":"Who composed the famous musical piece, \\"Moonlight Sonata\\"?","completion":"The famous musical piece \\"Moonlight Sonata\\" is a solo piano piece composed by Ludwig van Beethoven.

The nickname \\"Moonlight Sonata\\" originated in the 1830s, when German Romantic poet Ludwig Rellstab published a review comparing the first movement to a boat floating in the moonlight on Switzerland's Lake Lucerne. Beethoven dedicated this work to Countess Giulietta Guicciardi, a young aristocrat who briefly studied under him."},{"prompt":"It's raining outside, and I'm going to get my hair all wet.","completion":"Think of all the animals that depend on rainfall for water and how much the plants will appreciate the precipitation."},{"prompt":"My dog likes water too much.

Make sure to include examples, if there are any, for the tips.","completion":"1. Decorate your cake with quality cake-decorating tools for the perfect smoothness. Items you'll want to use for decorating include a cake scraper, an icing spatula, a cake disk, and a piping bag. 2. Freeze your cake for 15 minutes after assembling and applying the first thin layer of frosting, the crumb coat. The crumb coat holds your cake together, so if you see cake layers mixing into the buttercream, you need to freeze your cake for a few more minutes to allow the crumb coat to set. 3. Use your cake scrapper at a 45-degree angle to create lovely smooth edges for your cake. Using your scrapper at this angle will let you be almost eye level with your cake to see what is happening as you smooth it out closely. 4. Make clean-cut edges on your cake using an acrylic cake disk when applying your buttercream. An acrylic cake disk will help you make the flat cake top and straight edges you want on your cake. 5. When piping your cake, keep it from the edge of the cake. Instead, you'll want to decorate the cake by holding the piping bag slightly toward the middle to ensure that the frosting doesn't fall off the edge of the cake."},{"prompt":"Write a numbered list of 7 quick costumes that I could incorporate into the “Week of Halloween” costume contests at work this year.

The Bumblebee Don a pair of black pants and stripe a yellow shirt with black paint. You can craft a quick stinger out of cardboard and attach strings with puff balls to an old headband for the antenna. 5. Where’s Waldo?

Frosty the Snowman Pair some white pants with a white shirt, then draw black buttons in a straight line down your shirt front. Add a top hat for emphasis on the “Frosty” story and paint your nose orange to represent a carrot. 7. Secret Superhero Remember how Superman wore his superhero costume under his business suit?

In addition to erosion and damage caused at the base of the tree, there are secondary issues that come from an influx of people. “There was trash, and people were creating even more side trails to use the bathroom. They leave used toilet paper and human waste – it’s not a good thing,” Arguello said.","completion":"Tourists cannot visit Hyperion for the following three reasons: 1.

I draw a bit wider to the sidewalk before my front step. I watch the space. I wait. Footsteps in. Another. Out. Shoes with mud on them. Worn shoes. Working shoes. When will I go back to work? My stronghold quakes. I take a breath and look up. A face flits through. Laughing on the phone. When will I make friends again? My stronghold cracks. Leans. I draw the circle close to me.

If I had a full face on then I'd go for the 2 coats but every day the one coat is amazing!! I can't believe it's only £5.15. I have Bailey Sarian to thank for this 2. I've always had problems with my dry skin and after I take a shower my skin would always itch. so I found this dove bar soap and it says for sensitive skin and it's unscented, so I thought I'd try it. It makes my skin very soft and no more itching after I shower. I never knew I had sensitive skin until I tried this product and no more itchy problems with my skin 3. Terrible don't buy!!!! This is my second pair. Hard time Connecting. Then constantly disconnecting. Case never charges. Save your money!!! 4. I’ve always heard great things about this brand, but after using this tonight I don’t think I will ever try them again. The product would not lather at all. Didn’t feel like it cleaned anything. I don’t use any products but shampoo on my hair. It just gets oily quickly. The scent was so strong that I used my regular shampoo and washed it twice to try to get rid of the smell and actually clean my hair. I do not recommend because it didn’t clean, was too strongly scented and overpriced. Definitely taking it back. 5. I’ve had my series s for a little over a year at this point and have been loving it! It plays games really well and I haven’t had many problems with it. I would absolutely suggest getting an external hard drive because you only have a little over 300 gb when it’s fully set up. I would also suggest getting gamepass ultimate just because you’re already playing digital games, so why not get all the “Xbox” ones right off the bat?","completion":"1. Positive.

Say how this is great for retro gamers and comes with RCA audio outs on the back of the set. Mention it only weighs 40 pounds but is bulky. Ask for 50 or best offer for the clock radio, and 100 or best offer for the television.","completion":"FOR SALE - Vintage Home Electronics Hi, and thanks for checking out my ad. I have two vintage items for sale, an analog alarm clock with radio and a 29” tube television. The clock radio is by Realistic, a Radio Shack brand. I think it was from around 1985 or so. It is in excellent condition and still works well after nearly 40 years. The volume control has a touch of static on it, but that’s to be expected after so long. The AM/FM radio works well, and the manual tuning dial is good for getting harder-to-reach stations. If you are an AM radio fan, you know that these are being made less and less every year, so if you’ve been looking, this might be your find. The alarm clock is analog with flip-style numbers and keeps time as well as it ever did. Alarm tones and radio functions work as wake-up settings, and the snooze button works. Asking for 50 or best offer. The television is a 29” Magnavox from the late 1990s. I don’t have the original remote, but I do have a programmable one that works just fine. The big draw of these old tube TVs is for vintage video game consoles. There is a certain look to the games that can only be achieved on these kinds of sets, and have been a big hit with retro gaming fans. Zero input lag, great colors, and RCA audio outputs on the back for hooking into a modern sound system. It’s only about 40 pounds, but it is bulky, so make sure it will fit in your vehicle.

Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluids and the balance of acids and bases in your body. They also help control muscle and nerve activity, heart rhythm, and other important functions. An electrolyte panel, also known as a serum electrolyte test, is a blood test that measures levels of the body's main electrolytes: Sodium, which helps control the amount of fluid in the body. It also helps your nerves and muscles work properly. Chloride, which also helps control the amount of fluid in the body. In addition, it helps maintain healthy blood volume and blood pressure. Potassium, which helps your heart and muscles work properly. Bicarbonate, which helps maintain the body's acid and base balance. It also plays an important role in moving carbon dioxide through the bloodstream. Abnormal levels of any of these electrolytes can be a sign of a serious health problem, including kidney disease, high blood pressure, and a life-threatening irregularity in heart rhythm.

A little-understood backlash against higher education is driving an unprecedented decline in enrollment that experts now warn is likely to diminish people’s quality of life and the nation’s economic competitiveness, especially in places where the slide is most severe. “With the exception of wartime, the United States has never been through a period of declining educational attainment like this,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University’s Miller College of Business. There are 4 million fewer students in college now than there were 10 years ago, a falloff many observers blame on Covid-19, a dip in the number of Americans under 18 and a strong labor market that is sucking young people straight into the workforce. But while the pandemic certainly made things worse, the downturn took hold well before it started. Demographics alone cannot explain the scale of this drop. And statistics belie the argument that recent high school graduates are getting jobs instead of going to college: Workforce participation for 16- to 24-year-olds is lower than it was before Covid hit, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, reports. Focus groups and public opinion surveys point to other, less easily solved reasons for the sharp downward trend. These include widespread and fast-growing skepticism about the value of a degree, impatience with the time it takes to get one, and costs that have finally exceeded many people’s ability or willingness to pay. There has been a significant and steady drop nationwide in the proportion of high school graduates enrolling in college in the fall after they finish school — from a high of 70% in 2016 to 63% in 2020, the most recent year for which the figure is available, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. The decline is even worse in some states, though not all have data for the same periods of time. The proportion of high school graduates in Tennessee who are going directly to college, for example, has fallen to 53% — down 11 percentage points since 2017. In Indiana, it dropped to 53% in 2020, down 12 percentage points from five years earlier and a pace state Commissioner for Higher Education Chris Lowery has called “alarming.” Americans are increasingly dubious about the need to go to college. Fewer than 1 in 3 adults now say a degree is worth the cost, according to a survey by the nonprofit Strada Education Network, which conducts research into and financially supports ways of expanding access to higher education. Meanwhile, months of discussion about whether the Biden administration will forgive all or some student loan debt has had the unintended consequence of reminding prospective learners how much people before them had to borrow to pay for college. So has the fact that many of their parents are still paying back their own student loans. From 2015 to 2019, Americans’ faith in higher education dropped more than their confidence in any other institution measured by the Gallup polling organization — an extraordinary erosion of trust, considering that this list includes the presidency, Congress, big business and the criminal justice system. “There’s anti-elitism, anti-institutionalism, a perception that cost is out of control,” said Stephanie Marken, a partner in Gallup’s education division. The problems have been evident for years, but colleges and universities in general have done little to address them. They continue to advertise prices that few consumers actually pay but that discourage many from applying. They bury students in red tape, which is especially confounding for the increasing number of would-be applicants whose parents never went to college. And they often fail to make clear connections between academic disciplines and careers or keep up with the demands of the fast-moving labor market. A degree does, in fact, still pay off. Workers with bachelor’s degrees earn 67% more than people with only high school diplomas, according to the BLS. More than half of “good jobs” — those with salaries of at least 35,000 for workers under age 45 and 45,000 for people 45 to 64 — call for bachelor’s degrees, the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce estimates. Yet since the start of the pandemic, the proportion of 14- to 18-year-olds who think education is necessary beyond high school has dropped from 60% to 45%, the nonprofit Educational Credit Management Corporation. The pandemic only deepened the fears of students already struggling with self-confidence and skeptical about college, said Thea Cole, who also counsels students for Advise TN. “Their GPAs have suffered. So some of them are, ‘I don’t know if I can get in,’ or, ‘It will be too hard.’ ” Her colleague, Portia Cook, was more blunt: “My kids have a shorter fuse. When things start getting complicated, they’re done.” It’s not only recent high school graduates who are turning their backs on higher education. The number of Americans over 24 who are going for the first time or returning to college has also steadily declined, by 12% in the five years from the spring of 2017 to the just-ended spring semester. The United States has already fallen from second to 16th since 2000 among developed nations in the proportion of 25- to 34-year-olds with bachelor’s degrees. Countries ahead of it have increased their bachelor’s degree attainment during that time by an average of 177%, an analysis by an institute at the University of Pennsylvania found. Even before the pandemic, the nation was facing a shortage of more than 9 million college-educated workers over the next decade, affecting nearly every state and costing nearly 1.2 trillion in lost economic output, the center-right American Action Forum estimated. Economic rivals “could wish nothing better but to see the share of [American] adults who go to college drop by 12 percentage points,” Hicks said. “It is literally cataclysmic.”","completion":"Even as I embark on this journey of college, I can tell you I'm nervous. I've read all about the decline of high school graduates going to college. No one wants their parents or themselves to spend all that time and money. I had no idea why there was so much news about this topic. I got down to business and started researching. After all, I'm about to go on this journey and I want to know what I'm getting myself into. First, the economy stinks. The U.S. economy has been on a downward slope for some time. What does that mean? While scouring the internet, I found some information from the Director of the Center for Business and Economic Research and Ball State University. Michael Hicks stated, \\"With the exception of wartime, the United States has never been through a period of declining attainment like this.\\" What does this mean? I'm not sure, so I had to dig some more. Currently, there are 4 million fewer students in college than a decade ago. Of course, Covid-19 hurt these numbers. More young people went into the workforce, instead of going to college. That concept does not agree with me. I wanted a gap year off before college but not one that involved working. Even before the pandemic, college applications started declining. We can't blame the pandemic for everything. Different focus groups and surveys showed that people were skeptical that the college degree would prove results that some were willing to pay for. Statistics show that one in three don't think the degree is worth the amount of money shelled out. Think about it. When my parents went to college, the cost was less than 30,000 in some states. Now, my college education will cost closer to 50,000 with loans that will haunt me until the day I die. The conversations about worth keep coming up time and again with my friends and their parents. When my parents went to school, everyone went to college. If you didn't go to college, you were considered a bum. Not anymore. Now parents seemed relieved if their child opts out of college. Student loans. Don't get my father started. He has been paying off his loans for the past 20 years. It seems like he will always be paying. While my parents wait to find out if the government will forgive student debt, they pay every month like clockwork. This does not appeal to me in the least. Imagine if you bought a car, but never paid it off, no matter how many years passed. Why would you want to pay off a car for 20 years? College is no different. People who don't even graduate from college still have to pay off student loans. That is a real insult. Do you think the universities are addressing this issue? Nope. Having a degree is indeed necessary in some industries. It is also true that college grads tend to make more. However, the attitude about college being necessary has dropped from 60% to 45% according to the nonprofit Educational Credit Management Corporation. Even the ones who are already committed to college are doubting the decision."},{"prompt":"Show me how to import my threading.csv to Python, then plot the \\"threads\\" and \\"data\\" columns as a linear regression up to 1000 with test size of 10% a scatterplot and a line with matplotlib.","completion":"We'll need to use MatPlotLib, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, and Pandas DataFrames for that. # Import the modules from sklearn import datasets, linear_model import matplotlib import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import pandas as pd # Load the CSV file df = pd.read_csv(\\"threading.csv\\") # Define the x and y values y = df[\\"threads\\"] x = df[\\"data\\"] x = x.reshape(len(x),1) y = y.reshape(len(y),1) # Split the data into training and testing data x_train = x[:-100] x_test = x[-100:] y_train = y[:-100] y_test = y[-100:] # Plot the data plt.scatter(x_test, y_test) plt.xlabel(\\"Threads\\") plt.ylabel(\\"Data\\") plt.xticks(()) plt.yticks(()) # Train the model and create the regression line regr = linear_model.LinearRegression() regr.fit(X_train, Y_train) plt.plot(X_test, regr.predict(X_test)) # Show the plot plt.show() The code above first imports the \`sklearn\`, \`matplotlib\`, and \`pandas\` modules.

When a show didn't go exactly as expected, he yelled at the clowns, emotionally berated the acrobats, and spewed horrible names at the circus sideshow entertainers. Everyone was afraid of him, but they were even more afraid of leaving because he threatened them with horrible torture if anyone took off. He was truly a vile person, but the animals got the worst treatment. He starved them, chained them in tiny cages, and beat them daily to keep them submissive and afraid. Even the lions and tigers cowered when he approached. While he was putting on a show, spectators thought he was a great ringleader, and they really enjoyed the circus acts, but they didn't see what happened when the lights went out and the crowds dispersed. One day, an older, mysterious woman stayed behind. She saw beyond the forced smiling faces and saw how all the animals cowered in fear when he was around or when they heard his booming voice. She knew there was something wrong with this circus, and she aimed to find out what it was. As she quietly snuck around the tents, she heard the ringleader screaming at his employees. Her suspicions were founded, and she continued to watch and listen. When she saw him kick a skinny, starved dog chained outside his tent, she knew she had to take action. She wasn't going to report him to authorities, though; she had another plan. She knew dark magic. The way to teach this horrible man a lesson is to turn him into what he despises the most. The old woman waited until he went to bed, then she started her chant. She watched as a dark mist entered his tent. It glowed briefly to let her know the magic was successful. When the ringleader woke up the next morning, he found he was chained to a post outside. He was cold, tired, and hungry, and when he tried to speak, there were no words. Only barks, whines, and whimpers exited his throat. The ringleader had been turned into a dog and now would live the rest of his life as a poor, mistreated animal."},{"prompt":"Hello. I would like you to extract the following information about the three women in computer science: name, education, employment, contributions and awards. Sister Mary Kenneth Keller Born in 1913 in Ohio, Sister Mary Kenneth Keller joined the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1932. Keller became the first woman in the United States to earn a Ph.D. in computer science in 1965, after previously earning degrees in math and physics from DePaul University. She also completed graduate work at other universities, including at Dartmouth College's computer lab, which typically excluded women at that time. While at Dartmouth, Keller helped develop the BASIC programming language, which made coding more accessible to people in fields beyond math and science. After graduating with her Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin Madison, she founded the department of computer science at Clark University in Iowa and remained there for about 18 years. Keller worked to attract more women to the computer science field and invited students to bring their children to class. Margaret Hamilton Margaret Hamilton played a key role in helping astronauts land on the moon. Creator of the term \\"software engineer,\\" Hamilton was one of the first computer software programmers. She earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Earlham College in 1958. After graduating, she got a job at MIT to help support her family while her husband attended law school. While there, she taught herself programming and created software to aid in predictive meteorology. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she wrote code for the onboard software that made Apollo missions to the moon possible. She was the first computer programmer and woman that NASA hired to work on the Apollo project. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 from President Barack Obama to acknowledge her role in the Apollo moon missions. LEGO immortalized her and a few other NASA women by creating figurines of their likenesses in 2017. Adele Goldberg Born in 1945 in Ohio, Adele Goldberg liked math from an early age. She earned a bachelor's degree in math from the University of Michigan and worked at IBM in the summer between her junior and senior years. While at IBM, Goldberg taught herself to program unit record machines and began considering a career in computing. In 1973, she completed a Ph.D. in information science from the University of Chicago. After graduating, she started working at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, where she helped develop Smalltalk, an object-oriented programming language. Smalltalk was one of the first programming languages that could create graphic user interfaces like menus, icons, and windows. Goldberg co-founded ParcPlace Systems and later created a consultancy group. From 1984-1986, she served as president of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 1990, Goldberg won a lifetime achievement award from PC Magazine.","completion":"1. Name Adele Goldberg Margaret Hamilton Sister Mary Kenneth Keller 2.

It was a learning management system, built to revolutionise how tech companies managed to create a learning culture. The entire idea came to Ilie while trying to find a good tool to use within Thinslices to help organise learning, which is a core value at Thinslices, throughout the company. Browsing through an already crowded market of over 2000 LMSs, we couldn’t find a tool with the desired functionalities, the modern look and in the right price range. So, the natural question for a serial entrepreneur came up: why not build one ourselves? And we did. Moreover, if we, a software development company, had a real need for a modern, swift LMS, it made sense to think that other tech companies needed it as well. Soon after, a small team formed around Teamfluent, covering all departments: software development, sales, marketing, customer success, finance & admin. The sales discussions were great, people liked our MVP, our functionalities roadmap and our business model. But it’s a long and winding road from discussions to actual contracts. Moreover, the clients we were discussing with were already using learning management systems inside their companies. So, although they liked our product, putting into balance the effort it would have taken to switch to a new tool - however better the new one might be - and the difficulty to gain wide adoption among colleagues, the math simply didn’t add up. After 2 years of enthusiastic and hard work, with numerous tech customers, we decided to end Teamfluent’s journey, not without important learnings.","completion":"Teamfluent was found in 2016 while examining different tools in Thinslices to revolutionize the learning systems for tech companies. It was quite challenging to find a useful tool due to the oversaturated market and specific requirements for our idea, so we just decided to build it ourselves. We reflected on the high demand for an effective LMS and formed a small team called Teamfluent to bring this system to life. Initially, many people were intrigued by our visions, blueprints, and business plans, but persuading them to join us and form contracts wasn't as easy. Most of our clients were already accustomed to powerful LMS, but even though they admired our efforts and ideas, they couldn't see it as a widely-used tool. Thus, after 2 years of consulting tech-customers, Teamfluent realized its weaknesses and came to an end."},{"prompt":"Write an exactly 170-word blog post in the form of a list about 4 benefits of asparagus, starting every sentence with the word \\"The\\".","completion":"The benefits of asparagus are numerous, and it provides a lot of the nutrients you need to live a healthier life. 1. The first benefit is that it is low in calories and high in vitamins! The asparagus plant is a fantastic source of vitamin K, folate, vitamin A, and many others. 2. The second benefit is that asparagus is packed full of antioxidants. The compounds called antioxidants help protect your body's cells from the harmful effects of free radicals and oxidative stress. 3. The third benefit is that this vegetable can improve your digestive health. The fiber content in just half a cup of asparagus is 1.8 grams, which is 7% of your daily needs and helps support regular bowel movements. 4. The fourth benefit of asparagus is that it can help support a healthy pregnancy. The asparagus plant is high in folate, otherwise known as vitamin B9.

He looked out the window and saw the light in his treehouse was on. When he climbed up the ladder to turn the light off, he noticed something huddled in the corner. It was a little fuzzy creature he had never seen before, like a small bear with rabbit ears. He carefully walked towards it and scooped it up. The creature was initially frightened but seemed to warm up to Alan quickly. The boy tried to talk to him to see if he could understand, but the creature just made purring noises. Alan knew he had to help save him. He looked around to see where he came from and there was a hole in the backyard. Alan looked in the hole and he found a little spaceship, broken. Alan went back and told the creature he would help repair the spaceship. The creature purred in happiness. A couple of days went by, and they worked in the spaceship together. In their spare time, they watched movies, listened to music together, and even found some human food the creature liked. After working hard in the spaceship, they got it to finally work. The creature was able to return home, and, even across the galaxy, the two were strong friends. The creature never forgot what Alan did for him, and, every once in a while, the creature would return to visit Earth. They watch movies, listen to music and eat the creature's favorite food: a rare Earth delicacy known as Cheeto Puffs."},{"prompt":"Is the following news report about love, conflict, or religion? Please explain your reasoning. Serbian troops on the border with Kosovo were put on high alert Friday following clashes inside Kosovo between police and ethnic Serbs that injured more than a dozen people. Ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo, who are a majority in that part of the country, had tried to block recently-elected ethnic Albanian officials from entering municipal buildings earlier Friday. Last month’s snap election was largely boycotted by ethnic Serbs and only ethnic Albanian or other smaller minority representatives were elected in the mayoral posts and assemblies. Kosovo police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd and let the new officials into the offices. Several cars were set ablaze. Kosovo Serb hospital officials said about 10 protesters were injured. Police said five officers were injured as protesters hurled stun grenades and other objects. A police car was burned. In response to the clashes, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said he put the army on the “highest state of alert” and ordered an “urgent” movement of troops closer to the border. He also demanded that NATO-led troops stationed in Kosovo protect ethnic Serbs from the police.","completion":"The news report is about a conflict. It focuses on friction between police and crowds in the wake of an election."},{"prompt":"Provide an argument supporting the idea that living a healthy life and avoiding excesses is more important than living a life in pursuit of the most pleasure.","completion":"Utilitarianism is the belief that life should be lived in such a way that one maximizes happiness and minimizes sadness. However, while this is a great way to live to obtain pleasure, this path will ultimately lead to pain. In the pursuit of the greatest happiness, or the greatest pleasure, people inevitably try to gain more happiness and more pleasure until they become numb to it and have to go to further extremes to obtain it. For instance, people who enjoy the taste of food may end up on a path to obesity if their pursuit of happiness through food leads them to excess intake. People who look for physical pleasure in the form of sex may become lustful in their search for more pleasure, and they may also begin to entertain more perverse and twisted sexual fantasies. Still, others may be adrenaline junkies who love the thrills of bungee jumping, skydiving, or traveling fast in a car, but as they attempt to push themselves to find bigger and better thrills, they ultimately put themselves in dangerous and deadly situations that could end their lives. In contrast to utilitarianism, living a healthy life and avoiding excesses is a better way to live a happier, more fulfilling life. There may still be some discomfort or pain in the pursuit of a healthy life (i.e. dieting, exercising, demonstrating discipline), but these short-term discomforts pale in comparison to the long-term benefits of living longer and being healthier. One would argue that those who practice a lifestyle of moderation - like those who travel the \\"middle road\\" of Taoism - end up going with the flow of life, careful to balance in the middle of its scales rather than leaning to one side and tipping those scales in one direction."},{"prompt":"According to this text, what year did British Alpine goats become a breed and what countries have Alpine goats been introduced in? In 1903, Alpine goats brought from Switzerland were crossed with domestic goats to create the British Alpine breed. In 1958, the first British Alpines were transported to Australia, although there weren’t many due to quarantine rules. The ancestors of modern goats came from the group Aegodontia, which includes all bovids outside of the subfamily Bovinae. In general, the behavior of modern bovids varies greatly, with some being solitary and others traveling in groups. The alpine goat became well established in the US in the early 1900s by breeding goats. Thus, Rock Alpine goats were bred for further development. Via Frenchman Joseph Crepin, Alpines, including Saanens and Toggs, were imported into Canada in 1904.","completion":"British Alpine goats were first bred in 1903 when Alpine goats were brought from Switzerland to England.

Mites and lice feast on blood and skin tissue, not straw. They are not going to live inside straw tubes for very long, if at all.

Then he went down a bank to the frozen path of a small stream. This was Henderson Creek and he knew he was ten miles from where the stream divided. He looked at his watch. It was ten o’clock. He was traveling at the rate of four miles an hour. Thus, he figured that he would arrive where the stream divided at half-past twelve. He decided he would eat his lunch when he arrived there. The dog followed again at his heels, with its tail hanging low, as the man started to walk along the frozen stream. The old sled trail could be seen, but a dozen inches of snow covered the marks of the last sleds. In a month no man had traveled up or down that silent creek. The man went steadily ahead. He was not much of a thinker. At that moment he had nothing to think about except that he would eat lunch at the stream’s divide and that at six o’clock he would be in camp with the boys. There was nobody to talk to; and, had there been, speech would not have been possible because of the ice around his mouth. Once in a while the thought repeated itself that it was very cold and that he had never experienced such cold. As he walked along he rubbed his face and nose with the back of his mittened hand. He did this without thinking, frequently changing hands. But, with all his rubbing, the instant he stopped, his face and nose became numb. His face would surely be frozen. He knew that and he was sorry that he had not worn the sort of nose guard Bud wore when it was cold. Such a guard passed across the nose and covered the entire face. But it did not matter much, he decided. What was a little frost? A bit painful, that was all. It was never serious. Empty as the man’s mind was of thoughts, he was most observant. He noticed the changes in the creek, the curves and the bends. And always he noted where he placed his feet. Once, coming around a bend, he moved suddenly to the side, like a frightened horse. He curved away from the place where he had been walking and retraced his steps several feet along the trail. He knew the creek was frozen to the bottom. No creek could contain water in that winter. But he knew also that there were streams of water that came out from the hillsides and ran along under the snow and on top of the ice of the creek. He knew that even in the coldest weather these streams were never frozen, and he also knew their danger. They hid pools of water under the snow that might be three inches deep, or three feet. Sometimes a skin of ice half an inch thick covered them, and in turn was covered by the snow. Sometimes there was both water and thin ice, and when a man broke through he could get very wet. That was why he had jumped away so suddenly. He had felt the ice move under his feet. He had also heard the noise of the snow-covered ice skin breaking. And to get his feet wet in such a temperature meant trouble and danger. At the very least it meant delay, because he would be forced to stop and build a fire. Only under its protection could he bare his feet while he dried his socks and moccasins. He stood and studied the creek bottom and its banks. He decided that the flowing stream of water came from the right side. He thought a while, rubbing his nose and face. Then he walked to the left. He stepped carefully and tested the ice at each step. Once away from the danger, he continued at his four-mile pace.","completion":"Through the forest, he trekked a while, Down a bank, on a frozen stream, with a smile. Henderson Creek, ten miles he knew, His watch read ten, his pace steady and true. Four miles an hour, his travel speed, At half-past twelve, the divide he'd heed. Lunch awaited at the stream's embrace, No thoughts to ponder, a peaceful space. The dog trailed behind, tail hanging low, Along the frozen stream, they continued to go. Sled tracks concealed beneath snow's deep cover, No man had passed, no sound did hover. He pressed onward, not much of a thinker, With lunch and camp as his mind's only blinker. Silence surrounded, no words to be spoken, Frozen ice prevented his voice from being awoken. The cold persisted, a thought would arise, Unfamiliar chills, an icy surprise. His mittened hand against his face he pressed, Yet, numbness followed, freezing each crest. His face would freeze, he was well aware, Regretting the nose guard he didn't wear. But it mattered little, frost was a mere pain, Not a grave concern, just a temporary strain. Thoughts absent, observant he remained, Noting creek changes, each curve, each bend. Mindful of his steps, where his feet would tread, A sudden shift, avoiding a hidden thread. He veered away from the treacherous sight, Retraced his path, cautious and contrite. Frozen was the creek, down to its core, But hidden streams lurked, water's silent roar. Underneath snow and ice, they slyly flowed, Pools concealed, a danger unbeknownst. Thin layers of ice sometimes deceived, A man's misstep, a chance to be relieved. That's why he leapt, avoiding the break, Ice shifting beneath, the noise awake. For wet feet in such cold spelled trouble and woe, Delay or danger, he didn't wish to bestow. He gazed at the creek, studied its terrain, Water flowed from the right, he could ascertain. After thought and reflection, he made his choice, To the left he ventured, heeding ice's voice. Careful steps, testing the frozen ground, Away from peril, onward he bound. At his steady pace, four miles he'd stride, A lone traveler, in nature's embrace, he'd abide."},{"prompt":"Could you provide me with three helpful practices to help me regain control of my finances?","completion":"Here are some ideas I have for you to get back on top of your finance: 1. Budgeting - this is extremely helpful in gaining an idea of your income and where you're money is going. It will also help you lay out any short or long-term goals you would have regarding your finances. A good rule to follow when it comes the budgeting is known as the 50/30/20 rule. What this means is you should allocate 50% of your after-tax income to expenses you consider essential, then you would want to allocate 30% to the things you want such as amenities in the last 20% should go towards your savings. 2. Financial safety net - this practice will allow you to have money set aside for emergencies. Doing this will allow you to not rely on using a credit card for paying for major unexpected expenses. It's common practice to save about three to six months of your current living expenses to build that emergency fund. 3. Paying existing debts - existing debt can be a major contributing factor to the drain on your finances especially when faced with high interest rates. It's a good idea to make a plan to know how long realistically it would take you to pay off any loans or debt you may have. Cards that have the highest interest rates are the ones you're going to want to prioritize making extra payments on. You'll want to make sure you're only charging what you're capable of paying each month."},{"prompt":"Write the introduction to a short story about a woman who gains powers.

Flamini was 48 years old when she went into isolation and 50 when she emerged from the cave on April 14, 2023. The extreme athlete took up the challenge to test her mental strength. She also wanted to help scientists explore the effects of isolation on the human body and mind. Flamini entered the cave outside Granada, Spain, on November 20, 2021. She carried two Go Pro cameras to document her underground stay, 60 books, and some art and craft supplies. A team of volunteers supported the ambitious expedition by regularly dropping off food, fresh clothes, and water near the cave's entrance.

Use this information to respond: Chromecast can be used to play games Many Android users probably know that they can mirror the screen of their Android phone or tablet to a Chromecast device to share what they’re doing on the big screen. While screen mirroring performance might not be good enough to play a lot of regular games, there are actually a number that are specifically designed with Chromecast in mind. There are a number of multiplayer games that work with Chromecast designed specifically to take advantage of the big screen for party gaming. DrawParty and PictoParty are digital takes on the classic party game Pictionary. Puzzle Cast allows you to put together a jigsaw puzzle without all the mess and missing pieces. If you’re partial to word games, Wordcast is a big-screen multiplayer equivalent of the classic Scrabble. Or for something different, you can try Scrabble Blitz, which challenges you to make up words as quickly as possible. Whatever your taste is, you should be able to find something to play during your next friendly get together.","completion":"This article states that while you can play games on your television from your Android phone via Chromecast, the screen mirroring performance is not good enough to play all games.

There was nothing for it but to close my eyes and surrender. With my eyes tightly shut, I curled into a ball and waited, hoping the end would come swiftly. Without warning, the silence was broken by a menacing roar. I braced myself for the impact, but as the seconds ticked by, nothing happened. Why was I still alive? I forced my eyes to open.

These clauses typically set boundaries for the performers that prevent them from being forced to perform in the nude, whether this is requested fully or partially. Sometimes, when this clause is in place, a body double will take the place of the actor, and the nude portions of the body double will be shown as if they belonged to the actor or actress.

Talk specifically about whether to replace rain gutters or not. Give some pros and cons of repairing instead of replacing an item.","completion":"One valuable tip for homeowners is to decide if it’s cheaper to just replace an item than repair it. Rain gutters are a good example. Each spring, it’s important to get your ladder out of the garage and climb up to check out your rain gutters. Over the winter, they can become full of leaves, and they should be thoroughly cleaned out before the first hard rain of spring. If the gutters are over 10 years old and showing signs of wear, it might be time to replace them. This is usually a judgment call. It might be possible to clean them out, tighten the brackets and use them one more year. Today, you’ll find products that claim they never need cleaning. Check these out if you’re one of those people who hate gutter cleaning. Some of the vinyl brands now offer a lifetime warranty and never need to be painted. Though products like this often cost more initially, they save you money down the road. Of course, if you are simply making a few repairs before selling your home, it’s best not to plunk down thousands of dollars for the very best flooring, gutters, etc. If you and your family know that you are going to be staying in the house for at least five more years, then it might be worthwhile to buy a better-grade product."},{"prompt":"I want to plant vegetables in my garden but it's autumn now. What can I plant so it will still grow well? I don't like parsnips or broad beans.","completion":"Growing your own vegetables is a great idea and there are several varieties that won't mind cold weather in winter: 1. Brassicas: Cabbage, bok choy, cauliflower, and broccoli are all great options for winter gardening. Not only do they like cooler temperatures, but they tend to bolt in warm weather so it's better to plant them in autumn. 2. Leafy Greens: Spinach, kale, lettuce, and Swiss chard are very hardy vegetables that thrive in cold weather. Plant seeds in early autumn or get seedlings later and you will have fresh vegetables in your garden for most of the winter months. 3. Root Vegetables: Radishes, carrots, beetroot, and turnips are all vegetables harvested for their roots, which are very well protected underground. Unless your region gets a lot of snow, these vegetables are a great choice for winter gardening. 4. Peas: Snow peas are a wonderful variety that can be grown outside in most weather conditions. Just make sure to sow them in early autumn so they can grow to establish healthy roots before the frosts start. 5. Garlic is one of those vegetables that can't be grown at any time of year--winter is the only chance you get. Plant the cloves in autumn and watch them grow throughout the winter months. If you have a greenhouse or solarium, you have even more options with vegetables like tomatoes and peppers thriving well into the winter months. Even without a greenhouse, covering your vegetables with frost cloth can help to make them last longer."},{"prompt":"How long should I let baked cookies rest before eating?","completion":"I mean, let me ask my manager, I guess.

For example, a tree in a humid environment will need less water than a dry environment and in the summer trees need more water than they do in the winter due to heat and sun. A good rule of thumb is to water the tree when the soil becomes dry in the top 1-2 inches of the soil. To test how often to water in any given season, water the tree thoroughly and check it daily by poking your finger into the soil to test for dryness. Once dry, water again. You may find that in hot summer months, you need to water your tree 2-3 a week, while in the winter, watering may be required much less frequently. Pay attention to your tree and monitor it for signs of over or under-watering. If you notice yellowing or spotted leaves these may be symptoms of poor health. To give your tree the best care for your area and environment, consult a local nursery on the best way to properly care for your tree."},{"prompt":"Come up with four or five sentences about why basil is a good companion plant for tomatoes.","completion":"Tomatoes and basil are basically soul mates, both in the garden and on your plate.

Use information only from the following part of the article: What Is Big Data? Big data refers to the large, diverse sets of information that grow at ever-increasing rates. It encompasses the volume of information, the velocity or speed at which it is created and collected, and the variety or scope of the data points being covered (known as the \\"three v's\\" of big data). Big data often comes from data mining and arrives in multiple formats. How Big Data Works Big data can be categorized as unstructured or structured. Structured data consists of information already managed by the organization in databases and spreadsheets; it is frequently numeric in nature. Unstructured data is information that is unorganized and does not fall into a predetermined model or format. It includes data gathered from social media sources, which help institutions gather information on customer needs. Big data can be collected from publicly shared comments on social networks and websites, voluntarily gathered from personal electronics and apps, through questionnaires, product purchases, and electronic check-ins. The presence of sensors and other inputs in smart devices allows for data to be gathered across a broad spectrum of situations and circumstances. Big data is most often stored in computer databases and is analyzed using software specifically designed to handle large, complex data sets. Many software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies specialize in managing this type of complex data.","completion":"Big data refers to massive, rapidly growing sets of diverse information from multiple sources.

Today, Ryoto Matsuzawa says there are 1,250 farms left, most of which are under one hectare in size. “We want to preserve those at all costs.” The city recently made a crucial decision to do so. Eighty percent of the farms protected under the Law on Productive Green Areas were registered the year that law was enacted, in 1992. The law stipulates that after 30 years, the landowners can ask the city to buy their land at market price. But most cities, strapped for cash, can’t afford to. If they don’t, the land loses its tax subsidy and can be sold for commercial development.

He told me it could speak. Russian. He knew that I was bilingual, so he asked me to do some translation. I sat patiently, listening. Nothing. I’d almost given up waiting. Then I heard it. It was Russian, alright, with a Labradoodle accent. Sadly though, it was total nonsense: “Spotted carats snipe phlegm kisses.” I didn’t have the heart to tell my friend about his furrier friend’s crazed utterance.

We here at Project: Sword and Shield are thrilled to give you this new update for the game and to let you know about what we have in store for the future. First of all, as you know, we have reached the beta testing phase of development for Project: Sword and Shield. This means anyone who has contributed to our crowd-funding campaign will be sent a code within the next 48 hours of this email, which will allow you to log into the game and play the campaign in its current form. We want to get enough of you to play the game to stress-test our servers for the upcoming multiplayer campaign expected to be released in two months and to also give you the chance to check out the work we've been doing and what you have paid to support. Secondly, we'd like to provide a roadmap and timeline for the completion of the game and its subsequent roll-out to you, the supporters, and those players who purchase the game when it is released soon after. Our current outlook on the release of the game looks to be on time, with the original intended release date (August 1, 2023) being the target date for release to you, the supporters. On September 1, 2023, the game is anticipated to be ready for wide release to the public. We are releasing the game to supporters before doing a wide release to everyone to show our appreciation to you (the supporters) by giving you a chance to experience the game before anyone else and to get a head start on creating and leveling up your characters. In addition, we will be giving all campaign supporters several in-game items for free which will not be available to the public, just as another token of our appreciation. Another reason we will be providing early access to supporters is to make sure the completed game (including multiplayer) works perfectly before we do the wide release on September 1. This gives you an entire month of playing the game and offering any tips or suggestions, or pointing out any bugs that might exist. That's all for now. Thank you all for your support!"},{"prompt":"What are some ways I can eliminate trash being littered in my community? I don't want to tackle this issue alone so the proposed ideas shouldn't be solo solutions I have to do by myself. FYI, I live in a condo community, within a suburban metropolitan region.","completion":"Trash littered within a community is unpleasant and can be hard to prevent if the culprits are unknown. Here are some ways to prevent trash from being littered in your community. 1) Engage the HOA HOA groups often create and enforce policies for the residential communities they manage. Most likely, you are not the only resident observing the trash being littered around your neighborhood and there is a high chance that other neighbors share the discontent. If your townhouse community has an HOA, bringing this issue to their attention at the next HOA meeting may be a good way to start. With enough support from other residents and approval from the HOA board, guidelines can be set restricting any trash to be littered. HOA often also have the power, written into the contractual agreements signed by residents before move-in, to enforce rules they set. Penalties for residents refusing to comply with rules may range from thousands of dollars in fees to eviction. If new HOA rules making improper disposal of trash can be set, then residents will have to eventually comply, assuming the root cause is from within the community. HOAs may even help lead preventative strategies attempting to proactively address the problem. Some strategies include the installation of waste baskets for general use, increasing the frequency of waste management services, installing street signs, and/or employing third-party street cleaning services. 2) Establish a Neighborhood Watch Group A neighborhood watch, also called a crime watch is an organized group of civilians devoted to crime and vandalism prevention within a neighborhood, including littering. Similar to HOA organizations, members of watch groups are often intrinsically motivated to maintain a clean neighborhood and share the same common goals. Neighborhood watch groups can be as informal or formal as one would like, although informal methods may be easier to start if your community does not have such a group in place already. Typically, informal watch groups involve select community residents patrolling and monitoring the community looking out for any suspicious activity, crime, or other behavior breaking rules. A schedule is usually shared between volunteers listing out availabilities, procedures in case of emergencies, and contact information, including local law enforcement. Having an active neighborhood watch group monitoring the community will likely deter the culprits. Although the initial purpose of starting a watch group may be to catch and deter litterers, it is possible that the group also inadvertently encounters more serious and dangerous criminals who have gone unnoticed in the past. Depending on the danger of the threats, and if the watch group volunteers are inexperienced or untrained in handling more threatening situations, then risks can quickly escalate beyond what was anticipated. Therefore, the safety of the volunteers within the group is an important concern and should remain a high priority. 3) Contact local law enforcement Law enforcement will likely be able to assist in preventing trash to be littered in your community. Law enforcement is a public service and it can be argued that trash is impeding the well-being of the local public. A big advantage of involving law enforcement over creating a local neighborhood watch group is that the former has extensive experience and training in dealing with a wide range of threats, while the latter may not. For example, if the litterers also coincidentally happen to be wanted fugitives then law enforcement would be prepared to apprehend the criminals safely away from the community residents. Another advantage of involving law enforcement to eliminate trash being littered in your community is that they can adjust their levels of engagement depending on the severity of the issues. If the trash being littered is largely immaterial or non-threatening, then they may elect to install street signs warning culprits of the consequences of littering or occasionally patrol the street in marked police cars. Law enforcement may even leave a marked police car in plain sight within the community since the sight of a police car is known to reduce the chances of criminal activity in most cases. However, if trash being littered is significantly harming the residents (e.g., hazardous materials, food waste, heavy items, etc.), then law enforcement will likely elect to increase their engagement and may even dedicate an officer present at all times. As illustrated, some of the benefits of contacting law enforcement are the flexibility of engagement, the depth of their expertise, and nearly unlimited resources in combatting the littering issue."},{"prompt":"Compose an Amazon product review for a shrink-ray gun.","completion":"Five Out of Five! Buy this item! It has been about a week since I received the Acme Shrink-Ray Gun that I purchased here from Amazon. I was a little hesitant because all of the reviews here are so glowing. It makes you think that some of them might be fake! I am pleased to report, though, that this product is well-deserving of its high marks. I’ve been having some issues with ex-boyfriends going on social media and trashing me. It is so obnoxious. They say things like \\"She’s a weirdo,\\" \\"Stay away from her,\\" and \\"She talks about revenge all of the time!\\" And clearly, that’s not true! I talk about soap operas sometimes, too. My first purchase of a shrink-ray gun from Amazon was a disappointment. If you look at the reviews for the Widget Company Shrink-Ray Gun (my alias is @uwillpay), you’ll see that this was a far inferior product. The degree of shrinkage on that gun was a low 75%. I’m sorry, but an ex-boyfriend who's 2 feet tall is still way too big—are you with me? I donated it to charity. It was like a kid's toy or something. But the Acme Shrink-Ray Gun far outperformed the competition. When I waited in the shadows at Jerry’s house until he came outside with the trash, the Acme Shrink-Ray Gun got the job done! Jerry shrank from 6 feet to one inch. I’m serious, this is a great product! Well, of course, I did zap him again, and he’s probably riding on the back of a flea right now or something.

Opinion My father, Henry Kissinger, is turning 100. This is his guide to longevity. On Saturday, my father, Henry Kissinger, celebrates his 100th birthday. This might have an air of inevitability for anyone familiar with his force of character and love of historical symbolism. Not only has he outlived most of his peers, eminent detractors and students, but he has also remained indefatigably active throughout his 90s. Even the pandemic did not slow him down: Since 2020, he has completed two books and begun work on a third. He returned from the Bilderberg Conference in Lisbon earlier this week just in time to embark on a series of centennial celebrations that will take him from New York to London and finally to his hometown of Fürth, Germany. My father’s longevity is especially miraculous when one considers the health regimen he has followed throughout his adult life, which includes a diet heavy on bratwurst and Wiener schnitzel, a career of relentlessly stressful decision-making, and a love of sports purely as a spectator, never a participant. David Von Drehle: My neighbor lived to be 109. This is what I learned from him. How then to account for his enduring mental and physical vitality? He has an unquenchable curiosity that keeps him dynamically engaged with the world. His mind is a heat-seeking weapon that identifies and grapples with the existential challenges of the day. In the 1950s, the issue was the rise of nuclear weapons and their threat to humanity. About five years ago, as a promising young man of 95, my father became obsessed with the philosophical and practical implications of artificial intelligence. ADVERTISING As the Thanksgiving turkey was passed around in recent years, he would ruminate about the repercussions of this new technology, in ways that occasionally reminded his grandchildren of storylines in the Terminator films. While immersing himself in the technical aspects of AI with the intensity of an MIT grad student, he infused the debate over its uses with his singular philosophical and historical insight. The other secret to my father’s endurance is his sense of mission. Although he has been caricatured as a cold realist, he is anything but dispassionate. He believes deeply in such arcane concepts as patriotism, loyalty and bipartisanship. It pains him to see the nastiness in today’s public discourse and the seeming collapse of the art of diplomacy. As a child, I remember the warmth of his friendships with people whose politics might have been different from his, such as Kay Graham, Ted Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey. Kennedy loved to play practical jokes that my father thoroughly enjoyed (including inviting Dad to his home office and claiming to have a mongoose hidden in a closet). Even as Cold War tensions persisted, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin was a frequent guest at our house. The two of them would occasionally play games of chess between negotiating issues affecting the entire planet. My father had no illusions about the repressive nature of the Soviet regime, but these regular conversations helped de-escalate tensions at a time when the nuclear superpowers appeared to be on a collision course. If only such regular dialogue occurred between the top players in today’s global tensions. Chess aside, diplomacy was never a game for my father. He practiced it with a commitment and tenacity born of personal experience. As a refugee from Nazi Germany, he had lost 13 family members and countless friends to the Holocaust. He returned to his native Germany as an American soldier, participating in the liberation of the Ahlem concentration camp near Hannover. There, he witnessed the depths to which mankind can sink unconstrained by international structures of peace and justice. Next month, we will return to Fürth, where he will lay a wreath at the grave of his grandfather, who did not escape. I know that no son can be truly objective about his father’s legacy, but I am proud of my father’s efforts to anchor statecraft with consistent principles and an awareness of historical reality. This is the mission he has pursued for the better part of a century, using his rare brain and unflagging energy to serve the country that saved his family and launched him on a journey beyond his wildest dreams.","completion":"The 10 Keys to Longevity by Henry Kissinger 1) Cultivate a forceful character throughout your life. 2) Never forget an offense and determine to outlive your adversaries and neigh-sayers. 3) Make sure you have a stressful career where you make decisions with global, historical, and life-and-death consequences every day. 4) Eat bratwurst daily - preferably twice a day. 5) Have a mind like a heat-seeking missile and remain curious. 6) Care deeply about the world, but maintain a cold, dispassionate, and skeptical view of everything. 7) Assume new technology is harmful until proven otherwise, and even then... 8) Play chess while negotiating nuclear deals. 9) Believe in public institutions, even though you know the people in them to be corrupt and evil. 10) Don't forget to laugh because life is short, even if you live to be 100."},{"prompt":"write a love song that is a to-do list of things for the summer","completion":"Got a list of things to do Not surprising that they're all with you You're on my list and I'm gonna check it Come along I know you won't regret it Let's ride our bikes to the beach Watch the sunset out of reach Take a hike, find a trail Let's make this summer one for the tale I'll take you camping out in the woods Spend the night, just like we should Sleeping bags in a lil ole tent Now that's a night that is sure well spent Let's spend a lazy day in bed Read books, forget what lies ahead Let's dance under the stars at night Hold each other tight, make it right Got my list, gonna make it count Do all the things we've talked about Let's make memories that last all time Happening as long as you are mine"},{"prompt":"Write the classic scene of a kid finding a doorway to another world.

Eiji Aonuma likes to cheat. “I’m somebody who, if I can find a way, likes to do that kind of gameplay,” the longtime Zelda developer told Polygon in an interview on Thursday, ahead of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom’s May 12 release. It’s an ethos from which Link’s new Ascend ability was formed — as a debug feature that Aonuma and director Hidemaro Fujibayashi used to easily exit the depths of Tears of the Kingdom’s caves. “When I was exploring the caves, I would get to the destination where I was trying to get to, and once I checked it out, I would just use the debug code to get to the top,” Fujibayashi told Polygon. “And I thought, Well, maybe this is something that can be usable in the game.” Aonuma agreed with Fujibayashi that it was a “pain” to go all the way back through Tears of the Kingdom’s labyrinthine caves. “When I heard that, I thought, Oh, I guess he would feel the same way that I would be feeling,” Fujibayashi said. “That’s how we got to implementing Ascend.

Keep the tone light and humorous.","completion":"What's a cat's favorite show? Claw and Order. Some 14,000 years ago, animals started trading their role as predators or prey for pets. Dogs of course made the transition first when wolves became human's companions and protectors. Cats, however, waited to join human society until around 8,000 years ago. Cats hung around villages and cities to catch rodents after the latter quickly learned that crops were an easy meal. Humans accepted cats after noticing they kept the rodent population in check, and cats decided that living among people wasn't all that bad. What do cats like to eat on a hot day? A mice-cream cone. Today cats and dogs have shed their predator and prey images and even their pet status. Dogs spend their days at doggie daycare, serve as ring bearers for weddings, enjoy a trip to the beach and dress up for Halloween. Cats own the internet with rumba-riding cat videos, sleep on their human's beds and eat food fit for people. Owning a pet has been shown to help lower blood pressure, relieve stress and depression and increase the human life span. But perhaps the greatest benefit of having a pet is the unconditional love and companionship they provide. In return, cats and dogs are loved and cherished and considered vital family members.

Each day, people naturally lose approximately 30,000 to 40,000 dead skin cells. This layer also has melanin, which gives skin its color. 2. Dermis: The middle layer of the skin. This layer has nerve endings that send messages to the spinal cord or brain to tell people how things feel. This layer also has tiny blood vessels that bring nutrients and oxygen to skin cells and remove waste. 3. Subcutaneous Layer: The bottom layer of the skin. This layer is mainly fat to help bodies stay warm and absorb shocks when hitting something. This layer also helps attach the skin to other tissues and has hair follicles to help body hair grow."},{"prompt":"Write the story of The Milkmaid and Her Pail for an elementary child.

Each bean bag needs 7x7 inches of fabric. Can you write me a program that'll do yards for how many bean bags I want? It's for a craft project.","completion":"Of course! Here is a Python script that will calculate the number of yards of fabric to make your bean bags: # Define a function to calculate yardage based on number of bean bags def yardage(beanbag_count): # Convert bean bag inches of fabric to yards beanbag_inches = beanbag_count * 49 beanbag_yards = beanbag_inches / 36 return beanbag_yards # Get the number of bean bags beanbag_count = float(input(\\"How many beanbags are you making? \\")) # Call the function yards_fabric = yardage(beanbag_count) print(f\\"You will need {yards_fabric} yards of fabric for {beanbag_count} bean bags.\\") This script defines the function \`yardage(beanbag_count)\` to calculate the yards based on the number of bean bags you are making. It converts the bean bag number to inches by multiplying it by 7 x 7 = 49 inches per bean bag, then converts inches to yards by dividing the number by 36 inches per yard. These could be consolidated into one line of code, but separating them makes the code more comprehensible. The function then returns the yards of fabric needed for the bean bags. The bean bag count is requested with an \`input()\` function that is converted to a floating point decimal from a string with \`float()\`, then it is passed as an argument to \`yardage()\` to get the variable \`yards_fabric\`.

He decided to hike up the Sacred Mountain in the hope that by reaching the mountaintop he will gain a new perspective and ultimately achieve inner peace. The monk gathered himself and began his hike from the bottom of the mountain 3,000 below the believed source of his nirvana. As the monk hiked up the mountain, he came to a crossing where he was met by a tiger that was trapped in a thorny hedge. The tiger growled as the monk approached it; the monk, unafraid of the tiger and instead feeling compassion for its plight, began pulling the thorny vines away from the tiger in an attempt to free it from its bonds. The tiger continued to growl but became more curious as the monk freed it from the bush's grasp. Once the tiger was free, the monk bowed before it and offered a peaceful smile. The tiger, rather than attack the monk, laid down in front of the monk, appearing to be grateful for the monk's assistance. The monk, pleased with the outcome, got up and continued on his path. Further up the mountain, the monk was intercepted by two bandits who were obstructing the path. The bandits appeared menacing and looked like they were ready to pounce on the monk. The monk, on the other hand, was calm and assured of himself. The bandits produced knives from their robes, thinking they would take the monk's possessions with force. However, the monk reached into his robes and produced a loaf of bread and a clay bottle containing water; he offered the items to the bandits, who received the items with a sense of gratitude. The monk walked past the bandits, who offered no resistance and instead bowed to the monk with humility and respect. The monk was within a few hundred yards of the mountaintop when a dark cloud formed around it and threatened to drench the monk in water. Lightning began striking the ground below the clouds, but this did not deter the monk from continuing on the path. As the monk walked through the storm clouds untouched, he reached the top of the mountain and was greeted with a view of the entire world; the view immediately gave him a sense of peace."},{"prompt":"Please create a short review for me of the book poor dad rich dad.

You'll have to take some creative liberties in Dennis's inner thoughts but make sure they feel authentic based on the article. Include the term \\"American Dream\\" somewhere. Dennis C. would rather retire than return to the office full time — and that's exactly what he did. The Alabama-based 65-year-old, who verified his last name, former employment, and salary range with Insider, but asked that they be withheld to protect his privacy, got a taste of working from home years ago. In 2018, higher-ups at his job handed a day of remote work out as a reward. By 2019, he was working two days remotely, and three days in the office. He said that schedule was \\"fantastic,\\" and he thought he'd never retire: \\"This is perfect, this is heaven.\\" But as 2020 rolled in and sent everyone home, he discovered he loved full-time remote work even more. \\"We went to five days a week and it was like, 'Oh, I thought two was good, five is the sweet spot,'\\" Dennis said. \\"There's no reason to go back to the office.\\" He loved remote work for the same reasons he thinks other people do: more time to concentrate, and fewer meetings. He could turn off his camera, mute, and still plug away. His commute went from 20 minutes to five minutes. \\"If I wanted to do something and it wasn't time constrained, I could stop work and pick it up later that evening,\\" he said. He's not alone in that: Some remote workers are living like college kids again, using their afternoons for leisure activities or errands, and then picking work back up later in the day. \\"The more choice we have, the more autonomy we have, I think, the happier we are,\\" Dennis said. But then, in April 2021, Dennis was called back to the office. The company wanted him to come in for three days a week. Dennis, who was technically eligible to retire and had already been looking for new roles, said it was the straw that broke the camel's back. \\"When they said that I was going to have to come back, I sent them an email saying I'm retiring,\\" he said. Dennis had already secured a job offer elsewhere as a defense contractor. With the new role, he'd be taking a slight pay cut, bringing his salary from six figures to a little less. But since he receives new monthly retirement benefits from his old federal job, he's still technically bringing in more than he was before. His new role is also fully remote, a must-have for him. He said that it's been, in a word, \\"fantastic.\\" Bosses are made obsolete by remote work Dennis isn't alone. Felicia, an administrator in Arizona, previously told Insider that she too was leaving behind a six-figure salary over a forced return to the office. Her bosses were suffering from productivity paranoia and could not believe that people working from home were actually working. Dennis said that he thinks the only people who fully fail at remote work are those who went to meetings in person, walked around with a piece of paper, and looked busy — but weren't actually getting much done. But self-starters and motivated people with goals can excel with remote work. But remote work also calls into question the purpose of a boss, he said. A boss's model, whether they voice it aloud, is to make sure their employees get work done. And so those employees have to be there, in front of them, so the bosses can ensure they're working. \\"It's almost, 'If I don't see you working, then I don't have anything to do. What's my purpose?'\\" Dennis said. \\"So, I think that's the main driver of bringing people back.\\" With the pandemic, the remote-work genie is out of the bag, Dennis said. At his old job, higher-ups once doled out remote work as a reward. Now, there's a \\"bunch of people\\" who know they don't need to be in the office to do productive work. And that's going to lead to a reckoning for bosses. \\"The managers, especially the mid-level managers, still are going to want to see people. That's kind of justification for their job,\\" he said. \\"If everybody can work remote, it's a new model for the manager.\\" Even as remote work has fallen off slightly in the near term — the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently found that nearly 73% surveyed of companies offered little to no telework in September, compared to 60% surveyed in 2021 — Dennis still thinks it will slowly take over, especially as office leases expire. \\"I'm a baby boomer, so we're starting to die out,\\" he said. He added that as baby boomers \\"leave the scene, so to speak,\\" so will some of their traditions. \\"I think a lot of people that have exposure to remote work will say, 'Hey, that worked,'\\" Dennis said.","completion":"There was no going back after Dennis got his first taste of remote work. Forty years in the workforce had come and gone as he worked his way up the corporate ladder, and things never really changed. Not until 2018, when his Alabama employer began to offer a brand new benefit: As a reward for good work, employees would be offered one day of remote work. Though the concept was foreign, it intrigued Dennis, and he worked towards gaining as many remote days as possible. As his first day of work at home passed, he felt like this was something he could get used to. The convenience was unmatched -- who wouldn't prefer a five-minute commute to the home office over twenty minutes in traffic? Dennis continued to strive towards earning more of this reward and by the next year, his work week consisted of two days at home and three days in the office. Settled into the new routine, he felt he could do this forever. If he could always experience this much flexibility, maybe he didn't even have to retire... The split allowed him the flexibility to run errands before the stores closed while picking his work up again at a time that felt more convenient. Things couldn't possibly be better. Then, in 2020, his work became fully remote. Five days of work at home seemed too good to be true; it improved his concentration and productivity, and there were far fewer meetings. For the first time since joining the workforce, Dennis had autonomy over his schedule. Working remotely for two days was fantastic, but he quickly realized that five days was the sweet spot. There was no reason to return to the office now. When talking with other people, Dennis seemed to notice a pattern. All of his coworkers that failed at remote work were the types of people that would attend meetings with paper and pen, pretending to look busy the entire time. But anyone who was a self-starter, who could find their own motivation, seemed to be thriving. Still, there was one more group of people he had yet to consider: The bosses. What was a boss's purpose, anyway? Did they actually do anything but micromanage their underlings? He couldn't help wondering what all of the bosses and higher-ups were doing during their remote working time, since there was nobody for them to watch or manage. If they don't see people working... what's their purpose? Sure enough, another year came and went, and Dennis learned the answer. The managers and bosses needed employees back in person so desperately that they drove everybody back to the office. Well, everybody who didn't quit. After he had a taste of full-time remote work, Dennis knew he could never go back. When he got his call to return to his 2019 schedule of two days home and three days in-office, that was the final straw. The camel's back broke. He knew it was time to move on. Sending an email back to the company, Dennis announced his retirement and decided to accept another job offer. Even though this new offer had a smaller salary than his previous position, it didn't matter. A fully remote position made up for that. Not to mention, his old employer would be paying out his monthly retirement benefits now, bringing his income to a higher level than before. This was the new American Dream."},{"prompt":"What are the causes of male pattern baldness?","completion":"Male pattern baldness has to do with your genes and male sex hormones.

Bo-Kaap is also a diverse neighborhood that is home to artists, musicians, entrepreneurs and locals who will happily chat with visitors."},{"prompt":"What are the three types of learning styles widely recognized by educators?","completion":"Educators often classify learning styles into three major types: Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic, each relating to the sensory method in which individuals most effectively receive and process information. -Visual learners prefer to see or observe things, including pictures, diagrams, written directions, and information displayed on whiteboards or in books. They can often remember information better if it's presented visually rather than delivered orally. These individuals might benefit from strategies like using flashcards, taking notes, or watching videos to grasp and retain new information. -Auditory learners, as the name suggests, learn best through listening. They are good at remembering things that they hear, like spoken words, music, or ambient sounds. These individuals may prefer lectures, group discussions, and audio resources for learning. When studying, they might benefit from reading text aloud or using a tape recorder to playback information. -Kinesthetic learners prefer a more physical style of learning through doing and moving. They learn best when they can use tactile experiences and carry out a physical activity to understand a concept. This could include role-playing, building models, or using physical objects that can be touched or manipulated. Kinesthetic learners often prefer a 'hands-on' approach to learning, rather than sitting still for long periods."},{"prompt":"I'm throwing a garden party this June and I'm not going to have alcohol at the party.

They loved their walks, especially Fido, who would often observe their surroundings with a keen eye, identifying all kinds of animals and objects with his keen intellect. It was good, after all, to work the mind as well as the legs, though Fido enjoyed working his legs a great deal as well, especially when they played fetch. One afternoon, Ed and Fido encountered the most peculiar object in their path. It was a stick, but no ordinary stick. No, this stick had only one end. Ed picked it up and turned it around, trying to find the other end. Try as he might, he could not. Fido whimpered, staring at the stick as if wanting a closer look. Ed obliged, holding it down to Fido's nose for him to smell. To Fido, it smelled like any other stick, but he could not deny that it looked very strange, having only a single end. He bit down on it and pulled, prompting Ed to let go, and then dropped it. He tried dropping it again and again from multiple angles, but to no avail - only the one end of the stick ever hit the ground. So Fido did the only sensible thing that one would do upon finding such a strange object. He picked it up to hand to his human to throw. And throw it he did, again and again, long into the evening, and Fido would go running after it. This much Fido understood - no matter how many ends it has, no stick is too strange for a game of fetch."},{"prompt":"Who is the first Super Bowl Champion?","completion":"The Green Bay Packers were the first Super Bowl Champions.

It should have a concerning tone, while still being technically informative.","completion":"Let’s face facts, children aren’t always the most meticulous when it comes to brushing their teeth. Especially on the biting surfaces of the molars and premolars in the back of their mouth. Unfortunately, the contours of these teeth can sometimes be hard to clean from your child’s twice-daily brushing efforts. It’s all too easy for bacterial deposits to accumulate in the natural pits and fissures found on the tooth enamel layer of your back teeth. Over time, these bacterial deposits can gradually start to demineralize the local tooth enamel causing a serious cavity to form. These areas of tooth decay can sometimes be large and lead to more significant complications in the future. Not the least of which being major cavities that can require large fillings or even a dental crown restoration. If your dentist notices bacterial deposits in these areas during your child’s routine dental exam, they might recommend cleaning them away before applying dental sealants. In fact, there are some dentists who recommend dental sealants for any child between the ages of 6 to 16. They are a special type of dental grade resin that the dentist carefully paints onto the biting surface of your child’s molars and premolars. Then a special ultraviolet light to harden the resin creating a protective layer. This way even if bacterial deposits start to accumulate in the textured and contoured areas, the durable dental sealants will keep bacteria from direct access to the tooth enamel. Many dental sealants can provide up to 10 years of protection, which will help your child keep healthy teeth long into their adult life!"},{"prompt":"I need you to come up with ideas for a new game of Monopoly that is based on the Super Smash Brothers video game.

Dodo birds were flightless, fearless birds native to Mauritius, an island off the coast of Madagascar that was largely uninhabited from the human population until the 1500s. This made them an easy target for humans to hunt due to their inability to fly and because of their fearlessness to humans. Not only did humans hunt them, but the animals they brought with them did as well. Dogs, pigs, cats, and rats ate their eggs and destroyed their nests. Because the Dodos had no known natural predators, they did not fear these animals, had no way to defend themselves, and had no means of escape. The presence of these animals created more competition for food and resources and the Dodo birds were simply outnumbered. At the same time, humans were destroying their natural habitats. Explorers cut down trees to make way for paths across the island, pushing the dodo birds into a smaller area. This created an even greater lack of food and ultimately, extinction."},{"prompt":"How many mountain ranges are there in Alaska, and where is the most difficult summit?

Focus on Oswald's life in the Soviet Union, starting with why he moved there to begin with, and end with his return to America. Don't mention John F. Kennedy by name.","completion":"Believe me, a man who assassinates a US President is not someone who had a pleasant life or was well in the head. Lee Harvey Oswald had issues with spelling and reading as a child, though grew to become an avid reader. He declared himself a socialist after reading a good deal of socialist literature, even writing to America's Socialist Party to ask about joining their programs. However, one of his friends at the time disputes that his reading habits were especially sophisticated. I could never judge a man for how he gets into reading, though I can and do judge him for how he would repeat the history of what happened to me. Regardless of how true his claims to read socialist theory were, he was so vocally pro-Soviet that when he joined the US military, he gained the nickname \\"Oswaldskovich.\\" Over three score ago, Oswald taught himself Russian and traveled to the USSR. He insisted to Soviet officials that he loved the Soviet Union and wanted to join. They initially rejected his citizenship application, so he forced them to keep him in the country with a self-inflicted wound. He offered his knowledge of the American military to the Soviets and became a laborer in Belarus. He lived somewhat comfortably for a Soviet worker, though was constantly watched. After only two years, Oswald decided he would rather return to America. I can certainly remember a handful of Confederates who had second thoughts back in my time. Oswald thought that his work was dull and the recreational activities were lacking. Oswald had made a show of his defection but had never actually renounced his citizenship, so he asked the US embassy to return his passport and help his new wife and child immigrate back home. When they returned, they made far less of an impact in the headlines than Oswald had thought they would get."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this article but use lists for the products and corresponding information if available. Thankfully, the time of GPU shortages and overpriced (relative to MSRP) cards is now past. In fact, with PC and PC component sales slumping, there are even some deals to be had, with some cards now selling below MSRP. Unfortunately, the MSRPs on the latest generation parts are sometimes quite a bit higher than their previous gen equivalents — like the 799 RTX 4070 Ti compared to the 599 RTX 3070 Ti.

The GeForce RTX 4080 can be found starting at MSRP as well, with multiple RTX 4080 cards listed at Newegg. The same goes for RTX 4070 Ti that launched in January and has been mostly available with a starting price of 800, and the latest RTX 4070 lands with many 599 models in stock.

I'm a wife and mother of two young kids.","completion":"1. Subaru Ascent. This family-focused car has three rows and the ability to accommodate up to five car seats - perfect for a growing family or days when you're acting as chauffeur for the kiddos' friends. The dash display comes with a seatbelt reminder for the front and back seats, as well as a reminder to check the back seats before exiting the vehicle. The 8-speed manual mode with steering wheel paddle shifters adds a sporty, fun feel to the family car. The fuel economy is hard to beat, with each tank of gas getting you over 500 miles. The Premium and Limited models also come with the option to trade the middle bench seat for two captain's chairs, making access to the third row even easier. 2. Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid. This car is a great choice for you and mother earth, as it is the most fuel-efficient Subaru SUV ever made. Its compact size keeps it sporty and easy to drive, but the roomy backseat can still accommodate three car seats. With Starlink Connected Services, the car's heating and cooling system can be engaged without turning the car on, which means you can blast the A/C while soccer practice is still wrapping up. 3. Subaru Forester. A great choice for outdoorsy families, the Forester is equipped with LATCH seats that allow child seats to be attached to each outboard side position in the backseat. 8.7 inches of ground clearance mean this vehicle is fit for off-road adventures, but still low enough to make it easy for your little ones to climb in. An anti-fatigue system is available, using facial recognition technology to detect driver fatigue and alert the driver and passengers."},{"prompt":"Can you show me how to perform arithmetic on a variable inline with a variable in ahk?","completion":"Of course, that is relatively straight forward. Consider the following script: Value = 4 ValueMinusTwo := value - 2 Msgbox % ValueMinusTwo The first line of the script defines Value as an integer. The second line is defining ValueMinusTwo as a variable in function mode - if the colon was not used with the equals then the variable might interpret Value as a string and math functions would not work as expected. Then it is a simple matter of defining the variable as Value - 2 , which is 2, and this will be stored in the variable ValueMinusTwo. The third line of the script returns 2 as above."},{"prompt":"I have a group that wants to camp somewhere in Arizona near water. We would need a group site that is family and dog friendly.

Maybe it would be a dog he could play fetch with! Or maybe a cat that would hang out with him while he read books. Page 3: On the drive to the shelter, he thought about what names he might choose. Mabel is too common, and so is Spike, he thought to himself. Page 4: Upon arriving at the shelter, a nice lady met them at the door, introduced herself as Joyce, and asked if we wanted to take a look around. “There are so many pets available for you to adopt!” she said. Page 5: Joyce walked them through the shelter and showed them the different animals that needed a good home. There were so many dogs and cats in cages that Tommy didn’t know how he could possibly choose one. Page 6: Then, Tommy spotted a baby kitten in one of the smaller cages. This kitten had all-white fur with blue eyes and stared directly into his eyes. He felt an instant connection. Page 7: “This is the one!” Tommy exclaimed as he pointed at the white kitten. His parents beamed back proudly and turned to face Joyce. “I believe we have found our new pet,” Tommy’s mother told her. Page 8: “Great! I will get the adoption paperwork ready for you. Would you like to hold your new kitten while you wait?” Joyce asked Tommy. “Of course I would!” he said excitedly. Page 9: Tommy sat down on the floor as Joyce put the kitten into his lap. The kitten immediately started purring, and Tommy couldn’t help but to have the biggest grin on his face. Page 10: “I think I’ll name you Cloud. Because clouds are white and fluffy, just like you!” Tommy said to the kitten. Page 11: Joyce came back into the room. “The paperwork is all done!

Write approximately 350 words for this piece.","completion":"Maggie knew instinctively what Carter was going to say, even before he opened his mouth. He always took them on a long drive when he had something heavy on his mind; seeing the scenery of their rural town always seemed to help him unload and talk about what was bothering him. Carter had been acting distant ever since Maggie said she got a job in another state. He brought the jeep to a stop by Gopher’s Creek and shut the engine off. The only sound for some time was the trickling of water. Finally, he turned to her. “Mag, how will we keep a long-distance relationship? Do you think we’ll be able to?” Maggie looked down and bit her lip pensively. She hadn’t really thought about the impact her move would have on their relationship, and now she felt ashamed about how lightly she had taken it. “I don’t know, Carter,” she finally replied. “To be honest, I just don’t know.” “Do you want to?” Maggie lost herself in her thoughts again. Carter had been her friend since middle school, and the two dated from high school all through college. She loved and cared for him deeply, but as far as romantic partners went, he was someone she had always known. He was safe, he was home, like her small hometown. Unexciting, but reliable. She was leaving her state to pursue the career of her dreams, and it felt so thrilling. She realized she wanted the same from her relationship as well. “Maybe long-distance won’t work. Maybe we should get a chance to explore more options.” Carter smiled sadly, reading Maggie like a book. “I thought you might say something like that. So are we calling it quits?” “Maybe it’s for the best.” “Yeah, maybe.” “But Carter?” “Yeah?” Maggie smiled. “If it doesn’t work out for us in our separate endeavors, we’ve always got a home with each other, right?”"},{"prompt":"I need a grocery list written for me.

The serum is a smooth, lightweight product that doesn’t have a smell and doesn’t leave a residue. I have used it once a day for two weeks and it definitely works quickly! I ran out of the CeraVe SA cleanser and it took me a month to get around to buying more. I tried other SA products from a small town general store and I broke out really bad with large cystic acne. I made the trip to Walmart and found my fave cleaner and this serum was next to it on the shelf. The price for the Equate skin products is always much more affordable, and I always love the results so I grabbed this serum. It works quickly! After two weeks of cleanser and this serum, the random bump under my eye has nearly disappeared (it’s some kind of old lady bump that randomly appeared in my 30s and hung out for the last nine years until now), and my large, under-the-skin acne that I had developed right by my left eye and my neck is already gone.

Drain the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside. Reserve the bacon fat for step 2. 2. PREPARE THE MUSHROOMS: Use a paring knife to trim the mushrooms into medium-large pieces, leaving medium and small mushrooms whole. On an unlined baking sheet, toss the mushrooms with the bacon fat; season with salt and pepper. 3. Spread the mushrooms in an even layer on the baking sheet and then transfer to the oven. Roast until the mushrooms are tender and beginning to brown around the edges, 25 to 35 minutes. 4. WHILE THE MUSHROOMS COOK, MAKE THE POLENTA: In the same saucepan that you cooked the bacon, bring the broth, milk and shallot to a simmer. Gradually whisk in the polenta, then reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring frequently, until the polenta is thick and tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir in the butter and Parmesan, then season to taste with salt and pepper. 5. To serve, spoon the polenta into shallow bowls and top with the roasted mushrooms and bacon. Garnish with thyme, rosemary and chives.","completion":"1. 2 cups (460g) chicken broth 2. 2 cups (460g) whole milk 3. 1¼ cups (265g) polenta 4. ⅓ cup (35g) finely grated Parmesan cheese"},{"prompt":"Write a 100-word description to explain what a dog is to someone who has never seen one or heard of one before.","completion":"The creature is covered in fur from head to toe.

When he connected wires to his battery and a piece of carbon, the carbon glowed, producing light. His invention was known as the Electric Arc lamp. And while it produced light, it didn’t produce it for long and was much too bright for practical use. Over the next seven decades, other inventors also created “light bulbs” but no designs emerged for commerical application. More notably, in 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue enclosed a coiled platinum filament in a vacuum tube and passed an electric current through it. The design was based on the concept that the high melting point of platinum would allow it to operate at high temperatures and that the evacuated chamber would contain fewer gas molecules to react with the platinum, improving its longevity. Although an efficient design, the cost of the platinum made it impractical for commercial production. In 1850 an English physicist named Joseph Wilson Swan created a “light bulb” by enclosing carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. And by 1860 he had a working prototype, but the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a bulb whose lifetime was much too short to be considered an effective prodcer of light. However, in the 1870’s better vacuum pumps became available and Swan continued experiments on light bulbs. In 1878, Swan developed a longer lasting light bulb using a treated cotton thread that also removed the problem of early bulb blackening. On July 24, 1874 a Canadian patent was filed by a Toronto medical electrician named Henry Woodward and a colleague Mathew Evans. They built their lamps with different sizes and shapes of carbon rods held between electrodes in glass cylinders filled with nitrogen. Woodward and Evans attempted to commercialize their lamp, but were unsuccessful. They eventually sold their patent to Edison in 1879. Extract dates and their relevance to development of the light bulb.","completion":"1802: Humphry Davy invented the first electric light known as the Electric Arc lamp, but it was too bright and didn't last long enough for practical use. 1840: Warren de la Rue creates a platinum filament light bulb.

Since I am a college student, I don't have much time or money. Still, I want to learn to be a better cook. What are four easy, cheap, and quick ways I can improve my cooking?","completion":"Here are four ways you can improve your cooking: 1) Experiment. If you don't experiment with different flavors and dishes, you won't improve. Don't cook the same thing over and over again, otherwise, you won't see any progress. 2) Try different seasonings. Seasoning gives the food a rich flavor. You should try new seasonings and spices to broaden the flavors you like. Buying small samples of spices can be an affordable way to try new things. 3) Cook for others. Cooking for others is the fastest way to get feedback on your skills. Cook for others whenever you can, and never back down from the challenge. Try cooking for friends so you're cooking in a comfortable environment. 4) Add more to simple dishes. If you like simple dishes, like ramen, try adding a few things to them. For example, try adding an egg to the top of your ramen, or parmesan cheese. Add new ingredients to strengthen your understanding of how ingredients blend. Along with that, you can use your new knowledge and apply that to different dishes. Find another dish you like that's similar to ramen, then try adding the same ingredients."},{"prompt":"Turn this product description into an obituary.

The story should be three paragraphs and keep it between 350 and 400 words.","completion":"Iago lived in a small town tucked away on the outskirts of New Mexico. with his owner Derrick, who fed Iago every day. Derrick would also go shopping for new toys, try different parrot calls, read him the daily newspaper, and give massages. One particular morning, as Derrick was reading the morning newspaper articles for Iago, an article describing recent odd bird migration to Northern states was written on the front page. Iago only knew of warmth given that he lived in New Mexico for as long as he could remember. Iago never imagined life anywhere outside of this, nor life without Derrick. For as far as Iago was concerned, the love and life with Derrick were more than enough. However, Iago felt peculiar and strange when hearing about birds that were migrating North for mysterious reasons. Iago, for the first time in his life, was feeling instinctively adventurous. Derrick and Iago could never directly talk with each other given the gap in species between the two, but they always had an indescribable way of somehow knowing what the other was feeling. When Iago was feeling adventurous for the first time, Derrick sensed it and dreaded the meaning of the impulse. For the next couple of days that followed, Derrick stopped giving Iago massages, bought no new parrot toys, and most importantly, stopped reading the daily newspaper to him. Iago felt betrayed and heartbroken. Something about their relationship had changed, and it didn't seem to be for the better. One day, Derrick came home with a few bags of goods from an arts and crafts store. Iago, as curious as ever hopped into one of the bags and looked around. There were bags of thread everywhere and of multiple types: thread made of nylon, thick threads, skinny threads, and even multi-colored threads. Derrick then plopped down in their favorite chair and began knitting a small hat and scarf set for Iago. With tears in his eyes, Derrick put the recently-knitted hat and scarf on Iago and kissed him on the cheek. Iago, feeling overwhelmed with love, embraced Derrick and took off to head North."},{"prompt":"I want to write a scene where a character is trying to invite a friend to hang out.

I had liked her for awhile and decided I couldn't continue lying to myself or her. I confessed my feelings, and she told me to wait for her answer.

Last year, I was miserable! What are four ways I can beat the heat this summer and cool off when it gets too hot? No air conditioning suggestions!","completion":"The climate in North Carolina is considered one of the most temperate in the United States, but that doesn’t mean that it’s exempt from heat waves. While the average temperature hovers around 90 degrees Fahrenheit through most of the summer, the rising humidity can make it feel well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Plus, humidity adds a sticky quality to the air, which increases how much you sweat and how much your body temperature rises in response to the heat outside. While many North Carolinians opt to stay inside in air-conditioned homes for most of the summer, those that love being outdoors, or have to be outdoors for work, need ways to beat the heat. Below you’ll find four ways to cool down and stave off rising temperatures in NC this summer. • Sip ice water throughout the day. Being properly hydrated will replenish your body’s water supply, encouraging stabilization of body temperature. You could also suck on ice chips to get the same effect. Side Tip: At the height of heat waves, steer clear of sugary drinks, like sweet teas, lemonades, and sodas. Sugar increases thirst and raises body temperature, which can lead to heatstroke and dehydration. • Limit outdoor activities to early mornings or as the sun is going down. These are the coolest times of the day because outdoor temperatures will drop with the setting of sunshine. • Use cold water to spritz your face, wash your hands up to the wrists, and dip your feet up to the ankles. You could also drape a cold rag around your neck for up to 10 minutes at a time. Do this several times a day when you feel the hottest and most bothered. The quick splashes of cold water on these major pulse points will slightly lower your body temperature. • Eat cold fruits and vegetables that are dense in nutrients with high water content. Watermelons, mangoes, cucumbers, and grapes are delicious, nutritious, and perfect for helping your body's core temperature cool down by a couple of degrees with beneficial hydration."},{"prompt":"Who wrote the Star Spangled Banner, and when was it written?","completion":"\\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" the national anthem of the United States of America, was written by British composer John Stafford Smith.

You never eat your meals when I bring them - every time I make you a meal, you end up leaving it to get cold while investigating some new villain in Gotham, or you've gone to a soiree to eat caviar and crackers instead; 2. You constantly leave the Batcave doors open, which allows water from the waterfall into the cave, making the floor wet and difficult to mop up; 3. Ms. Rachel Dawes keeps leaving her clothing and \\"unmentionables\\" strewn about the mansion - I'm only paid to be picking up after one person, not two; 4.

Please create a numbered list style post that gives tips and best practices.","completion":"Tips to Get Luscious Locks and Grow Your Hair Stronger and Faster Yes! Getting luscious locks and strong hair is possible for anyone. You just have to try the right things. Here’s how: 1. Avoid Heat: Avoid using hot tools excessively as the heat can damage and weaken your hair. Try cooler settings when styling and rinse your hair with cold water to seal in moisture and prevent breakage. 2. Keep it Nice and Trimmed: Contrary to popular belief, regular trims encourage hair growth as they remove split ends and prevent breakage from traveling up the hair shaft. Aim for a trim every 6-8 weeks to maintain healthy and strong hair. 3. On Any Condition: Proper conditioning is crucial for promoting hair growth as it nourishes and strengthens your strands from the inside out. Look for conditioners containing keratin, biotin, and/or other hair-boosting ingredients to maximize growth potential. 4. Tender Caring: Be gentle when brushing or combing to avoid damaging your hair. Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle and minimize pulling, and avoid tight hairstyles (like tight ponytails or braids) that can put additional stress on your locks. 5. Don’t Dry it: Wet hair is more prone to damage and breakage, so avoid brushing or styling until it's dry. Instead, use a microfiber towel to gently pat your hair dry and then let it air dry, which is the healthiest method for your tresses. 6. Meddling Meds: Some medications may cause hair loss, while others may help promote growth. Talk to your doctor to find out if your medication regimen is affecting your hair health. 7. De-Stress Tress: Stress can take a toll on your hair. Incorporate relaxation techniques into your daily routine, like yoga or meditation, to reduce stress and promote healthy hair growth. 8. Coloring Conundrum: Frequent hair coloring can damage hair and inhibit growth. Choose natural dyes or give your locks a break from coloring for a while. 9. Braids to Breaks: Wearing tight hairstyles or extensions for extended periods can cause damage to your hair follicles. Give your hair a break and switch up your hairstyle frequently to prevent breakage. You can try these yourself and watch the results. You won’t have to do anything else. As a bonus tip, eat healthy and grow stronger from the inside out."},{"prompt":"Write a video script for a commercial ad for an internet provider called “Avalon.” Make the script for this video about 30-45 seconds long.

You’ve heard of the hoverboard, a highly maneuverable electric scooter. Put the two together, and you get...the HoverDrone! The HoverDrone combines two technologically advanced products into one amazing, new, patented invention! Here’s how it works: A foot platform like a hoverboard is attached to powerful propellers slightly below the level of the platform. The operator of the HoverDrone can then use similar movements to a hoverboard to shift their weight from front to back and side to side to determine their direction of flight! What happened to the remote control that drones use, you ask? The remote control operates as an override for parents. If your child won’t park their HoverDrone and come inside for supper, Mom and Dad can use the remote control feature to bring them back home, quickly and safely! For daredevils who’d like to take the HoverDrone concept one step further, we also offer the HoverDrone Deluxe! The HoverDrone Deluxe has boots built into the platform, firmly securing the rider and making it possible to do mid-air flips! Are you a snowboarder or skateboarder with experience performing flips and other tricks? This model is for you!

He was 764 years old and had seen it all: the Hundred Years War, the Black Death, the discovery of America, World War II, and 9/11. He had survived multiple attempts on his life by mortals who feared their misunderstood lifestyle. Despite all of his hardships, he soldiered on, all while carrying the oppressive weight of a secret so controversial, being discovered would certainly lead to his exile – or even worse. The secret? While his fellow vampires reveled in the crimson elixir that sustained them, Mordecai found himself repulsed by it. The mere sight of blood made his stomach churn and his skin crawl. At every feast, he struggled to hide his disgust and after seven centuries, he had grown weary of pretending. While others roamed the countryside every night in search of their next victim, Mordecai preferred to spend his nights alone, immersing himself in his sanctuary filled with a collection of books spanning hundreds of years. While he missed the camaraderie and sense of accomplishment he felt during a successful hunt, he could no longer continue the charade. So, rather than risk having his secret revealed by refusing to partake in every bloody, post-hunt feast, he accepted that solitude would be his mistress forever, and retreated to his library of peace and solitude."},{"prompt":"Extract from this text the percentages and their respective statistics in the format, [percentage-statistic].

But indoor air pollution, caused by emissions from building materials or even air fresheners, can be just as harmful. Yet, there are no widely-accepted methods to detect the toxins. But researchers at the University of Turku in Finland hope to change that with the help of tiny glowing worms. For their study, the scientists used two types of nematodes, also known as roundworms. The millimeter-long transparent worms had been genetically modified. They produced green fluorescent protein (GFP) when placed close to biological or chemical toxins. In tests done in the laboratory, Päivi Koskinen and his team found that the worms turned a fluorescent green when exposed to household toxins. This included black mold collected from moisture-damaged structures. The worms could even detect the presence of harsh chemicals in cleaning products. The intensity of the color depended on the amount of toxin present. 'The nematodes cannot tell us what kind of toxic compounds there are in the air, but they can provide an unbiased opinion on health risks associated with indoor air and on the need for more thorough technical investigations,' explains Koskinen. The worms have previously been used to monitor the harmful effects of things like heavy metals on the environment.

Something extreme happens because of this. • A pride of lions stumbles through a portal into another dimension in which their kind is able to communicate with humans and lions no longer live a free, wild, lifestyle. 1. Jacob was sensitive about his scar; so much so that he refused to take off his shirt in front of anyone. He made sure he was never on the “skins” side of a casual game, and he never even looked at the jagged, ugly thing himself. It made him remember too much. 2. Bark tossed Mila a cluster of berries as they ambled through the vines. She caught them deftly and popped some into her mouth, before stopping suddenly and pointing in horror at the ground. A human lay very still at her feet. 3. “Hey, Jen, I got the cutest new pets,” called Ronda. A terrified gasp made her whirl around and her eyes widened.

They convert nutrients into large quantities of chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. Mitochondria function using two processes known as the Krebs cycle (or tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle) and the electron transport chain (ETC), to generate ATP. The energy currency, ATP, can be used in many ways, including fuel for muscle movement and brain function. The genetic material in mitochondria, called mitochondrial DNA, is inherited maternally.

They may be narrower or a little steeper than the beginner trails but will not contain drop-offs or cliffs. Most of these are probably groomed and may feature some paths through wooded areas. -Black Diamond Trails marked with a black diamond are considered to be for expert-level skiers. There may be trees, narrow trails, steep drops, cliffs, jumps, rocks, or moguls. These may not be as groomed as the green or blue trails and could have icy patches and areas with deeper snow. Some resorts may have double or triple black diamond symbols on their maps, indicating that there is even more difficulty than a typical expert-level trail.

What elements are central to the plot of the story? Give examples of two separate games in the series.","completion":"Final Fantasy is a long-running series of video games in the RPG (role-playing game) genre. It spawned an entire generation of games that were inspired by it, and there is an entire sub-genre of RPG that was directly influenced by Final Fantasy. This sub-genre is called Japanese role-playing games, shortened to JRPG. The first Final Fantasy came out in 1987 in Japan on the Famicom, short for family computer. It had a 1990 release in North America, on the Nintendo Entertainment System, also known as NES. Although simplistic by today's standards, it was very innovative in its time and known for its cleverly laid-out dungeons, creative monster designs, and fun gameplay. The story revolves around four Warriors of Light, who find themselves banding together to save the world. They each carry an elemental crystal from their worlds, which were darkened by the four Elemental Fiends. They realize they must restore light to the crystals by defeating the fiends, while also growing stronger in the process. At the end of the game, the warriors travel through a portal to fight the final boss, Chao. Once he's defeated, they can restore peace to the world. Final Fantasy IV is another entry in the series, that came out for the Super Famicom in Japan and Super Nintendo in North America (in the US the title was Final Fantasy II), both in the year 1991. The Four Fiends make their return but the graphics and story have been greatly improved. The story revolves around the dark knight Cecil Harvey who is the captain of the Red Wings and takes orders from the King of Baron. He realizes in the story that he is taking orders from an evil king and strives to become a better person, transforming from a dark knight into a paladin while coming to terms with his past. The main antagonist throughout most of the story is Golbez, who is after the crystals that the Four Fiends are guarding. After numerous fights Cecil and Golbez realize that they are brothers, and they team up to defeat Zeromus, who lives on the moon and plans to destroy the Earth. Cecil defeats Zeromus with the help of his companions and peace is restored on Earth."},{"prompt":"Hey, can you write an email to my boss whose name is Eric about needing the 14th and 15th of December off due to an upcoming surgery?

He stood a few feet away, a grin lighting up his pale white face, dancing from foot to foot with the anticipation and excitement of what was going to come next. Despite Batman's strength, he was confident. That confidence was misplaced though. Batman knew he would win this. His gloved hands were curled into fists at his side, his head going over what could have happened here if he hadn't saved these people in time. Even through his mask, the anger was obvious, but The Joker only seemed to delight in it. His dancing didn't stop as he took a step closer to see Batman's anger.

I'd like you to give me a list of some things to think of when choosing SEO keywords, including where keywords should be located.","completion":"Got it! Here is a list of tips for choosing SEO keywords. 1. Use keyword research tools - One free and simple keyword research tool is Google Search Console. Google Search Console actually will show you what terms match your content in Google itself. Alternatively, there are several other keyword research tools you can use. 2. Know the types of keywords - There are four main types of keywords, some being simple words, and some being entire phrases. When you know about the different kinds of keywords, you can make them a part of your SEO content strategy. One type of keyword is buyer intent keywords, which are used in the buying process's last stage. There are also short-tail and long-tail keywords. Short-tail keywords are less than three words, and long-tail keywords are longer and have less search volume. There are also question keywords, which are questions. 3. Know search intent - Why are people searching this content? When you know this, you can use the intent of searches to craft content around. You can also use search intent to improve blog titles. Try to find search intent keywords that bring you targeted traffic and use these keywords in your meta description as well as the title. The types of search intent are \\"informational\\", which is when someone looks for information, \\"navigational \\"when someone is looking for a specific site, \\"transactional\\" when a person is looking to purchase something, and \\"commercial\\" when someone is looking for the perfect product for them. 4. Make a keyword list - Lists can help you find focus on your goals and drive your business forward. An optimized list of keywords can help you know what keywords you need to use to garner traffic to your site and create leads. 5. Know where to use keywords - Once you have a list of keywords, you need to know where to use them. You should be using your keywords pretty much everywhere actually. They should be used on the page in the title, headings, subheadings, and written content. They should also be used in the meta description, image names, image file names, image alt text, and URLs."},{"prompt":"I need a quick dialogue for two characters who have just completed a heist and are taking inventory of their ill-gotten goods.

Matchmaker: I doubt so, for I'm the one who gives them birth. You, on the other hand, destroy all my efforts, like a disaster on this earth. Matchbreaker: My schemes serve a greater aim. From two-faced dames to men with misleading claims, the world is filled with loathsome lovers who are just in it for the game. I identify these nefarious names and free their mates from their shallow endgames Matchmaker: By doing so, you break everyone's heart. Everyone blurts something that hurts. I bring the loners closer to bliss, so the loveness they miss is soon replaced by a kiss. I mend their hearts and invigorate their souls while you break them down, leaving much to console. Matchbreaker: Say what you may, Matchmaker, but it cannot be denied that your perception of love is oversimplified. Under the wrong influence, the innocent are left mortified. Not everyone can fix their broken happiness with a lullaby, so I sever their misused feeling from the evil eye before I see their precious hearts die Matchmaker: Are all your services in favor of the misguided victims?

Put in one paragraph of five complete sentences, written in first person as the original is. Thanks! The Season I'm In Giving myself permission to accept the good. ALEX ELLE I'm trying to make more space to reflect on how far I've come in my healing. Over the past eleven years, I have done my best to change for the better. To allow myself to not only heal but lean into joy and lightness. To be intentional about what is allowed in my space and what needs to be kept at bay. Healing can feel like such a heavy lift, but giving myself permission to accept the good, the fun, and the happiness that comes with it has been a game-changer. I no longer want healing to be something I do in survival mode. Instead, I want this journey to be a place of lightness, softness, and ease. That's the season I'm in now. As I continue to embark on this journey, protecting my peace is something I am deeply committed to doing. My healing space no longer feels chaotic. Instead, it feels grounded and easeful. It’s been a long time coming. Choosing to change, and rewrite my narrative, is creating restoration within my lineage. Healing is an act of community care. Breaking generational cycles that were never mine to hold has been challenging but something I've grown to see as sacred. If not me, then who? I've grown to feel proud about being the matriarch of healing for my lineage. My children will know what love, joy, and emotional stability look and feel like. They'll witness their mother moving through life in energetic abundance versus lack and scarcity. There are days when I question if I am truly made for the healing and emotional expansion I'm doing. Some days it can feel like I'm healing in circles, and no real change is happening. Self-doubt can be hard to sort through, but it is also a glorious teacher if we allow it to be. Even in my moments of uncertainty, I choose to lean in and learn. Sometimes, no matter how much healing, growing, and changing we've done, our inner critique can and will rear its head. In these moments, I've learned to remind myself what the truth is. And in the moments that the truth feels hard to recall, I remind myself what I want to be true in my life and legacy. I'd like to invite us all to start taking more inventory of how we're blooming. Really look at how far your journey has taken you. Celebrate how you've changed in big and small ways. Commune with yourself and look at how you've emotionally matured. Don't just glance at your healing and growth in passing. Take a good hard look at the beauty you're creating. Don't just glance at it. If you need more support in seeing yourself positively, call someone that reflects your truth back to you. If there's someone in your life that you love, trust, and can be your mirror, allow them to show up for you and be the reflection you need. As my mom used to say, sometimes people can see us better than we can see ourselves. Having people in our lives who we feel safe with act as a mirror is magnificent.","completion":"I'm realizing how much healing I've done and allowing myself to rest in the joy that comes from that. I'm committed to enjoying a season of lightness and protecting my peace along this journey. I'm grateful my children will know what emotional stability looks like as they witness me living it. I'll set aside self-doubt and learn from the teacher that healing and changing can be. I invite you to do the same; look how far you've come and celebrate it."},{"prompt":"What is the largest desert in the world?","completion":"The largest desert in the world is the Antarctic Desert, covering an expansive area of approximately 5.5 million square miles.

Faust or Faustus is a scholar who sells his soul to the Devil. Although fictional in literature, the legend is based on an astrologer and alchemist who lived in the area of northern Germany in the fifteenth century. Trained in theology, he turns to magic and makes a perilous deal with the Devil in which he commits his soul to eternal damnation in return for power and knowledge in this life. But he is only human, and arrogant and reckless. Can Faust — or anyone — wield the powers of God or resist the temptations of the Devil? The legend has inspired many great writers, musicians, and other artists. The earliest known published sources for the legend are the Wolfenbüttler manuscript dated about 1580-1587, and a printed chapbook (the Spies edition), intended for popular sale dated 1587. Two famous literary works on the Faust theme are Christopher Marlowe’s The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, and Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe’s Faust. While Goethe’s Faust has been called the definitive Faust, there is no one Faust story, instead, there are hundreds or thousands of variations on the theme in theatre, music, film, poetry, art, and literature including classics and favorites: The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, The Picture of Dorian Grey, The Phantom of the Opera/Paradise, The Devil and Daniel Webster, Damn Yankees, The Little Shop of Horrors and many more.","completion":"Hey Bowen! I found some information about the Legend of Faust you might be looking for. Faust, often called Faustus, is a scholar that made a deal with the devil in exchange for his soul. Although the literature is fictional, it's based on a German astrologer and alchemist from the fifteenth century. Turning away from theology, he becomes tempted by magic and makes a deal with the devil. Power and knowledge at the price of eternal damnation of his soul. The question at the core of this is: Is it possible for a human to hold the powers of God, yet resist the temptations of the Devil? The legend has grown large inspiring a range of great writers, musicians, and other artists throughout the years. The earliest known published sources for the legend are the Wolfenbüttler manuscript which was released around 1580-1587.

I will be flying with friends, so you can include them in some of your ideas if necessary. The plane does not have in-flight entertainment. Format your answer as a numbered list of 15 ideas. Title each idea in a few words and then include a small description and/or examples if necessary. Each number on the list should contain 25-65 words total.","completion":"1. Do crafts. Doing an artistic hobby on board your flight is a great way to pass time. Consider bringing tools for drawing, knitting, or crocheting. 2. Write in your journal. Your flight makes a great time to reflect on your past, upcoming events, and your internal thoughts and emotions. If you aren't into keeping diary-style entries, you can also use journals for brainstorming, freewriting, or creative writing such as poetry. You could also write a letter to a friend while you are flying. 3. Organize your trip. While on the plane, make a vague outline of events and attractions that you will visit once you arrive at your new location. 4. Watch a film or a TV show. Even if your plane does not have in-flight entertainment, you can still pass time on your flight by watching a movie or TV series on your smartphone or a tablet if you have one. 5. Listen to music. Listening to music will keep you somewhat occupied and makes a great activity to combine with something else, such as making crafts or journaling. Choosing to listen to new and unfamiliar music can make a great choice for keeping yourself more entertained. 6. Use an app. If you have your phone available, use an app to keep you entertained on the flight. You can play games, scroll social media, manage your finances, or organize your email. Some apps require internet to use, which is not available on all flights. It typically costs money to connect to in-flight wifi. 7. Read a book. Whether you prefer classic print on paper, e-readers, or using the Kindle app on your iPad, reading a book on your flight is a great way to help time pass by more quickly. Bonus points if the book is particularly suspenseful or otherwise works well to hold your attention. 8. Do skincare. Planes have extremely dry air and this can dry out your skin. Your flight makes a great time to use a face mask, apply moisturizers, or do other small and simple skincare treatments. Avoid bringing any products that must be rinsed off. 9. Take pictures out the window of the plane. If you have a window seat, taking pictures of the ground from your bird's-eye viewpoint can allow you to capture some very interesting moments in time. This suggestion is not as good for overnight flights, those not sat in window seats, or those who are flying over mostly water. 10. Get productive. If you can do so, complete some work for your job or potentially for school assignments while on your flight. This will help pass time and has the bonus of giving you a sense of accomplishment once you are done. 11. Chat with your neighbor. Whether it be friends or strangers, your seatmates on a flight can be a great source of entertainment if you are the social type. Talking to others on your flight can pass time and gives you insights into the lives of others, which can help you foster more empathy. 12. Listen to a podcast. Podcasts are a great option for killing time on a flight. The topics of podcasts can be informational, scientific, spiritual, comedic, or pure entertainment. 13. Learn the local language. Using podcasts, apps, or pocket-sized guidebooks, you can attempt to learn the local language of the place you are visiting. Some helpful words include thank you, please, sorry, hello, yes, no, you're welcome, and goodbye. 14. Play a game. If you have friends sitting near you on your flight, one great way to pass time is by playing games. Some examples of games that are great for flights include word games and card games. 15. Move around. If you are comfortable, walk around on your flight a little bit to stretch your legs. This can improve blood flow and will prevent you from feeling as stiff upon landing."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this Reddit post from the perspective of the friend who was rejected. I (27F) attended school in the UK. Towards the end of our final year of school, when we turn 18, our schools organise something called a Formal, which I suppose is a bit like a prom without the romantic aspects as you’re not expected to go with anybody, and the idea of promposals generally isn’t something that’s done here. Nearly 10 years ago, as I was preparing to leave school, I found out that, not only did a boy in my class have a massive crush on me for years, but he was planning one of these massive “promposals” that are often done at proms. He had always been a horrendous bully to me. He would go from calling me hideous and claiming that I would die alone and unloved, to stealing my friend’s phone to get my number, or sneaking up behind me and cutting out strands of my hair that to keep, or going so far as to find my house through my father’s distinctive car. Naturally, when the day for his “promposal” came along, he came out with his sign in front of the entire school, and I bluntly said no and walked away. I don’t like confrontation or arguments, but I had no intention of sparing his feelings after all he had done, and I was honestly just uncomfortable and wanted to leave. He badgered me until the day I left school for turning him down and being heartless. His friends did the same. I didn’t care. I recently met one of his old friends in my old town. I went to the business where one of them was working, and he kept bringing this up, saying that my bully had gotten depressed after we left school and hadn’t dated at all because he was embarrassed from the rejection and was still hung up over me. He kept asking me why I felt it was OK to reject him like that over some nasty words, and if I was really that petty. I got sick of it, so I told him. Turns out that, because all of these creepy things had happened within the classroom, he hadn’t seen them, or even heard of them happening. His friends and my other bullies within the class were covering for him. The friend abruptly left without a word, but apparently, the gossip did the rounds. Now, the friend group is divided in two. Many of those who didn’t know are pissed at him for lying, and pissed that their other friends hid what was happening as they think it went too far. The others are pissed at me for airing his dirty laundry. His parents apparently also know now, and they’re pissed that he had their sympathy through lies, and now know that he practically stalked me, which brings up questions about whether they want him to take over the small farm vs a younger brother. I wonder if I should have just let his friend be mad at me. I’d probably have never seen him again, anyway. I didn’t know that he would tell anyone as he’d never been one for gossip that I knew of, but I also didn’t expect this to potentially ruin the life of someone I haven’t seen for nearly a decade.","completion":"I went to school in the UK where, at the end of our final year, our school organizes a Formal. This is similar to a prom, but with less pressure over bringing a date so promposals are not as common. Nearly 10 years ago, my Formal was coming up and I had a massive crush on this girl. I had liked her for years and sometimes did the things teenage guys do, like negging, to get her attention. Admittedly, I had also done some awkward things like figuring out where she lived by spotting her dad's car, getting her phone number off a mutual friend, and once I took a few strands of her hair. With the the Formal coming up, I decided to be brave and plan a promposal to ask her to go with me. I made a sign asking her to be my date and presented it to her outside of the entire school. To my horror, she quickly said no and walked away. She didn't give any explanation or apologize for her rejection. I couldn't believe it. I tried to ask her multiple times throughout the day and told her it was cruel and mean to reject me the way she had. Some of my friends also tried to get her to at least talk to me about it. She didn't answer any of us. I was really hurt by it. It's been nearly a decade, but I haven't recovered from the brutal rejection. It shattered my self-confidence and made it difficult for me to date at all. Honestly, it was so embarassing. Recently, a friend of mine ran into this girl while she was visiting town. He told her how I had been affected by her rejection and instead of apologizing, she told him about everything I did as a teenager that she found uncomfortable and creepy. I think she exaggerated a bit, but my friend confronted me about it and I tried to explain how it was just emotional teenage stuff. My friend then went around town telling all of our friends about this new drama. Our friends are divided as some of them knew everything at the time and agree it was just teenage stupidity. My parents found out, though, and are now pissed at me for my behaviour and said that they might not let me take over the family farm over this. Thety might give it to my younger brother instead. This would destory everything I've worked for and completely ruin my life. I don't understand why this girl is doing this to me all over again so many years later."},{"prompt":"Hello.

Born with an unusually deep capacity for emotion, Moe often found himself deeply unsatisfied by the life he led as a near-universally hated insect. As he quickly zigzagged through the air, avoiding the clumsy swipes from the sweaty jogger he tried to land on, Moe lamented about how misunderstood he was and the impossibility of trying to convey to the human that he had no intention of sucking his blood. Buzzing quickly away to find refuge in nearby shrubbery, Moe thought to himself that his dreams of making a human friend would likely never come to fruition. Even in his earliest memory, Moe can recall how different he felt from his mosquito siblings, friends, and peers. Everyone seemed obsessed with only one thing -- sucking blood from as many humans as possible. In fact, there was even a leaderboard in his local mosquito community that highlighted the most prolific among them. Ironically, his own brother was at the top of the leaderboard, drawing even greater contrast to himself and the fact that he refused to feed on humans. Out of respect for the humans he idolized so dearly, Moe had made a promise to himself that he would only ever feed on squirrels, rats, and other small rodents. In his younger days, he used to be teased mercilessly about this. Though he'll never admit it, he will always harbor a small bit of resentment towards his siblings and peers for making him feel like he was less than them simply because of his dietary beliefs. All his mosquito friends seemed shallow and superficial, and Moe often felt like they couldn't understand him. Humans, however, exhibited the widest spectrum of emotions. He's seen it all -- buzzing above the bowed heads of mourners at a funeral, flying between the swinging arms of the dancers at a wedding, clinging quietly to the wall above the crib as a young mother sang soft lullabies to her firstborn, and hovering discreetly in the corner while an old couple fought in the kitchen for the hundredth time over dishwashing responsibilities. Love, anger, fear, loss, and devastation—it was intoxicating to witness, and Moe wanted so badly to be a part of it, despite the impossibility of it all. A lonely mosquito, bearing witness to a kaleidoscope of human feeling, but always only on the outside looking in."},{"prompt":"Come up with a conversation between two friends who are trying to understand how an electric water dispenser works.","completion":"1: Okay, so I just got this new water dispenser for the office.

Remove any bracketed numbers. The 2003 discovery of an early fossil bat from the 52-million-year-old Green River Formation, Onychonycteris finneyi, indicates that flight evolved before echolocative abilities.[20][21] Onychonycteris had claws on all five of its fingers, whereas modern bats have at most two claws on two digits of each hand. It also had longer hind legs and shorter forearms, similar to climbing mammals that hang under branches, such as sloths and gibbons. This palm-sized bat had short, broad wings, suggesting that it could not fly as fast or as far as later bat species. Instead of flapping its wings continuously while flying, Onychonycteris probably alternated between flaps and glides in the air.[7] This suggests that this bat did not fly as much as modern bats, but flew from tree to tree and spent most of its time climbing or hanging on branches.[22] The distinctive features of the Onychonycteris fossil also support the hypothesis that mammalian flight most likely evolved in arboreal locomotors, rather than terrestrial runners. This model of flight development, commonly known as the \\"trees-down\\" theory, holds that bats first flew by taking advantage of height and gravity to drop down on to prey, rather than running fast enough for a ground-level take off.[23][24]","completion":"- The 2003 discovery of an early fossil bat from the 52-million-year-old Green River Formation, Onychonycteris finneyi, indicates that flight evolved before echolocative abilities. - Onychonycteris had claws on all five of its fingers, whereas modern bats have at most two claws on two digits of each hand. - This palm-sized bat had short, broad wings, suggesting that it could not fly as fast or as far as later bat species. - This suggests that this bat did not fly as much as modern bats, but flew from tree to tree and spent most of its time climbing or hanging on branches. - This model of flight development, commonly known as the \\"trees-down\\" theory, holds that bats first flew by taking advantage of height and gravity to drop down on to prey, rather than running fast enough for a ground-level take off."},{"prompt":"Which bone is broken most often in the human body?","completion":"The most commonly broken bone is the collarbone, or the clavicle.

No! No!

After a few seconds, I hear a rustle from within the house. Soon, the side door bursts open and the farmer runs out and points a rifle at me. I drop to my knees and plead with the farmer, \\"No! I like farmers. Don't shoot!\\" He readies his rifle and shouts, \\"Are you that salesman who has been running around here?\\" I hurriedly reply: \\"No, no, I'm a doctor! I'm clean-cut! Just graduated college!\\" Just then a gorgeous young lady steps from behind him. She says, \\"Hey there, I'm Rita.\\" From the looks of it, she's his daughter.

Keep the story between 350 and 400 words while maintaining a heavy and somber tone.","completion":"\\"My heart hurts\\", I explain to the specialist. \\"Hm, I am not seeing anything, perhaps it'll go away on its own\\", the specialist said. I have been living with this pain. It comes and goes. Some days it's hardly noticeable, and other days it's unbearable. This heavy feeling, like I'm being suffocated, is torturous. I feel this parasite moving inside my body. Some say it's even in my head. I feel invisible and yet entirely exposed. I was aspirational and had dreams. I wanted to achieve things. But this hurt is immensely unwavering. This constriction and heaviness make it more than impossible for me to seriously commit. Honestly, it's not just a chest parasite. It's an organism growing within, and controlling me. Sometimes, it makes bad decisions for me. It feels like people somehow know and it is something they find upsetting, so I no longer try to socialize. It is indeed internal and eating my insides. At any given time, I think it can explode out of my body. It squeezes my heart, making it beat irregularly and causing phantom heart attacks. These days, I seldom sleep and instead stare blankly. The parasite continues to grow with each passing day. One day I find myself sitting on my balcony. The cool air and warm sun are too painful to bear. The parasite's grip has gotten stronger and I started crying. I can only think of one way to end this emptiness and pain. Oddly, the parasite seems delighted as well, as if this is what it wanted the entire time. I have gone largely unnoticed my entire life, with no one noticing the parasite, or sympathizing with me during the rare times I disclose the struggle. It is as if not a single person thought that the reason most find me unbearable is not because of them but rather the debilitating pain caused by this parasite. Perhaps this parasite is just a figment of my imagination. In any event, the feelings are real for me even though some said I was losing my mind.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 review – funny sequel suffers from pinballing pointlessness The Marvel superhero gang are back together – including Vin Diesel’s Baby Groot alongside Chris Pratt’s Quill – and while there’s plenty of comedy, it doesn’t really go anywhere Peter Bradshaw Mon 24 Apr 2017 Marvel’s likeable superhero comedy Guardians of the Galaxy is back for amiable and goofy volume number two, and its beefy-yet-quirky space hero and team leader Peter Quill, played by Chris Pratt, duly has a second volume of that Awesome Mixtape on the Sony Walkman he has on him at all times. It’s the same combination of cartoony action and intergalactic screwball with some ambient production design recalling the photorealist sci-fi imagery of Roger Dean or Chris Foss in a bygone age, creating a visual sense of earnestness to offset the archly retro pop culture gags. Again, it has its own supercharged Heart FM playlist of 70s and 80s music. The early 70s track Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl) by Looking Glass is laid on the soundtrack almost ecstatically in the opening sequence, and some tongue-in-cheek dialogue later invokes it as the greatest piece of music ever to have emerged from Planet Earth. This film rattles along and there’s a lot to enjoy, but there’s a weird air of pointlessness, almost plotlessness to this sequel. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 trailer starring Baby Groot Guardian The old gang are still together: as well as Quill, there is the green-faced Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, and the mighty, slab-like Drax, played by Dave Bautista. Vin Diesel provides the voice of Baby Groot, and Bradley Cooper voices the foxy, weaselly figure of Rocket; he is the louche and disreputable character whose job is to get the group into trouble. The Guardians get into some serious trouble pinching some energy sources from a certain golden empress named Ayesha, very amusingly played by Elizabeth Debicki. She has a haughty, queenly manner and an air of frozen displeasure whenever one of her many courtiers make a mess of things: Debicki’s Ayesha would be a great returning character, and on the strength of this Debicki would be strong casting in any new film about Elizabeth I, stealing Cate Blanchett’s crown. The ensuing cosmic affray brings Quill and the Guardians back into contact with Yondu (Michael Rooker), the hated freebooter who kidnapped Quill from Planet Earth when he was a child, and with Gamora’s fanatically driven and malevolent sister, Nebula, played by Karen Gillan. But most pointedly of all, there is a new character, worryingly named Ego, played by Kurt Russell, whose “prequel” relationship with Quill is signalled pretty clearly in the opening scene. There is something unsettling in his buttery tan and bouffant splendour as a digitised young man and in the gravitas of his facial hair in the present day: he is a character with no small opinion of himself. There are, once again, some funny lines, very often given to Drax, who has a way of oversharing. Pom Clementieff is very entertaining in the role of Mantis, a helpmeet of Ego; she has the gift of being an empath, someone who can intuit how someone else is feeling by laying hands on them, but is in every other fantastically naive and un-insightful about the way human beings behave. Ego himself introduces some apparently huge Freudian issues to the film, which on paper would seem to take the film’s emotional impact up a notch or two. But they are dealt with insouciantly, even flippantly – far more so than in something like Star Wars or Superman. That’s in keeping of course, with the distinctive comic flavour of this franchise, but the revelations about Quill’s background just zing and ping around with the same pinball-velocity as everything else in the film. It’s fun, though GOTG2 doesn’t have the same sense of weird urgency and point that the first film had. They’re still guarding, although the galaxy never seems in much danger.","completion":"Peter Bradshaw's 2017 review of \\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2\\" is a mixed review between positives and negatives. Although he writes positively of several things including: the soundtrack, the movie's sense of humor and its overall \\"quirky\\"-ness; he fails to find a deeper meaning in the story as a whole calling it \\"pinballing pointlessness\\". While Bradshaw specifically calls out certain artists for their humorous (as in the case of Dave Bautista as Drax) or \\"amusingly\\" haughty (Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha) roles he is not a fan of Kurt Russell's character Ego who he calls \\"unsettling\\". Ultimately, although Bradshaw seems to enjoy many parts of the story and references specific music from the movie (\\"Brandy\\" by Looking Glass) and amusing scenarios between characters, he ultimately does not like the \\"pinball\\" back and forth of the background story of the main character Quill, and did not feel like the movie, although an action movie, showed that the galaxy the Guardians were supposed to be \\"guarding\\" seemed to be in much \\"danger\\"."},{"prompt":"Help me write up an email to my coworker, Sheryl, informing them that I'd love their help planning a surprise birthday party for our boss, Mr. Jonathan.

Begin with a healthy head of romaine lettuce. You will need to harvest carefully following the steps below: 1. Leaving about 2-3 inches from the bottom of the heart, cut off the lettuce that you will use for your salad. 2. Place the freshly cut stem in a bowl with about 3 inches of water. 3. Find a bright, sunny spot to keep your lettuce project. 4. Change the water in the bowl at least every other day. 5. Watch for new roots! It could take several weeks to see these. 6. Monitor your new roots. Once you have roots that are 2 inches long, it's time to plant your lettuce in the soil! 7. You have your choice of planting options; either a raised bed or a pot. 8. Plant your lettuce in your preferred location, ensuring that the roots are completely covered. 9. Water regularly (several times per week), and watch your FREE lettuce grow! Once your lettuce is ready for harvest, you can take only the outermost leaves and allow the center to continue to grow. Or, you can cut the head off just above the stem, leaving the root system intact. Free lettuce over and over again!"},{"prompt":"Write an email to my friend telling her there is a concert in Baltimore, MD that I want to bring her to.

The code above that you provided is about a method called \\"smallerNumbersThanCurrent\\" Here's how the Java function works from beginning to end. 1. Starting with the first line, the code first creates an integer array named 'a' that is instantiated to the size of the input array 'nums'. Basically, it is creating a new array that will be the same size as the array that gets passed in as a parameter 'nums'. 2. The function then goes into a for loop that iterates through each entry in the input array, starting with the entry at position 0. 3. A count variable is then instantiated with the data type of integer, this variable ends up being used to count how many numbers are less than the current number that the variable 'i' is at in the loop. 4. A nested loop is created that compares which value is greater at various positions. For example, if nums[i] is greater than nums[j] then it would increment the count and add the current value of the count to the newly created array 'a' at position 'i' after the counter 'j' has reached the end of the array. 5. Finally, after iterating through all potential combinations and comparisons, the function returns an integer array 'a'.

Refine marketing strategy. First, you must set clear goals and expectations, define your target audience, research the competition, and focus on what makes you stand out. By doing this, you give yourself clear metrics to be measured by. A goal allows you to track progress and identify when more work may be needed. Knowing your target audience makes it easier to produce content. Researching your competition can both inspire you and better you. Focusing on what stands out from the crowd will enable you to create engaging content. 2. Create valuable content. If your content doesn't give your readers any value, the likelihood of them engaging with you or continuing to follow you is slim. Your audience sees a whole load of content daily that is useless for them or simply too like other content. Create valuable content to stand out and grow a following that knows you constantly have them in mind. This will help to solidify your audience. 3. Engage with your followers. Tweets providing value are great, but the one thing we value most is human connection. Engage and connect with followers through DM or in replies. This will help foster a genuine connection with your audience and show them that you care and are responsive to them. This is extremely important, considering how many people are online. If you create that bond with people, they can be more forgiving when you make mistakes and more supportive when needed. 4. Use trending hashtags. Hashtags are an incredible way to grow the visibility of your tweets. Try to see what is currently trending and produce content that hops on that bandwagon. The more people that see your tweets, the better, and using a trending hashtag vastly improves the chances prospective new followers will see your tweets. Be careful not to use too many hashtags, as this can be seen as spam. 5. Reuse and Repurpose. Coming up with new content all the time can be pretty tough. There is no harm in reusing or repurposing old content. In many cases, the point will remain valuable if it's valuable content. Simply saying the same thing differently or highlighting a new use case for information is an excellent way to churn out lots of content over time. Obviously, it's not good to copy and paste your old tweets. Try improving them with better wording so your content constantly improves."},{"prompt":"I've seen Java constructors written in two different ways. For example: public Car(String name) { this.name = name; } and public Car(String newName) { name = newName; } The first way uses \\"this.\\" and the second does not. What is the difference between them and which one is better?","completion":"Both ways of writing a constructor accomplish the same task. The difference is the first constructor allows you to use an argument with the same name as the variable. The \\"this.\\" modifier allows you to reference the variable in the current object. Without this modifier, Java will not understand which variable you are referring to if they have the same name. Thus, you would have to change the argument name, which you can observe in the second constructor you listed. Regarding whether one approach is best practice, this is a matter of preference and coding conventions for a project or team. The use of the \\"this\\" keyword can help increase the readability of code, especially if there are multiple variables with similar names, to help distinguish between local variables, instance variables, and static variables. However, the unnecessary use of the keyword can make code unnecessarily verbose and can encourage the creation of large classes that can be difficult to interpret.

People were scared and came running to help. Again on the next day, Peter yelled, \\"We're being robbed!\\". All the people in the museum came running to help, but they were disappointed to find that they had been tricked once again. One day, there was a real intruder at the museum. Peter saw the thief, and he yelled for help at the top of his lungs. But by this time, everyone thought it was just another false alarm. Peter was too afraid to confront the thief alone so he hid in the broom closet. As a result, the thief was able to steal valuable paintings and artifacts.

In the late 17th century's embrace, Armed freebooters, a fearsome chase, They raided European and Asian ships, With Madagascar's haven upon their lips. Legends spoke of Libertalia's grand design, A utopian colony, tales intertwined, Democracy's echoes and native embrace, A pirate's dream, a fabled place. Yet, the truth remains shrouded, veiled in haze, While Libertalia's myth continues to blaze, St. Mary's Island, where reality stands, A pirate stronghold on distant lands. Around 1,500 souls called it home, A bustling haven where pirates would roam, Captain Kidd, Thomas Tew, and Every as well, Found refuge in St. Mary's tales to tell. With an underground network of trade, Exotic goods plundered, a pirate's raid, Ships laden with treasures from India's shore, Targets for buccaneers seeking more. The booty acquired, a valuable prize, Sold by locals with cunning and guise, To merchants corrupt in New York's streets, Or Boston's alleys, where deceit meets. In 1695, a daring feat was done, Henry Every's fleet, a treasure ship won, From the Great Mogul's Indian wealth, A fortune amassed, tales of immense stealth. A fight ensued, bloodshed on the sea, As Every triumphed, his victory decree, The spoils he claimed, a staggering hoard, Worth millions in gold, a pirate's reward.

One night, the couple sat on the mountaintop and watched the stars twinkling and glowing in the sky. As they did so, they caught a glimpse of a shooting star coming from their left and streaking right in a parabolic arc across the night sky. As the star completed its course, the man and woman looked at each other and said the same thing: \\"Did you make a wish?\\" When they both said this to each other, they smiled and laughed in a seemingly knowing way. They did make a wish, one that they had hoped would come true since they first began their nighttime tradition. They decided to leave the mountain to prepare more thoroughly for tomorrow night's event. The next night, the couple went up to the mountaintop, but this time they brought backpacks with them. In the backpacks were necessities like a change of clothing, toiletries, and some snacks and water. They took their seat on the mountaintop and began watching the stars. They watched intently for several hours as they appeared to be waiting for something. And then, just before midnight, they saw what they were looking for: a shooting star coming from their left and streaking right in a parabolic arc across the night sky. The couple decided it was time, so they lay on the ground, holding hands, and closed their eyes. In a great big flash of light, the couple disappeared, their bodies vaporized by the ethereal light that shone from the shooting star.

The audience for this article is beginner-level skiers.","completion":"Learning how to ski can be challenging as many of the motions can feel unnatural for those who haven't done it before. Although it's tempting to try and rip down the slopes at high speeds right away, it is not a smart or safe idea. Going fast is not the hard part of skiing. The hard part is controlling your speed and being able to stop. Even in the case of experienced skiers, rarely will you see someone ski straight down the mountain at high speed. Instead, good skiers focus on using their edges to make turns and control their speed. As such, first-time skiers should also aim to first build skills for using their edges, making both wide and short turns, and stopping. The first things that new skiers should practice are controlling their speed and learning to stop completely. While watching experienced skiers can be helpful in giving you an idea of where you want to eventually progress, it is important that you don't try to copy what they do. Instead, you should focus on first practicing the pizza stop. In order to generate speed, you want to keep your skis parallel to one another in a straight line. In order to stop, you want to point the front tips of your skis in towards one another, making your skis resemble a slice of pizza. This allows the edges of your skis to dig in, create friction, and slow you down."},{"prompt":"Help me write the copy for a poster advertising the sequel to a horror movie marketed to chickens.

Mars was an enigma to ancient astronomers, who were bewildered by its apparently capricious motion across the sky—sometimes in the same direction as the Sun and other celestial objects (direct, or prograde, motion), sometimes in the opposite direction (retrograde motion). In 1609 the German astronomer Johannes Kepler used the superior naked-eye observations of the planet by his Danish colleague Tycho Brahe to empirically deduce its laws of motion and so pave the way for the modern gravitational theory of the solar system. Kepler found that the orbit of Mars was an ellipse along which the planet moved with nonuniform but predictable motion.

Embroidery: Embroidery is a method of precision sewing to apply decorative pictures or patterns to an item using needle and thread.

Diamond painting: Diamond painting kits are similar in concept to paint-by-numbers, but instead of paint, the user attaches colored plastic gems to the canvas in order to complete the picture. Each color of diamond corresponds to a number on the canvas. 5. Quilling: Quilling involves shaping strips of paper to form patterns or pictures. The strips are rolled, curved, or bent and then attached to a flat surface to form the lines of a two-dimensional image. Different colors of paper and an endless variety of possible patterns can be used to create these works of art. 6.

For example, if you are at an event or conference, you want to make eye contact and smile at any strangers that look in your direction. If you get the feeling that you are staring when making eye contact, you can blink occasionally or simply focus on the area in between the person's eyes. 3. Angle towards people - it's good practice when talking to someone to angle your body towards them to show that you are interested in the conversation. You want to focus on turning your feet and legs towards that person and allow your body to follow. This is good to do either sitting or standing. However, if you are sitting, you might also want to lean in slightly as it will show that you are listening and engaged in the conversation. 4. Look up - it's good to keep your head and eyes up when you're walking around the office or at events. This is because when you are looking up and ahead it is easier to make eye contact with others and greet them. It's important to note that people read your face to determine your approachability. Staring at the floor or your feet will cause the person to not be able to assess your interest. 5. Avoid fidgeting - having nervous habits can give the impression that you are anxious. You want to avoid fidgeting with things like your keys, pen, or hair or simply doing something you might not be aware of, such as cracking your knuckles or touching your face. You'll want to focus on keeping your hands at your sides or in your lap or just using them to gesture rather than fidgeting during conversations."},{"prompt":"Create a comma list of each line's last word.

Around the castle was a moat, and the walls and wooden door were covered by a purple glow from an unknown enchantment. No one had ever seen anyone enter or leave the castle. There were rumors of a powerful warlock who had shut himself in to protect his hordes of gems from the king, other rumors told of a wizard so powerful that multiple nations united to eliminate him hidden inside away from a hostile world, others told of a sort of enchantment that had the entire interior be thousands and thousands of miles, an entire kingdom set inside the enchanted stone walls of the castle.

When Elizabeth Alexandra Mary, the elder daughter of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, was born on April 21, 1926, she apparently had little chance of assuming the throne, as her father was a younger son of King George V. But in late 1936, her uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated to marry an American divorcée, Wallis Simpson. As a result, her father became King George VI, and 10-year-old “Lilibet” (as she was known within the family) became the heir presumptive to the throne. Though she spent much of her childhood with nannies, Princess Elizabeth was influenced greatly by her mother, who instilled in her a devout Christian faith as well as a keen understanding of the demands of royal life. Her grandmother, Queen Mary, consort of King George V, also instructed Elizabeth and her younger sister Margaret in the finer points of royal etiquette. Educated by private tutors, with an emphasis on British history and law, the princess also studied music and learned to speak fluent French. She trained as a Girl Guide (the British equivalent of the Girl Scouts) and developed a lifelong passion for horses. As queen, she kept many thoroughbred racehorses and frequently attended racing and breeding events. Elizabeth’s famous attachment to Pembroke Welsh corgis also began in childhood, and she owned more than 30 corgis over the course of her reign.","completion":"Queen Elizabeth's nickname was Lilibet, and she liked Pembroke Welsh corgis."},{"prompt":"Write a formal email trying to convince someone that cats are better than dogs, when they've had bad experiences with cats in the past.

The code for that might look like this: \`f = open(���file.txt���, ���rb���)\`. 2. Use the \`base64\` library.

It should feature some of his regular haunts as well as a conflict between our protagonist and some alley cats.","completion":"Marco yawned awake and stretched. It was a little earlier than he was used to getting up, but that was ok. He was patient. Carefully, he made his way out of the alley, avoiding broken bottles and sharp cans as he went. There were a few people on the streets today, but not too many this early. Most were already at work or were starting their shift later. Marco went to his first stop: the butcher shop. Every morning, Jenkins would throw out some scraps for him. It was lucky he'd chosen that particular back door one rainy night in August. Jenkins had seen him and taken pity on him by throwing a few scraps. The rest was history. After his morning meal of liver and fish guts, Marco sauntered around his usual haunts. He preferred to sit in the entrance to the alley; people were a little too friendly, even with an alley cat that undoubtedly had fleas. He would rummage through the trash cans or snag scraps from the dumpsters. Occasionally, he would get lucky and find some fresh food that someone had left behind. Frequenting the restaurants was always a good idea, especially if the servers were a little slow to clean up the leftovers. Of course, Marco wasn't lazy. He would nab a rat, mouse, or other small rodent from time to time if the opportunity presented itself. Anything to survive. After a long day of hunting, he returned home and began to clean. His sharp ears picked up a noise, and in the dark of the alley, he saw a pair of glowing eyes. \\"This is our turf now. Get lost,\\" a voice growled. Although the cat had told him to leave, they seemed to want to instill the lesson with a few scratches. Marco dashed past one of them toward the entrance. He knew every inch of this alley even without the visual cues, so it didn't surprise him when one of the cats in pursuit stepped on a broken glass bottle and began to wail. The noise stopped the others, and Marco made a quick escape. He would have to move home, but such was the life of a city cat."},{"prompt":"What does self-storage mean?","completion":"Self-storage is a service offered to assist people who are temporarily storing their personal belongings in a designated unit for later use."},{"prompt":"What are the different types of storage units?","completion":"At most facilities, there will be different size units which can range from 5x5 and 5x10 up to 10 x 10, 10 x 15, 10 x 30 and 20 x 20, which is the size of an average two-car garage."},{"prompt":"How much do storage units typically cost?","completion":"The cost to rent a self-storage unit will vary from one location to the next, and the size of the unit.

These sharks can swim down to depths of 1,100 feet or more, which is a cold, dark place for sea creatures. These sharks can reach over 1,000 pounds to insulate themselves for warmth. • Elephant Seals. These seals can reach weights of 3,000 to 9,000 pounds, depending on their environment. The warmth of accumulated blubber protects them from cold climates, while their plush bodies protect them from the aggressive nature of other elephant seals. • African Elephants. These elephants are the largest land animals in the world. They can grow up to 16,500 pounds, which comes in handy for protecting their young from predators in the wild. • Blue Whales. These whales are the biggest known animals in existence. Their typical weights hover around 330,000 pounds, but there have been record cases of blue whales that reached 380,000 pounds. • Hippopotamus. Hippos are massive and aggressive by nature.

Wheat flour dough is rinsed until all of the starch is gone, leaving the gluten. After this, it's steamed, boiled, or baked to give it a meaty texture. Seitan is widely used in vegan deli meats and chicken substitutes. 2. Green Spelt - Another wheat-based substitute, green spelt is spelt grain that's harvested while it's partially ripe. It's then roasted and dried, giving it a strong flavor. Green spelt is easy to digest and contains lots of B vitamins, phosphorus, and magnesium, and is used often in vegan meatballs, among other products. 3. Oat Flakes - Rich in zinc and iron, they're relatively cheap and available at virtually any supermarket. Oat flakes are made into a dough, fried, and added to vegetable broth, fat, carrots or zucchini, and other proteins. They're also a great source of complex carbohydrates, giving you more of that \\"full\\" feeling after a meal. 4. Black Beans - Black beans are commonly used for vegan burger patties, providing a tasty and nutritious alternative to restaurants and store-bought patties. They're rich in protein and fiber and the skins contain powerful antioxidants. 5. Chickpeas - Chickpeas are widely used as an alternative to chicken and turkey. They're incredibly protein dense and contain significant amounts of iron, calcium, and fiber.

Give it some cheerful fantasy elements, like alice in wonderland style.","completion":"Deep in the heart of an ancient forest lies a sun-streaked meadow filled with giant oaks and lush ferns. Just about in the center of this meadow, there is a massive willow tree, with branches gnarled and a trunk twisting up to the sky. Hanging from these branches are a myriad of curious slings and hammocks that appear to be woven from the bark of the willow, undoubtedly making this tree a popular rest area for many local creatures. The stoic willow gives off a serene sense of peace and wisdom, seeming to look over the meadow as a caring grandmother. Spotted all around this clearing are bunches of vibrantly colored mushrooms If you were to happen to walk past these particular mushrooms, you would be greeted in cheerful singsong voices. These mushrooms can be overheard gossiping about the local woodland drama and when that grows thin, the weather makes just as fine a subject. Tucked back among the leaves beside the meadow, where you would probably never even notice, lies a dragon's verdant den. She often appears to sun herself and perhaps join in with some of the gossiping. One excellent afternoon, she is happened upon by a good-looking emerald dragon, who happens to be new to this area. It is not long before the pair find themselves trying not to get caught stealing shy looks from across the meadow. With each \\"chance\\" encounter, the pair's friendship blossoms as they tell the tales that dragons tell, sitting beneath the willow. Their laughter can be heard echoing over the mushrooms' chatter.

Please number each of the benefits and provide a short paragraph explanation for each. Thank you!","completion":"1 - Enjoy Higher Quality Sleep Regular sauna use in the late evening can result in higher-quality sleep. Your body temperature will rise during the use of the sauna but then fall before you go into bed. This will result in a slow decline in the number of endorphins that are released into your body, which will help act as a sedative to facilitate easier and better sleep. 2 - Burn Additional Calories Saunas are a practical tool to help you burn calories because the process of sweating requires a significant amount of energy. Specifically, as your body temperature increases and your heart rate begins to increase with it, the body will require more oxygen. It will then convert more calories into energy. While saunas are not the definitive weight loss tool as some people claim, it is undeniably effective at helping one burn additional calories. 3 - Muscle Recovery Step into a sauna after your next workout. The heat from the sauna will relax your muscles and help soothe any aches in your joints and muscles you have from the workout as well. When your body is exposed to the heat produced by the sauna, your body will release endorphins that will help to keep pain to a minimum. Your blood vessels will also dilate, allowing for increased blood circulation, which helps to quicken your body's healing process. 4 - Reduce The Risk of Getting The Common Cold Sauna medical research from Germany has shown that regular sauna use amongst its participants greatly reduced their overall incidences of catching common colds and the flu. The explanation for this is that the body will produce more white blood cells when it is exposed to the heat from a sauna. These white blood cells are effective at killing viruses to stop the onset of illnesses. 5 - Social Benefits While a sauna can be a relaxing area of solitude for yourself, it can also be an equally relaxing area in the company of others. Saunas are an opportune environment to engage in open and yet quiet socializing with friends, family, and people who may soon become your new friends."},{"prompt":"I'm curious at to what movies Audrey Hepburn made in the 1970's?","completion":"Audrey Hepburn only appeared in two movies during the 1970s: • Robin and Marian (1976) - Sean Connery is Robin Hood to Audrey Hepburn's Maid Marian in this tale about the legendary characters in their middle-aged years. • Bloodline (1979) - Heiress to a pharmaceutical company whose wealth is measured in the billions, Elizabeth Roffe (Audrey Hepburn) is soon targeted for murder just as her late father was."},{"prompt":"But journalists’ most stubborn instinct—the one they share with Holmes—is to lean into a good story.

Having a baby is always a leap of faith, and it’s impossible to prepare perfectly beforehand. You’ll always be taken by surprise, and the key is to grow with the experience. The only thing you can really do to get ready is to prepare your heart, mind, and life to be open to the unexpected, and to make sure that you have a good support network around you, if at all possible. Looking back, I can see now that even my super broody friends weren’t more prepared than me for the reality of parenthood. Having children is a truly humbling experience, and you have to embrace the fact that you’ll be a beginner and feel totally out of your depth a lot of the time.

As a branch of mathematics that allows us to study continuous change, Calculus is more than just calculations. Some of the common applications of calculus include: 1. The predictions of weather and climate-related changes by scientists are made more accurate through calculus. These scientists consider factors such as wind speed, moisture level, temperature, and pressure. While there are many sensors used in weather forecasting today, equations still form the base of forecasting. 2. Building construction requires differential and integral calculus to correctly measure variables like weight, area, height, and material density. Civil engineers and architects use these skills every day in their professions. 3. Calculus-based equations allow mobile robots to do the things they do! This branch of mathematics can be used to coordinate the variables required for movement, such as distance, acceleration, and velocity. 4. Biologists rely on calculus equations to accurately predict the growth rate of bacteria and other microbes. Other similar applications are in the realm of patient diagnosis; calculating cardiac output, blood pressure, and cell and tumor growth are all possible through Calculus."},{"prompt":"Write a casual email to a former client of mine, Will, letting them know that my graphic design services are still available.

The T-7 has a relatively conventional configuration, with swept wings and two tailfins framing a single General Electric F404-GE-103 afterburning turbofan engine. Though a single engine sounds like a downgrade from the current T-38 Talon's two engines, this F404 actually produces three times as much thrust as both of the T-38's combined. The Red Hawk will carry two pilots (typically a student and an instructor). Since it’s intended to train pilots on advanced 4th- and 5th-generation fighters, it will simulate many of their systems such as radar, data links, defensive capabilities, etc., even though the T-7 doesn’t carry those systems itself.

Ice, Ice, Baby Wild Emperor penguins are only found in Antarctica. They breed and raise their young mostly on ‘fast ice’, a floating platform of frozen ocean which is connected to the land or to ice shelves. From birth, they spend their entire lives in and around the Antarctic ice, although very rarely vagrants have turned up off the coast of New Zealand. 2. Giants of the Penguin World Emperors are the biggest of the 18 species of penguin found today, and one of the largest of all birds. They are approximately 120cm tall (about the height of a six year old child) and weigh in at around 40 kg, though their weight does fluctuate dramatically throughout the year. But they would be dwarfed by the ancient ‘mega-penguins’. Fossils recovered from the Antarctic Peninsula reveal that a colossus species of penguin which lived about 37 million years ago may have stood 2m tall and weighed as much as 115 kg. 3. How many penguins? There are approximately 595,000 adult Emperor penguins in Antarctica. But due to a lack of research, there is still so much we don't know about these magnificent polar creatures. That's why we're funding research in the Antarctic, because the more we know, the better we can protect them. This will encourage the formation of Marine Protected Areas and will help in protecting the species in the face of climate change. Emperor penguin colonies have been discovered and counted from space. A survey led by British scientists in 2012 used satellite technology to identify emperor colonies from the poo stains left on the ice at breeding sites. They discovered a number of previously unvisited colonies and counted every individual penguin. In there are now thought to be around 54 Emperor colonies in the Antarctic. About half of these have been discovered by satellite survey and most of these remain unvisited. 5. Penguin Love Emperors incubate their eggs during the long dark southern winter months. Courtship displays are intricate but copulation is quick and the female lays a single egg in May or June. She then passes it over to her mate to incubate - and she’s off. She spends the next nine weeks at sea, feeding. The male carefully balances the egg on his feet for between 65 – 75 days to keep it warm in a specially adapted brood pouch, and off the snow surface, before it hatches. Then out pops a fluffy chick. 6. ‘Baby, its cold outside’ Emperors are uniquely adapted to survive these harsh conditions when temperatures can drop down to a bone chilling -50°C and with winds of up to 200km/hr. They have two layers of feathers, a good reserve of fat and proportionally smaller beaks and flippers than other penguins to prevent heat loss. Emperors also have feathers on their legs, so their ankles don’t get too chilly. Even their feet are adapted to the icy conditions, containing special fats that prevent them from freezing and strong claws for gripping the ice. But most remarkably, colonies of adults and chicks work together to huddle for warmth. 5,000 or more tightly packed adults and chicks shuffle around, so each takes a turn - but not too long - on the outside of the huddle where it’s cold. This is in complete contrast to their quarrelsome and territorial neighbours, the Adélie penguins. 7. Dive, Dive Dive! Emperor penguins are the Olympic divers of the bird world. The deepest recorded dive was 564 m – that’s the equivalent of nearly 2 x the height of the Shard, Europe’s tallest building. And the longest recorded dive was nearly 28 minutes. That’s incredible! 8. Fish suppers Emperors feed mostly on Antarctic silverfish as well as other species of fish, krill (like Will & Bill from Happy Feet) and some squid. An adult penguin eats about 2-3 kg per day, but on a good day they can eat twice this much to build up their store of body fat for the long winter, or for feeding their chicks.","completion":"Here's a quiz generated from penguin facts you shared: QUESTION 1: How many continents do wild Emperor penguins reside on?

Finding the right place to set up camp is essential: You want to avoid setting up your tent on a slant, and finding a flat space also helps with drainage. Make sure the area where you want to put your tent is clear of debris, roots, branches, and rocks. Also, review your surroundings, and make sure the trees around where you'll be setting up are alive and not at risk of falling while you're staying in the area. 2. Allocate a spot for your garbage and remain close to water sources: Designate a spot 20 feet from your campsite and away from any wildlife where you can store your disposables. Additionally, it is best to try and find a spot close to the bathroom. If your campsite has a water pump, make sure it is easily accessible, but if you're backcountry camping, stay close to natural water sources like streams and rivers. Remember, if you are using natural resources, be prepared and pack items that will make the water potable, like chlorine tablets and a water purifier. 3. Maximize the efficiency of the tent: Ensure you have ample space for the number of campers you will have joining you. It is helpful to bring a small tent just for supplies so that you do not have to bring everything you need into your tent and crowd that space. Waterproof your tents by bringing a tarp and staking it to the ground to keep it in place. 4. Keep your food and kitchen space contained: To reduce the risk of wildlife coming to your campsite, be sure to either keep your food in a car if you have one or in a bag hung away from your campsite. When you're cooking, try to position yourself downwind so as not to attract any animals nearby. 5. Practice building a campfire: This is a hotly contested debate amongst avid campers, but luckily there are many ways to build a fire. You should certainly keep wind directly and protection in mind. Try to clear the brush and other debris from the fire pit area. For fire safety, it is helpful to bring a bucket of water and a shovel nearby in case the flames get too big. All items used in the fire should be dry and dead, such as dry leaves, grass, and needles for tinder."},{"prompt":"What was the number one album released in 1995?","completion":"The number one album released in 1995 was Jagged Little Pill by Alanis Morissette, which sold 33,000,000 copies."},{"prompt":"What was the exact release date for Jagged Little Pill?","completion":"June 13, 1995"},{"prompt":"Did the album win a Grammy?","completion":"The Jagged Little Pill album won five Grammys including Album of the Year, making 21-year-old Morissette the youngest artist to win the top honor up to that point."},{"prompt":"My debit card was involved in a data breach, and I lost 3,000.

Although there is some data that suggests large banks are more likely to be targets of cyberattacks, they are also more prepared to handle them. Small, hometown banks often have less rigorous security standards and a smaller amount of available cash flow, meaning that they cannot immediately refund your funds and must wait until the dispute has settled. 2) Complete all purchases on a credit card, rather than a debit card. Although this seems counter-intuitive, as credit cards incur interest, they are also much safer. When disputing a credit card charge, you do not have to pay the funds until the dispute is settled. It's much easier to stop a charge than it is to recover funds once they have departed your account. Furthermore, interest is only paid on credit card charges that carry over to the next month or interest period, and some might even offer perks like cash back on purchases or point accrual towards future discounts or interest rates. 3) Use a verified transaction company, such as Paypal, when completing online purchases. Paypal has buyer protection and can handle disputes efficiently. Smaller sites with their own payment processors might not be as safe and verified as they assert themselves to be, nor will they be as conveniently reachable in the event of a dispute. 4) Refrain from linking your bank account, debit card, or credit card to any services. Saving your information in their system creates a database that can be breached at any point in the future if your password is discovered or the company suffers a cyberattack. Typing your information each time makes this less likely, although not impossible. 5) Change your passwords frequently and don't save them on websites or in your browser. Using strong passwords and changing them frequently significantly reduces the likelihood they will be involved in a company's data breach. You may not be immediately notified of a compromised password, so don't reuse them. 6) Diversify your accounts. As the saying goes, \\"don't keep all of your eggs in one basket.\\" Your checking account should be used for flowing cash, while your savings account should hold any lump sums that you may need access to in emergencies. Beyond your emergency fund, you can store cash in certificates of deposits (CDs) or investments that earn interest. 7) Stay aware of your account and purchases. Turn on purchase alerts if your bank offers them. Balance your checkbook and review your account frequently to notice any strange charges. The earlier these charges are caught, the easier they are resolved. I hope these suggestions help better protect your funds in the future!"},{"prompt":"Write a relatable acrostic poem about coffee.","completion":"Caffeinated to new levels in order to work daily, Options are endless at the coffee bar too, First, there’s a latte or a plain old hot coffee, Frappes for the sugar fiend with extra ice, Everyone has their preferences, but, Everyone needs coffee!"},{"prompt":"What is a metaphor and give me 3 examples.

Have you ever felt like your fears were holding you back from your full potential? Have you ever experienced imposter syndrome that prevents you from showing up as the best version of yourself in a situation? If so, rest assured, you are not alone. We all struggle with some degree of self-doubt and fear of failure. It's particularly common among ambitious high-achievers, who, by definition, are constantly putting themselves in situations that are on the edge of their current competency level. It can crop up in a variety of contexts—backstage before a big speech or performance, at the gym as you try to build a new exercise habit, or at home as you transition from work to home mode for your family. It can be crippling. While there are a variety of techniques for managing these feelings to rise up and own the moment, in today's piece, I want to share the single approach that has made a difference in my life: Character Invention. Main Character Energy By the late 2000s, Beyoncé was already a global superstar. Few were aware that she had struggled with nerves and anxiety throughout her career, dating back to her days performing as a child. In 2008, to combat these struggles, she created Sasha Fierce, an alter ego stage persona that embodied the fearless, brave characteristics that she would need to perform at her best in front of millions. Image Credit: Matt Schnuck​ Beyoncé had engaged in a textbook example of Character Invention, a technique grounded in drama therapy and Neuro-Linguistic Programming in which the user creates a character that can show up and perform in the situations that induce fear or self-doubt. Kobe Bryant famously created the \\"Black Mamba\\" alter ego in a similar vein, a character that was relentless and fiercely competitive who would show up in big moments on the court. They're not alone in using the technique: countless top performers across a range of fields have used Character Invention to rise to the occasion. Not just pop-stars, celebrities, and athletes, either—many of the world's top executive coaches teach it to their clients. The general strategy: Create a character in your mind who can show up in the way you want to and teach yourself to \\"flip the switch\\" to become this character when necessary. Creating Your Own Characters You may not have to perform in front of millions on a regular basis, but Character Invention can still be an incredible tool to show up as the best version of you across a variety of situations. As an example, here are a few situations you may encounter during a typical day: You wake up in the morning and need to get ready for your day. This may involve getting your family out the door for their respective activities, getting yourself dressed and ready, and handling any household chores. You go to the gym before work to get some exercise in before the day inevitably becomes chaotic. You go to work and have a few big projects to present to your managers and team. You get home after work and want to unwind with your family. You want to turn off work mode and be the present parent, partner, or friend that you know you should be. In each situation, there are different versions of you that must \\"turn on\\" in order to perform at your best. For some, it can be very difficult to navigate all of the context switching within the confines of your persona, especially as your energy is getting depleted throughout the day. Character Invention can help. Envision the character that you would like to embody in this situation: What traits do they possess? How do they interact with their surroundings? How do they physically appear to others? What is their mentality? The next time you enter that situation, \\"turn on\\" your character and take on the moment with new energy. Who Are Your Characters? Character Invention has been a wonderful addition to my life. If you've ever struggled with fear, insecurity, or imposter syndrome in your day-to-day life, I'd encourage you to give it a shot. Here are a few steps to incorporate it into your life: Identify Situations: Identify the situations where you'd like to show up as the best version of yourself. This can be as big as performing in front of millions or as small as having dinner with your family after a long day. Any situation where you want to be your best. Envision Your Character: Envision the character you would like to embody in each situation. What traits do they possess? How do they appear and interact? What is their mentality and energy level? Get in Character: Nothing works without practice. Get yourself some reps by turning on this character in those situations. See how it feels to show up as your best self in these moments.","completion":"1. Identify Situations 2. Envision Your Character 3.

I'm not even sure what the official name of this forest is except that it is somewhere in the Nuuanu(?) Valley. I think I should sit down, take a rest, and document what has gone on since I first entered this forest in case I am not found in time for authorities to rescue me. Yesterday at noon, I came into this forest from a road that was about 100 feet above the valley. The path into the valley led from the parking lot where I parked my car (a rental vehicle, license plate HHH123 red Chevy Camaro convertible). I walked on the path for about five hours before I decided to stop and have a drink of water and a bite to eat. I don't remember exactly how the path went; it could have been going straight or it could have curved a bit, so I didn't know which direction to head back. I figured I would just walk back in a straight line the way I came in, hoping to reach the parking lot or the main road. However, as I walked for several hours, I started to panic when I couldn't hear the vehicular traffic coming from the road anymore. I can only vaguely remember hearing it when I was walking at the beginning of the path, but now I was sure I couldn't hear anything except grasshoppers and coqui frogs, and it was getting dark. I decided to stay in one place, making a camp in case I needed to wait until the next day and building a fire. I stayed over the night and woke up the next morning and decided to chronicle what has happened so far. Now, I intend to continue walking the way I came (I think?), hoping that I will come out to the road. If I am heading the wrong way, I'm sure I will come out the other end of the forest. I have to stay calm, have hope, and remember that this is an island, so I'm bound to reach the end of this forest and the beginning of the shoreline at some point.

Melissa Murray: Let’s start with the elephant in the room: the mifepristone rulings. A judge in the Amarillo division of the northern district of Texas has issued a decision that stays the FDA’s approval of mifepristone. Another competing ruling in the western district of Washington requires the FDA to continue making mifepristone available to those in a number of blue states which have filed a challenge of their own to maintain mifepristone access. We have governors in states like California and Massachusetts stockpiling both mifepristone and misoprostol. Is it chaotic by design? Jessica Valenti: Yes. The point is to sow so much uncertainty that even in places where abortion is legal, people don’t know if they can get the care they are legally entitled to. Doctors will be afraid. Pharmacists will be afraid. And because this is all changing so quickly, that feeds into that chaos too. Melissa Murray: In June 2022, the Supreme Court issued its much-anticipated decision in Dobbs, which upheld by a 6-3 vote a Mississippi law that banned abortion at just 15 weeks—and by a 5-4 vote, overruled both Casey and Roe. The Court insisted that its decision did no more than return the fraught and vexed question of abortion to the democratic process and to the people, who were rightfully the ones to decide this question. So, is Judge Kacsmaryk “the people”? Jessica Valenti: We always knew that it was never about state’s rights. It was always about banning abortion in every single state in every possible way. What has been really frustrating to me in Kacsmaryk’s ruling is this idea that they’re doing something for women’s health, that they’re protecting us. It just adds salt to the wound. It makes me a little more furious than usual because it’s so offensive, so insulting and so obviously false. Melissa Murray: What Jessica is referring to is the plaintiff, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, arguing that mifepristone is unsafe for women despite the FDA’s approval that has been in place for over 20 years. What is this about? Is this a backlash to women’s progress? Is this an effort to put us back into a particular box? I mean the women’s rights movement has been in place since the 1970s. Ruth Bader Ginsburg helped to read women into the Equal Protection Clause. Abortion rights is only part of that. Again, this is the question this symposium asks: Is there more to come, and how will we as women fit into a society that purports to be democratic without necessarily taking into account the voices of women? Jessica Valenti: I think so much of this is about punishment. I don’t think it is a coincidence that they went after abortion medication specifically. Abortion medication completely changed the way that people were able to get abortion care. You can have an abortion in your home while watching Netflix privately. We took away their ability to publicly shame us at clinics, and that made them angry. They don’t want abortion to be easy and safe and that is part of the big hypocrisy. Melissa Murray: Punishing women but for what? What are we doing? Jessica Valenti: Existing. Having our own lives and making our own decisions. And I think with abortion specifically that is very much you controlling your body, the trajectory of your life and of your family.","completion":"Melissa Murray and Jessica Valenti are talking about some recent decisions and changes regarding a medicine called mifepristone and the availability of abortion. They mention different rulings from judges in different parts of the country, which are causing confusion and uncertainty about whether people can get the care they need. This is making doctors and pharmacists worried too. They also mention a decision by the Supreme Court in 2022 that allowed a law in Mississippi to ban abortion after just 15 weeks and overruled previous decisions protecting abortion rights. The Court said it was giving the power back to the people to decide. However, Jessica believes that the real goal has always been to ban abortion in every state. They discuss a group called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine that argues mifepristone is unsafe for women, even though it has been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for a long time. They question if this is a backlash against women's progress and an attempt to control and limit our choices. Jessica believes that a big part of this is about punishing women for simply existing and making their own decisions. Abortion medication has made it easier and more private for women to have abortions, and some people don't want that. They want to make it difficult and unsafe, which is unfair and hypocritical. Overall, they raise important questions about how women's voices and rights are being considered in our society, and how we can navigate a democratic society that may not always prioritize women's perspectives."},{"prompt":"Who was the first President of the United States?","completion":"George Washington was the first President.

So, this kid jumps in the back of my cab, holding a fish bowl with a small fish swimming in it. I asked him, \\"Boy, what's the matter with the fish? A different kinda fish or something?\\" And he says, \\"Nah, man. I won him at the carnival.\\" I couldn't help but chuckle at the thought that he probably had a better chance of winning the lottery than keeping that fish alive for more than a day. But this kid was determined to keep his trophy alive, so he tells me to step on it and take him to the pet store. We arrive, and I dropped him off at the front door. The kid hops out, leaving the fish in the back seat. I'm heading to my parking spot wondering what kind of trouble this kid is getting himself into when all of a sudden, I hear a flopping noise. I turned around and saw that the fish had somehow jumped out of the bowl and was rolling on the floor of my cab. I start to panic, trying to keep control of the car and stay calm. Getting into an accident would just make everything worse. I pull into the closest parking spot and turn around to help the fish. The boy returns from the store, sees the commotion, and jumps back to rescue the fish. He picks it up and puts it back in the bowl but accidentally spills half the water all over the seats. I couldn't believe it, but all I could do was smile and hand the boy a towel to clean up the mess.

How they prepare Grant writers usually have a range of skills, a college degree, and other training or experience. Skills. Research and writing skills are essential for grant writers. Research helps writers find grant opportunities. Good writing expresses ideas clearly and succinctly, with creativity and persuasiveness helping a proposal stand out. Interpersonal skills are important, too, because grant writers interact with clients, colleagues, and donors to gather and relay information. Grant writers also need to be detail oriented and have multitasking and organizational skills. These skills allow them to juggle multiple grant applications and adhere to each grant’s guidelines and deadlines. Education and training. Grant writers, like other types of writers and authors, typically need a bachelor’s degree to qualify for entry-level jobs. Often, the field of study doesn’t matter, but helpful courses include marketing and English. Some colleges and universities offer programs specifically in grant writing. Classes and workshops are also available through community colleges and professional associations. But many grant writers learn from online resources, books, and on-the-job training. And years of practice help them develop the skills for writing successful grant proposals. “You learn by doing,” says Shelia. “And the more you do it, the better you’ll get. You also learn from your rejections.” Experience and more. Experience in a related occupation is generally not required for entry-level grant writing jobs, but it can be helpful to have. For example, many grant writers start out in another role in an organization before transitioning to grant writing. A background in communications, fundraising, or budgeting is valuable. Gaining experience isn’t limited to employment, however. Networking with other grant writers and doing some unpaid work may help you learn more about the occupation. “Talk to folks involved in the funding and application process,” says Shelia. “And volunteer with small organizations to learn how grant writing is done.” Experienced grant writers also might opt to earn certification, which demonstrates a level of proficiency and could improve their employment options. And, although success is not guaranteed, grant writers have a better chance of writing a good proposal if they’re passionate about the causes for which they seek funds. “If you feel it, then you can write it for others to feel as well,” Shelia says. “If you aren’t motivated for the cause, you can’t motivate anyone else.”","completion":"bachelor's degree, online resources, books, other work experience, on-the-job training, unpaid work, classes and workshops, certifications"},{"prompt":"Hi, please give me five reasons why I should be an art major. I need to show my parents because they don't believe me. Don't make them too long, just a few sentences each. Also, don't address it directly to my parents, it's not a letter.","completion":"Sure thing! You can give your parents these five reasons: 1. We consume art every day. TV, music, movies, photography--art isn't just a picture hanging in a gallery, although that's valuable, too. Becoming an artist means contributing your creativity to the world. 2. No one has the same ideas that you do. Two people can paint the same still life, and their paintings will still be unique because they interpreted the source differently. It's important to share YOUR vision because nobody else can. 3. While it's true that not every artist signs a million-dollar contract in a month, not every artist works for pennies, either. Plenty of artists make a liveable income or at least supplement their paychecks. 4. The Internet has made it easier than ever for artists to find work. You can jump on Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok and potentially earn thousands of followers. Artists also join Patreon, which allows their fans to fund their work in exchange for requests, sketches, and exclusive pieces. 5. If you don't act now, you might spend the rest of your life wondering why you didn't take the risk.

Nelly couldn't believe her eyes! She saw a meadow filled with colorful flowers, a sparkling stream, and in the distance, a tall mountain. She decided to explore further and eagerly took her first steps into the great outdoors.

This so-called tourist destination definitely deserves a solid one star, and that's only because zero stars aren't an option. First off, the journey to the moon was a total nightmare. The spaceship looked like it was built by a bunch of amateurs. If you're gonna charge an arm and a leg for this experience, at least make sure your spacecraft doesn't rattle around and almost give you whiplash. And don't get me started on the seats—they were more uncomfortable than a rock. I thought my back was going to snap in half! Once we finally landed on the moon, you'd think things would get better, right? Wrong! The so-called \\"moon base\\" was nothing more than a flimsy tent. Seriously, it felt like I was camping in my own backyard, and at least I wouldn't have had to pay for that. The accommodations were beyond pathetic. I've seen better beds at a cheap motel, and the food? Well, let's just say I'd rather eat a frozen TV dinner. They promised all these cool moonwalks and sightseeing excursions, but guess what? They were canceled. So I paid a fortune to see some rocks up close. Oh, and did I mention the staff? They were the epitome of incompetence. I asked for a refund, and they just flat out said no and refused to explain. They couldn't care less about my dissatisfaction. It was like they were trained to ignore customer complaints. I've never felt so unimportant in my life. To sum it all up, this moon trip was a colossal waste of time, money, and dreams. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. Save yourself the trouble and go on a nice tropical vacation instead. At least there you'll get a comfy bed, decent food, and maybe even a smile from the staff.

Less than 24 hours after the rules known as Title 42 were lifted, migrants and government officials were still assessing the effect of the change and the new regulations adopted by President Joe Biden’s administration to stabilize the region. “We did not see any substantial increase in immigration this morning,” said Blas Nunez-Neto of the Department of Homeland Security. He said the agency did not have specific numbers because it was early in the day. Migrants along the border continued to wade into the Rio Grande to take their chances getting into the U.S. while defying officials shouting for them to turn back. Others hunched over cellphones trying to access the appointment app that is a centerpiece of the new measures. Migrants with appointments walked across a bridge hoping for a new life. And lawsuits sought to stop some of the measures. The Biden administration has said the new system is designed to crack down on illegal crossings and to offer a new legal pathway for migrants who pay thousands to smugglers to get them to the border. Migrants are now essentially barred from seeking asylum in the U.S. if they did not first apply online or seek protection in the countries they traveled through. Families allowed in as their immigration cases progress will face curfews and GPS monitoring. Across the river from El Paso in Ciudad Juárez, many migrants watched their cellphones in hopes of getting a coveted appointment to seek entry. The application to register to enter the U.S. had changed, and some were explaining to others how to use it. Nearby, other migrants were charging their phones on a lamppost to try to get an appointment. Most of them were resigned to wait. “I hope it’s a little better and that the appointments are streamlined a little more,” said Yeremy Depablos, 21, a Venezuelan traveling with seven cousins who have been waiting in the city for a month.","completion":"● Joe Biden ● Blas Nunez-Neto ● Yeremy Depablos"},{"prompt":"Rewrite this email into something polite for me to send Walmart, The experience I had at your store today was awful!

I notice all of the prices of goods continue to rise but I feel like I am not seeing an increase in employees to match the increase in prices, and profits.

Also provide specific tips on how to make the best grinder.","completion":"1. Bread is king. Nothing turns a good sandwich bad faster than a bread type that doesn’t match what you’re trying to create. As a general rule of thumb, think of soft breads for soft spreads. The sturdier your sandwich filling, the firmer your bread can be. 2. Don’t limit yourself to one sauce. Mayo and mustard are great together. Mayo and anything, really. But consider dressing each side of the sandwich with different sauces. It changes the balance of the sandwich in a great way. 3. Consider the pickle. Sandwiches often have fatty, savory elements. A good pickle adds crunch and a bit to cut through all that fat. Pickles don’t have to be cucumbers, too. Think about pickled onions, peppers, or even giardiniera. 4. Let it rest. A good sandwich is like a complex chord. You want to give it a second to let those notes blend together. Your patience will be rewarded! Let’s dig deeper into the classic Italian grinder. This sandwich is best with a crusty seeded roll. Balance out the savory meats with a sharp cheese like cheddar or provolone, and don’t forget some pickled peppers. Dress it with Italian dressing (oil/vinegar) on one side, and either mayo or brown mustard on the other. Lettuce and good tomato help complete the puzzle."},{"prompt":"Hi so, I like frogs.

In the trade, St. Louis sent Arizona Luke Weaver, Carson Kelly, Andy Young, and draft compensation. The trade should provide the Cardinals with a much-needed slugger in the middle of their lineup. Goldschmidt has been an all-star in the 6 seasons leading up to the trade. Coming off another great season, the first baseman has been one of the league's most consistent hitters. Goldschmidt throughout his career has finished second or third in MVP voting three times, slugging 201 homers and 684 RBIs throughout his career.

Cut the shirts into squares of equal size and lay them out in a pattern of your choosing. Keep the squares together at the corners using simple knots. Before you know it, you'll have a personalized quilt that's as warm as it is sentimental. 5. T-Shirt Headband: Give your hair accessories a unique twist by crafting a headband out of an old shirt. Cut a strip of fabric from the shirt (the thicker you want the headband to be, the wider your strip should be), and stretch it out until it curls on the edges. Keep the ends sticking up like bunny ears. 6. T-Shirt Ice/Heat Pack: Next time you're nursing an injury or feeling sore after a workout, skip the drugstore purchases and grab an old t-shirt instead. Cut out a square or rectangle from the shirt, fill it with ice cubes or heat in the microwave, then knot the edges together to create a makeshift cold or hot pack."},{"prompt":"Write a short story that doesn't really have a point.

They leave the grocery store through a portal in the dairy fridge. Now, this really weirds you out. You question your sanity, and wonder if you've been drugged. No one else really seemed to be bothered by the exchange. The employees are opening boxes of Cheezits and pouring them into their mouths. The cashiers are stuffing money into their pockets and spitting on customers. You decide to leave without paying because the store has turned into some kind of zone of anarchy, and you have a date later. On the way home, you see a rally. People are outside of the courthouse with signs. You get a look at one of the signs, and it says \\"I hate math, let's ban math!\\" You agree, and join the rally. They invite you up to the podium.

The dark green leaves of the plants around him were larger than he was used to, and for a moment, he felt dwarfed in comparison. His shoes sunk into the wet soil, and he stumbled as he walked, pushing the leaves aside so he could better see. The canopy of trees above him was so densely packed; only muted light fell down, casting everything in inky, murky colors. When he had decided to go hunting for El Dorado, Sal was aware that he’d have to trudge through the jungles, but knowing something and experiencing something were two completely different things. He knew he would find El Dorado; now, he just had to experience it. He pushed back another heavy monstera leaf and stopped short. In front of him, without any warning at all, was a sheer drop from a cliff. And below that cliff, sprawled across the wide valley of the jungle, was a golden city. THE golden city: El Dorado. Sal’s heart caught in his throat and all he could do was stare, and the longer he did, the more he picked up. The gold – it wasn’t actual gold, no, it was golden bricks. Whole houses and structures and curling roads and streets, all of them were made of the same shining golden bricks, and nestled as it was amidst the lush, dark greenery, it glittered all the more."},{"prompt":"Write a short review about a fictional product called Minzarora.

Make your answer as close as possible to 200 words long and include two paragraphs total.","completion":"No problem! Here's a persuasive description of an almond croissant: Made with a delicate, flaky pastry, almond croissants give off the strong buttery smell of fresh baked goods. These rich croissants are heavily ladened with butter, giving them a unique, flaky texture that crumbles away each time you take a bite. As they are baked and the layers of pastry begin to rise, the outside of the croissant begins to turn a rich, golden-brown color that resembles the hue of caramel. The slices of almond that are often added to the top of these croissants also become lightly roasted during the baking process, exaggerating their flavor and providing an added element of crunch. Even though they look and smell delicious, the true magic of almond croissants is what they conceal on the inside. Unbeknownst to many, these croissants that seem bland upon one's first impression actually contain a rich, sweet, and flavorful almond-based cream. Known as frangipane to those more acquainted with baking jargon, this delicious filling is sugary enough to satisfy the sweet tooth of consumers who typically prefer pain au chocolat. Although almond croissants can be overlooked and misunderstood, these delectable pastries make a great choice for pairing with your morning coffee or an afternoon cup of tea."},{"prompt":"What happened when JFK was shot?","completion":"I remember it like it was yesterday.

When we have company over we always end up conversing around the kitchen island picking at something I’ve whipped up, usually a charcuterie board of some sort. I never take for granted that I get to prepare delicious food for the people I love. I actually think that may be my love language. But if I’m being honest since having two little ones it has caused me more stress too. With a three year old and almost one year old I am constantly in the kitchen.

Last week, shortly after a Wii review unit arrived at Forbes.com's office, I set it up in a conference room to test it out. A colleague and I booted up Wii Sports, a collection of simple sports games that comes bundled with every console. It wasn't long before we were completely immersed in Wii Tennis. The simple mini-game replicates an actual tennis match as well as any I've ever seen: Since you're actually swinging the remote like you would a racket, you can hit with varying force or apply spin to the ball, depending on how you move your body. Within minutes, we'd drawn a crowd, and only a short while after that, most of the editorial staff was packed into the conference room, laughing, enjoying the show and pushing for their turn at the remote. It was the first time since the original Nintendo Entertainment System came out in 1985 that videogaming felt like a party experience--not just because it was new, and worth gawking at, but because the experience is so much more physical, like Charades or Twister, and spectators can enjoy as much as the players. After the hard-core gamers got their turns, less videogame-savvy editors took a shot, too. And it was here where the intuitive motion control system really proved its worth. There's no sequence of arcane button combinations required to throw a baseball: You just wind up and mime an actual throw. Suddenly, videogames are fun for everyone--old or young, male or female, regardless of prior gaming experience. I lost count of how many times I heard non-gamers say, \\"Wow, I want to get this.\\" The other phrase I heard a lot was something to the effect of, \\"There's no way I'm shelling out all that cash for a PlayStation 3.\\" Sony's new game console, which debuts Nov. 17 in the U.S., will retail for 500 or 600, depending on whether you buy a basic setup or the premium version, which comes with a bigger hard drive, built-in Wi-Fi and a flash memory card reader. Similarly, Microsoft's Xbox 360, which debuted in November 2005, now retails at 300 or 400. Compare that to the Wii's 250 price tag, and Nintendo's already got a leg up in the upcoming console war. By concentrating on innovating through game play, and ignoring its competitors' most high-tech features--super-powered processors, support for high-definition televisions and DVD formats--Nintendo has not only been able to keep its costs down, but it's hit upon the single thing that sets apart an entertainment device most: It's fun.","completion":"Here is the bullet point summary you asked for: - The Wii Sports Tennis game is immersive and fun - The motion-based controller means users can swing as if they are holding a real tennis racket - The physical experience allows for an enjoyable experience for both players and spectators - The controls don't require complex button sequences meaning that everyone can enjoy regardless of gaming experience - Sony's PS3 retails for around 500 and the Xbox 360 retails for between 300-400 - The Wii retails at just 250 - The biggest advantage of the Nintendo Wii is that it's fun"},{"prompt":"I’m feeling a bit low these days and want to start saying affirmations to myself to enhance my mood.

Write it in a casual, upbeat and energetic voice and use personal anecdotal experience as the framework to explain these concepts.","completion":"Hey yogis! Today we're going to talk about the secret to nailing arm balances and inversion poses. Before you roll your eyes and groan that you're not strong enough, skinny enough, or flexible enough, hear me out! I'm convinced that none of these challenges are actually deal breakers when it comes to unlocking these intimidating poses, and hopefully, by the end of this post, you will be, too. Every time I unlock a new, difficult pose--whether it's a crow pose, handstand, or flying splits--I'm always shocked at how easy it feels. That's because these poses don't actually require as much strength or flexibility as we usually believe they do. Sure, core strength is an integral element of any balance pose, but you don't need washboard abs. Getting into these poses in the first place doesn't require extraordinary strength, but it does require the following: -Alignment. Standing on your hands is relatively easy when you stack your shoulders over your wrists and hips over your shoulders. You'll run into trouble if your hands are too close together or too far apart. -Engaged core. Even if your abs are fairly weak, you can still activate the core as you land in the pose to build strength while practicing and to make your body feel lighter (just like in \\"light as a feather, stiff as a board\\"). -Hand posture. To balance on the hands, your palms need to be slightly tented and fingers spread, gripping the mat like claws. This gives your fingers room to move and steady your balance if you feel like you might fall, whereas if they're already flat on the mat, they can't do anything to help you. -Drishti. Holding a focal point with your gaze is one of the most important keys to balance poses. If your eyes start wandering around the room, you will start wobbling. It also is helpful to send your gaze forward in balances and inversions. If you look down, you will likely fall down. -Belief. Fear is probably the single greatest hurdle that aspiring arm balancers need to overcome. It's understandable--no one wants to fall on their face. But you might be surprised how effective it is to relax, visualize yourself in a pose, and even use little cheats to prove to yourself that you're capable."},{"prompt":"Provide me with 7 quiz questions and answers about DashCon with multiple choices in true/false format.

Where did this start and what is the story behind it? Write a paragraph with around 200 words. Be sure to include what makes the main types of tea different.","completion":"According to a Chinese legend, tea was first discovered in 2737 BC when the then-emperor Shen Nung was sitting beneath a tree when leaves accidentally fell into the drinking water one of his servants was boiling. The leaves were from the Camellia sinensis tree which is now known as the tea plant. While the truth of this story is up for debate, there is no debate that tea originated in the regions around modern-day China thousands of years ago and was enjoyed by other nearby countries. However, it wasn’t until hundreds of years later that global trade routes brought tea to the rest of the world. Now tea comes in many different varieties. The main categories of tea that come from the tea plant are white, green, and black tea. The difference in these teas is in the oxidation process. Green tea is steamed after harvesting, maintaining the green color, while white tea is made by allowing the leaves to oxidize for a short amount of time. Lastly, black tea is allowed to undergo full oxidation, which allows its aroma to develop and gain its black-brown appearance."},{"prompt":"create 10 Chapter titles for a political thriller novel with a summary of each chapter.

Please remove superfluous details. Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition, which occurs in people who become sensitive to a protein called gluten. Gluten is found in wheat, barley and rye and is normally a nourishing and harmless part of the food we eat. However, if you have coeliac disease, gluten causes damage to the lining of your small bowel (intestine). This can cause problems with the absorption of both macronutrients (protein, fats and carbohydrates) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals and trace elements), from the foods we eat. The treatment, which is usually very successful, is to remove all sources of gluten from the diet. Over the past few years, it has become clear that coeliac disease is much more common than we used to think. Recent research has shown that approximately 1 in 100 people in the UK have this condition. Coeliac disease can affect people of all ethnicities. The incidence of coeliac disease in people with first-degree relatives (parent, child, sibling) who have coeliac disease is 1 in 10. However some people who have coeliac disease don’t actually know they have it but may still have some mild symptoms. It is thought that 7 out of 10 people remain undiagnosed. Some people don’t have any symptoms and are diagnosed when coeliac disease is suspected during investigation of other problems. Examples are bone fractures, anaemia and thyroid disease.","completion":"Q. What is coeliac disease? A.

Where is gluten found? A. Gluten is found in wheat, barley, and rye and is normally a nourishing and harmless part of the food we eat. Q. How is coeliac disease treated? A. The treatment, which is usually very successful, is to remove all sources of gluten from the diet. Q. How prevalent is coeliac disease? A. Over the past few years, it has become clear that coeliac disease is much more common than we used to think. Recent research has shown that approximately 1 in 100 people in the UK have this condition. It is thought that 7 out of 10 people remain undiagnosed. Q. What factors increase your risk of developing coeliac disease? A. Coeliac disease can affect people of all ethnicities. The incidence of coeliac disease in people with first-degree relatives (parent, child, sibling) who have coeliac disease is 1 in 10. Q. What are some complications of coeliac disease? A. Examples are bone fractures, anemia, and thyroid disease."},{"prompt":"What are some of the cheapest cities in the world to visit? Write a numbered list of at least three.

If you want really good coffee, first you have to buy the right kind, maybe something organic - none of that Folger's crystals for me! That's all we used to have in the 70s, and it seemed fine back then until your grandma and I took that trip to Europe and ordered espresso and wooo-weee! That was some strong coffee. Now I make my coffee not too strong, just strong enough to have a real coffee flavor. See this scoop? You'll want to put two for every cup. Make sure you measure the water just right, so you know how many scoops to put in. Something else you'll need to do sometimes is clean out the thingamajig that holds the water - it can get kind of slimy and that will ruin your coffee. If you can take it off the coffee machine, just run it through the dishwasher every now and again. And use purified water to make your coffee - I know this guy who installed a filter for me. I can give you his phone number if you want. And when your coffee maker starts taking a long time to drip, that means it's full of calcium, so you need to clean it with white vinegar - you put that in the water part, then run clean water, and your machine will be as good as new. Now try that coffee before you put any of that coffee creamer or sugar in it - if you really love coffee, you drink it black!

A parasite might be driving some wolves to lead or go solo. Wolves in Yellowstone National Park infected with Toxoplasma gondii make more daring decisions than their uninfected counterparts, researchers report November 24 in Communications Biology. The wolves’ enhanced risk-taking means they are more likely to leave their pack, or become leaders of their own. “Those are two decisions that can really benefit wolves, or could cause wolves to die,” says Connor Meyer, a field biologist at the University of Montana in Missoula. The findings reveal a parasite’s potent ability to influence a wolf’s social fate. Disease is often considered important for wildlife, mostly in the context of killing its host, Meyer says. “We have evidence now that just being infected with a certain parasite — Toxoplasma — can have pretty major implications for wolf behavior.”","completion":"It seems that Yellowstone National Park wolves that are infected with a parasite (Toxoplasma gondii) become risk-takers. This behavior causes the infected wolves to leave the pack, take more risks, and even become pack leaders themselves. This parasite seems to influence a wolf's social fate, and can help create a new leader, and subsequently a new pack, or it could cause the wolf to die. While most diseases in the wild only lead to an animal's death, this particular parasite may help to increase a wolf's standing and social implications."},{"prompt":"Write a short story about a little boy who flies away on his birthday after being given too many helium balloons for children in the second grade.","completion":"On a bright sunny day in June, all the neighborhood children gathered at little Sammy's house to celebrate his 7th birthday.

The birthday cake was shaped like an airplane because Sammy always dreamt of becoming a pilot. Fifty helium balloons decorated the backyard and danced in the warm breeze. After singing \\"Happy Birthday\\" and eating a big slice of chocolate cake, Sammy suddenly got an idea. \\"What if I can grab a hold of all of the balloons at once?\\" he thought to himself. He quickly loosed the balloons and began to hold them all together in the little fist he made with his right hand. When he got to the 50th balloon, something strange started to happen. His feet started to lift off of the ground! The children gathered around in amazement. He laughed as he rose...higher...and higher...and higher! In a flash, Sammy was above the rooftops and the treetops of his neighborhood, and was drifting away from his own house with the wind. \\"This is the best birthday ever!\\" thought Sammy as he floated through the air. The birds squawked in surprise as they flew past him and wondered how a little boy learned to fly! The children below squealed in delight as they saw Sammy rise higher and higher into the air. Only the adults seemed worried, as they yelled from below, \\"Sammy, start letting go of some balloons, right this instant!\\" Seeing their concern, Sammy let go of one balloon. He began to sink a little lower to the ground, but could still see the birds nesting in the trees. A new idea came to him. \\"What if I float over to my neighbor's pool and make a splash landing?\\" thought Sammy. He let go of another 5 balloons as he came closer to the large pool in the neighbor's yard. Before he knew it, he was hovering just above the cool blue waters and decided to release the rest of his balloons. \\"SPLASH!\\" Sammy had fallen directly into the pool! The children came running over and laughing, dove in after him. Sammy swam over to them as they cheered him for his aerial adventure. \\"I'll never forget the birthday I learned to fly!\\" exclaimed Sammy with glee."},{"prompt":"Write an email to the owner of a company from the perspective of an entrepreneur who wants to run ads for the owner's company.

Explain why someone may be afraid of these things. Also, please explain if phobias can be cured.","completion":"In the world of mental health and wellness, phobias are considered a kind of anxiety disorder that can cause someone to have an extreme fear of places, objects, animals, people, situations, and things. The fears are often irrational and difficult to explain, but exposure to the subject of a phobia can cause severe reactions, like the urge to run away or lash out violently. Some phobias are more widely accepted and well-known than others. Arachnophobia, for instance, is the extreme fear of spiders, and it affects up to 15 percent of the world’s population. Other common phobias include ophidiophobia (the fear of snakes), acrophobia (the fear of heights), and cynophobia (the fear of dogs). Some phobias, while uncommon, are still real and scary to the people that suffer from them. Five lesser-known phobias include: • Alektorophobia (the fear of chickens). • Globophobia (the fear of balloons). • Podophobia (the fear of feet). • Pedophobia (the fear of small children) • Phobophobia (the fear of fear) While some phobias may seem strange or silly to other people, they are often a source of extreme anxiety and insecurity for sufferers. The cause of each phobia can vary depending on the person. While some may have had negative experiences that caused extreme fear, others could associate their general anxiety disorder with a specific phobia because their brain latches onto that fear at the moment. Through psychotherapy and consistent behavioral therapy, most phobias can be either completely cured or lessened. The sufferer has to be dedicated to finding treatment and healing from their fears. There’s no linear method of treatment since every phobia sufferer is different and has different reasons for the fear that they feel. In most cases, exposure therapy is a method of overcoming any phobia. This means that a sufferer has to get comfortable with the object of their fear before they can heal and overcome their phobia. In other cases, anxiety medications can help lessen the extreme fear and visceral reactions associated with certain phobias."},{"prompt":"Reframe this discussion about the perceived effectiveness of supplements, with a particular focus on Vitamin D, into a conversation between two health-conscious friends debating about the validity of supplements in their daily routines. These are dark days for supplements. Although they are a 30-plus billion market in the United States alone, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, beta-carotene, glucosamine, chondroitin, and fish oil have now flopped in study after study. If there was one supplement that seemed sure to survive the rigorous tests, it was vitamin D. People with low levels of vitamin D in their blood have significantly higher rates of virtually every disease and disorder you can think of: cancer, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, heart attack, stroke, depression, cognitive impairment, autoimmune conditions, and more. The vitamin is required for calcium absorption and is thus essential for bone health, but as evidence mounted that lower levels of vitamin D were associated with so many diseases, health experts began suspecting that it was involved in many other biological processes as well. And they believed that most of us weren’t getting enough of it. This made sense. Vitamin D is a hormone manufactured by the skin with the help of sunlight. It’s difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities through diet. When our ancestors lived outdoors in tropical regions and ran around half naked, this wasn’t a problem. We produced all the vitamin D we needed from the sun. But today most of us have indoor jobs, and when we do go outside, we’ve been taught to protect ourselves from dangerous UV rays, which can cause skin cancer. Sunscreen also blocks our skin from making vitamin D, but that’s OK, says the American Academy of Dermatology, which takes a zero-tolerance stance on sun exposure: “You need to protect your skin from the sun every day, even when it’s cloudy,” it advises on its website. Better to slather on sunblock, we’ve all been told, and compensate with vitamin D pills. Yet vitamin D supplementation has failed spectacularly in clinical trials. Five years ago, researchers were already warning that it showed zero benefit, and the evidence has only grown stronger. In November, one of the largest and most rigorous trials of the vitamin ever conducted—in which 25,871 participants received high doses for five years—found no impact on cancer, heart disease, or stroke.","completion":"\\"Hey Sarah, have you noticed that supplements seem to be losing their shine lately?\\" John asked, glancing at the array of vitamin bottles on the kitchen counter. \\"You know, vitamin A, C, E, even fish oil, they all seem to be failing in these research studies.\\" Sarah, stirring her morning coffee, nodded. \\"I did notice that, but it was really surprising about Vitamin D. It seemed like a sure bet, you know?\\" \\"Yeah,\\" John agreed. \\"I mean, people with lower Vitamin D levels have a higher risk of pretty much every disease you can think of - cancer, diabetes, obesity, heart diseases... the list goes on. It's also crucial for bone health because it helps absorb calcium.\\" Sarah furrowed her brow in thought. \\"And because Vitamin D is produced by our skin through sun exposure, experts believed we weren't getting enough, especially with our modern indoor lifestyles and the whole skin cancer scare leading to excessive sunscreen use.\\" \\"Exactly!\\" John exclaimed. \\"But despite our logical assumptions, Vitamin D supplements have shown no significant benefits in clinical trials. Five years ago, researchers already began questioning its effectiveness, and recent evidence only strengthens their skepticism.\\" Sarah looked thoughtful. \\"That's concerning, considering how many people rely on these supplements. I mean, remember that large trial conducted recently? The one with over 25,000 participants receiving high Vitamin D doses for five years? It found no impact on cancer, heart disease, or stroke.\\" John nodded, his gaze returning to the line-up of vitamin bottles. \\"It definitely makes you wonder about the validity of including supplements in our daily routines, doesn't it?\\""},{"prompt":"Using this text, summarize how guessing the wrong word helped the writer solve the puzzle.

It looked as though the D must come at the end of the word, and there was a good chance that the letter between O and N would be a U: POUND My third guess confirmed my ideas about the general shape of the word. Now all I had to do was find the first letter. My problem was that I could think of five possible answers that all fitted the pattern using letters that were still available: BOUND, FOUND, HOUND, MOUND, WOUND.

Make is humorous and under 400 words.","completion":"In the land of Hoo-man, a tremendous power lay hidden for centuries - the One Ring to Rule them All. It was said that whoever possessed the Ring would be granted the power to control all the chihuahuas in the land and become their leader. They would have an army of the tiniest but fiercest dogs at their command. This power would make them undefeatable. Throughout history, many had sought the power of the Ring, but none had ever found it, until one day... A young chihuahua named Bolsón was playing in a stream deep in the forest when he stumbled upon the Ring. It was such a tiny gold band with strange markings on it. He knew immediately that he had found something of vital importance that must be protected at all costs. Some would stop at nothing to possess the Ring. The evil Maiar Saurpug, leader of the rival pug kingdom of Morpug, sent his PugOrc minions to find and capture Bolsón and the Ring. Bolsón knew that he had to leave his home, lest it be destroyed, and embark on a treacherous journey to destroy the Ring for once and for all before it fell into the wrong paws. With the help of his best friends - Samhowl the Beagle, MerryButts the Corgi, and Pippinlow the Dachshund - Bolsón set out on a quest to destroy the Ring. They encountered many dangers along the way, including treacherous rivers, towering mountains, and terrifying creatures, but they persevered. Finally, they reached the volcano, Mount Derp, where the Ring had to be destroyed. Saurpug and his army of pugs were close behind, determined to capture the Ring to claim ultimate power. Our heroes could feel their hot Pug breath on their necks at every turn. Bolsón knew that he had to act fast. So he threw the Ring into the volcano's core, destroying it forever.

Create a quick story about a military pilot who gets shot down not by an enemy aircraft, but by some otherworldly horror that comes from below the ocean.","completion":"The blaring alerts and sirens were replaced very suddenly by the roar of rushing air. I tumbled gradually through the air. The bulky emergency kit pressed heavily against my leg, which, oddly, felt both reassuring and unnerving. Though I knew I was moving at hundreds of miles an hour, everything seemed like slow motion. Then came the loud FLOP! of the unfurling parachute, and everything sped up again for a brief second. The harness yanked against my body with a jolt that made my teeth chatter. Once my acceleration had stabilized, though, it was back to slow motion. And there was the silence. Other than the wind whistling past my helmet and an occasional flutter from the parachute, the world seemed empty – almost peaceful. I caught sight of my F-18's tumbling remains just in time to watch it shatter against the ocean's surface. There was a brief flash of ignited jet fuel and then nothing. My beautiful bird simply disappeared. That sobered me up enough for the questions to start coming. What had hit me? I'd had no indication of unknown aircraft. No nearby islands were large enough to host surface-to-air missiles. Not a single unfriendly radar was painting my jet. Even the weather was as placid as one could possibly ask. Yet my fighter had taken a catastrophic hit at 30,000 feet. At least I wasn't over unfriendly waters. I'd have to remember my survival training, but as long as my beacon was functioning, the SAR guys would be along in a reasonable amount of time. It was about that point that I hazarded a look straight down. For lack of a better word, my brain just sort of fizzled at the sight. Below me, rising out of the empty ocean, was an immense black shape. My brain had never seen something by which to compare it. The thing moved in fluid motions, and long tendrils appeared to writhe along its surface. Immense tentacle-like appendages unfurled in multiple directions. Yet something about the shapes suggested it was not necessarily organic either. Whatever the case, the THING was jet black but for several rows of glowing orange orbs that ran along its longer axis. And as I fell closer and closer toward the giant THING in the water, I could swear some of those orbs were LOOKING at me."},{"prompt":"I'm learning Java, and I'm wondering if you can write me a class.

Small home design details make me feel happy and comfortable.","completion":"Do any of these ideas look like they'll help? • Paint or wallpaper an accent wall in your bedroom or living room! One color for every wall in your bedroom or living room can feel monotonous. It’s boring for the eyes. Give you and your guests something to break up the space with an accent wall. This is a colorful wall that uses either paint or wallpaper, creating a focal point where you can show off more of your interior design personality. • Bring nature indoors with a fresh vase of flowers, windowsill succulents, and a kitchen herb garden. Grocery stores have sales on seasonal flowers every week, so change out a vase of fresh flowers to bring nature indoors. You could also line your living room or bedroom windowsills with succulent plants, which require little upkeep to maintain vivid greenness and full beauty. Another great idea would be to grow your herbs in the kitchen. Use small pots in a line across your windowsill and plant fresh seasonings, like oregano, rosemary, and cilantro. • Change your curtains! For bedrooms, most people prefer blackout curtains. However, that still leaves your living room curtains, and perhaps the curtains in your home office. Change it up! Find a floral pattern that you love or choose light curtains and allow the sunshine to stream through in the mornings. • Create a flowerbed or small garden and line your front path with solar lights. Solar lights are eco-friendly ways to illuminate the way to your front door while also providing a nice evening aesthetic to your home’s exterior. As for a small garden or flowerbed, a new hobby could be fun, and you’d beautify your yard with pretty seasonal blooms. Plus, if you go the small garden route, there’s nothing quite like harvesting and eating veggies that you've grown! • Line your bedroom ceilings with fairy lights. Fairy lights are a colorful, twinkly way to add a touch of magic and whimsy to your bedroom. If you invest in ones with a remote, you can change colors to suit your moods while lying in bed to unwind after a long day."},{"prompt":"How many moon phases are there? And what are they called?

Modern pop music is very repetitive, one-dimensional, and shallow in both musical sophistication and lyrical content. Now, you could counter this observation and say that every generation of music gets that same critique. There's a hint of truth in that. But here are my arguments that the pop music of modern times truly does pale in comparison to the sophistication and variety offered in the 1960s through the 1980s. Those three decades introduced such bands as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, R.E.M, The Police... and a much longer list of iconic bands. The Who, Jimi Hendrix, The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac... Again, we're just scraping the surface. Not to mention all the Motown acts of classic R&B like Marvin Gaye or Al Green, and scores of similarly iconic black artists. All of these artists are on regular rotation on the radio to this day. On 'classic' stations, of course, but that's a testament to their staying power. Musicianship and lyrical content were highly respected in those eras. There were a wide variety of genres, ranging from disco to progressive rock. And people bought full albums from these artists, collections that were consistent in quality for their entirety. Today, with a few exceptions here and there, it's all about how an artist looks, not their talent. K-pop features artists who lip-sync, but none of their fans care, because it's purely about how attractive they are, and their dance moves. Electronica? People fill stadiums to watch someone twist knobs on a stage full of high-tech light shows. Some might say that I'm just an old curmudgeon. Well, that's fair enough. But let's see if artists like Drake or Rihanna or Taylor Swift are considered 'iconic' a few decades in the future."},{"prompt":"What can I do to help improve my motivation?","completion":"Oh honey, I'm so sorry you're not feeling motivated.

How do I do so? Can you make me a list that goes through some helpful steps in this process?","completion":"Good luck with your transition into freelancing! Here's some things you can do to give yourself the best chance of success 1. Figure out finances - Find out how much you typically spend each month including bills and figure out how much money you need to bring in every month to make ends meet. 2. Get a regular client - You should find a client with regular work while you're still working your day job. This client acts as a sort of retainer because you know that you can be assured to have regular work while you're with them. When you have a regular client, you can make the rest of your income from other clients. 3. Network - Get networking as soon as possible. Doing so will offer a community of support, and you may find some connections that will hire you or connect you with others who may hire you. 4. Be present online - You should have a website and be active on social media. This is something else that you can do while you're at your other job. 5. Make an elevator pitch - Ask yourself exactly what you want to bring to the table, and make this clear on your website site. If you provide more than one service, you should have a main service and work every other one around that main one. People will more likely hire you if they know what you can do for them. 6. Take on as much work as possible - You'll know when you reach the point that it's time to move to freelance. When you want to move forward, you should do everything you can to work on your freelancing. 7. Don't wait to be ready - The truth is, you'll likely not ever feel quite ready. But don't jump into freelancing too fast. Make sure your foundation is set, and then you can shift to freelancing as your career."},{"prompt":"My bathroom sink is plugged.

Pulling himself back up to a standing position and checking to make sure that no one saw his temporary cowardice, the young man slowly crept up on the glow, a small voice in the back of his mind worrying at him about radiation and Marie Curie. Instead, what looked like a square plastic (or maybe ceramic? or steel?) container sat in the remains of the mailbox, nearly cracked in two, the green light spilling out. \\"If it's radioactive, then I'm already boned,\\" he mused, ignoring the nagging, fearful voice of \\"reason.\\" A small green ring. Neat. Like one of those Green Lantern ones. Is it a Power Ring? \\"There's no way. Literally no way,\\" he thought, followed by, \\"Stop saying literally all the time.

Can you give me five tips to become a better YouTuber?

Video editing is one of your special skills, which means you shouldn't hide it. Make your videos flashy, fresh, and fun. Along with that, incorporating more editing will give you a personal style. People will start to recognize your videos based on the editing style. When this happens, you'll become more popular. 2) Post your films on YouTube. Film is one of your special skills, meaning you should make films, if you haven't already, and post them on YouTube. Short films with good editing, two of your skills, can get good views on YouTube. Along with that, you're building a film portfolio. 3) Try video essays. Video essays are right up your alley since your skills include writing and editing. Those two skills allow you to create engaging video essays. Your watch time will increase, meaning your videos will get recommended more. Along with that, viewers love it when creators put a lot of effort into their videos. Considering video essays take a long time, trying that genre can result in a lot of love. 4) Make a podcast. Humor and writing are two essentials for podcasts. Make a podcast and post it on YouTube. As long as you incorporate good humor and talk about interesting topics, your podcast could take off and make you a popular YouTuber. 5) Post gaming highlights. If you game often, you should consider recording it and posting the highlights on YouTube. These highlights are easy to make, and posting them can't hurt. You don't have to do a lot of editing to create these videos; however, if you want to incorporate your other skill, editing, you can.

Marinate your chicken: Place your chicken, buttermilk, pickle juice, and half of all spices in a bag or container and allow it to sit for at least 1 hour. 2. Once your chicken has marinated, preheat your oil to 375 degrees. The reason for this is that the temperature of the oil will drop once the cool chicken is added to it. Making it slightly hotter than 350 degrees will ensure your chicken's breading comes out crunchy. 3. Mix the remaining seasonings with your flour in a plastic bag or container. 4. Coat the chicken tenders in the seasoned flour. 5. Place chicken in the oil and fry until golden brown. Helpful Tip (Once the chicken tenders float, they are cooked through. Avoid overcooking so your chicken will remain juicy.) 6. Once your last batch of tenders is frying, start preparing your sauce by combining the honey, buffalo sauce, and butter in a small saucepan. 7. Cook over medium heat until it starts to bubble and thicken. Once the desired consistency is achieved remove from the heat. 8. Toss your chicken tenders in the hot honey sauce for more even distribution. You may also pour the sauce over the tenders or dip them if you prefer less sauce. 9.

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a donut pan with coconut oil or non-stick spray. 2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined. 3. In a separate bowl, combine the almond milk, melted coconut oil, apple cider vinegar, and vanilla extract. Stir well. 4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.

This damage is from sliding off the road,” the officer said. The weight on her shoulders eased, replaced by relief.

It speaks of shattered dreams and a broken heart, Of love that's lost, tearing worlds apart. In the moonlit night, a lone voice sings, Echoes of pain, to which the soul clings. With each melancholic note, the tale unfolds, A story of love's demise, forever untold. Verse by verse, the lyrics pierce through the air, Weaving a tapestry of despair and despair. The singer's voice trembles with every word, As the saddest melody the world has ever heard. It tells of a love that once burned bright, Two souls entwined, a dazzling sight. But fate intervened, and their paths did sever, Leaving hearts wounded, shattered forever. The chorus rises, carrying a weight of sorrow, Emotions raw, with no hope for tomorrow. The melody weeps, as memories replay, Of a love that faltered and slowly decayed. Each verse reveals the pain that remains, A bittersweet symphony, a heartache that sustains. A story of loss, of love's cruel twist, A sad song that etches wounds that persist. And as the final notes linger in the air, A cathartic release, a shared despair. For in sadness, we find solace, somehow, Through the saddest songs, we heal, for now.

Here is an instruction manual on how to train like Bruce Lee: Weight training - Bruce Lee was a proponent of circuit resistance training, which involved doing circuits of exercises using weights. A sample circuit would consist of exercises that work out the entire body. For example, bench press, bicep curl, military press, squat, bent-over barbell row, and tricep extension using a weight about 60% of one's max 10 times per exercise, without rest, until all exercises have been completed would be considered a single circuit. Doing several circuits works muscles to build endurance, and also taxes the respiratory and circulatory systems. Aerobic training - Bruce Lee loved his stationary bike; it allowed him to get an aerobic (at least 20 minutes of repetitive, low-impact exercise) workout while watching television or reading a book. If he was not using his stationary bike, he would go for a run of between 2-6 miles, with the runs changing the speeds and tempos during the duration. Skill training - Of course, as Bruce Lee would say, learning to fight from a book was like dry-land swimming; one needs to practice the skills that will be used in a fight. These skills mainly consisted of punching and kicking. The following is a list of skills that Bruce Lee practiced when developing his martial art of Jeet Kune Do: lead punch; uppercut; back fist; cross; hook; straight blast; front kick; crescent kick; roundhouse; front thrusting kick; instep kick; side kick; shuffling side kick; thrusting side kick. These are just a few of the techniques used by Bruce Lee, but while Jeet Kune Do teaches one to use any weapon that is appropriate for the situation, the simplest techniques are usually the best."},{"prompt":"Write a freeform poem about a jazz lounge.","completion":"Smoke fills the velvet room and, Although it's noon, You would never know. Brass and wood fire up, In a way you can't describe, Unless you've heard the tap, Tap, Tap, of the rhythm in your bones.

When did it happen and why? What was the effect of the Mariel boatlift?","completion":"The Mariel boatlift was a mass emigration of Cubans who traveled from Cuba's Mariel Harbor to the United States between 15 April and 31 October 1980. The Cuban government organized acts of repudiation against those who wished to leave the island. Mobs would sometimes beat their targets, force them to walk around with accusatory signs on their necks or trash their homes. Castro, trying to stop the unrest, opened the port of Mariel, west of Havana, to any residents who wanted to leave. The Cuban government facilitated an emigration process that gave special privileges to those who were socially undesirable. People deemed \\"homosexual\\" would be allowed to leave the country. Those with gender non-conforming behavior were especially targeted by authorities for departure. From April until October, some 125,000 Cuban immigrants crossed the Florida Straits to the United States. The Mariel immigrants increased the Miami labor force by 7%, and the percentage increase in labor supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was even greater because most of the immigrants were relatively unskilled."},{"prompt":"Who are the teen characters in The Breakfast Club?","completion":"The teen characters that appeared in \\"The Breakfast Club\\" were: 1.

This will be the longest trip they’ve ever taken without access to internet based tech/entertainment. What kinds of activities should we plan to keep them busy? I’m looking for anything from board games to outdoor excursions. We’ll be in the Sierras in California, and the kids are 11 and 13 years old.","completion":"That sounds like fun! Here are some activities that can help to keep your kids entertained while camping: -Reading: Encourage the kids to bring 2 or 3 books each. They may be surprised at how quickly they’ll get through them without any tech-based distractions. -Writing: Nature is full of inspiration. Have your kids bring some journals and writing utensils so they can jot down diary entries, poems, short stories, or anything else they want to write. -Games: Even if you’re planning lots of wilderness adventures, it’s a good idea to bring games in case of inclement weather. Bring some fun multiplayer board games, and a deck of cards in case anyone wants to play solitaire. -Arts and crafts: This will be a great time to experiment with arts and crafts such as watercolor painting, wood carving, knitting, embroidery, sculpting, wood burning/etching, and more. Your kids could also try their hands at some extra messy projects like tie-dye, making goo from scratch, paper mache, or splatter painting a la Jackson Pollock since you won't have to worry about making a mess inside your home. -Puzzles: Bring a book of crosswords or sudoku puzzles, and maybe a jigsaw puzzle that the whole family can work on together. -Play music: Camping provides a great opportunity to practice playing acoustic instruments such as the guitar, ukulele, hand drums, flute, or fiddle. -Sports: Bring a soccer ball, basketball, football, or tennis ball and racket so the kids can play together and exhaust themselves with some exercise. -Hiking: Trail hiking makes a fun family excursion. -Boating: There are several bodies of water in the Sierra Mountains. If you own a boat, you can bring it with you, or you may be able to rent one just for the trip. You could canoe, kayak, or use a motorized boat. Have the kids bring bathing suits, too, in case the water's warm enough for a swim. -Biking: Like hiking, this is a great way to explore the area, but you’ll be able to cover a lot more ground in a shorter amount of time on wheels than you could on foot. -Star gazing: Bring a book of star maps and/or a telescope and spend the evenings searching for constellations and shooting stars. -Campfire rituals: Replace the habit of zoning out in front of the tv after dinner with a nightly campfire ritual. You can cook dinner over the fire, make s’mores together, and take turns telling ghost stories, or opt for family stories if your kids don’t enjoy being scared."},{"prompt":"What is the tone of the text provided?

While there are more than three groups, let's discuss three of them: Sporting, Working, and Toy groups. -Sporting dogs include breeds such as Retrievers, Spaniels, Pointers, and Setters. These dogs were historically bred for hunting and other field activities. They are known for their superior instincts in water and woods, and many of these breeds enjoy hunting, swimming, and retrieving games. They are generally very active and fun-loving animals, requiring regular, invigorating exercise. -Working dogs comprise breeds like Boxers, Siberian Huskies, Saint Bernards, and Great Danes. They were originally bred to perform jobs such as guarding property, pulling sleds, and performing water rescues. This group is known for their intelligence and versatility. Due to their size and strength, early training and socialization are essential to manage these breeds effectively. -The Toy group, as the name suggests, contains the smallest breeds of dogs such as Chihuahuas, Pomeranians, and Yorkshire Terriers. Despite their small size, these dogs were bred for various reasons, ranging from companionship to vermin hunting. They are well-suited to apartment living and make excellent companion pets. While they may require less exercise than larger breeds, they are often full of energy and personality."},{"prompt":"Tell me a joke about a porcupine.","completion":"What do you call a porcupine's backbone?

He created ballets for other notable dance companies including the American Ballet Theater, the Paris Opera Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet, among others. At the helm of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater (AAADT), Ailey concealed his sexuality but used his art as an outlet for it. He choreographed ballets for AAADT dancers that juxtaposed same-sex partnering with religious and sometime hypermasculine archetypes. Ailey succumbed to AIDS-related complications in 1989 at age 58.
