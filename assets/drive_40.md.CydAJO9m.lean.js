One lazy Sunday afternoon, she accidentally stumbles upon her eccentric neighbor, Kern, while trying to retrieve a package that was mistakenly delivered to his door. Valentine is intrigued by Kern's odd behavior and quirky mannerisms. As a short story writer struggling with writer's block, she gets an idea to use Kern as the inspiration for a new story, so she occasionally tries to meet him under various pretexts. Valentine starts noticing that Kern spends most of his time inside his apartment with the window blinds down and the lights dimmed. This piques her curiosity, and she starts wondering what Kern does in his apartment all day. One day, Valentine's best friend, Marla, comes over for a visit, and they notice Kern secretly fumbling with a pair of binoculars. Convinced that he's spying on his neighbors, and driven by a growing sense of paranoia, Marla convinces Valentine to gather more evidence so they can report him to the police. Valentine, against her better judgement, hesitantly agrees and starts putting together a log of Kern's suspicious activities. Over time, Valentine begins to see past Kern's eccentric exterior and starts to notice his quirky charm. She starts wondering if she's falling for the crazy neighbor she's supposed to be gathering evidence against. As the two neighbors slowly become friends, Valentine learns the truth behind Kern's spying - he is a private investigator hired to observe and protect an undercover agent posing as a tenant in the building. This agent is working to expose a criminal operation that has been using the apartment building as a front for illegal activities. Upon learning Kern's true intentions, Valentine is relieved and excited by the unexpected twist in Kern's story. She decides to work with Kern and use her writing skills to help solve the case, all the while turning this into the perfect plot for her next short story.

Diana Scott is a beautiful, bored young model married to Tony Bridges. One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the predatory males of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the \\"Glass Corporation\\" who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him. The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous, but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely. Diana attends a high-class charity draw for world hunger for which she is the face.

Tertiary education, also known as post-secondary education or higher education, refers to the academic pursuits that a person undertakes after completing their secondary education or high school. Graduating from high school is a prerequisite for entering any form of tertiary education, which is why it is the best answer to this question. Let's break down each of the options to explain why \\"graduate from high school\\" is the most appropriate answer: 1. Catch cold - This option is not related to the context of the question. Catching a cold is an illness caused by a viral infection, and it doesn't have any direct connection to preparing or entering tertiary education. 2. Feel lonely - While some students transitioning from secondary to tertiary education may experience feelings of loneliness, this option does not represent a step that a person needs to take before entering tertiary education. Emotional well-being is essential during this phase, but it is not an action one must necessarily complete before enrolling in higher education. 3. Enter college - This option is closest to the correct answer after \\"graduate from high school,\\" but it is not the best choice because entering college or university is a part of tertiary education, not something one does before entering it. A student must first complete their high school education before they can enroll in college or university programs. 4. Finish junior high - Completing junior high, or middle school, is an important phase in a person's education. However, this stage precedes secondary education (high school) rather than tertiary education (college or university). For this reason, it is not the correct answer, as graduating from high school is the step required before entering tertiary education. In conclusion, while some of the options in the question may have some relevance to education, \\"graduate from high school\\" is the most appropriate answer because it is the fundamental and essential step a person must take before they can enter tertiary or higher education.

Write a title for this article: A woman at the centre of sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump has spoken for the first time in detail about her personal experience with the billionaire tycoon who this week became the Republican nominee for president. Jill Harth, a makeup artist, has stayed quiet for almost 20 years about the way Trump pursued her, and ‚Äì according to a lawsuit she instigated ‚Äì cornered her and groped her in his daughter‚Äôs bedroom. After Trump mounted his campaign for the White House, details emerged of the 1997 complaint, in which Harth accused him of ‚Äúattempted ‚Äòrape‚Äô‚Äù. She said she was quickly inundated with interview requests from major US television networks, but resolved not to speak about the events ‚Äì until Trump publicly said in May that her claims were ‚Äúmeritless‚Äù and his daughter Ivanka gave an interview in which she said her father was ‚Äúnot a groper‚Äù. Harth, who feels she has been publicly branded a liar and believes her business has suffered because of her association with the allegations, decided to speak out about her experience with Trump because she wants an apology. In an hour-long interview at the Guardian‚Äôs New York office on Tuesday, Harth said she stands by her charges against Trump, which run from low-grade sexual harassment to an episode her lawyers described in the lawsuit as ‚Äúattempted ‚Äòrape‚Äô‚Äù. She first met Trump in December 1992 at his offices in Trump Tower, where she and her then romantic partner, George Houraney, were making a business presentation. The couple wanted to recruit Trump to back their American Dream festival, in which Harth oversaw a pin-up competition known as American Dream Calendar Girls. Harth described that meeting as ‚Äúthe highlight of our career‚Äù. But in other ways, it was something of a lowlight: Trump took an interest in Harth immediately and began subjecting her to a steady string of unwanted sexual advances, detailed by Harth in her complaint. There was the initial leering in that first December meeting in Trump Tower, and the inappropriate questions after her relationship status. It continued the next night over dinner at the Plaza Hotel‚Äôs Oak Room, where at a dinner with beauty pageant contestants she alleges he groped her under the table. It culminated in January 1993, when Harth and Houraney were visiting his Florida mansion, Mar-a-Lago, to finalize and then celebrate the beauty pageant deal with a party. After business concluded, Harth and Houraney were on tour of Mar-a-Lago along with a group of young pageant contestants ‚Äì Trump wanted to ‚Äúsee the quality of the girls he was sponsoring‚Äù, Harth recalled ‚Äì when he pulled her aside into one of the children‚Äôs bedrooms. ‚ÄúHe pushed me up against the wall, and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again,‚Äù Harth said, ‚Äúand I had to physically say: ‚ÄòWhat are you doing? Stop it.‚Äô It was a shocking thing to have him do this because he knew I was with George, he knew they were in the next room. And how could he be doing this when I‚Äôm there for business?‚Äù Speaking as Republicans gathered in Cleveland to formally declare Trump as the party‚Äôs candidate in the November general election, Harth said she had been very reluctant to talk after the sexual assault allegations resurfaced, ‚Äúbecause honestly, it was painful for me to have to do it again. It was stressful, it gave me anxiety, it definitely wounded my marriage ‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt the death knell, but it wounded it, it was stressful having to handle this.‚Äù She recalled how Trump ‚Äì who had just gone through a divorce from his first wife, Ivana, and was in a relationship with Marla Maples, who would become his second wife ‚Äì pursued her and urged her to leave Houraney. ‚ÄúTrump did everything in his power to get me to leave him. He constantly called me and said: ‚ÄòI love you, baby, I‚Äôm going to be the best lover you ever had. What are you doing with that loser, you need to be with me, you need to step it up to the big leagues.‚Äô ‚ÄúHe was constantly working on me during that time and that took a toll on me. But I moved on. I‚Äôm a forgiving type person, OK? I‚Äôm a Christian, I moved on.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs decision to run for president brought the question to the fore for her once more. And initially, she said she was inclined to let bygones be bygones. She concedes she even found herself getting excited at the thought that someone she knew so well was running for president. A recent Trump rally she attended seemed to confirm her decision to lie low. ‚Äú‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry about it,‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not going to say anything bad, we‚Äôve moved on, we‚Äôre friendly,‚Äô‚Äù Harth recalled in her interview with the Guardian. When Trump thanked her and gave her a hug, she thought he wouldn‚Äôt say anything either. The interaction, Harth said, reaffirmed her decision to stay quiet. That is, until she saw Trump dismiss media reports referencing her case as ‚Äúmeritless‚Äù, or worse. After the New York Times ran a story in May this year about Trump‚Äôs history with women, including an account of Harth‚Äôs story, Trump‚Äôs campaign even reached out to her to pressure her to take back her account, she told the Guardian on Tuesday. ‚ÄúHis office ‚Äì and I have it on my voicemails that he called, that they called ‚Äì they asked me to recant everything when the New York Times article came out. They were trying to get me to say it never happened and I made it up. And I said I‚Äôm not doing that,‚Äù she recalled. Trump‚Äôs office denied this. She was further upset by an interview Trump‚Äôs daughter Ivanka gave in the wake of the New York Times article saying her dad is ‚Äúnot a groper‚Äù. Nobody was defending me, that's why I'm talking ‚Ä¶ I went through hell and I still have to relive this again ‚ÄúI understand that the girl wanted to defend her dad, being it‚Äôs her dad,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut what did she know? She was 10 years old! She was 10 years old at the time. She didn‚Äôt know what her father was about, what he was doing, how he was acting.‚Äù Such statements felt defamatory to Harth, adding insult to injury. That‚Äôs when she hired attorney Lisa Bloom to demand that Trump retract his statements that are, as Bloom put it, ‚Äúeffectively calling her a liar‚Äù. ‚ÄúJill is very clear that she is not a liar,‚Äù Bloom said. ‚ÄúAnd her reputation is important to her. And her living a life free of this kind of stress is important to her. So we‚Äôre calling on not only Mr Trump, Ivanka Trump, too.‚Äù The renewed controversy comes as Trump prepares to give his keynote speech in Cleveland on Thursday. It also comes as Roger Ailes, the chairman and CEO of Trump-friendly Fox News, is in the process of being ousted following a sexual harassment suit filed by a former anchor. When Trump‚Äôs office was asked to respond to Harth‚Äôs allegations, they highlighted her inconsistency about her views on Trump, forwarding emails from 2015 and as recently as January 2016 in which she expressed friendly feelings about Trump and even asked about a job helping to do his campaign trail makeup. As Harth wrote in an August 2015 email forwarded by Trump‚Äôs campaign: ‚ÄúI also would like to show my support for Donald and his campaign. I am offering my services to do his grooming and getting him perfectly camera ready for photos and Hi-Definition TV. He knows better than anybody how important image is.‚Äù In another email from October 2015, she praised Trump for ‚Äúdoing a tremendous job of shaking things up in the United States‚Äù and added: ‚ÄúI am definitely Team Trump!‚Äù Harth said those emails were written months before Trump called her integrity into question. She also defended her action, as a businesswoman who has never been too proud to look for help where she needs it, even if it smacks of opportunism. Meanwhile the fact that Trump has an army of staffers and family defending him is part of what inspired her to speak out, she said. ‚ÄúNobody was defending me, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm talking,‚Äù Harth said. ‚ÄúYou can believe it or not, but I went through hell and I still have to relive this again. And I just, I‚Äôm horrified that I have to think about this again.‚Äù Michael Cohen, executive vice-president and special counsel to Donald Trump, responded by email to a Guardian request for comment, saying: ‚ÄúIt is disheartening that one has to dignify a response to the below absurd query. Mr Trump denies each and every statement made by Ms Harth as these 24-year-old allegations lack any merit or veracity. ‚ÄúHope [Mr Trump‚Äôs spokeswoman Hope Hicks] will forward to you under separate e-mail, a series of e-mails documenting Ms Harth‚Äôs support of Mr Trump, the race for the White House as well as seeking a job opportunity with the campaign.‚Äù In an earlier phone call, Cohen said Harth had ‚Äúmassive credibility issues‚Äù. Speaking in Cleveland at the Republican national convention on Wednesday, Roger Stone, a veteran strategist and longtime Trump adviser, dismissed the allegations, saying: ‚ÄúI have an excellent bullshit detector.‚Äù Stone added: ‚ÄúA verbal agreement is entirely unprovable ‚Ä¶ So it‚Äôs more he said, she said. Sure sounds like bullshit to me.‚Äù Such responses from the Trump camp aren‚Äôt new and neither is the lawsuit, which Harth brought forward in 1997. She dropped it weeks later after Trump settled an outstanding business lawsuit from her partner Houraney claiming he broke contract by backing out of the American Dream festival. (Houraney sued for 5m but settled with Trump for a smaller, undisclosed amount.) Houraney met Harth when she was still in high school and though he didn‚Äôt witness any of the alleged incidents with Trump, aside from that first meeting in Trump Tower, Houraney has never doubted her. ‚ÄúI know they‚Äôre all true,‚Äù he said of the allegations. ‚ÄúI knew her way too long to think she could make up stuff like that, It wasn‚Äôt in her. She wasn‚Äôt capable of making up the things she said in that thing.‚Äù Harth told the Guardian she expected very little from Trump. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to get an apology from him.

Movie plot title: Blackadder's Christmas Carol Movie plot: In a small Moustache Shop in England, resides Ebenezer Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), and his assistant, Mr Baldrick (Tony Robinson). Ebenezer is one of the nicest men there ever was, generous and giving to a fault (so generous that the majority of his profits are given away to charities).On Christmas Eve, Ebenezer is visited by the Spirit of Christmas (Robbie Coltrane), who just happens to have accidentally stopped by Blackadder's place by mistake. Even so, Ebenezer offers him some respite from his busy evening of helping miser's to change their ways. The Spirit tells that Ebenezer is ok, but in his past, there are other Blackadders who are quite miserly. Curious, Ebenezer asks to know more, and the Spirit goes into several flashbacks.The first vision shows how Lord Blackadder managed to con his way into great fortune and entitlement by tricking Queen Elizabeth (Miranda Richardson) into executing Lord Melchett (Stephen Fry).The second vision shows Edmund Blackadder tricking Prince Regent (Hugh Laurie) into giving up his valuable worldly goods to the poor.These visions intrigue Ebenezer, and he also wishes to see the future. However, the Spirit shows him two futures: if he becomes bad, his future descendant will become ruler of the Universe. If he stays good, he'll become the slave to the future descendant of Mr Baldrick.The Spirit of Christmas then attempts to leave, hoping that none of what Ebenezer has seen will cause him to stray from the side of good. Ebenezer claims he won't, and the Spirit departs.The next day however, it becomes apparent that Ebenezer has lied. Every single person he encountered the previous day shows up for hand-outs or to take advantage of him, but Ebenezer is crass, rude, and ill-tempered towards almost every single one of them, including Baldrick.Two strangers soon come to call, but Ebenezer tells Baldrick to have them go away.

Given the question: Given the following context: In recent years, several other craters of around the same age as Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20¬∞N and 70¬∞N. Examples include the disputed Silverpit crater in the North Sea, and the Boltysh crater in Ukraine. Both are much smaller than Chicxulub, but are likely to have been caused by objects many tens of meters across striking the Earth. This has led to the hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time. Another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger Shiva crater, though the structure's status as an impact crater is contested.The collision of Comet Shoemaker‚ÄìLevy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, giving rise to many impacts over a period of a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past. This scenario may have occurred on Earth at the end of the Cretaceous, though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 years apart.In late 2006, Ken MacLeod, a geology professor from the University of Missouri, completed an analysis of sediment below the ocean's surface, bolstering the single-impact theory. MacLeod conducted his analysis approximately 4,500 kilometres (2,800 mi) from the Chicxulub crater to control for possible changes in soil composition at the impact site, while still close enough to be affected by the impact. The analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment, which indicated there was only one impact. Multiple-impact proponents such as Gerta Keller regard the results as \\"rather hyper-inflated\\" and do not agree with the conclusion of MacLeod's analysis, arguing that there might only be gaps of hours to days between impacts in a multiple-impact scenario (cf. Shoemaker-Levy 9) which would not leave a detectable gap in deposits. answer the following question: What was the full name of the person whose analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment?

Toiling to defuse deadly improvised explosive devices on the Afghan frontline, siblings Kim and Lee Hughes really are brothers in arms. Kim, 34, is Britain‚Äôs bravest bomb hunter. The warrant officer was awarded the George Cross - the highest accolade for gallantry not in the face of the enemy - for heroism on the battlefield in 2009. He has returned to the warzone to oversee the Army units clearing the homemade bombs strewn across Helmand. Brothers in arms: Staff Sergeant Lee Hughes, left, and his younger brother, Warrant Officer Kim Hughes, serve together with 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment, defusing improvised bombs in Afghanistan. No sibling rivalry: But Kim Hughes, who won the George Cross, admitted: 'I loved bossing him around' It is a family affair because the team which thwarts the Taliban‚Äôs terror tactics includes his big brother Lee, 35, a staff sergeant. Both soldiers insist there is no sibling rivalry ‚Äì even though Kim, a married father-of-one, is the commander. Warrant Officer Class One Hughes said: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs sound that we‚Äôre able to be out here together. We have a good time. Family affair: The men's step-brother Matthew Heppenstall, 27, is about to join the regiment too. 'Lee is my brother, but he‚Äôs also a mega operator. I‚Äôve got no issues whatsoever with his capability. ‚ÄòThe professional answer is every one of my solders is exactly the same and they are treated exactly the same. My answer is he‚Äôs my big brother, and I love bossing him around.‚Äô S/Sgt Hughes, a married father-of-three, said: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm the less brave big brother. You look round the dinner table ‚Äì there‚Äôs only one with a George Cross. ‚ÄòBut it‚Äôs not too bad working for him. There is a mutual understanding but there‚Äôs still the rank structure.‚Äô Both men serve with 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Regiment, part of the Royal Logistics Corps, but on this tour of duty they are attached to the Royal Engineers. WO1 Hughes won his George Cross for what was hailed by top brass as ‚Äòthe single most outstanding act of explosive ordnance disposal ever recorded in Afghanistan‚Äô. On the morning of August 16 2009, British troops were taking part in a mission to reclaim a chunk of Sangin, a Taliban stronghold in Helmand. Disaster struck when Lance Corporal James Fullarton, 24, triggered a bomb. As he was evacuated on a stretcher by Fusilier Simon Annis, 22, and Fusilier Lewis Carter, 18, they tripped a second blast - killing them both and wounding three more. WO1 Hughes was called on to rescue the four maimed soldiers who were stranded in the middle of a minefield. Without a thought for his own safety, the bomb disposal expert cleared a path across the dusty open ground so the wounded could be evacuated and the dead men retrieved. Shunning protective clothing to save time, he picked his way across the field dotted with more of the booby-trap bombs. Keeping his cool beneath the Afghan sun and with the sound of bullets ringing in his ears, WO1 Hughes managed to dismantle seven IEDs - three by simply using his hands. Lee Hughes, left, admitted it was nerve-wracking to be in a room where only one man had a George Cross. Honour: Kim Hughes, now a Warrant Officer Class One, was awarded the George Cross at Buckingham Palace for a mission in which he disarmed seven improvised bombs to save colleagues without safety clothes. His 'utterly selfless action' allowed the casualties to be recovered. Tragically, L/Cpl Fullarton later died from his injuries. In total, WO1 Hughes cleared more than 80 buried bombs on that tour of duty. Five years later, he is in the operations room co-ordinating missions while his brother goes out on the ground. They have trained the Afghan National Security Forces to disarm IEDs. WO1 Hughes said: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs different because I‚Äôm not out on the ground and Lee is one of the operators ‚Äì he‚Äôs doing the job when I was back out here. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a lot quieter now. Because of the amount of training we have given the Afghan forces they run their own EOD teams now. ‚ÄòThey have taken the majority of the work but we still provide capability when it‚Äôs requested and needed. ‚ÄòIt does give you a sense of satisfaction to know we are leaving this country absolutely prepared to deal with the task in front of them.' Star soldier: Kim Hughes in 2009, before he received his George Cross, speaking to the then Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth and Home Secretary Alan Johnson (centre) in Camp Bastion. Right, part of the men's uniform. Mum's the word: The men admitted their mother Francis, 54, has had a 'few years' of worrying about them. S/Sgt Hughes, who is on his third deployment to Afghanistan, has seen action during his stint in the warzone. On one occasion, he was 1ft from a booby-trap bomb which was protecting an insurgent ammunition dump. He was inspired to become a bomb disposal expert after his brother signed up. He said: ‚ÄòI spent eight years in the artillery and knew nothing about the job until Kim joined the Army and showed an interest in it.‚Äô Both men admit their trade worries their mother Francis, 54. And their step-brother Matthew Heppenstall, 27, is about to join 11 EOD Regiment too. S/Sgt Hughes said: ‚ÄòWhen Kim was in Afghanistan and I was in Iraq she was worried and then I came back and I went to Afghanistan and came back and now we‚Äôre both here. 'She‚Äôs had a few years of it.‚Äô Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"In this article, we learn about the remarkable story of brothers Kim and Lee Hughes who serve together in the 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Regiment, defusing improvised bombs in Afghanistan.

Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Melted rock inside the Earth is also called molten rock, or magma - Magma moves up through Earth&#x27;s crust, but it does not always reach the surface - When magma erupts onto Earth&#x27;s surface, it is known as lava - As lava flows from volcanoes it starts to cool - Minerals form when magma and lava cool - Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of the process is the generation and accumulation of magma within the Earth's mantle and crust. This process involves the following sub-steps: 1. Formation of magma: Magma is formed through several geological processes, such as mantle convection, subduction of tectonic plates, and partial melting of rock materials. The Earth's mantle is composed of solid and semi-solid rock material under immense pressure and temperature. When the heat from Earth's core is transferred towards the mantle, the mantle material undergoes convection, a process in which the hotter and less dense rock material rises, while the colder and denser material sinks. This continuous motion creates a series of convection cells within the mantle. 2. Subduction and melting of tectonic plates: Earth's crust is composed of a series of tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. When two plates collide, one plate can be forced, or subducted, beneath the other. As the subducting plate descends into the mantle, it carries water and other sediment materials, which lower the melting point of the surrounding mantle rock. The result is the formation of magma through a process known as partial melting. 3. Accumulation of magma in magma chambers: Once magma has formed, it begins to rise through the Earth's crust due to its lower density compared to the surrounding solid rock. As it rises, it accumulates in magma chambers, which are pockets or reservoirs of molten rock within the Earth's crust. The size and location of these magma chambers can vary, depending on factors such as the local tectonic setting, the availability of pathways through the crust, and the type and volume of magma being produced. Once magma has accumulated in these chambers, the process outlined in the initial question begins, with magma moving up through the Earth's crust, either erupting as lava on the surface or cooling and crystallizing underground before reaching the surface."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The portrait, painted around 1590 by an unknown artist, celebrates the British navy‚Äôs unlikely 1588 victory over the Spanish fleet and is a staple in Britain‚Äôs school textbooks. Unusual in its time for its large size and horizontal format, it depicts the queen, bejeweled and regal in front of two seascapes, her right hand resting on a globe. The painting in question, one of three versions of the portrait, was first owned by Sir Francis Drake, one of the commanders of the British fleet, and subsequently remained in the hands of his descendants, who recently decided to sell the work. The money resulting from the public appeal ‚Äúwill meet the cost of the painting as well as vital conservation and an extensive national programme to engage audiences around the country with the painting,‚Äù a spokeswoman for the Art Fund, Madeline Adeane, said in an email. It will also prevent the portrait from being sold to an international collector. A major donation of ¬£7.4 million came from the Heritage Lottery Fund, while 8,000 individuals contributed a total of ¬£1.5 million. The Art Fund contributed ¬£1 million and Royal Museums Greenwich gave ¬£400,000. A total of ¬£10.3 million was raised. Starting Oct. 11, the portrait will hang in the Queen‚Äôs House, on the site of the original Greenwich Palace, where Elizabeth I was born.

Question: who is the indonesian nurse? Movie title: Soegija Movie plot: Though raising the universal aspect of humanity rather than emphasize the religious aspects, this film is about Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) first indigenous bishop: Monsignor Albertus Soegijapranata SJ, from his inauguration until the end of Indonesia's independence war (1940√¢¬Ä¬ì1949). This turbulent decade marked by the end of 350 years of Dutch occupation, entry and commencement of Japanese occupation of Indonesia, the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, and the return of the Netherlands who tried to get Indonesia back as part of their Dutch Empire, which led to the Indonesian National Revolution. Soegija wrote all these events in his diary reflections, and also its participation in relieving the suffering of people in the midst of the chaos of war. He tried to play a role at all levels, local politics, national and international. (For his participation, President Sukarno awarded him with the title of National Hero of Indonesia.)

Sentence 2: That is the whole problem. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Here's why: 1. Both sentences have fundamentally the same meaning. They are expressing the same idea that a particular issue or matter is the totality of a problem. 2. \\"Entailment\\" in a linguistic context often means that the truth of one statement (the entailed) can be assured from the truth of another (the entailer). 3. When the first sentence \\"It is the entire problem\\" is considered true, the meaning expressed is that the entirety of the problem lies within \\"it\\". This should correspond with the affirmation of the second sentence \\"That is the whole problem\\", which conveys the similar meaning that the whole problem is contained within \\"that\\". 4. The use of \\"it\\" and \\"that\\" in these sentences may potentially refer to the same problem, so we accept that \\"that\\" in the second sentence is being used in reference to what \\"it\\" is in the first sentence. 5. As for words \\"entire\\" in the first sentence and \\"whole\\" in the second sentence, they are synonyms. Both words carry the meaning of \\"the complete or full thing\\", contributing to the evidence that the sentences are entailing each other.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: How many species of fish are in the river that's main stem is 187 miles long and its tributaries? from the following article ? The Willamette River ( (listen) wil-AM-it) is a major tributary of the Columbia River, accounting for 12 to 15 percent of the Columbia's flow. The Willamette's main stem is 187 miles (301 km) long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state's largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia. Originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well. Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21st century, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges. Since 1900, more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in the Willamette's drainage basin, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).

Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains stated that solos should be to serve the song, rather than to show off a guitarist's technical skill. In place of the strutting guitar heroes of metal, grunge had \\"guitar anti-heroes\\" like Cobain, who showed little interest in mastering the instrument.In Will Byers' article \\"Grunge committed a crime against music‚Äîit killed the guitar solo\\", in The Guardian, he states that while the guitar solo managed to survive through the punk rock era, it was weakened by grunge. He states that when Kurt Cobain played guitar solos that were a restatement of the main vocal melody, fans realized that they did not need to be a Jimi Hendrix-level virtuoso to play the instrument; he says this approach helped to make music feel accessible by fans in a way not seen since the 1960s folk music movement. The producer of Nirvana's Nevermind, Butch Vig, stated that this album and Nirvana \\"killed the guitar solo\\". Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil stated he feels in part to be responsible for the \\"death of the guitar solo\\"; he said that his punk rocker aspects made him feel that he did not want to solo, so in the 1980s, he preferred to make noise and do feedback during the guitar solo.

Information: - A court painter was an artist who painted for the members of a royal or noble family, sometimes on a fixed salary and on an exclusive basis where the artist was not supposed to undertake other work. Especially in the late Middle Ages, they were often given the office of valet de chambre. Usually they were given a salary and formal title, and often a pension for life, though arrangements were highly variable. For the artist, a court appointment had the advantage of freeing them from the restriction of local painters' guilds, although in the Middle Ages and Renaissance they also often had to spend large amounts of time doing decorative work about the palace, and creating temporary works for court entertainments and displays. In England the role of Serjeant Painter was set up for this, leaving the \\"King's painter\\" (and the queen's) free to paint mostly portraits. See category of \\"Italian art collectors\\" for lists that included non-aristocratic patrons. Some artists, like Jan van Eyck or Diego Vel√°zquez, were used in other capacities at court, as diplomats, functionaries, or administrators. - The Northern Renaissance was the Renaissance that occurred in Europe north of the Alps. Before 1497, Italian Renaissance humanism had little influence outside Italy. From the late 15th century, its ideas spread around Europe. This influenced the German Renaissance, French Renaissance, English Renaissance, Renaissance in the Low Countries, Polish Renaissance and other national and localized movements, each with different characteristics and strengths. - Lucas Cranach the Younger (\\"Lucas Cranach der J√ºngere\\"; 4 October 1515 25 January 1586) was a German Renaissance painter and portraitist, also known as the son of Lucas Cranach the Elder. - Matthias Gr√ºnewald ( 31 August 1528) was a German Renaissance painter of religious works who ignored Renaissance classicism to continue the style of late medieval Central European art into the 16th century. His first name is also given as Mathis and his surname as Gothart or Neithardt. Only ten paintingsseveral consisting of many panelsand thirty-five drawings survive, all religious, although many others were lost at sea in the Baltic on their way to Sweden as war booty. His reputation was obscured until the late nineteenth century, and many of his paintings were attributed to Albrecht D√ºrer, who is now seen as his stylistic antithesis. His largest and most famous work is the Isenheim Altarpiece created 1506 to 1515 or perhaps 1512 to 1516. - The German Renaissance, part of the Northern Renaissance, was a cultural and artistic movement that spread among German thinkers in the 15th and 16th centuries, which developed from the Italian Renaissance. Many areas of the arts and sciences were influenced, notably by the spread of Renaissance humanism to the various German states and principalities. There were many advances made in the fields of architecture, the arts, and the sciences. Germany produced two developments that were to dominate the 16th century all over Europe: printing and the Protestant Reformation. - Lucas Cranach the Elder (\\"Lucas Cranach der √Ñltere\\" , c. 1472 16 October 1553) was a German Renaissance painter and printmaker in woodcut and engraving. He was court painter to the Electors of Saxony for most of his career, and is known for his portraits, both of German princes and those of the leaders of the Protestant Reformation, whose cause he embraced with enthusiasm, becoming a close friend of Martin Luther. He also painted religious subjects, first in the Catholic tradition, and later trying to find new ways of conveying Lutheran religious concerns in art. He continued throughout his career to paint nude subjects drawn from mythology and religion. He had a large workshop and many works exist in different versions; his son Lucas Cranach the Younger, and others, continued to create versions of his father's works for decades after his death. Lucas Cranach the Elder has been considered the most successful German artist of his time. - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age. - Albrecht Altdorfer ( c. 1480 -- February 12 , 1538 ) was a German painter , engraver and architect of the Renaissance working in Regensburg . Along with Lucas Cranach the Elder and Wolf Huber he is regarded to be the main representative of the so - called Danube School setting biblical and historical subjects against landscape backgrounds of expressive colours . As an artist also making small intricate engravings he is seen to belong to the Nuremberg Little Masters . - The Danube School or Donau School (German: \\"Donauschule\\" or \\"Donaustil\\") was a circle of painters of the first third of the 16th century in Bavaria and Austria (mainly along the Danube valley). Many also were innovative printmakers, usually in etching. They were among the first painters to regularly use pure landscape painting, and their figures, influenced by Matthias Gr√ºnewald, are often highly expressive, if not expressionist. They show little Italian influence, and also represent a decisive break with the high finish of Northern Renaissance painting, using a more painterly style that was in many ways ahead of its time. Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'movement' with the subject 'albrecht altdorfer'.

They have been indicted on separate gun charges and pleaded not guilty.","completion":"Title: St. Louis' Gateway Arch Bombing Plot Foiled, Authorities Arrest Two Suspects St. Louis' iconic Gateway Arch faced a significant threat after two individuals, Brandon Orlando Baldwin and Olajuwon Ali Davis, were arrested on Friday for allegedly plotting to bomb the landmark. The men are also accused of planning a murder plot targeting Robert McCulloch, the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney, and Tom Jackson, the Chief of Police in Ferguson. The suspects, Baldwin and Davis, caught the attention of the authorities, leading to their arrest before they could carry out their heinous plans. Their targets were influential figures in the legal sphere, capturing not only the nation's focus but also ensuring local communities remain on high alert for potential threats. McCulloch and Jackson are prominent figures in law enforcement and have played vital roles in handling various cases throughout their careers. As such, any potential threats against them reverberate throughout their respective departments and the larger community, highlighting the critical need for vigilance in the face of potential dangers. In addition to the murder and bombing plots, Baldwin and Davis have been indicted on separate gun charges. They have pleaded not guilty to the charges, and their arrest has thwarted any immediate danger to the intended targets. However, this incident emphasizes the necessity for local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to collaborate in combatting domestic terrorism and, more broadly, the ongoing battle against criminal activity in our communities. The Gateway Arch, an iconic 630-foot structure symbolizing westward expansion, could have been the site of a devastating tragedy. Fortunately, the intervention of law enforcement authorities has ensured that this landmark remains unharmed, preserving its historical significance and the pride it elicits among St. Louis residents. In conclusion, the arrest of Baldwin and Davis underscores the crucial role law enforcement agencies play in foiling potentially devastating terrorist plots. The protection of influential individuals such as McCulloch and Jackson, as well as beloved national landmarks like the Gateway Arch, serves to remind citizens of the ongoing efforts and sacrifices made by those who work tirelessly to keep us safe from harm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was a major naval expedition launched by Spain against the French-occupied Republic of Genoa, of which the capital Genoa was being besieged by a joint Franco-Savoyard army composed of 30,000 men and 3,000 cavalry. In 1625, when the Republic of Genoa, traditionally an ally of Spain, was occupied by French troops of the Duke of Savoy, the city underwent a hard siege. It was known in Genoese governmental circles that one of the reasons why the Dutch government had offered their help to the Franco-Savoyan army was so that they could \\"hit the bank of the King of Spain\\". However, the Spanish fleet commanded by General √Ålvaro de Baz√°n, Marquis of Santa Cruz, came to the aid of Genoa and relieved the city. Returning its sovereignty to the Republic of Genoa and forcing the French to raise the siege, they consequently began a combined campaign against the Franco-Savoyan forces that had overrun the Genoese Republic one year before. The joint Franco-Piedmontese army was forced to leave Liguria and Spanish troops invaded Piedmont, thereby securing the Spanish Road.

(The party guests are played by the same actors as the Wonderland characters, and are shown as resembling them in appearance and personality, in a similar manner to the MGM version of The Wizard of Oz.

Thanks to stage fright, and constant nagging from her confident governess (Dilys Laye), Alice runs out of the house and hides herself in the woods nearby until the party has ended. However, an apple floats down from the tree and seems to hover in Alice's face. She is suddenly distracted by a human-sized White Rabbit (voiced by Richard Coombs) rushing by. Curious, Alice follows the White Rabbit, falling down his rabbit hole and ending up in Wonderland. Alice travels throughout Wonderland, meeting a large number of bizarre people and challenges.

Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What medium of communication does That Darn Cat and Miracle have in common? Answer:","completion":"That Darn Cat and Miracle are two very distinct movies in terms of their plot, genre, and target audience. That Darn Cat is a comedy-mystery film released in 1965, whereas Miracle is a sports docudrama released in 2004. However, despite their differences, these two movies share a common medium of communication that helps them engage their target audience, convey their messages, and tell their unique stories. The medium of communication that both That Darn Cat and Miracle have in common is the film medium. As movies, they rely on a combination of audio and visual elements to create a captivating and immersive experience for their viewers. These audiovisual components allow the filmmakers to effectively convey the emotions, actions, and ideas that are integral to their respective narratives. Both That Darn Cat and Miracle employ cinematography as a critical part of their storytelling process. The camera work, lighting, and composition of shots in both films are used to create dynamic and aesthetically pleasing visuals that capture the viewers' attention. For example, That Darn Cat relies on suspenseful and comedic shots to build intrigue and humor, while Miracle uses action-packed and emotional shots to highlight the intense competition and determination of the U.S. ice hockey team. Another key aspect of the film medium is the use of sound and music to enhance and emphasize the emotions and atmosphere in each scene. That Darn Cat uses a playful and lighthearted soundtrack to complement its comedic and mysterious tone, while Miracle employs an inspiring and rousing score that mirrors the team's journey towards victory. Furthermore, both films use sound effects and dialogue to create an authentic and engaging environment for the characters and the audience. The film medium's capacity to convey a wide range of emotions also helps That Darn Cat and Miracle connect with their audience on an emotional level. The actors' performances, as well as the editing and pacing of each film, contribute to their success in engaging the viewers with the story and its characters. As a result, the audience can empathize with the protagonists, understand their motivations, and ultimately invest in the outcome of the narrative. Additionally, both That Darn Cat and Miracle use the film medium to provide viewers with social, cultural, and historical context. In That Darn Cat, the 1960s setting and the characters' attire, mannerisms, and speech patterns reflect the cultural norms and values of the period. In Miracle, the story is set against the backdrop of the Cold War and helps the audience understand the significance of the U.S. hockey team's victory over the Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Olympics. The film medium's ability to visually convey context and evoke emotions aids in providing a richer and deeper understanding of the stories being told. In conclusion, the medium of communication shared by That Darn Cat and Miracle is the film medium, which employs audiovisual elements such as cinematography, sound, and music to immerse viewers in their respective narratives. The film medium's ability to blend visuals, sound, and emotions enables both movies to entertain, inspire, and inform audiences, successfully conveying their distinct stories to a wide range of viewers."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Are Aaron Hall and Dickie Peterson the same nationality?

Cliff and Laurie Henderson and their daughter, Jill, are relocating to Tokyo and decide to sail there on board the ship. A fire in the boiler room is extinguished, but not before a boiler fuel supply valve is fused open. Before Chief Engineer Pringle can manually open a steam relief valve, a huge explosion rips through the boiler room and the many decks situated above it, killing him and some of the passengers and trapping Laurie under a steel beam in their state room, in addition to opening a huge hole in the side of the ship. Cliff runs back to their state room and can't get Laurie out alone. He then finds Jill trapped on the other side of the room. He tries to use a shattered piece of the bed to get to the other side, but it falls through the huge hole made by the explosion. Third Officer Osborne believes that the crew should start loading the passengers into the lifeboats, but Captain Robert Adams is reluctant, as he never lost a ship. Cliff rescues Jill by using a board to have her crawl across the hole on. Down in the boiler room, Second Engineer Walsh reports to Captain Adams that a seam to the bulkhead has broken away. Cliff tries to get a steward's help, but to no avail. A passenger states that he overheard his conversation, and wants to help. Osborne reports that the boiler room is now half full. The ship then begins to transmit an SOS, on orders of Captain Adams. Cliff and a few other men return to his state room to try to help free Laurie, but find that they need a torch.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A‚àí, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H‚ÄîA bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H‚ÄîA bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base. I am facing a new situation today: David is a chemical engineer. Yesterday, he was working on two samples, sample A and sample B. Sample A was a strong acid, and sample B was a weak acid. David needed to find the differences between them. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which would lose a proton more easily, sample A or sample B? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the key information from the background article. - Strong acids completely dissociate in water, yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base. - Weak acids only partially dissociate in water and at equilibrium, both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. - The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+. Step 2: Apply the knowledge to the current situation. - Sample A is a strong acid. - Sample B is a weak acid. Step 3: Determine which sample would lose a proton more easily. - According to the key information, the stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton. - Since sample A is a strong acid and sample B is a weak acid, sample A would lose a proton more easily.

The first sentence says: \\"A light novel series adaptation under the same name is published by Kadokawa 's Kadokawa Beans Bunko. All volumes were written by T≈çko Fujitani with illustrations by Yamako.\\" This sentence focuses on the publication aspect of the light novel series adaptation. It says that the series is published by Kadokawa's Kadokawa Beans Bunko, and then adds that all volumes were written by T≈çko Fujitani, with illustrations by Yamako. There is a clear distinction between the publisher (Kadokawa Beans Bunko) and the author (T≈çko Fujitani). The sentence emphasizes the publisher's role in making the series available to the public. The second sentence says: \\"A light novel - series - adaptation under the same name was written by Kadokawa 's Kadokawa Beans Bunko, all volumes were published by T≈çko Fujitani with illustrations by Yamako.\\" In this statement, it is slightly misleading because it appears to attribute the writing of the series to Kadokawa Beans Bunko, which is actually the publisher.

Life would be easier. However, education cannot promise all wishes, dreams, and desires.Society must reject the foolish idea that a college education's main purpose is to satisfy our desires and secure success.Like most challenging things, education is a gamble in which results depend entirely on people's ability to look past their wants to see the realism and reason behind their wants.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? its rather routine script","completion":"To analyze the sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"its rather routine script,\\" we can break it down into its components to determine the overall tone: positive, negative, or neutral. First, let's consider the word \\"routine.\\" The term is usually used to describe something that follows a regular pattern or is unvarying. In the context of a movie review, this could be understood as a criticism, indicating that the script lacks originality or freshness. Generally, viewers and critics appreciate novelty and innovation in storytelling, so describing a script as \\"routine\\" denotes a negative sentiment. The word \\"rather\\" serves as an intensifier, further emphasizing the sentiment conveyed by \\"routine.\\" The usage of this adverb suggests that the script's lack of originality is particularly notable and goes beyond mere familiarity. Thus, it amplifies the negative sentiment of the sentence. In summary, the sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"its rather routine script\\" is negative. The phrase criticizes the film's script for being unoriginal and overly familiar and conveys disappointment or dissatisfaction with the film's storytelling aspects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 3: Choose the most suitable answer - Based on the context and evaluations of the possible answers, the most suitable answer is (b) something she can do for her parents.

In South Africa, the period of colonization resulted in many unions and marriages between European men and African women from various tribes, resulting in mixed-race children. As the Europeans acquired territory and imposed rule over the Africans, they generally pushed mixed-race and Africans into second-class status. During the first half of the 20th century, the Afrikaaner-dominated government classified the population according to four main racial groups: Black, White, Asian (mostly Indian), and Coloured. The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu, Khoisan, and European descent (with some Malay ancestry, especially in the Western Cape). The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa. It imposed a system of legal racial segregation, a complex of laws known as apartheid. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What was a result of these marriages?","completion":"Imagine you have a big box of crayons with different colors. In South Africa, a long time ago, many people from different colors and tribes (like the crayon colors) came together. When European men (white crayons) and African women (black and other color crayons) fall in love and get married, they have children who are mixed with different colors. These children are called 'Coloured' (like when you mix two different crayon colors). Sadly, the people who were in charge, called the government, treated these mixed-colored children and their families differently. They made rules, like a not-fun game, where people were put into groups based on their color: Black, White, Asian, and Coloured. This not-fun game was called apartheid. So, as a result of these marriages between European men and African women, mixed-race children were created, and they were called 'Coloured.' These children and their families were treated differently because of the rules that the government made during apartheid."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? When you're having a problem with someone, first try talking to a person you trust; whether it's a significant other or just a friend, sometimes it's easy to do things that make the problem worse before you have the chance to make them better. For example, if you're having a fight with your girlfriend because she thinks you cheated on her (even if you didn't), don't make the problem worse by spending a lot of time out being social with other girls. This will only make you look worse and make it harder to argue with her from the moral high ground. Instead, take a vacation from people until you work things out with her. Another example for a problem with a friend is if your best friend is mad at you for blowing off their party in order to spend time with someone else. In this situation, you'll want to avoid seeming distant or disinterested in their feelings. Instead, try to do something nice for them. Avoid arguing because it will only make the other person defensive. Instead, come to a solution for whatever the problem is that the two of you are having. Make sure you understand what's really bothering them first. Sometimes people seem mad about one thing but really they're mad about something else. If you want to really fix the problem, it's a good idea to make sure you're working on the right problem first. For example, your boyfriend might say that he's mad you decided to go to the big state school in the next town over instead of going to the local college with him. Of course, you'll still be able to see each other all the time and date without serious problems: what he's really worried about is that all that time off on your own will lead you to meet someone new. When you're fighting with someone it's easy to feel that you're right or your way of doing something is best. You're working with your own brain after all. However, people rarely argue with you just to be contrary. They're doing the best that they can with what they know and the situation might look very different from their perspective. Try seeing things from their side of the field in order to help you find a way to meet in the middle. Sometimes, if you're having a hard time understanding their perspective, it can be really helpful to just ask them. Ask them to explain, at length, why they think it would be better to take another route. Say something like: ‚ÄúCan you explain your thinking to me? I‚Äôd really like to know better.‚Äù By walking through their feelings and thought process, you can often gain a better understanding of the problem and how to solve it. When people feel disrespected or cornered, they will often become more argumentative and combative, even if they would normally agree with you. If you see a personal situation developing, try taking steps to make that person feel like they have more control and that they are respected. You will find that suddenly they are much more willing to talk. For example, you'll want to dial back your language. Don't insult them or use accusatory language like \\"you should have ______\\". Instead, use ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements to express yourself. Say things like, ‚ÄúI felt hurt after out last conversation,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI get upset when you talk to me like that.‚Äù Make them feel in control by giving them choices or options, as well as doing things like coming up with what they think is a fair solution to the problem. Once you've taken those basic first steps towards solving the problem, you should start really talking through a solution. Communication is key here and communication is more than just telling them what you think. You'll want to think before you speak, being careful to think about how what you say comes across. You'll also want to be a really good listener, really focusing on what they're saying and working to understand them. For these serious, problem-solving conversations, you should generally set aside a large chunk of time and meet in a place that's private and quiet. This will remove distractions and things which add more stress. Talking it out also shows the other person that you have put a priority on making things right, which can earn you some points and soften them up for finding a solution. The solution to more interpersonal conflicts will be a middle ground. This means you're going to have to stop seeing things in black and white. Don't see \\"my way\\" and \\"their way\\". You're both great people and you have so much to offer each other, so instead talk it out and find \\"our way\\" instead. For example, if your girlfriend is upset because you can't agree which family to spend Christmas with, you can propose a third option: spending the week before Christmas with her family, the week after with your family, and the day itself with just each other. For example, if your friend is upset because they want to take one class with you but you want to take another class instead, you can suggest that you keep your classes separate but both take a study period that you can spend together studying in the library.","completion":"The article suggests that when facing interpersonal conflicts, it's essential to communicate openly, understand the other person's perspective, and find a middle ground through respectful and honest discussions, rather than escalating the situation or ignoring the problem."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Just to be clear, those were not 253 calories' worth of tofu, yogurt or carrot.The most popular vending machine items included soft drinks, candy, chips, crackers, cookies, cakes and ice cream.On the plus side , kids also bought low-fat milk, fruit juice and even fruit, the study found. But the eventual effect on kids' diets was not good.Those who bought from vending machines ate an average of 156 grams of sugar per day, compared with 146 grams for those who abstained .They also consumed less fiber, iron and vitamin B. _ Vending machine customers ate 4% less sodium than other students--an average of 3,287 milligrams per day compared with 3,436 mg for those who didn't buy from vending machines.That's probably because the extra snacks made kids too full to eat as much at mealtimes, when dishes are especially Salty.In any event, kids should eat no more than 1,200 to 1,500 mg of sodium each day, according to the Mayo Clinic.Even for adults, the government recommends a daily limit of 2,300 mg. Overall, vending machines in school appear to be a threat to children's health.The researchers calculated that all that snacking adds up to about14 extra pounds per child per school year.For some students this might be a serious contributor to weight issues.The study was based on data collected from 2,309 children nationwide for the third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study, which was conducted by the U.S.Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service.

Article:Only one in 10 hospitals enforces a smoking ban outside health service buildings, and Public Health England (PHE) wants all hospitals to offer help to quit as part of patients' treatment. More than a million smokers are admitted to NHS hospitals every year. PHE chief executive Duncan Selbie said it was not about \\"forcing people\\" to quit, but was about \\"helping people\\". A recent report by the British Thoracic Society said 25% of hospital patients were recorded as being \\"current smokers\\" - which is higher than rates in the general adult population (19%). Its other results included: The survey saw 14,750 patient records submitted from 146 institutions across the UK. The report said the execution of national standards in smoking cessation were \\"woefully lacking\\" within the NHS and that there was \\"much to do to improve smoking cessation treatment for patients in hospitals across the UK\\". Its authors called for support for smokers in hospital by referring them to specialised help to quit, improving the prescription of nicotine replacement therapy, and investing in staff across all hospitals dedicated to helping people stop smoking. Mr Selbie said the plan was to give smokers who want to quit the right kind of support. \\"This isn't about forcing people. This is about helping people. And seven out of 10 say they want to quit. \\"So it's the chance when they're in the hospital to get them in touch with people who can help. And we know if you get that help, you're four times more likely to quit forever.\\" According to PHE, smoking causes 96,000 deaths a year in the UK, and for each of those deaths, about 20 smokers are suffering from a smoking-related disease. About 475,000 hospital admissions in England were attributable to smoking in 2014-15, and the annual cost is estimated at √Ç¬£2bn, with a further √Ç¬£1.1bn in social care costs. Smoking in hospitals grounds is already banned by law in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Legislation is earmarked for potential introduction in Wales later this year. The Department of Health in England says it has no plans to make it illegal at the moment. Dr Frank Ryan, a consultant psychologist at the Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, said more people had to be encouraged not to smoke. \\"It's really about refocusing our efforts and motivating our service users and staff to quit. \\"And of course, whatever investment we make in smoking cessation programmes, there's a payback many times more in terms of the health benefits and even factors such as attendance at work, because it's workers who smoke [who] tend to have more absent spells from work.\\" But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said banning smoking on hospital grounds would be a \\"gross over-reaction\\". \\"It won't stop people smoking. It will simply force people to smoke further away, which will discriminate against those who are physically infirm or in a wheelchair \\"The impact on public health will be minimal because smoking in the open air is no threat to anyone else's health. \\"The reality is that hospitals can be stressful places for patients, visitors and staff. Instead of campaigning for a tobacco-free environment Public Health England should show some compassion for the many people for whom smoking is a comfort at a difficult time.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"This article says that only one in 10 hospitals has a rule against smoking outside their buildings.

I will also justify each step for better understanding. 1. Prepare the cookie dough: Ensure that you have prepared the cookie dough according to your preferred recipe. Mixing the ingredients thoroughly and achieving the right consistency is crucial for easy cutting. This will provide a stable base for creating the squares. 2. Chill the dough: Refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes or until it is firm. Chilling the dough makes it easier to handle, preventing it from becoming too sticky when cutting. 3. Choose your work surface: Select a clean, flat surface to roll out the dough. You can also use a silicone baking mat or parchment paper to prevent sticking. This ensures that you can smoothly and uniformly cut the squares. 4. Roll out the dough: Sprinkle some flour on your work surface and rolling pin to prevent sticking. Roll the dough out to a thickness of about 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Rolling the dough to an even thickness ensures all the squares will bake evenly. 5. Create a grid pattern: Using a ruler or a straight-edged tool, such as a bench scraper, score lines along the dough to create a grid pattern. The distance between the lines should be equal to the desired width of your squares. Scoring the dough this way helps to create even squares and makes cutting easier. 6. Cut the squares: Press down firmly with a sharp knife, pizza cutter, or pastry wheel to cut the dough along the scored lines. A sharp tool allows for clean, precise cuts. 7. Separate and place on baking sheet: Gently separate the squares and transfer them onto a lined baking sheet, leaving some space between each square to allow for expansion during baking. Spacing the squares prevents them from sticking together while baking. 8. Bake and enjoy: Finally, bake the cookies according to your recipe's instructions. Once baked, allow them to cool and serve your evenly cut cookie dough squares. These steps provide an easy and efficient method to cut cookie dough into squares, ensuring uniform size and evenly baked cookies."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

On my seventh birthday, my parents bought me a second-hand ZX Spectrum and, in a foretaste of my life to come, I immediately set about learning how to use it to get attention. It's a sign of how rapidly technology develops that my crappy Spectrum, with its 48k of memory, already had 12k more storage power than the computer that had guided the Apollo 11 moon landing eighteen years earlier* With power like that, there seemed to be no limit to what I could do. While my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house. From that day on, the possibilities offered by technology to both subvert the norm and get attention had me hooked. Years later, at secondary school, I convinced my English teacher, Mr Coen, to teach me desktop publishing, ostensibly to work on the official school magazine, but in reality to produce an alternative underground version - complete with less than flattering articles about teachers and fellow pupils and distributed via the publicly accessible shared hard drive that was supposed to be used for collaborative coursework. That particular stunt got me banned from the school computer room for half a term. And then, in 1997, I discovered the Internet. Throughout history, every fame-hungry media dickhead has found his preferred medium for pursuing fame and wealth (in that order). For Tony Parsons - and Hitler, for that matter - it was books. William Randolph Hearst chose newspapers. Don Imus and Howard Stern preferred radio. For Nick Griffin it's inflammatory leaflets. For Tracy Emin it's art. Or at least an approximation of it.

Mechanical energy is a combination of the energy of motion or position. This type of energy describes objects that are moving or could move. A moving ball can have energy from motion. An arrow can also have the energy of motion. Both are types of mechanical energy. Can you think of some other examples? Where does the energy of motion come from? It comes from the energy created by position. This energy is stored energy. This means it is not moving yet, but it has the potential to move. How can you store energy? The arrow gains energy from the drawn bow. As the arrow is released, the bow releases its stored energy and puts the arrow into motion. Can you think of some other ways to store energy using position? Do you have any questions?","completion":"Yes, there are definitely other examples and ways to store energy using position. Here are a few examples of mechanical energy: 1. A compressed spring: When a spring is compressed, it stores potential energy. Once released, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the spring returns to its original position. 2. A raised weight: When an object is lifted above the ground, it stores gravitational potential energy. If the object is dropped, this potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy as the object accelerates towards the ground. 3. A roller coaster at the top of a hill: As the roller coaster climbs the hill, it gains gravitational potential energy. When it begins to descend, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, propelling the roller coaster down the hill and around the track. 4. A wound-up clock: A clock with a wound-up spring stores mechanical energy (torsional potential energy). As the spring unwinds, the stored energy is released, powering the clock's movement. The energy of motion typically comes from stored energy, or potential energy, which is either stored by an object's position or condition. As mentioned earlier, this potential energy can come from various sources such as gravitational force, elastic force, or the position of particles within a system. Are there any other questions or examples you would like me to provide related to mechanical energy and energy storage?"},{"prompt":"Daughter of the Party - Daughter of the Party (ÂÖöÁöÑÂ•≥ÂÑø) is a 1958 Chinese film directed by Lin Nong and produced by Changchun Film Studio.

You should avoid an overly large cage which may not feel cozy enough for your dog. A crate that's restricted in size stops your dog from soiling the space. Give him a comfortable bed and a bowl of water. Encourage your Cavalier to investigate the crate by sprinkling treats inside the bed. The goal is to make a cozy place for your dog to go in order to feel safe and secure. Avoid using the crate as a punishment. Place a toy or two inside, so that he begins to associate the crate with interesting things. Stay home while training your dog to use his crate. Leave the crate door open and let him enter on his own. Once he's inside, feed him a meal. While he's eating, shut the door briefly and tell him how clever he is. Open the door before he begins whining and so he doesn't feel trapped. Over time, increase how long you keep the door shut. This will get him used to being in the crate. Avoid opening the door when he is crying or he will think that crying gets him released. Leave the door open when he's not inside so that he can come and go if he needs a safe space. If you'd like to keep your Cavalier safe and out of the way at night, his crate should be comfortable and in a quiet place. Make sure the crate is out of the way of foot traffic so people's movements won't disturb him. Get him settled in his crate and leave the room while he's not crying. Remember that your dog will need to toilet overnight, especially if he's young. Set an alarm and let your dog out to toilet every 2 or 3 hours. Make sure your dog is completely comfortable with the crate before you start leaving him alone in it. Once your Cavalier is comfortable being left alone for 30 minutes at a time, you can begin gradually increasing the amount of time he's left alone. Never make a big deal when you leave or return and always let your dog out to toilet once you come back. Never crate your dog for more than 4 hours at a time (unless it's overnight). Younger dogs can only handle an hour or two while dogs that are 15 weeks or older can usually do 3 or 4 hours.","completion":"When selecting a crate for your Cavalier, ensure it is spacious enough for your dog to lie on its side with legs stretched out or stand without hitting its head, but not too large as to not feel cozy. A properly sized crate discourages soiling and provides a comfortable environment. Equip the crate with a bed, water bowl, and treats to encourage exploration. Aim to create a safe and secure space, avoiding the use of the crate as punishment. Include toys and interesting items, and remain home during initial crate training. Begin crate training with the door open, gradually increasing the duration of the door being closed, and avoid reinforcing negative behavior like whining. Allow your dog access to the crate even when not in use for a sense of security. Ensure the crate is in a quiet and low-traffic area for nighttime use. Be attentive to young dogs' needs for overnight toilet breaks, setting an alarm to let them out every 2 to 3 hours. Gradually increase your Cavalier's time alone in the crate, starting with 30 minutes and working up from there. Keep departures and arrivals low-key and maintain a consistent bathroom schedule upon return. Remember that crating limits vary by age, with younger dogs tolerating 1-2 hours and dogs 15 weeks or older managing 3-4 hours, excluding overnight crating, which should never exceed 4 hours. Always prioritize your dog's comfort and well-being during crate training."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who was a student but was also, technically, a professional?

His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede‚Äîat the time thought to be by Titian‚Äîin one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student.

Who is the mother of the actor Toby Stephens ?","completion":"The mother of actor Toby Stephens is Dame Maggie Smith, a prolific and highly respected British actress. Maggie Smith was born on December 28, 1934, in Ilford, Essex, England. She is a distinguished stage, film, and television actress, recognized for her versatile acting skills and longevity in the entertainment industry. Her acting career has spanned over six decades, and she has performed in a variety of genres ranging from Shakespearean and modern theatre to more popular films and series. Born Margaret Natalie Smith, she initially made her stage debut in 1952 and joined the prestigious Royal National Theatre in 1963. Her first film appearance was in the British crime film \\"Nowhere to Go\\" (1958), for which she received a BAFTA nomination for Most Promising Newcomer. However, she, perhaps, is most recognized for her role as the formidable Professor Minerva McGonagall in the \\"Harry Potter\\" film series (2001‚Äì2011) and as the sharp-tongued Dowager Countess of Grantham in the British television series \\"Downton Abbey\\" (2010‚Äì2015). Maggie Smith is a highly decorated actress. She has twice won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performances in \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\" (1969) and \\"California Suite\\" (1978). She is also a three-time winner of the BAFTA Award for Best Actress and has received three Golden Globe Awards. Furthermore, for her performance in \\"Downton Abbey,\\" she has won three Emmys. She married actor Robert Stephens in June 1967. Together, they had two sons, Chris Larkin (born in 1967) and Toby Stephens (born in 1969). Toby Stephens, like his mother, pursued a career in acting and has built a successful career both in film and on the stage. He is perhaps most known for his performances in \\"Die Another Day,\\" \\"Black Sails,\\" and more recently in the Netflix series \\"Lost in Space.\\" Maggie Smith and Robert Stephens divorced in 1974. Despite the difficulties and turbulence in her personal life, Smith's career continued to flourish, marking her as one of the most enduring figures in British acting history. Her talent and love for acting is seemingly mirrored in her son Toby's own career, indicating that the legacy of the Smith family in the world of entertainment continues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The tribe of the family of Hashim and the Quraysh tribe is the same - both belong to the Banu Hashim clan, which falls under the larger Quraysh tribe. The Quraysh tribe was a powerful and influential tribe in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in the city of Mecca. The Banu Hashim clan is named after Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, who was the great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. As for the dynasties descended from Ali ibn Abi Talib, Ali was the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, marrying his daughter Fatimah. Ali was the first Imam of Shia Islam, and the fourth caliph to Sunni Muslims. He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan within the Quraysh tribe as well. Dynasties that claim their descent from Ali, through his two sons Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali, are known as Sayyids (descendants of Muhammad) or Sharifs (noble title for descendants of Hasan ibn Ali). There are several notable dynasties that descended from Ali ibn Abi Talib, including: 1. Fatimid Caliphate (909‚Äì1171): An Ismaili Shia dynasty that ruled over lands stretching from the Red Sea to the western parts of North Africa and Sicily. 2. Alid dynasties of northern Iran: These dynasties were founded by Zaydi-Fiver Shia Imams in the 9th to 14th centuries, including the Alavids, Hasanids, and Zaydids, among others. 3. Safavid dynasty (1501‚Äì1736): This dynasty ruled Persia (Iran) and established Twelver Shia Islam as the official religion of the empire. The Safavid dynasty was of Azerbaijani-origin, however, they claimed descent from Ali through Safi al-Din Ardabili, an ancestor of the dynasty's founder. 4. Idrisid dynasty (788-974): A Sunni Muslim dynasty that ruled in Morocco and claimed descent from Ali through Idris I, who was a direct descendant of Hasan ibn Ali. These are just some of the dynasties that hold a connection to Ali ibn Abi Talib. The members of these dynasties often played significant roles in Islamic history and contributed to the political, religious, and cultural development of the regions they ruled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926‚Äì2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Fa√ßade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

Answer:","completion":"Marguerite Duras was the writer from France, while Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa was a Japanese writer. Marguerite Duras, born on April 4, 1914, in Gia ƒê·ªãnh, French Indochina (now Vietnam), was a French author, playwright, and film director. Her real name was Marguerite Donnadieu, but she took the pen name Duras from the name of the village close to her family home in the Lot-et-Garonne d√©partement of France. Duras is best known for her novels, such as L'Amant (The Lover), Hiroshima mon amour, and Moderato Cantabile. Her works often dealt with themes like love, suffering, and the intricate relationships between men and women. In addition to her literary career, Duras went on to become a prominent film director and screenwriter, earning critical acclaim for her films and screenplays. Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa, on the other hand, was born on March 1, 1892, in Tokyo, Japan. He is considered one of Japan's most significant short story writers of the early 20th century. Akutagawa's work has been characterized by his unique narrative style, exploring themes like human nature, morality, and individual identity. Some of his most famous works include 'Rash≈çmon,' 'In a Grove,' and 'The Spider's Thread.' These stories, along with others, are considered prime examples of Taish≈ç era Japanese literature, and his influence can still be seen in the works of many contemporary Japanese authors.

Article: Have you ever wondered how your favorite NBA team received its famous name? All NBA teams have an interesting story or a history behind their names. Some of the names reflect the city's culture or history, others came from previous owners and many were selected through \\"Name the Team\\" contests. For teams like Los Angeles and Utah, the names were not always a reflection of the city. Even though Los Angeles has no lakes, the Laker name has been a city treasure for almost 40 years. Before going to Los Angeles, the team originated in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 1948, team officials chose the name for its direct relationship to the state's motto, \\"The Land of 10,000 Lakes.\\" The team name went unchanged after moving to Los Angeles in 1960. Because Utah's team originated in New Orleans, Louisiana, it was called the Jazz. In 1974, New Orleans club officials chose the name to represent the city for its reputation as the \\"jazz capital of the world.\\" The name stayed with the team even after finding a new home in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1979. The Chicago Bull's original owner, Richard Klein, named the team the Bulls. He picked the name because a fighting bull is relentless, and never quits. Klein, who founded the club in1966, believed these qualities were necessary for a championship team and hoped his Chicago athletes would live up to the team name. A belief that Bulls----winner of the six NBA championships have definitely followed. In 1967, the Indian Pacers selected their team name in a different way from most other teams.

Write highlights for this article: With its walls left to crumble, and ivy winding its way through grandiose halls and staircases, it's easy to imagine how Overstone Hall might have fallen into disrepair because of a lack of funds for its upkeep. However, the Northamptonshire stately home's troubles run far deeper than that. Right from its first owner - Lord Overstone - it has been a resolutely unloved place and, since a fire ravaged the upper floors a decade ago, it has been up for sale for a mere ¬£1million but without any interest. Scroll down for video. Overstone Hall in Northamptonshire was hated by Lord Overstone whose wife commissioned the vast property in 1860 and has never been wanted by any of its owners. The stately home boasts 114 rooms, occupying 20,000sq ft and sits on 50 acres of country parkland in Overstone, Northamptonshire. The 19th century stately home boasts 114 rooms in 50 acres of country parkland in Overstone, Northamptonshire. Lady Overstone commissioned the Elizabethan and Renaissance style building in 1860, but didn't live to see it finished. Unfortunately her husband Lord Overstone hated the design, built by architect William Milford Teulon, and even declared his contempt in a letter to friends. 'The new house, I regret to say, is a cause of unmitigated and disappointment and vexation,' wrote Lord Overstone. 'It is an utter failure, although very large and full of pretension - it has neither taste, comfort nor convenience. I am utterly ashamed of it.' Lord Overstone despised it so much that he refused to live in it for the remainder of his life, leaving it to his daughter Lady Wantage on his death in 1883. The lounge inside Overstone Hall in the 1920s when it was owned by Sir Philip Stott who used it as a training base for Conservative party members. Sir Philip Stott who wanted to turn it into a training base for the Conservative Party disliked the imposing building and condemned his scheme as an 'abject failure' in 1928, before it was sold to the Charlotte Mason Schools Company. Lord Overstone (left) declared that he did not like the mansion his wife had designed and gave it to his daughter Lady Wantage (right) on his death in 1883. Lady Overstone commissioned the Victorian hodgepodge of Elizabethan and Renaissance architectural style in 1860, but didn't live to see it finished. The mansion has now fallen into disrepair and has been reclaimed by nature with ivy and foliage growing through all the rooms in the house. A fire ripped through the top floor destroying 60 per cent of the property in April 2001, including all of the principal rooms and the impressive carved staircase. Lady Wantage also spent minimal time at the property, only occasionally using it for winter hunting parties, so it was sold in 1920. In 1979 the school closed and was sold privately for ¬£701,000 and used by the New Testament Church of God as its UK headquarters. Lady Wantage also spent minimal time at the property, only occasionally using it for winter hunting parties. After she died in 1920, the property was sold to Sir Philip Stott who intended to use it as a training base for Conservative party members. However he condemned the scheme as an 'abject failure' in 1928. It was privately sold to Charlotte Mason Schools Company in 1929 where part of the massive building was run as a girls' boarding school. Lord Overstone hated the house so much that he refused to live there, saying: 'It is a cause of unmitigated and disappointment and vexation' The property was listed in 2010 for ¬£1million but the property didn't sell and is still owned by the New Testament Church of God, which is asking for the same price. Lord Overstone's daughter, Harriet, inherited the house after his death. Overstone Park was acquired by Lewis Loyd, father of Samuel Jones-Loyd, 1st Baron Overstone, for ¬£117,500 in 1832. On the death of Lewis Loyd in 1858, the house and 10,000 acres of land became Lord Overstone‚Äôs property. The banker and politician had married Harriet, daughter of Conservative politician Ichabod Wright, in 1829. Together they had one son, who died as an infant, and a daughter The Honourable Harriet Sarah Jones Loyd in 1829. In 1860 Lady Overstone decided to engage the architect William Milford Teulon to replace the existing house with something more in keeping with their taste. She was keen to have a property fitting with their status and so her husband decided to rebuild on a grand scale. But she commissioned a design with a mixture of Elizabethan and Renaissance features which led to one of the most derided houses created in the Victorian era. Lady Overstone died before the house was completed in November 1864 and left her husband a widower. He hated the house and remarked in a letter to a friend: 'The New House, I regret to say, is a cause of unmitigated disappointment and vexation. It is an utter failure although very large and full of pretension, it has neither taste, comfort, nor convenience.' He refused to live there in his later years and left the house and extensive fortune to his daughter Harriet on his death in 1883,. One of the most revered heiresses of her time, she was a noted philanthropist, and greatly interested in hospital and nursing work. In November 1858 she married Robert James Lindsay, who assumed the name of Loyd-Lindsay by deed poll. Early on, they became the owners of two fine country places - Overstone Park, Northampton, and Lockinge House, Wantage, where the couple chiefly resided. She only used the Overstone estate occasionally for winter hunting parties, as her main home was in Oxfordshire. With her husband, a former distinguished soldier and Victoria Cross hero, she was instrumental in establishing the National Aid Society, which was really the forerunner of the British Red Cross Society. Photographer Mathew Growcoot, 25, who entered the property described his experience as surreal and haunting, saying it has been reclaimed by nature.

'I can understand why it was never wanted by any of its owners, the main tower looks distinctly unfriendly. It's hard to judge the interior because there's so little of it left but the few rooms that did remain were far too big and drafty. 'It was totally surreal being there and I did feel on edge because of the constants noises and flutterings, I actually had to remind myself that I don't believe in ghosts.'

It was privately sold to Charlotte Mason Schools Company in 1929 where part of the massive building was ran as a girls' boarding school.

Took me 9:18 and 740ish strides if my points were right . Went to the gym . Good workout there . Question: How would one describe the narrator 's level of fitness ?","completion":"Based on the information provided, the narrator appears to have a reasonably high level of fitness. There are several factors and observations that can be taken into account to determine this assessment. 1. Running Ability: The narrator mentions running and particularly focuses on completing the last mile to track their strides and speed. A time of 9 minutes and 18 seconds for a mile is indicative of a moderately fit individual. While not an expert or elite runner, this pace suggests that the narrator is comfortable with cardiovascular exercise and has developed a certain level of endurance. 2. Stride Count: The narrator counted approximately 740 strides for the duration of their mile run. While it is difficult to precisely evaluate fitness based on stride count alone, this detail does provide some information about the individual's running efficiency. It can be inferred that they are likely conscious of their running technique and form, which is indicative of an experienced and mindful exerciser. 3. Gym Workouts: The narrator mentions going to the gym and having a good workout. This suggests that they are actively engaged in a regular fitness routine that likely includes both cardiovascular exercise (running) and strength training (gym workouts). This balanced approach to exercise is indicative of a person who is committed to maintaining and improving their overall physical fitness. 4. Consistency: It is important to consider consistency when evaluating the level of fitness. The fact that the narrator tries to keep track of their strides and time for the last mile demonstrates a level of dedication to their fitness journey. This person is most likely in the process of continuously monitoring and developing their workout routine, which helps maintain motivation, track progress, and ultimately improve their overall fitness level. 5. Self-Awareness: The narrator's attention to details such as stride count and running time reveals a certain degree of self-awareness in terms of physical fitness. This willingness to scrutinize and analyze their performance indicates a proactive attitude towards their health and wellbeing. In summary, based on the details provided, the narrator can be described as a moderately fit individual who is actively engaged in maintaining and improving their cardiovascular endurance, strength, and overall physical fitness. Their consistent efforts and attention to detail demonstrate a commitment to their wellbeing and a proactive approach towards personal health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle‚Äôs law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle‚Äôs law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles‚Äô law and Amontons‚Äô law.) According to Boyle‚Äôs law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure‚Äîand vice versa. That‚Äôs what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop. I am facing a new situation today: Except for their color, there are two identical inflatable chairs in a grade school classroom that the children can use during free time. Today, Patrick and Mark, who weighs much more than Patrick, are allowed to use the chairs. Patrick chooses to sit on the red chair, and Mark sits on the green chair. The boys have fun reading books while they sit on their comfortable inflatable chairs. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which chair has a lower air pressure? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The red chair, where Patrick is sitting, has a lower air pressure than the green chair, where Mark is seated. Here is a detailed explanation to support this conclusion: Using the knowledge acquired from the background article on Boyle's law, we understand that when the volume of a gas is held constant and pressure is applied, the internal pressure of that gas will increase accordingly. In the given situation, we have two identical inflatable chairs, filled with air, and are being used by Patrick and Mark. Since Mark weighs more than Patrick, he applies greater force to the chair on which he is sitting. This increased force results in a higher compression of the air inside the green chair. When the force exerted on the chair by Mark compresses the air within the chair, the volume of the air decreases. As stated by Boyle's law, when the volume of a gas decreases, and the temperature remains constant, the pressure inside the container (in this case, the inflatable chair) increases. So, the green chair, which Mark is using, experiences a rise in internal air pressure due to the increased weight exerted on it. On the other hand, Patrick, who weighs less than Mark, exerts lesser force on the red chair, which results in less compression of the air inside it. Consequently, the red chair has a lower internal air pressure as compared to the green chair. In conclusion, based on Boyle's law and given the weight difference between Patrick and Mark, the red chair, where Patrick is sitting, has a lower air pressure than the green chair, where Mark is seated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and J√∏rgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (K√∏benhavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of Aladdin. Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster Mogens W√∂ldike, remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and Rudolph Simonsen, the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.The Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen's works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world. The concerti and symphonies feature frequently in these listings. The Carl Nielsen International Competition commenced in the 1970s under the auspices of the Odense Symphony Orchestra.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The area of child psychology is one of the most significant and well studied of all the branches of psychology. It aims to help with achieving a greater understanding of the behavior of children through an understanding of their minds. It deals with children who range from the prenatal stage right up to the stage of adolescence. The psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980) has been credited with making a major breakthrough in this area when he put forward his idea that children were not actually less intelligent than adults, rather they just thought in a different way. Preciously the development of children right from birth through to adulthood was an area that was almost completely _ . In fact very little work was done in this area. However, interest in this field has now developed to the point of being one of the most debated of all the areas of psychology. Despite popular belief that factors such as genetics or personal characteristics are the only determining factors that influence a youth's behavior, this is not in fact the case. In reality, development actually includes many more factors than those contained within an individual. Factors such as environment, which can include social relationships and the surrounding culture, also play important roles. Relationships with both peers and adults will no doubt affect how children think and learn, and therefore develop. These relationships can include those that are found not only within families but also in schools and peer groups. Culturally speaking, this factor will contribute greatly to how children develop their personality concerning the values they end up holding (perhaps for a lifetime) as well as how they view such things as traditions and customs. Nowadays, psychologists have agreed that a child's psychology is both unique and highly complex. However, there are debates on many different points in this field and many viewpoints exist. Question: The author's purpose in writing the passage is to _ . Options: A: introduce an important psychologist. B: give a brief introduction to child psychology.

Does the word \\"lift\\" mean the same thing in \\"Lift one's eyes.\\" and \\"Lift potatoes.\\"?","completion":"To determine if the word \\"lift\\" means the same thing in both phrases, I will analyze the context and usage of the word in each phrase. Step 1: Examining the first phrase, \\"Lift one's eyes.\\" - In this context, \\"lift\\" refers to raising or elevating one's gaze or line of sight upward. The word \\"lift\\" here implies an action that is metaphorical and focused on the movement of the eyes. Step 2: Examining the second phrase, \\"Lift potatoes.\\" - In this context, \\"lift\\" refers to physically picking up or raising potatoes from a surface or the ground. The word \\"lift\\" here implies a tangible action that involves the act of moving objects (in this case, potatoes). Step 3: Comparing the meaning of \\"lift\\" in both phrases. - Both contexts use \\"lift\\" to describe an action of raising or moving something from a lower position to a higher one. However, the first phrase uses the action metaphorically and focuses on the movement of the eyes, while the second phrase uses the action literally and focuses on moving physical objects. Conclusion: The word \\"lift\\" may have a similar underlying concept of elevation or raising in both phrases, but its meaning is used differently in each context ‚Äì metaphorically in \\"Lift one's eyes\\" and literally in \\"Lift potatoes.\\""},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend blog will know that I suffer from an extremely sensitive scalp which can be really itchy, and I have to be very careful what shampoo I use. I know that I‚Äôm sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it‚Äôs the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I‚Äôm also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too ‚Äì mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop¬Æ, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn‚Äôt always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos ‚Äì and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it‚Äôs a nice one so it doesn‚Äôt put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application ‚Äì the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I‚Äôve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I‚Äôve used it ‚Äì the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too.

Article: Ever feel like you've been hit on the head after a bad night's sleep? According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems. A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, \\"What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.\\" Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained. Benedict, whose study is published in the journalSleep, added, \\"In conclusion, the findings of our experiment indicate a good night's sleep may be critical to maintaining brain health.\\" A third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared with almost nine a few decades ago.

By nationalizing Northern Rock, the people in charge of the country could make sure everyone's houses and money were safe.

Given a scientific passage and an answer, generate a question for the given answer. Q: Passage: The lifecycle of basidiomycetes includes alternation of generations (Figure 24.16). Spores are generally produced through sexual reproduction, rather than asexual reproduction. The club-shaped basidium carries spores called basidiospores. In the basidium, nuclei of two different mating strains fuse (karyogamy), giving rise to a diploid zygote that then undergoes meiosis. The haploid nuclei migrate into basidiospores, which germinate and generate monokaryotic hyphae. The mycelium that results is called a primary mycelium. Mycelia of different mating strains can combine and produce a secondary mycelium that contains haploid nuclei of two different mating strains. This is the dikaryotic stage of the basidiomyces lifecyle and and it is the dominant stage. Eventually, the secondary mycelium generates a basidiocarp, which is a fruiting body that protrudes from the ground‚Äîthis is what we think of as a mushroom.

Article: As millions of playthings are recalled, doctors are reminded that the risks of lead exposure continue for young patients. Lead is such a well-known health - perhaps even contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire- that it came as a shock to discover that toys played by children could contain lead. Doctors are now dealing with the aftershocks. Just how dangerous is this exposure? That's the question physicians are being asked by parents who find a lead-polluted Elmo, of Dora. Millions of others toys, lunch boxes and pieces of jewelry manufactured in China have been recalled because they contain lead either in the paint that coats them or as a component of the plastic used to make the item more flexible. The lead content in some of the toys recalled this summer was 180 times the amount allowed by law. Some pieces of jewelry were almost 100% lead. Experts advise that the items do cause a risk and that doctors should urge parents to check the comprehensive lists of recalled products on the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Web site and return any appearing on those lists to the manufacturers. If exposure is suspected, a blood test is in order . Since there is no safe level of this universal element, the risk face by children for lead poisoning and its accompanying threat of learning disabilities and behavior problems is considerable.

The situation you mentioned involves people talking, and Sasha potentially felt overwhelmed or displeased by the noise or lack of attention focused on something important. As a result, Sasha responded by threatening detention to those who continued talking. This reaction suggests that they were agitated and required silence or attention to regain control over the situation. While the choices of \\"laid back\\" and \\"threatened\\" were both provided, they do not accurately depict the situation's context and Sasha's reaction. \\"Laid back\\" indicates a relaxed and unhurried disposition, which contrasts with the described act of threatening detention as a means to manage the ongoing talks. Had Sasha been laid back, they would have either not cared about the chatter or potentially addressed it in a more casual and patient manner. On the other hand, \\"threatened\\" is a term that usually implies being at risk or feeling endangered in a situation, which doesn't seem to be the case for Sasha. In this specific circumstance, Sasha may have felt frustration, but they did not seem to be at the receiving end of an actual threat. Instead, Sasha was the one to threaten others with detention to assert authority and impose discipline. In conclusion, I would describe Sasha as irritated in this particular scenario, as their actions were prompted by a feeling of disturbance and agitation caused by the excessive talking in the room.

We're used to seeing them parade along our television screens, happily singing Hakuna Mutata or humorously saying 'simples'. But it seems Aleksandr Orlov, Timon and their meerkat pals have a secret dark side. A new study has found the cuddly creatures are 'nasty, brutish and short' - and are actually callous killers. Dark side: They might look 'cute and fluffy', but meerkats have a dark side and are 'nasty and brutish', experts claim. The study, carried out by a group of British and South African universities, found the dominant female meerkat uses violence to survive and often abandons other females once they give birth. It then brutally kills and eats their offspring to ensure they have enough food for their own pup and their pool of meerkat 'babysitters'. The study's leader, Dr Matthew Bell, from the University of Edinburgh's School of Biological Sciences, said the findings were all the more shocking because meerkats are 'cute and fluffy'. He said: 'Since meerkats are cute and fluffy, and have been saccharine, anthropomorphized poster children for happy family life, it comes across as more shocking. 'Contrary to the public perception meerkat lives are \\"nasty, brutish and short\\".' Meerkats have been used as loveable creatures on the Compare the Meerkat adverts since 2009 - but researchers say that, in reality, they are not as nice as the advert would have you believe. Timon, pictured here with Pumba in the Lion King, a Disney cartoon film, is also seen as a loveable creature. The study, published in July in Nature. Communications, looked at the effect of giving contraceptive jabs to. female helpers in groups of meerkats in the Kalahari Desert. The jabs. ensured the helpers could not reproduce for six months. During that period, dominant females were less aggressive towards the helpers, foraged more, gained more weight and had bigger pups. The female helpers provided more care and food for the dominant female's offspring. Dr Bell wrote: 'We've done the first clear experiment that measures the value that dominants gain from suppressing their subordinates. 'Such benefits have always been assumed, but never clearly confirmed.' Dr Andrew Young, an evolutionary biologist at Britain's University of Exeter, who was not involved in Bell's study, said: 'That's sort of the niche in which meerkats fit as a nice model, because there's very strong hierarchy but subordinates do still try to breed.' Meerkats are also competitive in captivity, according to Agnes Maluleke from the Johannesburg zoo. The zoo, which has 20 meerkats, has previously had to split up a group when a young pup challenged a dominant female. It turned into a vicious scrap that Maluleke described as 'fighting for life or death'.","completion":"The recent study by a group of British and South African universities has unveiled the dark side of meerkats, which opposes their popular image as cute and fluffy animals from movies and TV. Meerkats are now said to be callous killers who display violence and dominance, particularly among the females, in order to survive. Notably, dominant female meerkats resort to abandonment, killing, and even cannibalism of others' offspring to secure food and resources for their own pup and group of meerkat caretakers. Dr. Matthew Bell, the study's leader from the University of Edinburgh's School of Biological Sciences, expressed that the findings were shocking because of the public's perception of meerkats as 'cute and fluffy,' and the happy family life they portray. However, contrary to this impression, meerkat lives are, in reality, described as \\"nasty, brutish and short.\\" The study, published in Nature Communications, observed the impact of giving contraceptive injections to female helpers in groups of meerkats dwelling in the Kalahari Desert. The contraceptives ensured that the helpers could not reproduce for six months. As a result, the dominant females demonstrated less aggression towards their helpers and focused more on foraging and caring for their offspring. The female helpers, in turn, provided more assistance and food for the dominant female's offspring. Dr. Bell mentioned that this is \\"the first clear experiment that measures the value that dominants gain from suppressing their subordinates.\\" Dr. Andrew Young, an evolutionary biologist at Britain's University of Exeter, who was not a part of Bell's study, added that meerkats are fitting models for this niche research due to the species' strong hierarchy and competitive behaviors. Even in captivity, meerkats display competitiveness, as reported by Agnes Maluleke from the Johannesburg Zoo. One example involves a fierce fight between a young pup and a dominant female when the pup challenged the dominant position, resulting in the intervention of zoo staff to separate the group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don‚Äôt need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Process: - Greenhouse gases are released into the air by human activities - The earth changes energy from the sun into heat - Heat rises from the ground - Greenhouse gas molecules in the atmosphere prevent the heat from going into space - The temperature of the earth increases - The temperature continues to rise and melts the polar ice caps - The temperature rises even faster. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose people build more hydro electric plants happens, how will it affect Less greenhouse gas molecules prevent heat from going into space. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of building more hydroelectric plants can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of reducing greenhouse gas molecules, which in turn, can help in preventing heat from going into space. Direct Effects: 1. Reduced greenhouse gas emissions - Hydroelectric power is a renewable source of energy that generates electricity using the power of moving water. Unlike fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, hydroelectric plants do not emit greenhouse gases during the electricity generation process. By increasing the number of hydroelectric plants, people would be able to generate more electricity from a clean source, leading to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Indirect Effects: 1. Reduced dependency on fossil fuels - As more hydroelectric plants are built, societies can aim to reduce their dependency on fossil fuels for electricity production. This further contributes to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and can play a significant role in mitigating climate change. 2. Transition to renewable energy sources - Building more hydroelectric plants can promote the adoption of other renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and biomass, encouraging the development of a sustainable energy mix. This transition would lead to a lower overall emission of greenhouse gases. 3. Enhanced technology and policies - An increase in hydroelectric plants could drive technological advancements and supportive policies for improved renewable energy generation, storage, and transmission. This, in turn, can lead to more effective and efficient clean energy solutions. 4. Public awareness and behavioral change - The expansion of hydroelectric plants and renewable energy sources might increase public awareness about the need to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, individuals and businesses could potentially adopt cleaner and more energy-efficient practices, further reducing emissions. In conclusion, building more hydroelectric plants can have both direct and indirect effects on reducing greenhouse gas molecules, which can help prevent heat from being trapped in the Earth's atmosphere and lead to less global warming. This perturbation is beneficial in addressing climate change and its consequences."},{"prompt":"Of course, the most unforgettable classmate I had was also the most vicious bully.

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20‚Äôs flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others.

Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic. and a hint : There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Please answer this question : In which organism ATP molecules would be produced, sample A or sample B? Answer:","completion":"ATP molecules would be produced in sample A. Step 1: Understanding the information provided - Sample A has a higher respiration rate induced - Sample B has no respiration rate induced - Sample C is heterotrophic - Sample D is autotrophic - Respiration rate correlates with energy use - Cellular respiration consumes oxygen to produce usable energy in the form of ATP molecules - Glucose is needed for ATP production - Heterotrophic organisms acquire glucose from other organisms - Autotrophic organisms make their own glucose through photosynthesis Step 2: Assessing which sample can produce ATP molecules Since ATP production is linked to cellular respiration, which requires oxygen and glucose, we need to determine which sample would have both. Sample A: Induced higher respiration rate - Higher respiration rate means higher oxygen consumption - Oxygen is required for cellular respiration and ATP production Sample B: Induced no respiration rate - No respiration rate means no oxygen consumption - Oxygen is required for cellular respiration and ATP production From the provided information, Sample A has a higher respiration rate, which means an increased consumption of oxygen, which is necessary for cellular respiration.

I loved the new art at the hospital instead of the old design, because the","completion":"new artwork introduced a sense of freshness and vitality to the environment, which had a significant impact on my overall perception and experience of the space. The old design, while perhaps serving its purpose during its time, felt outdated and uninspired, thus failing to provide the necessary emotional uplift that a hospital should ideally engage. The new art at the hospital featured a contemporary and invigorating approach, showcasing a diverse array of styles, from abstract expressionism to realistic representations. This wide range of artistic techniques and ideas allowed for a broader appeal, ensuring that visitors and patients from all walks of life could find something that resonated with them. Moreover, the art encompassed a vibrant color palette, which contributed to brightening the atmosphere and offsetting the otherwise sterile, clinical setting. The choice of colors was not just appealing to the eyes, but also thoughtfully curated, as research has demonstrated the impact of colors on our psychology and mood. For instance, the inclusion of blue shades invoked a sense of calm and tranquility, while the presence of greens signified growth and healing. Beyond the aesthetic appeal and visual stimulation, the new art at the hospital aimed to provide deeper emotional and psychological support to patients, visitors, and staff. By depicting scenes of nature, such landmarks as parks, mountains, and oceans, the artwork underscored the innate human connection to the environment, inducing feelings of peace, relaxation, and reduced anxiety. Other pieces showcased themes of human resilience and strength, offering inspiration and encouragement to those who might be facing difficult challenges or medical situations. Furthermore, the hospital made an effort to showcase art created by local artists, thus fostering a sense of community within the facility. Patients and visitors could identify with these artists, feeling a connection to their own community and region. This sense of familiarity and belonging has been linked to improved mental health and a greater likelihood of effective recovery. Additionally, the creative process behind the artwork exhibited at the hospital opened up opportunities for therapeutic art programs within the facility. Studies have demonstrated that engaging in art can be helpful for patients, acting as a form of self-expression, stress relief, and emotional outlet. Consequently, hospitals have begun to recognize the importance of promoting art as a means of healing and recovery, and the new art on display helped to advance this movement. In conclusion, the new art at the hospital significantly outshone the old design, providing not only an aesthetic enhancement but also contributing positively to the emotional and psychological well-being of those who occupied the space. The vivid colors, diverse styles, and thoughtfully curated themes offered a refreshing and engaging environment that supported the healing process and fostered a sense of connection and community. As hospitals continue to evolve and adapt to the needs of their patients, it is crucial to embrace the transformative power of art as a crucial component of holistic healthcare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Start each question simply by taking inventory of the building blocks of the pattern. Look for predictable changes from one image to the next, taking note of things like: The number of shapes The size of the shapes The number of sides each shape has The shading of each shape The orientation of each shape The patterns in an abstract reasoning test are dictated by a set of rules or relationships. Once you‚Äôve taken notice of the shapes within a pattern, start looking for the rules that dictate how these shapes change. The items that you noted when evaluating the pattern will often relate to the change in the shapes. For example, the pattern may dictate that the biggest shape in an image has two more sides than the previous image. So the first image may show a triangle, while the second will show a pentagon. Depending on the level of test you are taking, the pattern may have more than one rule governing it. Evaluate each part of the pattern carefully to see if there are multiple rules. Always be prepared for the chance that a pattern may have more than one rule. Once you‚Äôve figured out the rule for the pattern, pick the answer that should come next in the pattern sequence. Be sure to look at each answer option carefully, since they are typically designed to look similar. For example, if each shape in a pattern has two more sides than the previous shape, your test may show a triangle, a pentagon, and a septagon. The answer you would choose, then, would be a nonagon, or a polygon with nine sides. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of something.

Choices: - varying number - three - zero - same number A: Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the question - The question asks about the number of protons in the nuclei of atoms of a particular element. Step 2: Define the key concept - Protons are positively charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom. The number of protons in an atom determines its atomic number and, therefore, the element it represents. Step 3: Compare the choices with the key concept: - Varying number: This would mean that the number of protons changes for atoms of the same element, which is not true, as the number of protons in each atom determines its element. - Three: This answer suggests that all elements have three protons in their nuclei, which is incorrect because different elements have different numbers of protons. - Zero: Atoms must have at least one proton to be classified as an element, making this choice incorrect. - Same number: This statement is accurate, as the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is consistent for a particular element.

Possible A: expensive, wolf, wool, goat, lamb Why is \\"expensive\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Expensive\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it refers to the cost associated with purchasing a sheep. When people go to buy something, one of their primary concerns is usually the price of the product or service. In this context, \\"expensive\\" means that the cost of buying a sheep could potentially be high or more than expected, which is a standard concern for individuals aiming to make a purchase. Other answers such as \\"wolf,\\" \\"wool,\\" \\"goat,\\" and \\"lamb\\" are not as aligned with human common sense in relation to the question. This is because they describe different things: 1. Wolf - A completely different animal and not related to the process of buying a sheep. 2. Wool - A product derived from sheep, but not directly answering the aspect of purchasing a sheep. 3. Goat - Another animal different from sheep, not relevant to the process of buying a sheep. 4. Lamb - A young sheep, which is relevant to sheep buying, but doesn't convey any information about the process or cost associated with the purchase.

(i am so sorry but what were you expecting to read here!) i felt very uncomfortable doing it on the commode so i decided to go to the bathroom and do it squatting the indian way. ( which is anyways proven to be the healthy and hygienic way of taking a shit, but my piece of shit \\"modern\\" hostel doesn't have one indian commode in the hostel). i wash my ass again, put on my pants, go out wash my hands, and enter the bathroom. that walk was the single most painful ten steps in my life. i am not talking a fractured bone pain, i've had it. i am talking tack pins into your penis tip kind of pain. after entering the bathroom i threw my pants faster than naked sasha grey would make me do. i straight up put my finger and thumb of left hand onto my ass like a boss within 5 seconds that son of a bitch centimeter long motherfucker was out of my ass. was i elated! oh my i would have looked like will smith from pursuit of happyness after he cracked the interview. i washed my hands a million times and the piece of leaf too so you all could see!! i swear by the name of all gods humanity believes in that no part of this is made up. i could never have shared this in person and i could not live without sharing this with someone. so yeah .... proof: [the leaf from hell](http://i.imgur.com/0gfkt6x.jpg) Solution:","completion":"A 24-year-old male living in a hostel in South India ate a hurried meal that led to a hilarious and painful ordeal involving a leaf from the meal getting stuck in his anus, ultimately requiring him to manually extract it while feeling immense discomfort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump‚Äôs vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted the agreement in a letter to her Democratic colleagues, saying negotiators \\"fought for and achieved drastic reductions to the Trump/GOP plan,\\" including much less funding for the wall than Trump requested and a limit on the number of immigrants that can be...

Lieutenant Steklov, son of a high-ranking General, is assigned to Afghanistan, hoping to take part in combat and earn some medals before the war ends. Sgt. Arsionov (Aleksei Serebryakov) combines his combat experience and bravery with brutal hazing of young conscripts back on the field base. Major Bandura\`s tour of duty has expired.

This means leaving his mistress Katya (Tatyana Dogileva), a nurse in the base's hospital√¢¬Ä¬îto a much anticipation from Bandura's superior Leonid (Mikhail Zhygalov) who fell in love with Katya. Anxiety is felt by many characters about the change taking place back in the Soviet Union during the Perestroika. Bandura himself thinks he might not be able to adapt. Katya says that Afghanistan will be remembered as the best part of their lives. The Soviet command arranges a deal with a local Afghan warlord that he won't take action against the withdrawing Soviet troops in exchange for weapons and supplies. When asked why he needs more weapons as the war seems to be coming to an end, he replies that his war will go on for a very long time. On its way back to base the convoy that has delivered the supplies is ambushed by another faction of the mujahedin. The paratroopers take cover and fight back with only a few casualties, but the road is blocked by a damaged fuel tanker. While Bandura personally drives a tank to push the tanker off the road, inexperienced Steklov dashes forward attempting to lead troops to counterattack and is badly wounded. Later, his leg is amputated at the hospital, which adds to the stack of Bandura's career problems. Bandura decides to stay with his men for a while and lead a retaliatory mission to finish a mujahedin leader, who is presumed wounded and taken to the neutral warlord's village.

Article: On Saturday, 24 June 1950, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed President Truman that the North Koreans had invaded South Korea. Truman and Acheson discussed a U.S. invasion response and agreed that the United States was obligated to act, paralleling the North Korean invasion with Adolf Hitler's aggressions in the 1930s, with the conclusion being that the mistake of appeasement must not be repeated. Several U.S. industries were mobilized to supply materials, labor, capital, production facilities, and other services necessary to support the military objectives of the Korean War. However, President Truman later acknowledged that he believed fighting the invasion was essential to the American goal of the global containment of communism as outlined in the National Security Council Report 68 (NSC-68) (declassified in 1975): Now answer this question: The US involvement in the Korean War was important to achieving what goal?","completion":"The US involvement in the Korean War was important to achieving the goal of containing the spread of communism globally. This objective was in line with the strategy outlined in the National Security Council Report 68 (NSC-68), which emphasized the need to resist and counteract the expansion of communism to safeguard American national interests, as well as those of its allies. At that time, the United States, under President Truman, adopted a foreign policy approach called \\"containment,\\" which aimed to prevent the further spread of communism. The invasion of South Korea by communist North Korea in June 1950 was viewed as a direct threat to this policy, hence, the United States felt obligated to intervene. The U.S. decision to assist South Korea in repelling North Korea's invasion was driven by the need to uphold its commitment to containment and to prevent appeasement of aggressive communist forces, similar to the mistakes made with Adolf Hitler's aggressions in the 1930s, which led to World War II. Truman and his advisors believed that if the United States did not act against the North Korean invasion, it would send a dangerous message to other communist nations, emboldening them to test the resolve of the United States and its Western allies. Moreover, the United States was also concerned about the domino effect, fearing that the fall of South Korea to communism could lead to further spread of communism in the region, which would ultimately threaten US interests in Asia and around the world. This concern was particularly underscored by the emerging Cold War with the Soviet Union and the rise of the People‚Äôs Republic of China as a new communist power during this period. Therefore, US involvement in the Korean War was crucial in achieving the goal of containment, as well as demonstrating American resolve and commitment to defending democratic values and thwarting the expansion of communism throughout the world."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Title: IT IS TERRIBLE Review: THE LAGGIEST GAME I EVER PLAYED no BODY BUY THIS IT IS A MISTAKE ...

Step 1: Discuss Background of the Ring The 20-carat diamond ring in question is believed to be the engagement ring that ex-NBA player Kris Humphries gave to reality TV star Kim Kardashian when the couple got engaged in 2011.

A Washington state 34-year-old who was born Jeffrey Drew Wilschke apparently legally changed his name to just that back in 2011, and since then, he's made the news every time he's had a run-in with the law. Most recently, Zopittybop-bop-bop was accused of tearing down fliers at the Evergreen State College library Sunday, then scuffling with a responding police officer (including allegedly trying to grab his gun, trying to stab him with a pen, and successfully biting his finger a few times and hitting him in the head with a handcuff case) and fleeing. He then allegedly threw rocks and a brick at a second officer who saw him running, all while somehow fighting off hits from Tasers, batons, and officers' fists alike, the Tri City Herald reports. A third officer had to get involved before Zopittybop-bop-bop was finally arrested. He's been charged with two counts of first-degree assault, third-degree assault, third-degree malicious mischief, and malicious harassment.

His latest alleged offense occurred at Evergreen State College library, where he was accused of tearing down fliers. Zopittybop-bop-bop then allegedly scuffled with a responding police officer, trying to grab his gun, attempting to stab him with a pen, biting his finger a few times, and hitting him in the head with a handcuff case before fleeing. He was reportedly seen running and accused of throwing rocks and a brick at a second officer while resisting hits from Tasers, batons, and officers' fists. Ultimately, it took a third officer to assist in apprehending Zopittybop-bop-bop. He has now been charged with two counts of first-degree assault, third-degree assault, third-degree malicious mischief, and malicious harassment. Zopittybop-bop-bop initially made headlines in 2012 for facing charges of drug possession, weapons violations, and probation violation in Wisconsin. In 2013, he was arrested again in Iowa on drug charges.

Sentence 2: Coney Bay is a natural bay on the island of Newfoundland in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador , Canada . It is east of Otter Bay . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"Let's break down the information in each sentence step-by-step to compare them. Sentence 1: 1. Otter Bay is a natural bay. 2. Otter Bay is on the island of Coney Bay. 3. Coney Bay is located in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. 4. Otter Bay is located east of Newfoundland. Sentence 2: 1. Coney Bay is a natural bay. 2. Coney Bay is on the island of Newfoundland. 3. Newfoundland is in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. 4. Coney Bay is east of Otter Bay. Step-by-step comparison: 1. Both sentences describe a natural bay, but Sentence 1 is about Otter Bay, while Sentence 2 is about Coney Bay. 2. Sentence 1 states Otter Bay is on the island of Coney Bay, while Sentence 2 mentions that Coney Bay is on the island of Newfoundland. This information is conflicting. 3. Both sentences agree that the bays are located in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. 4. Sentence 1 indicates that Otter Bay is east of Newfoundland, whereas Sentence 2 states that Coney Bay is east of Otter Bay. This information could be potentially consistent if the two bays are on the same island. In conclusion, the two sentences do not convey the same information due to differences in details about the locations of Otter Bay and Coney Bay. The precise relationship between the two bays is not entirely clear, but there may be some overlap or consistency in their locations if they are both situated on the island of Newfoundland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Everyone continued to stare at Digger, curiosity piqued, as they wondered how and why he had a centrifuge in his bedroom. \\"You know, I'm a bit of an amateur scientist,\\" Digger continued. \\"I like to dabble in various fields of study in my spare time, including astronomy, chemistry, and even a little bit of biology. Having a centrifuge at my disposal broadens my range of experiments and research.\\" Neville raised an eyebrow, feeling both impressed and skeptical. \\"Interesting hobbies, I must say,\\" he said, attempting to hide his disbelief. \\"Would you care to give us an example of one of your experiments that required a centrifuge?\\" Digger began to explain, slowly and deliberately, so everyone could understand. \\"Well, one of my recent projects involved the separation of bacterial cultures from liquid media samples. The centrifuge allowed me to isolate the bacteria by spinning the samples at high speeds, causing the heavier bacterial cells to be pushed to the bottom, leaving the liquid media on top.\\" As he spoke, the others began to lose their skepticism and started to nod along, having a newfound respect for Digger's hobby. \\"Another time,\\" Digger continued, \\"I wanted to test the purity of a homemade herbal oil, so I used the centrifuge to separate the oil from any possible solid impurities. It wasn't a complicated experiment, but it was fascinating to see how the centrifuge can yield such clear results.\\" \\"Wow,\\" Neville said, genuinely intrigued. \\"I had no idea you were into science like that, Digger.\\" Digger grinned, happy to share his passion for the first time with his friends. \\"There's a lot more to me than meets the eye,\\" he said, winking at them. \\"Anyway, my point is, I cannot simply unplug the centrifuge. It's an essential part of my ensemble of scientific tools.\\" The room fell silent as everyone contemplated the situation at hand. Eventually, Louise piped up and struck a compromise. \\"Alright, since we can't unplug the centrifuge, what if we switch some things around on the surge protector? That way, we can free up enough space for the power brick without having to remove anything important.\\" Everybody agreed to this proposal, and they quickly got to work rearranging the various plugs on the surge protector. To their satisfaction, they managed to make enough room for the power brick without causing any disturbance to Digger's scientific setup. As they all settled back down, they marveled at how everyone's unique interests and skills came together to solve a seemingly inconsequential issue. From Neville's questioning to Louise's practicality, they each played a role in finding a solution, allowing Digger to maintain his unique mix of bedroom items.

Question: How Do You Get Hepatitis C Suggestion: An estimated 130‚Äì200 million people worldwide are infected with . A:","completion":"False The given suggestion does not provide a correct or complete answer to the question, \\"How Do You Get Hepatitis C.\\" The suggestion merely states that an estimated 130-200 million people worldwide are infected with (presumably Hepatitis C), but it does not give any information on how the infection occurs or how Hepatitis C is transmitted. A more appropriate answer to the question would be as follows: Hepatitis C is a viral infection caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). It primarily affects the liver and is spread through contact with the blood of an infected person. The most common ways of transmission include: 1. Sharing drug injection equipment: Hepatitis C is commonly spread among people who share needles, syringes, or other equipment used to inject drugs. 2. Receiving contaminated blood products: Before 1992, Hepatitis C was often transmitted through blood transfusions and organ transplants from infected donors. Since then, rigorous screening procedures have been implemented, significantly reducing this risk. 3. Unsterile medical or dental equipment: Infection can occur if medical, dental, or other healthcare-related equipment is not adequately sterilized after exposure to HCV-positive blood. 4. Needlestick injuries: Healthcare workers are at risk of Hepatitis C if they accidentally prick themselves with a contaminated needle. 5. Tattooing and body piercing: Getting a tattoo or piercing in an unregulated setting with contaminated equipment may increase the risk of Hepatitis C. 6. Sexual transmission: While less common, sexual transmission can occur, particularly if a person has rough or unprotected sex with multiple partners, has an existing sexually transmitted infection (STI), or has a history of other blood-borne infections like HIV. 7. Vertical transmission: Hepatitis C may be passed from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth. It is important to note that Hepatitis C is not spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing, or sharing utensils or living spaces with an infected person."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- The crisis over the Egyptian constitution triggered by President Mohamed Morsy's adoption of sweeping powers is just the latest chapter in a long-standing ideological struggle in the Middle East. Morsy, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate who came to power after the 2011 Arab Spring revolution that deposed long-time Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, says he needs the new powers \\"to speed reform.\\" His rivals say it is all motivated by the Brotherhood's Islamist agenda for controlling the country. Morsy is not the first -- and given the upheavals of the Arabic Spring, is unlikely to be the last -- Muslim leader to seek a constitutional way to create functioning state institutions in a region where the collapse of the Ottoman Empire led more often to tyranny or puppet regimes than strong democratic states.

The correct answer is \\"Egyptian president\\" because, according to the passage, President Mohamed Morsy was the first freely-elected president after the 2011 Arab Spring revolution in Egypt. He was from the Muslim Brotherhood, but the passage specifically refers to him as the Egyptian president. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - Arab Spring president: The term \\"Arab Spring\\" refers to a series of uprisings and revolutions in multiple Arab countries, not a specific president or country's leader. - Arabic Spring president: The correct term is \\"Arab Spring,\\" not \\"Arabic Spring.\\" - Brotherhood president: The passage refers to Morsy's affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood, but calling him the \\"Brotherhood president\\" is not as accurate as \\"Egyptian president.\\" - CNN president: This is irrelevant as CNN is a news organization, not a political entity. - Hosni Mubarak president: Hosni Mubarak was the previous president, not the first freely-elected one after the Arab Spring. - Islamist president: While Morsy has an Islamist agenda, the passage identifies him specifically as the Egyptian president. - Middle East president: This is too vague and doesn't specify a particular country. - Mohamed Morsy president: While this answer includes the name of the president, it doesn't clarify the country, making it less accurate than \\"Egyptian president.\\" - Morsy president: Same reasoning as the \\"Mohamed Morsy president\\" option above. - Muslim president: This is too broad and doesn't specify a particular country. - Muslim Brotherhood president: Again, although Morsy is from the Muslim Brotherhood, the passage specifically refers to him as the Egyptian president, which is more accurate. - Ottoman Empire president: The Ottoman Empire collapsed long before the Arab Spring and is not relevant to the question."},{"prompt":"You are given a sentence in Arabic.

Alan is impressed by Gwen and hires her to be the new head teacher at the small private school he and his sister, well-known journalist Stephanie Bax, run for the local children in the village of Heddaby. Upon moving into the teacher's cottage, Gwen asks her maid, Valerie Creek, where she might find the rectory.

The animals reduce the size of their brains and skulls as winter approaches and regrow them in the spring, say researchers They use echolocation to explore their habitat and produce an unpleasant scent to avoid being eaten by cats. But the common shrew has another survival trick: as winter approaches, its skull shrinks and then regrows in the spring. Dubbed ‚ÄúDehnel‚Äôs phenomenon‚Äù after the scientist who first spotted the effect, the shrinkage has previously been studied by looking at the skulls of shrews that died at different times of year. But since the changes weren‚Äôt followed in the same animals, it was not clear whether other factors might be responsible, such as smaller shrews being better able to survive the winter months. Now researchers say they have finally shown the phenomenon is real. ‚ÄúNow for sure we can say this is happening [within] individuals ‚Äì we can really talk about the shrinkage and regrowth,‚Äù said Javier L√°zaro, co-author of the research from the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology. The phenomenon, he adds, appears to be an unusual way to prepare for the harsh months of winter. ‚ÄúThese animals cannot hibernate [and] they cannot migrate and they live in a very seasonal environment ‚Äì so they need some alternative strategy to deal with winter,‚Äù said L√°zaro, adding the shrews need to eat near-constantly to survive and that smaller animals need less food. ‚ÄúIf you shrink an organ like the brain which is disproportionally more ‚Äòexpensive‚Äô than other kinds of tissue you might save energy,‚Äù he said. Writing in the journal Current Biology, L√°zaro and colleagues from Germany and the US report how they captured shrews of the species Sorex araneus, or ‚Äúcommon shrew‚Äù, between summer 2014 and autumn 2015. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The pygmy shrew, Sorex minutus, which also undergoes Dehnel‚Äôs phenomenon. Photograph: Christian Ziegler The team measured each animal‚Äôs body mass and took X-rays of its head while the creature was under anaesthetic. The animal was then microchipped and released back to the same spot. In total 37 shrews were captured more than once by the team, allowing the researchers to explore changes in the skulls size of individual creatures as the seasons changed. The results reveal that the animals‚Äô body mass changed over the year: during the autumn it fell by 17.6%, before increasing by 83.4% in the spring, ahead of the onset of the breeding season. However the animals‚Äô skulls also changed in size, with the height of the shrews‚Äô brain cases decreasing just over 15% on average during the autumn, before regrowing by 9.3% during the spring months. What‚Äôs more, while shrews generally don‚Äôt live for much more than a year, data collected from a small number of elderly creatures reveals that they appear to undergo a second shrinkage in skull size as they approach a second winter. ‚ÄúThe fact that they shrink a second time in a second winter, really suggests [a] correlation between seasonality and the skull size and not just an ageing effect,‚Äù said L√°zaro. But, he added, mysteries remain, not least why the brain case does not completely regrow in adults in the spring (leaving them with a smaller skull than juveniles despite having a greater body mass), how exactly tissue is reabsorbed to generate the shrinkage, and what is driving the effect. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know [to what extent] this is genetically programmed, and to which point this is influenced by environmental factors,‚Äù said L√°zaro, adding that his current research is looking at how the brain itself also shrinks, and the effects of such changes on the animals‚Äô cognition and behaviour. But, it seems the common shrew is not alone: research has revealed that other species of red-toothed shrews as well as weasels appear to show Dehnel‚Äôs phenomenon. Dr Allan McDevitt, a shrew biologist from the University of Salford who was not involved in the study, said that the research highlighted the drastic changes some species of shrew undergo to cope with the cold. But, he added, the research also threw up conundrums about how such animals might respond to climate change, and might also have ramifications for human health. Dr Anna Champneys, an expert in small mammals at Nottingham Trent University, described the study as fascinating. ‚ÄúIf scientists can work out how skeletons grow and shrink it will aid our understanding of skeletal diseases and could potentially provide a cure one day,‚Äù she said. ||||| Right now, as autumn descends upon the Northern Hemisphere, many animals are preparing for the frigid and lean winter months. Bears are going through a serious bulking phase. Hares and stoats are changing the colors of their coats. Oh, and shrews‚Äô heads are shrinking. New research shows that the skull of at least one variety of shrew actually shrivels in size every winter. The research team, led by scientists at Germany‚Äôs Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, not only discovered that the shrews sport this surreal, skull-wilting ability, but that they shrink their skulls repeatedly and on a seasonal cycle. The shrews‚Äô skulls shrink during the winter, but then miraculously grow back nearly all their original mass in the spring and summer, according to new research published today in the journal Current Biology. This sets the shrews up to do it all over again at the end of the year, which honestly sounds like they‚Äôve been saddled with some cruel, recurring witch‚Äôs curse. There was some initial inkling that a seasonal pattern was at play. Scientists had previously described an odd relationship between skull size and season in some shrew and weasel species, where winter was full of individuals with smaller skulls, and summer was dominated by animals with comparatively voluminous noggins. This observation‚Äîtermed ‚Äúthe Dehnel phenomenon‚Äù‚Äîwas first reported by Polish zoologist August Dehnel in the early 20th century, and alternatively sounds like the title of next summer‚Äôs poorest performing young adult science fiction film. Generally, it was thought that the Dehnel phenomenon was produced by population filtering effects of the passing seasons, where larger individuals (with larger heads) simply didn‚Äôt live through the winter as readily as their smaller compatriots. This is an understandable hypothesis to make, considering the other option was that shrews were expanding and contracting their skulls like a slowly beating heart. This is objectively crazier, and also, in one of nature‚Äôs lovely twists, apparently the accurate explanation. Advertisement By tracking the skull measurements of wild common shrews (Sorex araneus) over the course of a year, the researchers were able to show how individual shrews shrank and regrew their skulls. They trapped shrews and took detailed x-ray measurements of their skulls. Before being released back into the wild, the shrews were also anesthetized and implanted with a microchip, allowing for identification of specific individuals for any recaptures. The research team was able to recapture a dozen shrews at three points over the year‚Äîwinter, spring, and summer‚Äîand measure their skulls at each timepoint. The shrews experienced some rather incredible changes, losing as much as 20 percent of their skulls in the winter months, and regaining 15 percent later in the year. The recaptured shrews all showed the same annual pattern: the skulls were largest in the summer, waned in the winter, and then rebounded in the spring. Much of the shrinkage occurred around the shrews‚Äô braincase, substantially flattening its roof. It‚Äôs not yet known how the shrews are able to accomplish this. It‚Äôs possible that tissue where skull bones meet is reabsorbed, shrinking the braincase volume, and then regenerating those same sutures in the spring. This is obviously awesome and weird as hell, but...why? The answer may reside in other anatomical seasonal changes. Alongside the shrinking skulls, shrew brains lose a hefty portion of their mass, and there is also winter reduction in organ size and spine length. In this study, the shrews managed to lose about a fifth of their body mass overall. This rollback on specific areas of the shrew bod‚Äô might be an energy-saving adaptation, throttling down disproportionately calorie-sucking apps like brains. Shrews don‚Äôt hibernate or migrate, so they have to overwinter as is‚Äîwhich is a condition not well-suited for times of wintertime food scarcity. Shrews may look like mice, but they are close relatives of moles and hedgehogs, are voracious invertebrate-devouring mini-predators, and have famously-extreme metabolic rates‚Äîsometimes requiring their own body weight or more in food daily. Mercilessly cutting back on energy output by downgrading whole organs might be the only way these little guys can make it through winter without starving. Advertisement Whatever the reason for this seasonal shrinking, figuring out how shrews pull it off may be of importance to humans. The researchers note that if shrews can reverse their own bone loss, we could potentially co-opt the process for treatment of degenerative bone diseases in humans.

To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilard and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilard, to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research. A secret German facility, apparently the largest of the Third Reich, covering 75 acres in an underground complex, was being re-excavated in Austria in December 2014 and may have been planned for use in nuclear research and development. The letter is believed to be \\"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\\". In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first. As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the \\"race\\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \\"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\\" to initiate the Manhattan Project.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet, FRSE (15 August 1771 - 21 September 1832) was a Scottish historical novelist, playwright, poet and historian. Many of his works remain classics of both English-language literature and of Scottish literature. Famous titles include Ivanhoe, Rob Roy, Old Mortality, The Lady of the Lake, Waverley, The Heart of Midlothian and The Bride of Lammermoor. Although primarily remembered for his extensive literary works and his political engagement, Scott was an advocate, judge and legal administrator by profession, and throughout his career combined his writing and editing work with his daily occupation as Clerk of Session and Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire. As a boy, youth and young man, Scott was fascinated by the oral traditions of the Scottish Borders. He was an obsessive collector of stories, and developed an innovative method of recording what he heard at the feet of local story-tellers using carvings on twigs, to avoid the disapproval of those who believed that such stories were neither for writing down nor for printing. At the age of 25 he began to write professionally, translating works from German, his first publication being rhymed versions of ballads by Gottfried August Burger in 1796. He then published an idiosyncratic three-volume set of collected ballads of his adopted home region, The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border. This was the first sign from a literary standpoint of his interest in Scottish history. As a result of his early polio infection, Scott had a pronounced limp. He was described in 1820 as tall, well formed (except for one ankle and foot which made him walk lamely), neither fat nor thin, with forehead very high, nose short, upper lip long and face rather fleshy, complexion fresh and clear, eyes very blue, shrewd and penetrating, with hair now silvery white. Although a determined walker, on horseback he experienced greater freedom of movement. Unable to consider a military career, Scott enlisted as a volunteer in the 1st Lothian and Border yeomanry. On a trip to the Lake District with old college friends he met Charlotte Charpentier (or Carpenter), daughter of Jean Charpentier of Lyon in France, and ward of Lord Downshire in Cumberland, an Episcopalian. After three weeks of courtship, Scott proposed and they were married on Christmas Eve 1797 in St Mary's Church, Carlisle (a church set up in the now destroyed nave of Carlisle Cathedral). After renting a house in George Street, they moved to nearby South Castle Street. They had five children, of whom four survived by the time of Scott's death, most baptized by an Episcopalian clergyman. In 1799 he was appointed Sheriff-Depute of the County of Selkirk, based in the Royal Burgh of Selkirk. In his early married days Scott had a decent living from his earnings at the law, his salary as Sheriff-Depute, his wife's income, some revenue from his writing, and his share of his father's rather meagre estate. After their third son was born in 1801, they moved to a spacious three-storey house built for Scott at 39 North Castle Street. This remained Scott's base in Edinburgh until 1826, when he could no longer afford two homes. From 1798 Scott had spent the summers in a cottage at Lasswade, where he entertained guests including literary figures, and it was there that his career as an author began. There were nominal residency requirements for his position of Sheriff-Depute, and at first he stayed at a local inn during the circuit. In 1804 he ended his use of the Lasswade cottage and leased the substantial house of Ashestiel, 6 miles (9.7 km) from Selkirk. It was sited on the south bank of the River Tweed, and the building incorporated an old tower house. Scott's father, also Walter (1729-1799), was a Freemason, being a member of Lodge St David, No.36 (Edinburgh), and Scott also became a Freemason in his father's Lodge in 1801, albeit only after the death of his father. who is his wife","completion":"Sir Walter Scott's wife was Charlotte Charpentier (or Carpenter).

Mr Trump said on Sunday the system was unfair and he preferred a simple vote. But on Tuesday he insisted he would have still won a straight vote because he would have focused more on the big states won by Mrs Clinton. \\"I would have campaigned in N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily\\" the president-elect said on Twitter. He lost New York and California. Meanwhile, retiring Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer from California has filed legislation to abolish the electoral college, saying the system was \\"outdated, undemocratic\\". It is unlikely that the bill will be passed at it would involve a constitutional amendment, which would require passage by two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate, and then in three-quarters of states. Was Trump's election democratic? Full results on one page Can Donald Trump get what he wants? In an interview on Sunday with the 60 Minutes programme Mr Trump complained about the electoral college system, in which each state is worth a different number of votes, saying that he preferred the popular vote method. He said that he has \\"respect\\" for the electoral college system \\"but I would rather see it where you went with simple votes\\". \\"You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win,\\" he told interviewer Lesley Stahl. It's not the first time Mr Trump has lashed out at the voting system. On election night 2012, he incorrectly tweeted that Mitt Romney had won the popular vote but lost to Barack Obama: \\"He lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election. We should have a revolution in this country!\\" In a subsequent post from that night he added \\"the electoral college is a disaster for a democracy\\" and \\"the phoney electoral college made a laughing stock out of our nation\\". Bernie Sanders, the populist candidate who ran against Mrs Clinton in the Democratic primary, has also questioned the electoral college system. When asked by USA Today if the electoral college should be changed, he responded \\"I think you ought to think about this... I think we want to rethink that.\\" Mr Trump has set up a transition team to help assemble his cabinet.

WHITE HOUSE ‚Äî A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country‚Äôs major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party‚Äôs conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump‚Äôs much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. ‚ÄúWe can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,‚Äù Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president‚Äôs policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,‚Äù Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota.

It lies in the Zone of Avoidance and is heavily obscured by the Milky Way. The size and mass of Dwingeloo 1 are comparable to those of Triangulum Galaxy. - Dwingeloo 2 is a small irregular galaxy discovered in 1996 and located about 10 million light - years away from the Earth . Its discovery was a result of Dwingeloo Obscured Galaxy Survey ( DOGS ) of the Zone of Avoidance . Dwingeloo 2 is a companion galaxy of Dwingeloo 1 . Dwingeloo 2 was first detected at radio wavelengths from the 21 cm emission line of neutral atomic hydrogen ( known to astronomers as HI ) in the course of follow - up observations after the discovery of Dwingeloo 1 . Dwingeloo 2 is thought to be a member of the IC 342/Maffei Group , a galaxy group adjacent to the Local Group . The galaxy recedes from the Milky Way at the speed of about 241 km / s. The visible radius of Dwingeloo 2 is approximately 2 , which at the distance of 3 Mpc corresponds to about 2 kpc . Dwingeloo 2 has a well defined rotating HI disk inclined at approximately 69 ¬∞ with respect to observer . The distribution of the neutral hydrogen in Dwingeloo 2 is quite irregular , and it is detected as far as 3.2 kpc from the center of the galaxy . The total mass of the galaxy within this radius is estimated at 2.3 billion Solar masses , while the mass of the neutral hydrogen is estimated at about 100 million Solar masses . The total mass of the galaxy is about five times less than that of Dwingeloo 1 . The irregular structure of Dwingeloo 2 is likely related to its interaction with the much larger nearby galaxy Dwingeloo 1 , which lies at a distance of only 24 kpc from Dwingeloo 2 . - A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. - An irregular galaxy is a galaxy that does not have a distinct regular shape, unlike a spiral or an elliptical galaxy. Irregular galaxies do not fall into any of the regular classes of the Hubble sequence, and they are often chaotic in appearance, with neither a nuclear bulge nor any trace of spiral arm structure. - The Triangulum Galaxy is a spiral galaxy approximately 3 million light-years (ly) from Earth in the constellation Triangulum. It is catalogued as Messier 33 or NGC 598, and is sometimes informally referred to as the Pinwheel Galaxy, a nickname it shares with Messier 101. The Triangulum Galaxy is the third-largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, behind the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. It is one of the most distant permanent objects that can be viewed with the naked eye.

Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the analysis of the text, the reviewer displays a clear negative tone towards the product (in this case the book). My justification for this is based on the use of negative adjectives such as \\"vapid\\", \\"insipid\\", \\"shallow\\", and \\"embarrassing\\" to characterize their opinion about the book. The reviewer also expresses disappointment that the book was received as a gift, which again indicates dissatisfaction and reinforces the negative tone.

Paul served in Congress three different periods: first from 1976 to 1977, after he won a special election, then from 1979 to 1985, and finally from 1997 to 2013. In his early years, Paul served on the House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in the savings and loan crisis. Paul argued for a return to the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873-1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress. During his first term, Paul founded the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE), a non-profit think tank dedicated to promoting principles of limited government and free-market economics. In 1984, Paul became the first chairman of the Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), a conservative political group founded by Charles and David Koch \\"to fight for less government, lower taxes, and less regulation.\\" CSE started a Tea Party protest against high taxes in 2002. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. The two organizations would become key players in the Tea Party movement from 2009 onward. Paul proposed term-limit legislation multiple times, while himself serving four terms in the House of Representatives. In 1984, he decided to retire from the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate, complaining in his House farewell address that \\"Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare... It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic.\\" Paul lost the Republican primary to Phil Gramm, who had switched parties the previous year from Democrat to Republican.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Justice League, with Cyborg's assistance, stop the Royal Flush Gang's attempted robery of a diamond vault using complex technology that allows them to pass through solid objects. Meanwhile, Vandal Savage plots to exterminate the greater part of the human population and start a new civilization; he discreetly gave the technology to the Gang for testing purposes. To ensure the Justice League cannot stop him, Savage hires Mirror Master to hack into the Batcomputer and steal contingency plans devised by Batman to incapacitate his League teammates, in case they go rogue. Savage assembles Mirror Master, Bane, Cheetah, Ma'alefa'ak, Star Sapphire, and Metallo, who all have personal vendettas against the heroes and pays them to simultaneously attack using the stolen plans, albeit altered to be lethal. When the supervillains agree, he welcomes them to the Legion of Doom. The villains each do their part to take out each member of the Justice League: Batman, as Bruce Wayne, is informed by Alfred Pennyworth that the bodies of Thomas and Martha Wayne have been exhumed and are missing. At his parents' graves, Bruce is ambushed by Bane, who gains the upper hand and renders Bruce unconscious. Bruce is buried alive in his father's coffin; he is left a tape recorder with a message from Bane taunting him, which motivates him to break out of the coffin. He realizes that the League has been attacked using his contingency plans, which were constructed from studying physical and psychological weaknesses in the event the League went to the other side or succumbed to mind control. With Cyborg's help, he saves his teammates one by one. Wonder Woman is attacked by Cheetah with a scratch that sends nanomachines into her bloodstream. The nanomachines attach to the brain stem and cause her to believe everyone she sees... Answer:","completion":"Considering the movie plot provided in which the Justice League members are being attacked using stolen contingency plans created by Batman to incapacitate them if needed, the technology provided to the Royal Flush Gang by Vandal Savage for testing purposes to advance his plans for a new civilization, and the formation of the Legion of Doom by gathering supervillains with personal vendettas against the heroes, an appropriate question to ask about this movie plot could be: How will the Justice League adapt and overcome the challenges posed by the Legion of Doom and Vandal Savage's nefarious plans, particularly given that the very contingency plans designed to protect them are now being weaponized against them, and what key factors or strategies contribute to their success in thwarting the villains' plans for a new civilization? This question addresses the central conflict within the movie plot and invites a deeper exploration of the themes of trust, redemption, and teamwork, as well as an analysis of the unique abilities, strengths, and vulnerabilities of each individual Justice League member. The answer would involve a discussion of how the members of the Justice League not only regain control over the stolen contingency plans and dismantle the Legion of Doom's efforts but also evaluate and reassess the ethical implications of having these types of plans in place. Furthermore, the answer could explore their collective response to Vandal Savage's sinister long-term vision for humanity and how they work together to protect the human population in light of this existential threat. Additionally, the question allows for potential character development insights, as the League members come to terms with Batman's contingency plans and the breaches in trust this may expose, together with how the experience ultimately brings the team closer together in the pursuit of justice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Big Butte Creek drains approximately 245 square miles (635 km2) of southern Oregon. Elevations range from 1,562 feet (476.1 m) at the creek's mouth to 9,495 feet (2,894 m) at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of 3,528 feet (1,075 m). About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford.The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from 10 ¬∞F (‚àí12 ¬∞C) in the winter to 100 ¬∞F (38 ¬∞C) in the summer. Precipitation averages between 35 and 80 inches (890 and 2,000 mm) annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the South Fork Rogue River to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west.

Answer the following question: Information: - Arsaces I (\\"Arshak\\") was the founder of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia, and after whom all 30+ monarchs of the Arsacid empire officially named themselves. A celebrated descent from antiquity (the Bagratid \\"line\\") begins with Arsaces. Arsaces or Ashk has also given name to the city of Ashkabad. - The Parthian Empire (247 BC 224 AD), also known as the Arsacid Empire, was a major Iranian political and cultural power in ancient Iran and Iraq. Its latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who, as leader of the Parni tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in Iran's northeast, then a satrapy (province) in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I of Parthia (r. \\"c\\". 171138 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates, in what is now central-eastern Turkey, to eastern Iran. The empire, located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han Empire of China, became a center of trade and commerce. - Mithridates III of Parthia ( Persian : ) ruled the Parthian Empire c. 57 -- 54 BC. Mithridates was a son of Phraates III , whom he murdered in 57 BC , with the assistance of his brother Orodes . Orodes became king of Parthia and made Mithridates king of Media , a Parthian client state . On account of his cruelty , Orodes turned on his brother and disposed him . Mithridates was forced to flee from Media to Roman Syria . He took refuge with Aulus Gabinius , the Roman proconsul and governor of Syria . Mithridates then returned to invade Parthia with Gabinius in support . The Roman proconsul marched with Mithridates to the Euphrates , but turned back to restore another ruler , Ptolemy XII Auletes of Egypt , to his throne . Despite losing his Roman support , Mithridates advanced into Mesopotamia and managed to conquer Babylonia . He ousted Orodes and briefly restored his reign as king in 55 BC , minting coins in Seleucia until 54 BC. However , king Mithridates was besieged by Orodes ' general , Surena , in Seleucia , and after a prolonged resistance , offered battle to Orodes ' forces and was defeated . Mithridates was taken prisoner and executed in 54 BC by Orodes . - The Seleucid Empire (\\"Basile√≠a tn Seleukidn\\") was a Hellenistic state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty, which existed from 312 BC to 63 BC; it was founded by Seleucus I Nicator following the division of the Macedonian empire vastly expanded by Alexander the Great. Seleucus received Babylonia and, from there, expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander's near eastern territories. At the height of its power, it included central Anatolia, Persia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and what is now Kuwait, Afghanistan, and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan. What is the relationship between 'mithridates iii of parthia' and 'arsacid dynasty of parthia'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between Mithridates III of Parthia and the Arsacid Dynasty of Parthia lies in the fact that Mithridates III was a ruler in the Arsacid Dynasty of the Parthian Empire. The Arsacid Dynasty was the ruling dynasty of the Parthian Empire, founded by Arsaces I in the mid-3rd century BC. This empire was a significant political and cultural power in ancient Iran and Iraq, and its rulers formally named themselves after Arsaces. Mithridates III of Parthia ruled the Parthian Empire from approximately 57 to 54 BC and was a descendant of the Arsacid Dynasty. He was a son of Phraates III, whom he murdered with the assistance of his brother Orodes to claim power. While Orodes became the king of Parthia, Mithridates gained control of Media, a Parthian client state. However, due to his cruel acts, Orodes turned against him, forcing Mithridates to flee to Roman Syria, where he sought support to invade and take back Parthia. Although he temporarily reclaimed power in 55 BC, he was eventually defeated, captured, and executed by Orodes' forces in 54 BC. As a ruler during the Arsacid Dynasty, Mithridates III contributed to the complex and shifting political landscape of the Parthian Empire. His tumultuous reign was marked by conflict and betrayal, ultimately leading to his demise amidst the power struggles typical of this era in the Arsacid Dynasty. Thus, the relationship between Mithridates III of Parthia and the Arsacid Dynasty can be characterized by shared lineage, affiliation, and historical significance within the broader narrative of the Parthian Empire's development and decline."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So i ' m really getting nervous about school . and only my close friends know exactly why . i wish the world could just stop for a little bit so my summer wo nt be over in like a week and a half . Why does the narrator with that the world would stop ?","completion":"The narrator in the passage wishes for the world to stop, likely due to a range of emotions and concerns surrounding the imminent return to school. From the provided information, we can infer several reasons for the narrator's desire for the world to stop: 1. Anxiety about school: The narrator explicitly mentions feeling nervous about school. This anxiety could be attributed to a variety of factors, such as academic performance, social situations, or transitioning to a new phase of education. The prospect of facing these challenges after a break could be daunting and lead to the wish for time to stand still, allowing them to temporarily escape these struggles. 2. Enjoyment of Summer: The mention of summer ending in \\"like a week and a half\\" suggests that the narrator has enjoyed their time off and wants to prolong it. Summer vacation is often considered a time to relax, engage in fun activities, and unwind from the pressures of school. The desire for the world to stop reflects their wish to maintain this carefree state for a longer period. 3. Fear of change: The end of summer and the start of the school year often bring changes to one's routine and social environment, which can be difficult for some individuals to manage. The narrator possibly fears facing these changes, and therefore, the idea of pausing the world may offer a sense of security and comfort in maintaining the current state of affairs. 4. Sharing concerns: The narrator mentions that only their close friends know the exact reasons for their anxiety. This could further emphasize their apprehension about expressing their thoughts openly and confronting their feelings. By wishing for the world to stop, they might be hoping for an opportunity to process their feelings and gather support from others without worrying about progressing too quickly into the school year. In conclusion, the narrator wants the world to stop due to a combination of factors, such as anxiety about school, a desire to prolong the enjoyable experiences of summer, fear of change, and a need for more time to process their emotions and gather support. This pause in time would provide temporary relief from the challenges they anticipate facing as they return to school."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Plot title: Grotesque Movie plot: A young couple Aki and Kazuo are snatched off the street while having their first date as a romantic couple after a few years working in the same office, and wake up shackled in a basement, which has all its walls covered with plastic. With no further explanation, a sadistic madman degrades, tortures and mutilates them. Initially, he punctures Kazuo's belly with a screwdriver and slices his tongue, then rapes both, one at a time, forcing the other to watch. Sometimes he stops the torture to provide medical assistance and cure the couple's wounds, so they can continue alive for a long period of time. This way he cuts off all their fingers, makes collars with them, pops out Kazuo's right eye, removes the girl's nipples and cuts off her right arm. As the torture progresses, it is revealed he is simply doing it for sexual stimulation, and tells the couple he wants the two to survive. He finally castrates Kazuo, claiming he has found all the sexual relief he needs, so no longer needs the couple's \\"services\\". Then the couple is moved to a room which resembles a modern and clean hospital room, where the kidnapper takes care of the couple's wounds.

During late adulthood, various physiological changes occur, and the risk of developing age-related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer increases. The immune system becomes less effective with age, leading to a higher susceptibility to common diseases like influenza. These diseases can be more severe and even life-threatening for older adults. Additionally, the decline in strength and stamina, compromised sensory perception, and slower reflex time are also indicative of a weakening immune system. In contrast, Ann, who is in her late 40's, has a relatively stronger immune system since she is comparatively younger. While she is also experiencing age-related changes, her body's ability to fight off infections and maintain overall health is better than that of her mother, Mary. Both Mary and Ann engage in regular workouts, which are beneficial for their health. Exercise has been shown to improve immune function, aid in maintaining a healthy weight, and decrease the risk of chronic diseases. Despite this, given Mary's age, her immune system remains weaker in comparison to Ann's. It's essential for both Mary and Ann to continue their regular exercise routines and maintain a healthy lifestyle to support their immune systems. Additionally, Mary should consider consulting her healthcare professional for age-appropriate interventions and recommendations to manage her health issues and bolster her immune system further."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Overseas, the company signed up more users than it expected, adding 2.74 million subscribers compared with a forecast of 2.4 million. ... ||||| Video-streaming service provider Netflix Inc reported third-quarter U.S. subscriber additions below its own forecast, blaming a transition to chip-based cards for the miss. Shares of Netflix, known for its original shows such as \\"House of Cards\\" and \\"Orange is the New Black\\", plunged about 15 percent after the bell, before clawing back to trade down 2.4 percent. U.S. credit and debit card companies have been shifting to chip-enabled cards ahead of the Oct. 1 deadline mandated for the switch. For Netflix, the switch meant that many of the older cards on its file no longer worked as the companies gave new cards to their customers, leading to \\"involuntary churn,\\" as Chief Executive Reed Hastings put it in a letter to shareholders. \\"It's just the dumbest thing I've heard,\\" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. FBR Capital Markets analyst Barton Crockett said the issue around the chip cards is particularly confusing, given that these cards have been around for a bit. \\"It begs a million questions,\\" he said. Netflix said on Wednesday it added 0.88 million U.S. subscribers in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with its forecast of 1.15 million. \\"The slowdown in U.S. subscriber growth was particularly disappointing because one would expect that since Netflix just raised rates last week, this number would have been strong,\\" said Crockett. Netflix increased the subscription rate for some new members earlier this month by 1.00 a month to 9.99 in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Internationally, Netflix added 2.74 million subscribers, compared with its projection of 2.40 million. Netflix, which is also battling competition from streaming services such as Amazon.com Inc's Prime Video service and Hulu, has been aggressively building its overseas presence. The company said it was in the \\"early stages\\" of its China entry and said it was \\"still learning a lot\\". Netflix said in July its plans to enter China in 2016 could be delayed. Netflix is being \\"more adventurous\\" on the news side, company executives said on a post-earnings conference call. The company added it was not looking at live sports as an offering currently. \\"There's a lot of irrational bidders for sports, we're not anxious to become another one,\\" Netflix's head of content Ted Sarandos said. \\"Sports on demand is not as exciting as sports live.\\" Netflix forecast adding about 1.65 million customers in the United States in the current quarter. It also said it expected to add about 3.50 million subscribers worldwide. (Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr) ||||| Netflix is blaming its lower-than-expected US subscriber growth to changes to Americans‚Äô credit cards. In a letter to shareholders, the company said its over-optimisitic estimates for its third-quarter results were ‚Äúdriven in part by the ongoing transition to chip-based credit and debit cards.‚Äù In other words, the company is claiming that the number of US subscribers to Netflix didn‚Äôt meet what the company had expected for the third quarter in part because, well, fewer people than expected paid up. ‚ÄúI read this Netflix quote and I scratched my head and thought, ‚ÄòWhat?'‚Äù says Ken Oros, a senior associate at The Strawhecker Group, which focuses on the electronics payments industry. I read this Netflix quote and I scratched my head and thought, ‚ÄòWhat?‚Äô Ken Oros, The Strawhecker Group In the past few months, credit card issuers have been transitioning from cards without chips to ones with them, known as EMV technology, to help curtail credit card fraud, which you may have noticed. Card users have been receiving these new cards in the mail as banks rushed to meet the October 1 deadline. Since then, new liability rules have taken effect that now hold merchants who don‚Äôt switch over to the new technology liable for credit card fraud. To industry experts watching the country‚Äôs shift to EMV, Netflix‚Äôs statement is somewhat surprising. After all, while brick-and-mortar businesses have had to update their processing systems to account for the new cards, the way we pay at digital businesses remains pretty much unchanged. ‚ÄúIt sounds like a bunch of customers received new cards at once and their old cards on file were inactive,‚Äù says Forrester analyst Sucharita Mupuru-Kodali. ‚ÄúMost people may not even realize all the things they need to change for autobilling and they forget until the next time they use Netflix.‚Äù Regular users, however, would likely soon realize if they weren‚Äôt able to sign into their accounts because they hadn‚Äôt paid their bill or if their cards were no longer active. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs meaningful and, even if it is sizable for one quarter, I‚Äôm sure people will realize soon enough,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnyone who churns out probably wasn‚Äôt using the service much in the first place.‚Äù Don‚Äôt Give ‚ÄòEm A Chance to Think The statement is especially perplexing because credit card companies have been sending users new cards for quite some time, and many users won‚Äôt actually have their numbers changed. Even if users do get new cards, some old cards remain active in the interim, meaning that the information they gave to Netflix wouldn‚Äôt necessarily automatically be void. ‚ÄúRight now the larger issuers are leading the way with card reissuance, and many of these have the ability to tie old card numbers to reissued cards,‚Äù says Aite Group‚Äôs retail banking research director Julie Conroy. Many issuers will also continue to approve recurring charges for a period of time, she adds, because they know that card holders may forget to update their credit card information with merchants. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think a significant customer churn could be blamed on the chip migration,‚Äù she says. When pressed on the issue during the earnings call, Netflix chief financial officer David Wells clarified the statement from its letter about why US subscriber growth may not have met expectations. ‚ÄúWe think it‚Äôs a contributor,‚Äù Wells said of the chip-card transition. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs likely multi-factored, there may be other things going on here, but certainly the transition to the chip cards is not helping and that has to be a factor.‚Äù He went on, ‚ÄúAny interaction where you have to update your payment method and are presented an opportunity not to do that, it just means there‚Äôs more noise introduced.‚Äù In other words, Netflix doesn‚Äôt want to give subscribers any opportunity to even briefly reconsider continuing to pay their monthly bill.

Q:Question: \\"What range could primary cultural centers be located?\\" Context: \\"After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th‚Äì6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Primary cultural centers during the Hellenistic period could be located in various parts of the territories influenced by Hellenistic culture. These include mainland Greece, parts of Asia (such as south-west Asia, north-east Africa, and South Asia), and cities founded by the Hellenistic Greeks in regions they colonized. Some of the most prominent cultural centers during this time were: 1.

The Pick your answer from: - Business should succeed. - Ideas should succeed.","completion":"Ideas should succeed, as they lay the foundation for a thriving business, acting as the driving force behind innovative strategies, unique products or services, and effective branding. In essence, when businesses thrive, it can be traced back to the successful implementation of the core ideas that were initially conceived. The process of transforming a mere idea into a tangible result for a business involves several steps. Firstly, the idea must be generated, which could be achieved through brainstorming sessions or methodical research. The concept should then be refined to align with the business's mission, vision, and values before being further developed to account for market positioning, target audience, and other crucial factors that impact a business's success. Through thorough evaluation and feasibility analysis, a business can determine if the idea has the potential to create value, generate revenue, and maintain a competitive edge. Upon passing the evaluation, the idea proceeds to the implementation phase, where it is carefully executed while taking into consideration challenges, resources, and potential obstacles. Ideas that succeed are those that have been diligently developed, thoroughly analyzed, and effectively implemented, resulting in businesses that can adapt, innovate, and prosper. Furthermore, successful ideas need to be flexible and open to feedback and adaptation as the market and business conditions change. In this way, a business can pivot and stay ahead of competition while driving growth and profitability. Hence, a successful business begins with the successful development and execution of its ideas, allowing it to flourish in a competitive environment and build a strong reputation in the eyes of its customers. It is the success of these ideas that ultimately leads to the success of the business overall."},{"prompt":"Christopher Warm had a sedentary job.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Province of Posen was a province of Prussia from 1848 and as such part of the German Empire from 1871 until 1918. The area, roughly corresponding to the historic region of Greater Poland annexed during the 18th century Polish partitions, was about . For more than a century, it was part of the Prussian Partition, with a brief exception during the Napoleonic Wars. - A grand duchy is a country or territory whose official head of state or ruler is a monarch bearing the title of grand duke or grand duchess. Relatively rare until the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the term was often used in the official name of countries smaller than most continental kingdoms of modern Europe (e.g., Denmark, Spain, United Kingdom) yet larger than most of the sovereign duchies in the Holy Roman Empire, Italy or Scandinavia (e.g. Anhalt, Lorraine, Modena, Schleswig-Holstein). During the 19th century there were as many as 14 grand duchies in Europe at once (a few of which were first created as exclaves of the Napoleonic empire but later re-created, usually with different borders, under another dynasty). Some of these were sovereign and nominally independent (Baden, Hesse and by Rhine, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Oldenburg, Saxe-Weimar and Tuscany), some sovereign but held in personal union with larger realms by a monarch whose grand-dukedom was borne as a subsidiary title (Finland, Luxembourg, Transylvania), some of which were client states of a more powerful realm (Cleves and Berg), and some whose territorial boundaries were nominal and the position purely titular (Frankfurt). - The Congress of Vienna (German: \\"Wiener Kongress\\") was a conference of ambassadors of European states chaired by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich, and held in Vienna from November 1814 to June 1815, though the delegates had arrived and were already negotiating by late September 1814. The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other off and remain at peace. The leaders were conservatives with little use for republicanism or revolution, both of which threatened to upset the status quo in Europe. France lost all its recent conquests, while Prussia, Austria and Russia made major territorial gains. Prussia added smaller German states in the west, Swedish Pomerania and 60% of the Kingdom of Saxony; Austria gained Venice and much of northern Italy. Russia gained parts of Poland. The new Kingdom of the Netherlands had been created just months before, and included formerly Austrian territory that in 1830 became Belgium. The immediate background was Napoleonic France's defeat and surrender in May 1814, which brought an end to twenty-five years of nearly continuous war. Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by Napoleon's dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during the Hundred Days of MarchJuly 1815. The Congress's \\"Final Act\\" was signed nine days before his final defeat at Waterloo on 18 June 1815. - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. - Eduard Heinrich Flottwell ( 23 July 1786 -- 28 May 1865 ; after 1861 von Flottwell ) was a Prussian Staatsminister . He served as Oberpr√§sident ( governor ) of the Grand Duchy of Posen ( from 1830 ) and of the Saxony ( from 1841 ) , Westphalia ( from 1846 ) and Brandenburg ( from 1850 ) Provinces . He was also Prussian Minister of Finance ( 1844 - 1846 ) and Minister of Interior ( 1858 - 1859 ) . Flottwell was born in Insterburg in the Province of East Prussia ( present - day Chernyakhovsk in Russian Kaliningrad Oblast ) , studied law at the University of K√∂nigsberg and entered the civil service at the Insterburg court in 1805 , from 1812 at the East Prussian Regierungspr√§sidium of Gumbinnen . After the Napoleonic Wars he together with Oberpr√§sident Theodor von Sch√∂n re-organised the administration of the West Prussian province at Danzig . In 1825 he was appointed Regierungspr√§sident of Marienwerder . When in 1830 the Polish November Uprising led by Micha Gedeon Radziwi broke out at Warsaw in Russian Congress Poland , his brother Antoni Radziwi was dismissed as Duke - Governor of the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen by King Frederick William III and the sole rule passed to Flottwell as the new Oberpr√§sident . He was a strong supporter of Germanisation and standardised schooling policies , which by some was seen as directed against ethnic Polish Prussians in the region . In 1843 in \`\` Anerkennung der Hilfe nach dem gro√üen Hamburger Brand '' ( acknowledgment after the great Hamburg fire ) , he was named an honorary citizen of Hamburg . - The Kingdom of Prussia was a German kingdom that constituted the state of Prussia between 1701 and 1918 and included parts of present-day Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic. It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin. - The Partitions of Poland were three partitions of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth that took place towards the end of the 18th century and ended the existence of the state, resulting in the elimination of the sovereign Poland for 123 years. The partitions were conducted by the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and Habsburg Austria, which divided up the Commonwealth lands among themselves progressively in the process of territorial seizures. - The Grand Duchy of Posen was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, created from territories annexed by Prussia after the Partitions of Poland, and formally established following the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Per agreements derived at the Congress of Vienna it was to have some autonomy. However in reality it was subordinated to Prussia and the proclaimed rights for Polish subjects were not fully implemented. The name was unofficially used afterward for denoting the territory, especially by Poles, and today is used by modern historians to refer to different political entities until 1918. Its capital was Posen. The Grand Duchy was formally replaced by the Province of Posen in the Prussian constitution of December 5, 1848.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The lead singer of the band whose breakthrough single is \\"Light My Fire\\" is Jim Morrison. The band in question is The Doors, an iconic American rock band that was formed in 1965 in Los Angeles, California. Jim Morrison, born on December 8, 1943, was an American singer-songwriter and poet who served as the charismatic and enigmatic frontman of The Doors. He possessed a distinctive baritone voice that contributed significantly to the band's captivating and evocative sound. Morrison's poetic and symbolic lyrics, often delving into themes of love, spirituality, and the human experience, have been widely celebrated and scrutinized by both critics and fans. \\"Light My Fire,\\" released in 1967 as a single from The Doors' self-titled debut album, was a game-changing hit for the band. The song showcased the group's unique blend of rock, blues, and psychedelia, with Morrison's mesmerizing vocals at the forefront. It was written primarily by the band's keyboardist, Ray Manzarek, and guitarist, Robby Krieger. However, all members of The Doors, including drummer John Densmore, have been credited with contributing to the song's final arrangement. The song's timeless appeal is enhanced by its iconic organ intro and the catchy guitar riff which became synonymous with the band's sound. The Doors, with Jim Morrison as their lead singer, went on to achieve considerable acclaim, releasing several successful albums throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, such as \\"Strange Days,\\" \\"Waiting for the Sun,\\" and \\"L.A. Woman.\\" The band's music tackled various subjects and frequently experimented with diverse musical styles, further cementing their place in the pantheon of legendary rock groups. Tragically, Jim Morrison's life was cut short at the age of 27; he was found dead in the bathtub of his Paris apartment on July 3, 1971. The official cause of death was listed as heart failure, though no autopsy was conducted. Following Morrison's passing, The Doors continued as a trio for a brief period before disbanding in 1973. Over the years, Jim Morrison's life, work, and untimely death have been the subject of numerous documentaries, biographies, and films, with his enigmatic persona and artistic contributions continuing to captivate and intrigue fans worldwide. In addition to his musical legacy, Morrison's poetry and writings have also garnered attention, showcasing his multifaceted talents and complex creative vision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Ian has an easier time understanding Irish speakers than Robert, because","completion":"Ian was exposed to the Irish language and culture from a young age. Growing up in a small village in the west of Ireland, he was surrounded by native speakers who regularly used the language in everyday conversations. His parents, both fluent Irish speakers themselves, made a conscious effort to teach their children the language and encourage its use at home. This early exposure to the Irish language allowed Ian to develop a strong foundation and comfort in both speaking and understanding it. In contrast, Robert's experience with the Irish language was limited to formal education. He grew up in a predominantly English-speaking area, with little opportunity to engage with native Irish speakers outside of school. His exposure to the language was mostly through textbooks and classroom instruction, which, while helpful for learning the basics, cannot quite compare to the natural language acquisition that comes from immersion in a living, breathing language community. Furthermore, Ian's involvement in traditional Irish music and dance further cemented his connection to the language and culture. He actively participated in local sessions, where musicians would gather to play traditional tunes and sing songs in Irish. This exposure to spoken and sung Irish in a social setting allowed Ian to pick up on linguistic nuances, idiomatic expressions, and the natural rhythms of the language that are often lost in translation or overlooked in a classroom setting. Additionally, Ian's experience with different regional accents and dialects of Irish gave him a broader understanding of the language. As he traveled and met speakers from various parts of Ireland, he familiarized himself with the unique aspects of each regional dialect, making it easier for him to understand and communicate with a wide range of Irish speakers. In comparison, Robert's familiarity with Irish was mostly limited to the standardized form taught in schools, which does not always account for the diversity of accents and dialects found in the Irish-speaking regions. This lack of exposure to different dialects may contribute to his difficulty in understanding some Irish speakers, particularly those with strong regional accents. Lastly, Ian's deep interest and passion for the Irish language motivated him to dedicate time and effort toward mastering it. He consistently sought out opportunities to improve his language skills, such as enrolling in advanced language courses, attending language immersion programs, and participating in conversation circles with native speakers. This ongoing commitment to learning the language and engaging with the Irish-speaking community has allowed Ian to continually enhance his understanding and fluency. In conclusion, Ian has an easier time understanding Irish speakers than Robert because of his early exposure to the language, cultural immersion, experience with different dialects, and commitment to ongoing language learning. This rich and diverse language background has enabled Ian to develop a deeper connection to the Irish language and allowed him to become a more adept listener and communicator. Meanwhile, Robert's limited exposure to the language, predominantly through formal education, has made it more challenging for him to understand the variety and nuances within the language as easily as Ian does."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The initial agreement was reached on June 23, 1987, at Meech Lake, which is located in the province of Quebec, Canada. However, amendments and ratifications to the accord were discussed over the following three years. The Meech Lake Accord was a series of proposed amendments to the Canadian Constitution that aimed to gain the consent of Quebec to the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982. The accord was primarily an attempt to address the concerns and demands of the Quebec government for greater recognition of its distinct status as a primarily French-speaking province and to bridge the constitutional divide between it and the rest of the country. The accord was negotiated by the Canadian Prime Minister at the time, Brian Mulroney, and the provincial premiers in an attempt to resolve this longstanding issue and bring Quebec fully into the Canadian federation by recognizing it as a \\"distinct society\\" within Canada. The Meech Lake Accord contained several key provisions: 1. Recognition of Quebec as a distinct society with its unique language, culture, and legal traditions. 2. Allowing greater provincial input in the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court of Canada. 3. Strengthening provincial powers over immigration policies. 4. Providing provinces with the right to \\"opt-out\\" of federal programs in areas of provincial jurisdiction with compensation if they chose to implement their own programs. 5. Enhancing provincial authority in constitutional matters by requiring unanimous consent of all provinces in future constitutional amendments that affected their powers, status, or role. For the Meech Lake Accord to take effect, it required the consent of the federal government and all ten provincial governments within a three-year period. The deadline for obtaining the necessary ratifications was set for June 23, 1990. However, the accord ultimately failed to receive the required unanimous consent as two provinces‚ÄîManitoba and Newfoundland‚Äîdid not ratify it before the deadline. The failure of the Meech Lake Accord led to a period of Canadian political uncertainty and a renewed push for constitutional reforms, including the Charlottetown Accord in 1992 which also failed to gain enough support. The broader implications of the accord's failure have influenced the Canadian political landscape and the relationships between the federal government, Quebec, and the other provinces, with Quebec's constitutional status remaining a contentious and unresolved issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What piece was composed as a tribute to Albert Libon? ? For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Sa√´ns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Sa√´ns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carr√©'s libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Sa√´ns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Sa√´ns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Sa√´ns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Sa√´ns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation.

Before settling on their current name in January 1984, the band performed under the name Death Cult, which was an evolution of the name of lead singer Ian Astbury's previous band Southern Death Cult. They gained a dedicated following in the UK in the mid-1980s as a post-punk/gothic rock band, with singles such as \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", before breaking mainstream in the United States in the late 1980s as a hard rock band with singles such as \\"Love Removal Machine\\" and \\"Fire Woman\\". According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the band fuse a \\"heavy metal revivalist\\" sound with the \\"pseudo-mysticism ... of The Doors [and] the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin ... while adding touches of post-punk goth rock\\". Context: With the same line-up still in place, the band released The Cult in October 1994, produced by Bob Rock. The self-titled 'Cult' album is commonly referred to as the 'Black Sheep' album by fans of the group. Astbury referred to the record as \\"very personal and very revealing\\" songs about his life, with the subject matter ranging from sexual abuse at the age of 15, to the death of Nigel Preston, to his directionless years spent in Glasgow in the late 1970s. The record achieved little success, only reaching No. 69 in the US and No. 21 in the UK. Duffy remarked that he thought that the record wouldn't sell well due to the offensive lyrics. The record went to number one in Portugal also, but quickly dropped out of sight. The single \\"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\\" was released with the band going on tour in support of the new album. Only one more single, \\"Star\\", was officially released with a live appearance on UK TV show The Word. \\"Star\\" began life in 1986 as \\"Tom Petty\\" and was recorded at the \\"Sonic Temple\\" demo sessions as \\"Starchild\\", being dropped by the band during rehearsals. In 1993 the song was resurrected and was finally completed for the record in 1994 as, just simply, \\"Star\\". When the band began the Beauty's On The Streets tour in winter 1994, they augmented the line up with James Stevenson on rhythm guitar. As with the Ceremony record several years earlier, no other official singles were released, but several other songs were released on a strictly limited basis: \\"Sacred Life\\" was released in Spain and the Netherlands, \\"Be Free\\" was issued in Canada and France, \\"Saints Are Down\\" was issued in Greece, but none of the songs gained much commercial success. During this tour, the Cult made their first ever appearance in Norway. Question: Did it win awards. Whats the answer?","completion":"The Cult's 1994 self-titled album did not win any major awards. The album achieved limited commercial success, reaching No. 69 in the US and No. 21 in the UK. Although it reached number one in Portugal for a brief period, it quickly dropped off the charts. Additionally, the singles from the album, such as \\"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\\" and \\"Star\\", did not gain significant recognition or commercial success, and the limited releases of other songs like \\"Sacred Life\\", \\"Be Free\\", and \\"Saints Are Down\\" in specific countries also did not achieve notable commercial success or awards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.\\" Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet: \\"The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.\\" They conclude \\"On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.\\" Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook \\"nutritional epidemiology\\", and the most-cited author in his field.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person for whom Roy said her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat? Ferrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert organised by Dame Myra Hess. Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che far√≤ (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca.

Write a text based on \\"israeli rockets kill senior hamas official drawing reprisal threats\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Israeli Rockets Kill Senior Hamas Official, Sparking Reprisal Threats Introduction: Tensions in the Middle East escalated recently as an Israeli rockets attack killed a senior Hamas official, prompting threats of reprisal from the Palestinian militant group. The incident adds to the ongoing strife between Israel and Hamas, and is expected to further provoke violence in the region. Step 1: Assess the Situation and Israeli Motivation The targeted assassination of the Hamas official is believed to be part of Israel's ongoing efforts to weaken the organization and hinder its capacity to carry out attacks on Israeli targets. Israel claims that Hamas poses a significant threat to its national security and has, in the past, carried out multiple operations against the group to safeguard its citizens. Step 2: Understand Hamas' Position and Reaction As a consequence of the assassination, Hamas has vowed to retaliate against Israel. The group has been increasingly vocal in recent months, expressing its intent to continue its fight against Israel. With the loss of a senior official, Hamas may feel emboldened to carry out even more aggressive actions in response to this latest incident. Step 3: Analyze the Likely Repercussions Given the history of conflict between Israel and Hamas, it is highly likely that this assassination will lead to a surge in violence between the two parties. As both sides remain entrenched in their respective positions, there is a growing risk of significant civilian casualties and further destabilization in the region. Step 4: Examine the International Response The international community, particularly the United States and European Union, has called for restraint and diplomacy in resolving the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. However, the recent assassination of the senior Hamas official has complicated efforts to mediate a lasting peace agreement, creating skepticism about the prospect of a diplomatic solution. Step 5: Evaluate Potential Outcomes In the aftermath of this incident, it is possible that both Israel and Hamas will seek to reestablish leverage through acts of aggression, thus intensifying the cycle of violence. Alternately, it could serve as a turning point, pushing both sides to reevaluate their strategies and engage in meaningful diplomacy to pursue peace. Regardless, the international community will play a crucial role in supervising and mediating discussions between the parties to ensure a lasting resolution. Conclusion: The assassination of the senior Hamas official by Israeli rockets has sparked further reprisal threats and deepened the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. As both sides weigh their options and consider their next moves, the international community must strive to promote peace and diplomacy, in order to mitigate the potential for further violence and bring stability to the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Such is Krauzenberg's wealth and power that when he agrees to sign over his property, it is two of the most powerful men in the Nazi regime who announce they will be coming to his house to handle the paperwork ‚Äì Adolf Eichmann and Heinrich Himmler. However, as the Nazi leaders are ushered into Krauzenberg's home, they are struck by something unusual ‚Äì his two most trusted servants, Hans Vassmann and his wife Ingrid are a married Aryan couple who, despite the law, are still working for Jews. As it happens, Eichmann and Himmler's suspicions are well-founded ‚Äì despite appearing to be the perfect Aryan couple, Hans and Ingrid are actually Jews working deep undercover with the underground Resistance.

Q: With the melting of Jewish culture into many places in the world, what is happening to the boundaries of Ashkenazi culture?, Context: In this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is Sephardic, since most non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or not they are ethnically Sephardic. By tradition, a Sephardic or Mizrahi woman who marries into an Orthodox or Haredi Ashkenazi Jewish family raises her children to be Ashkenazi Jews; conversely an Ashkenazi woman who marries a Sephardi or Mizrahi man is expected to take on Sephardic practice and the children inherit a Sephardic identity, though in practice many families compromise. A convert generally follows the practice of the beth din that converted him or her. With the integration of Jews from around the world in Israel, North America, and other places, the religious definition of an Ashkenazi Jew is blurring, especially outside Orthodox Judaism. A:","completion":"With the integration and melting of Jewish culture into various parts of the world, the boundaries of Ashkenazi culture are blurring, especially outside Orthodox Judaism. This is due to the integration of various Jewish communities, such as Sephardic and Mizrahi, into Ashkenazi families and vice versa. Typically, children adopt the practices of the parent whose cultural background aligns with the family's religious leanings. However, with Jewish people integrating globally in places like Israel and North America, these traditional practices are becoming less distinct, leading to a more blended, less strictly defined Ashkenazi Jewish identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In flashback, Martin recalls stopping over in Tokyo, where a series of ship disasters catches his attention. When a survivor finally washes up on Odo Island, Martin flies there for the story with Tomo Iwanaga (Frank Iwanaga), a representative of the Japanese security forces and learns of the island inhabitants' belief in a sea monster god known to them as \\"Godzilla\\", which they believe is causing the disasters. Martin returns to the island with Dr. Yamane (Takashi Shimura), who leads an investigation crew to Odo Island, where radioactive footprints and a Trilobite are discovered. An alarm rings and Martin, the villagers, and Dr. Yamane's crew head to a hill for safety, only to come across Godzilla.

Sean Connery's disenchantment with his starring role is unmistakable in this, the fifth Bond spectacular. 7. Sean Connery plays 007 with his usual finesse. 8.

Tons of fun, really, and Donald Pleasence as Blofeld is inimitable. What was the overall consensus about the movie?","completion":"The overall consensus about the movie appears to be mixed, with both positive and negative reviews. On the positive side, many reviewers appreciate Sean Connery's portrayal of James Bond, noting that his sleek machismo is indelibly imprinted on the character. They also enjoy the old-school, classic Bond vibes and the well-crafted nature of the film. Additionally, the movie's theme is praised as one of the best in the Bond series, and Donald Pleasence's performance as Blofeld is considered inimitable. On the negative side, some reviewers criticize the film's pacing, claiming it to be tired and poorly paced for a Bond movie released in 1967. Connery's disenchantment with the role is also mentioned, implying that this may have affected his performance. Furthermore, the film is described as excessively noisy, violently intense, and suffering from an implausible script by Roald Dahl, making it about half an hour too long. In summary, the movie has its share of memorable moments and strong performances, but it also suffers from weaknesses in pacing, script, and the main actor's seemingly waning interest in the role. Therefore, the overall consensus about the film is a mixed bag ‚Äì offering enjoyment for those who appreciate classic Bond experiences while leaving others unsatisfied with specific aspects of the production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: A day after Target announced that forty million of its customers had their credit and debit card data breached, the retailer announced a 10% discount for all shoppers at its stores this Saturday and Sunday. \\"We recognize this has been confusing and disruptive during an already busy holiday season,\\" Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel said in a statement Friday. \\"Our guests' trust is our top priority at Target and we are committed to making this right.\\" The company also provided details Friday about the extent of the hack and the information that could have been compromised. The nation's No. 2 general merchandise retailer said cards used at its brick-and-mortar stores between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15 of this year may have been impacted. Target (TGT) said there is no indication that any debit card PIN numbers were compromised. The retailer also claimed it doesn't appear that the three- or four-digit security code visible on the face of credit cards were breached. That means that the debit and credit cards that were compromised cannot be used to withdraw cash from an ATM or to shop online. Related: 4 things to do after your card has been hacked But lawyer Robert Ahdoot, part of a legal team in California that has filed a lawsuit seeking class action status on behalf of Target customers, said he had spoken to shoppers who claimed thieves had used their debit card information to withdraw money from ATMs. The lawsuit alleges negligence on the part of the retailer, and also says Target failed to promptly notify victims of the hack. \\"Target has an obligation to provide adequate security for the financial information they collect,\\" Ahdoot said. He recommended that consumers who suspect that their cards may have been compromised change their PIN numbers as a precaution. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the retailer \\"typically doesn't comment on pending litigation.\\" Target said it believes customers' birth dates and social security numbers weren't compromised. The retailer said it gave Visa, MasterCard (MA), Discover (DFS) and American Express (AXP) the card numbers of those who may have been impacted, and that these companies will monitor the cards for fraud. As a precaution, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. said it was temporarily limiting ATM withdrawals to 100 a day and purchases to 300 a day for Chase customers in the U.S. whose debit cards are at risk, the company said in a letter to affected account holders. Meanwhile, Target is also monitoring its own card, the REDcard, for potential unauthorized activity. Steinhafel said the affected customers \\"will not be held financially responsible for any credit and debit card fraud.\\" \\"[T]o provide guests with extra assurance, we will be offering free credit monitoring services,\\" Steinhafel said. \\"We will be in touch with those impacted by this issue soon on how and where to access the service.\\" To help answer questions about the incident, Target has set up a hotline for customers. Shoppers have been reporting long hold times, so Target said it will beef up its staffing. Target didn't specify how its systems were hacked. But judging by the scope of the breach and the kind of information that criminals obtained, security experts say hackers apparently targeted the retailer's point-of-sale system. That means they either slipped malware into the terminals where customers swipe their credit cards, or they collected customer data while it was en route from Target to its credit card processors. The retailer said it had notified authorities and financial institutions immediately after it was made aware of the unauthorized access, and had hired a forensics team to investigate how the breach may have occurred. The issue that allowed the breach has been identified and resolved, Snyder said. ||||| CNBC's Dominic Chu reports Target has issued a statement to customers and will be issuing a 10 percent discount on in-store purchases this weekend following news of the recent credit card data breach. A day after Target announced more than 40 million of its shoppers' credit and debit cards may have been compromised during the crucial holiday season, the retailer's CEO offered some positive news for customers. All in-store customers will receive a 10 percent discount on purchases made Saturday and Sunday, said Gregg Steinhafel, the company's chairman, president and chief executive officer. This weekend, the last before Christmas, also happens to be one of the busiest shopping times during the holiday season, a key time frame for the retailer to drive sales. (Read more: An Easing of Rules on Charges by Amex) In a statement, Steinhafel said, \\"We take this crime seriously. It was a crime against Target, our team members, and most importantly, our guests. We're in this together, and in that spirit, we are extending a 10% discount‚Äîthe same amount our team members receive.\\" Target extended an additional benefit to shoppers in the New York state area. At the urging of the New York Attorney General's office, the discounter will provide free credit monitoring services to all potential victims in the state. \\"Following the news this week of a massive breach of personal financial data belonging to millions of Target shoppers, I urged Target to offer affected New Yorkers one year of free credit monitoring to ensure they are not victims of identity theft. I'm pleased to report that, just a short time ago, Target agreed to our request,\\" said Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman.

This branch of Protestantism is distinguished by belief in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an experience separate from conversion that enables a Christian to live a Holy Spirit‚Äìfilled and empowered life. This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing‚Äîtwo other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism. Because of their commitment to biblical authority, spiritual gifts, and the miraculous, Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church. For this reason, some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Give two examples of spiritual gifts.","completion":"Pentecostalism, as a branch of Protestant Christianity, emphasizes the importance of personal encounters with God and the presence of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives. This experience is distinct from conversion and is often referred to as the \\"baptism with the Holy Spirit.\\" Through this baptism, Christians are empowered to live their lives in a manner reflecting the early church's spiritual power and teachings found in the Apostolic Age. Spiritual gifts, or charisms, are an integral part of the Pentecostal experience and are believed to be manifestations of the Holy Spirit working through believers. Two examples of spiritual gifts are: 1. Speaking in tongues (glossolalia): Speaking in tongues is considered one of the most distinctive spiritual gifts in Pentecostalism. It is a form of praying in an unknown language, which is believed to be a direct result of the Holy Spirit's presence within a believer. The practice of speaking in tongues allows the believer to communicate directly with God and serves as a sign of their baptism with the Holy Spirit. Glossolalia can be a spontaneous and personal experience or occur during communal worship services. Some Pentecostals believe that speaking in tongues also serves as evidence of salvation and an authentic encounter with the Holy Spirit. 2. Divine healing: Divine healing is another prominent spiritual gift among Pentecostals. This gift refers to the belief that physical, emotional, and spiritual illnesses can be miraculously healed through prayer and faith in God's power. Healing services are common in Pentecostal churches, and believers often gather to pray for those in need of healing. It is thought that the Holy Spirit works through the faith and prayers of the congregation, channeling God's healing power to those who are suffering. Pentecostals believe that divine healing is a tangible demonstration of God's love and compassion and serves as a witness to the validity of their faith. In addition to speaking in tongues and divine healing, there are several other spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament, including prophecy, discernment of spirits, and performing miracles. These gifts are seen among Pentecostals as an essential aspect of their faith and serve to further demonstrate the power and presence of the Holy Spirit in their lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Nigella Lawson's assistants 'refused to take pay cut after claims of stealing' Two sisters employed as personal assistants by Charles Saatchi and Nigella Lawson complained they were being treated \\"worse than Filipino slaves\\" when they were asked to take a pay cut and offered rent-free accommodation after being accused of stealing more than ¬£600,000 of the celebrity couple's money, a court heard on Thursday. Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, 35 and 41 respectively, had initially offered to repay tens of thousands of pounds that they admitted they had spent on designer clothes, luxury hotels and flights around the world, Isleworth crown court was told. But when the art collector's financial director asked them to sign a letter admitting they had fraudulently stolen money, and to agree to work for the couple at reduced pay until they were satisfied they had been repaid, the women had refused, saying it would tie them to Saatchi and Lawson for the rest of their lives, it was claimed. Francesca Grillo's bills were an average of ¬£48,000 a month and her sister's were ¬£28,000 when their spending first began to cause alarm, Rahul Gajjar, now chief operating officer of the Saatchi Gallery group, told the jury. Until that point, the assistants' monthly bills totalling tens of thousands of pounds had been regarded as \\"trivial matters\\" by the Saatchis, he said. The sisters were among five personal assistants of the couple who had credit cards paid for from Saatchi's personal account. They deny fraud. Gajjar told the court he had confronted Francesca Grillo in July 2012 with a copy of her company credit card bill for the previous month, which ran to 15 pages and totalled ¬£64,336.97. While some purchases had been on behalf of the Saatchi and Lawson family, he said, the Italian had acknowledged that she had spent more than ¬£34,000 that month on luxury items for herself. These included flights to and from New York costing more than ¬£2,300 each way, luxury hotels in London, Paris, New York and Mallorca, and designer clothes and accessories including a ¬£723 dress from Chlo√©, a jacket and shoes costing ¬£2,725 from Miu Miu and a Louis Vuitton bag priced ¬£2,300. On a single day, 12 June, he said, Grillo had admitted spending ¬£5,385 in Miu Miu and making two payments of ¬£1,195 and ¬£1,455 to Prada, a total of more than ¬£8,000. Elisabetta Grillo, 41, who like her sister had worked first for Lawson, and then for the couple, for more than a decade, had admitted spending almost ¬£5,000 on personal items in the same month, Gajjar said, at stores including Harvey Nichols and Harrods. A company taxi account showed 107 personal trips booked by Francesca and 10 by Elisabetta during June 2012. Lawson's personal credit card bill, also paid from Saatchi's private account, averaged ¬£7,000 per month, the court heard. The couple have since divorced. Under cross examination by Anthony Metzer QC, representing Elisabetta Grillo, Gajjar agreed that though he had received copies of the six private credit card accounts each month, he had filed them \\"without any degree of scrutiny\\" until a taxi journey brought to his attention by Saatchi prompted him to examine the Grillos' statements in detail. He said he was unable to comment on large payments on some of the other assistants' statements, which included ¬£1,368 that one of the five, Alice Binks, had spent at the nightclub Annabel's, and a bill of ¬£2,358 at Donna Karan charged to her credit card by another PA, Alice Wales. The statements of the assistant Anzelle Wasserman showed a payment of more than ¬£12,500 at the Gallery Mess, the restaurant at the Saatchi Gallery, which Metzer suggested may have been for her wedding party. \\"That could have been gifted by Nigella,\\" said Gajjar. The Grillos' lawyers have previously argued that their spending had the tacit agreement of Lawson, on the understanding that they did not reveal to her then husband that she was a daily user of cocaine, class B drugs and prescription medication. The crown said those claims were \\"totally scurrilous\\". Saatchi and Lawson are both expected to give evidence in the trial.

Article: Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story SANA, Yemen ‚Äî Yemenis voted Tuesday in an election that was predetermined, with one candidate on the ballot for president. But the lack of choice did little to dim the palpable joy on the streets here where the vote meant the formal end of an autocrat‚Äôs rule and the chance to move past a violent, yearlong political crisis. The electoral exercise on Tuesday means that Ali Abdullah Saleh will no longer be Yemen‚Äôs president after more than three decades in power. He is to be replaced by his loyal, longtime vice president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, in a peaceful transfer of power orchestrated under pressure from Yemen‚Äôs neighbors in the Persian Gulf region, and Western nations. Mr. Saleh, who has recently been receiving medical treatment in New York after a failed assassination attempt last year, agreed to step down only after having turned his security forces on unarmed demonstrators calling for democracy, killing dozens and prompting some in the military to side with the opposition. It was a bloody conflict that damaged the economy while giving Al Qaeda an opportunity to expand its influence. So the vote was seen as a step forward. Photo At one polling place here in the capital, five women, veiled in black from head to toe, waited patiently for their turn to vote. The air was quiet in the musty stone room where one by one they stepped up to a table to register their thumbprints and check a box on the white ballot slip. ‚ÄúWe all agree to Abdu Rabbu,‚Äù said one of the women, who identified herself as Umm Abdullah, displaying her ink-stained thumb after she finishing voting. ‚ÄúHe is enough for us. We want to end this crisis.‚Äù Outside the polling place, a group of men burst into patriotic songs. Voter turnout appeared to be high here, as long lines wrapped outside polling places in schools and outside mosques. Sporadic gunfire was heard throughout the day in various neighborhoods of Aden, a southern port city, residents said. Seven people were killed by gunfire, including three government soldiers, according to local news reports. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Supporters of the president voted because the election was endorsed by Mr. Saleh, while the opposition‚Äôs supporters voted to ensure Mr. Saleh‚Äôs ouster. Whatever the motivation, for the first time in more than a year, the popular spirit was optimistic in this conflict-stricken capital where the sound of shelling used to echo every night. The uprising here was not swift and triumphant like the revolutions of Tunisia or Egypt, or the all-out warfare of Libya and Syria. Rather, a slow-burning revolution of sit-ins, negotiations and international pressure has pushed out Mr. Saleh, making him the fourth Arab autocrat forced from power in the wave of popular uprisings that continue to roil the region. Yemen was not without violence, though, as powerful allies of Mr. Saleh decided to take up arms against him and supported the protest movement calling for his ouster, eventually fracturing the government and forcing Mr. Saleh to enter into negotiations over his exit strategy. An agreement that gave Mr. Saleh immunity from prosecution contributed to a resolution. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story ‚ÄúThe change that has taken place was not a voluntary change, for sure,‚Äù said Abdel-Karim al-Iryani, a former prime minister under Mr. Saleh who still acts as an adviser to the president. ‚ÄúThe spearhead of the change, despite what the situation might be now, was the youth protesters.‚Äù The end of Mr. Saleh‚Äôs rule does not yet put Yemen on the road to democracy, though. Mr. Saleh is most likely to return to Sana and will retain considerable influence, through the prominence of his family and tribe, which have dominated the Yemeni military for the past three decades. Mr. Saleh ruled Yemen as if he were a tribal sheik, pitting different players against one another and using the resources of the state ‚Äî jobs and money ‚Äî to win allies. Cronyism substituted for the rule of law, and little effort was put into building the infrastructure required for a stable state. All authority in the country had been consolidated in the Saleh presidency. But Mr. Saleh‚Äôs influence will be weakened when Mr. Hadi, a southerner, takes over. Photo ‚ÄúThe political stage is wide open to create a new political system,‚Äù Mr. Iryani said. ‚ÄúThat new political system cannot be the same as it was before. There is a consensus that the dominance of the military and tribal sheiks that has controlled the stage is now no longer acceptable.‚Äù Mr. Hadi‚Äôs role as president is to lead a transition to a more democratic system. After he formally takes power, the ruling and opposition parties intend to begin a national dialogue to draw up a new constitution. Previous efforts to do so ground to a halt, and even with Mr. Saleh gone, all parties may not be willing to participate. That may be especially true of the Houthi rebels who control Saada Province in the north and the southern separatist leaders, many of whom are living in exile. Others are worried that Mr. Hadi will remain loyal to Mr. Saleh. ‚ÄúHe will play according to Saleh‚Äôs rule,‚Äù said Abdel Kader al-Guneid, a well-connected opposition supporter in Taiz. ‚ÄúHis pocket is full. He has no power base, but the ambassadors and the opposition stand behind him nicely.‚Äù But Mr. Guneid added that voter turnout in Taiz was very high because ‚Äúpeople want to see the back of Ali Abdullah Saleh.‚Äù The United States ambassador to Yemen, Gerald M. Feierstein, said that Mr. Saleh‚Äôs political future was uncertain. ‚ÄúIf he is running things from behind the scenes, it‚Äôs because the new government has not asserted itself,‚Äù the ambassador said. ‚ÄúWhat we want to see is see this government develop and take on their full role and responsibilities. That will eliminate the potential or people from outside the government to interfere.‚Äù As soon as the ballots are tallied, Mr. Hadi will be sworn in as president of the Republic of Yemen, probably next week. Yemeni officials say that Mr. Saleh will return to Yemen this week. The leader of Yemen‚Äôs Socialist Party, Yassin Saeed Noman, who played an active role in the negotiations between the ruling party and opposition over the past year, warned of the uphill battle for the new government. ‚ÄúHadi will face a lot of problems, you see, not just because it‚Äôs Hadi, but any person would,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe has to face very complicated issues.‚Äù Yet despite his worries, Mr. Noman still sounded brighter than he had all year. ‚ÄúThis is the first such experiment in the past 33 years, so let us be optimistic,‚Äù he said. ||||| Violence in southern Yemen has marred an election to replace veteran leader Ali Abdullah Saleh. At least nine people, including a child, were killed in violence which had been widely expected after separatists called for a voter boycott. Half of Aden's polling stations closed early as a result but voting in the capital, Sanaa, was calm and orderly. A US spokeswoman said the country was \\"encouraged\\" by the \\"very strong and positive referendum\\". \\"We congratulate the Yemenis for really launching this process, taking ownership of it as a population, and we will stand with them as they take the next steps,\\" state department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. The poll comes a year after violent anti-government protests erupted in the Arabian peninsula's poorest country. Voters are due to rubber-stamp Vice-President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi - the only candidate. Disobedience call British election observer Baroness Nicholson was in a polling station in Aden, the main city in the south, when an attack happened nearby. Analysis At a huge rally inside the Sanaa football stadium, I saw thousands of enthusiastic supporters chanting the name of Yemen's Vice-President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. For outsiders, it is hard to understand why anyone would get excited about such a demonstrably undemocratic election. The vice-president is the only candidate - but that is not the point. This election is about making sure that Yemen's president for the last 33 years, Ali Abdullah Saleh, is gone for good. Even with him gone, the old president's sons and nephews still control the military. Large chunks of the country are in rebellion and al-Qaeda militants have recently taken control of two districts. And half a million children suffer from severe malnutrition. It is a daunting list of tasks for Yemen's new president. She told the BBC World Service programme Newshour that she and two female Yemeni ministers were monitoring voting when \\"a great sequence of explosions\\" took place near to the building. She said no-one at the polling station was injured and she did not think she had been the target of the attack. But she said she had been \\"encouraged\\" by speaking to people before the vote who told her \\"we know it's going to be horrible but we're jolly well going to go out and vote\\". Elsewhere in Aden two soldiers were killed. The separatist Southern Movement had announced a day of \\"civil disobedience\\" to mark the vote. A leader of the movement, Abdulhamid Shokri, said four civilians - including a child - had died in the city during clashes between security forces and people opposed to the election. Officials told BBC Arabic that gunmen killed four soldiers in an attack on a polling station in Hadramawt province. Two soldiers were also killed in an attack in the al-Hawta district. Shia rebels in the north also called for a boycott. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, in the capital Sanaa, says such violence has been seen in previous elections and had been expected. But Sanaa itself was largely peaceful, says our correspondent, with many people voting amid tight security. In one district officials said 45% of eligible voters had cast their ballot by midday. \\"We've seen extensive voting - which we didn't expect - especially from young people,\\" said election official Ammar Al Magbali. Saleh era ends The main supporters of the uprising that began in January 2011 are backing Mr Hadi, whose election posters are prominently displayed in Sanaa. He is from the south himself and has called for dialogue with the separatists. Yemeni human rights activist Tawakkol Karman, joint winner of the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize, said that the election marked the end of Mr Saleh's 33-year reign. \\"We are building the democratic and happy Yemen that all of the youth and women have dreamed about,\\" she said. But the country still faces many challenges - an ongoing rebellion in large parts of the country, al-Qaeda militants, widespread malnutrition among children and severe drought. The election follows a deal brokered by Yemen's Gulf Arab neighbours. Mr Saleh signed the agreement to step down - but only once a new president has been elected. The new president is due to stay in office for two years, when a further round of presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled. |||||Summary:","completion":"People in Yemen had a vote to choose a new president. There was only one person to vote for, but people were still happy. They were happy because it meant the old leader, who had been in charge for a long time, was finally going away. The new leader is supposed to help Yemen become more democratic and make things better for the people who live there. But the country still has many problems, like fighting, hunger, and lack of water.

This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada. - Hudson Bay (Inuktitut: \\"Kangiqsualuk ilua\\") (sometimes called Hudson's Bay, usually historically) is a large body of saltwater in northeastern Canada with a surface area of .

Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - Nicolas de Vignau was a companion of Samuel de Champlain in New France .

In 1611 , Vignau volunteered to live with a group of Algonquin natives to learn their language and customs . He accompanied them on their journey North to Allumette Island becoming the second white man to travel up the Ottawa River . Vignau spent the winter on Allumette island with a band of Algonquins led by a one - eyed chief named Tessouat . Anyone coming down the river was forced , by rapids on either side of the island , to portage through Tessouat 's territory .

He is also known as a prophet by Christians and Muslims, and is mentioned in the second chapter of the Qur'an, although not by name. - The Saint Lawrence River (Tuscarora: \\"Kahnaw√°kye\\"; Mohawk: \\"Kaniatarowanenneh\\", meaning \\"big waterway\\") is a large river in the middle latitudes of North America. The Saint Lawrence River flows in a roughly north-easterly direction, connecting the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean and forming the primary drainage outflow of the Great Lakes Basin. It traverses the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and is part of the international boundary between Ontario, Canada, and the U.S. state of New York. This river also provides the basis of the commercial Saint Lawrence Seaway. - Samuel de Champlain (born Samuel Champlain; on or before August 13, 1574 December 25, 1635), \\"The Father of New France\\", was a French navigator, cartographer, draughtsman, soldier, explorer, geographer, ethnologist, diplomat, and chronicler. He founded New France and Quebec City on July 3, 1608. He is important to Canadian history because he made the first accurate map of the coast and he helped establish the settlements. - New France was the area colonized by France in North America during a period beginning with the exploration of the Saint Lawrence River by Jacques Cartier in 1534 and ending with the cession of New France to Spain and Great Britain in 1763. At its peak in 1712 (before the Treaty of Utrecht), the territory of \\"New France\\", also sometimes known as the \\"French North American Empire\\" or \\"Royal New France\\", extended from Newfoundland to the Canadian prairies and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico, including all the Great Lakes of North America. - The Great Lakes (also called the Laurentian Great Lakes, or the Great Lakes of North America) are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes located primarily in the upper mid-east region of North America, on the CanadaUnited States border, which connect to the Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River. Consisting of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron (or MichiganHuron), Erie, and Ontario, they form the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth, containing 21% of the world's surface fresh water by volume. The total surface is , and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is . Due to their sea-like characteristics (rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as \\"inland seas\\". Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world by area, and Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country. The southern half of the Great Lakes is bordered by the Great Lakes Megalopolis. - Jacques Cartier (December 31, 1491September 1, 1557) was a French explorer of Breton origin who claimed what is now Canada for France. Jacques Cartier was the first European to describe and map the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the shores of the Saint Lawrence River, which he named \\"The Country of Canadas\\", after the Iroquois names for the two big settlements he saw at Stadacona (Quebec City) and at Hochelaga (Montreal Island). - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language. - The Canadian Prairies is a region in western Canada, which may correspond to several different definitions, natural or political. Notably, the Prairie provinces or simply the Prairies comprise the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, as they are partially covered by prairie (grasslands). In a more restricted sense, the term may also refer only to the areas of those provinces covered by prairie; their portions of the physiographic region known as the Interior Plains. Prairie also covers portions of northeastern British Columbia, though that province is typically not included in the region in a political sense. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre.

Q:Given the following context: Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Fr√©d√©gonde, Saint-Sa√´ns wrote twelve operas, two of which are op√©ras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Sa√´ns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Sa√´ns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Sa√´ns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Sa√´ns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Sa√´ns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music ‚Äì \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Sa√´ns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Sa√´ns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less... answer the following question: What were the names of the five models Saint-Sa√´ns forged his own style from?

Make your decorations unique and inject a little personality by going the decor road less traveled or visiting a local thrift store for decor. Use pink paper lanterns as a unique, luxe alternative to the average balloon, for example. Use mason jars as center pieces and thrift plates and table cloths to make for an elegant setup for your party and/or personalize them to match your party's overall theme. Party favors do not have to be complex in nature. They can be straightforward favors in their simplicity. They can also be sentimental and come with a lot of thought and effort. While you don't have to have party favors, they are a nice way to leave a lasting impression after a great night. Fill up a small gift bag with different lollipops and candies.

Position your index and middle fingers on either side of the seam. For better ball control, your index finger should just about touch the seam. Pick your answer from: A). For best ball control, place the palm of your hand over the seam so your knuckles are facing forward. Press down on the seam with your palm and keep the ball where it is, just above the seam. B). Your thumb may rest on the ball, but this usually doesn't affect delivery. Use your remaining two fingers to hold the ball in place. C). The first step is to make contact with the ball at a forty-five degree angle. If you press down on the ball too hard or not aim to, you may create a ring around the seam, ruining your motion. D). Since the doosra is sometimes folded at the seam, you want to throw it well out of the way. Hold the ball back or toward your other hand. Answer:","completion":"B). Your thumb may rest on the ball, but this usually doesn't affect delivery. Use your remaining two fingers to hold the ball in place. It is crucial to have a firm grip on the ball yet still allow certain flexibility to ensure the proper spin when you release it. As you approach the wicket, focus on your arm movement and wrist action. Your bowling arm should stay straight and close to your body during the entire motion. Start with a high-arm action to build momentum, and as you bring your arm down to release the ball, make sure to maintain a high elbow position. The doosra relies heavily on the wrist action to deceive the batsman, so it is essential to perfect this skill. As you release the ball, allow your wrist to rotate away from your body to impart this unique spin. Your wrist should be flexible, but not too loose, as this can lead to a lack of control and reduced efficiency in spin. Consistency is key when bowling the doosra, so practice regularly to perfect your grip, delivery, and wrist action. Gradually increase the consistency and accuracy of your deliveries through repetition and tweaking your technique as needed. To further improve your doosra, consider watching videos of professional cricketers who excel in bowling this delivery, such as Saqlain Mushtaq and Muttiah Muralitharan. Analyze their technique and try to adapt it to your own. Lastly, it's essential to practice and experiment with different variations of the doosra, such as altering the speed, length, and angle of the delivery. This will keep the batsman guessing, making it difficult for them to anticipate and counter your next move. The key to successful doosra bowling lies in your ability to deceive the batsman and consistently exploit their weaknesses. So, keep refining your technique, practicing, and adapting your arsenal to evolve as a more formidable doosra bowler."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Korean War: On 1 March 1951 Mao sent a cable to Stalin, in which he emphasized the difficulties faced by Chinese forces and the urgent need for air cover, especially over supply lines. Apparently impressed by the Chinese war effort, Stalin finally agreed to supply two air force divisions, three anti-aircraft divisions, and six thousand trucks. PVA troops in Korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war. In late April Peng Dehuai sent his deputy, Hong Xuezhi, to brief Zhou Enlai in Beijing. What Chinese soldiers feared, Hong said, was not the enemy, but that they had nothing to eat, no bullets to shoot, and no trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded. Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA's logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving methods of supply, but these efforts were never completely sufficient.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the painter Scarpia mistrusts and believes complicit in Angelotti's escape? from the following article ? Inside the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now an escaped political prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel ‚Äì his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left a key to the chapel hidden at the feet of the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the \\"hidden harmony\\" (\\"Recondita armonia\\") in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving. Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place. Tosca enters and suspiciously asks Cavaradossi what he has been doing ‚Äì she thinks that he has been talking to another woman.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the given text, we understand that the amplitude of a wave is directly related to the height of its crest. In the scenario where Jimbo is surfing and the waves begin to crest lower, it indicates that the height of the wave crests is decreasing. As a consequence of the decrease in crest height, the amplitude of those waves will also decrease. This is because the amplitude is intimately connected to the height of the crests - when the crests get higher, the amplitude increases, and when the crests get lower, the amplitude decreases. In conclusion, when Jimbo experiences waves with lowering crests while surfing, the amplitude of those waves is decreasing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hugh Trumble (12 May 1867 - 14 August 1938) was an Australian cricketer who played 32 Test matches as a bowling all-rounder between 1890 and 1904. He captained the Australian team in two Tests, winning both. Trumble took 141 wickets in Test cricket--a world record at the time of his retirement--at an average of 21.78 runs per wicket. He is one of only four bowlers to twice take a hat-trick in Test cricket. Trumble was born in the inner Melbourne neighbourhood of Collingwood, Victoria in 1867, the son of William, born in Northern Ireland and superintendent of an insane asylum, and Scottish-born Elizabeth (nee Clark). His elder brother, John, also played Test cricket for Australia and his younger brother, Thomas, was a public servant who served as Secretary for the Department of Defence from 1918-27, and then official secretary to the High Commissioner for Australia in London. Trumble spent part of his early life in the western Victorian town of Ararat before returning to Melbourne, settling in suburban Camberwell. He was educated at Hawthorn Grammar School and played his early cricket for Kew Cricket Club. Encouraging his sons' early love of cricket, William Trumble--a keen cricketer who bowled leg breaks for South Melbourne Cricket Club--set out a cricket pitch at the family home. He placed a feather on a good length and urged his sons to aim at it when bowling. Known for his accuracy, Hugh later said, \\"Of course I couldn't repeatedly hit the feather, but I soon reached the stage when I was always pretty close to it\\" Trumble transferred to the Melbourne Cricket Club for the 1887-88 cricket season and was an immediate success. He took 36 wickets that season, finishing with an average of 6.77 runs per wicket; the best in the club, beating his teammate and Australian Test bowler Fred Spofforth. He made his first-class cricket debut for Victoria that same season, selected to play against a touring English XI led by Middlesex batsman George Vernon. His first match for Victoria against Australian opposition was against New South Wales at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Bowling with Spofforth, in the first innings Trumble took seven wickets for 52 runs.

Italian-born sculptor Arturo Di Modica says the Fearless Girl statue, which was placed nearby during International Women's Day, is a copyright violation. His lawyers argue that the new sculpture's presence changes the artistic meaning of his famous statue. Mr Di Modica's statute was installed in 1987, without any city permits. The 7,000 pound (3,175 kg) structure was placed on a New York City street after a financial collapse in the middle of the night, but was eventually moved to the Financial District, steps away from Wall Street, after the public called for the statue to be allowed to stay. Mr Di Modica objects to Mayor Bill de Blasio's decision to allow the Fearless Girl statue to remain in place opposite of the Bull for one year, after a public clamouring for the statue to become permanent. His lawyers argue that proper procedure was not followed by city officials when choosing to grant the permit. Mr Di Modica has argued that the girl is not a work of art, but rather an \\"advertising trick\\" since it was sponsored by investment firm State Street Global Advisers, and erected by advertising firm McCann.

However, this water isn't cold enough so he puts it into the freezer to cool it down. He then pours himself the exact same amount of water in a red cup, but gets a phone call and leaves that cup on the table without taking a sip. He comes back two hours later after the phone call to get his cups of water back. Which cup is more likely to get a crack in it? Hint: This is how ice wedging works. When liquid water changes into solid ice, it increases in volume. You see this when you fill an ice cube tray with water and put it in the freezer. The ice cubes go to a higher level in the tray than the water. You also may have seen this if you put a can of soda into the freezer so that it cools down quickly. If you leave the can in the freezer too long, the liquid expands so much that it bends or pops the can. (For the record, water is very unusual. Most substances get smaller when they change from a liquid to a solid.) A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, let's analyze the situation step by step. 1. Jeremy pours water into a blue cup and places it in the freezer to cool down. When water freezes, it expands in volume. 2. While the water in the blue cup is freezing, it will continue to expand, which may exert pressure on the cup walls. Ice wedging, as mentioned in the hint, works by water expanding as it turns into ice and exerting force on surrounding structures. 3. Meanwhile, Jeremy pours water into a red cup but gets a phone call, so he leaves it on the table. Since it's left at room temperature, there is no process causing the water to expand in the red cup. 4. When Jeremy returns two hours later, the water in the blue cup is likely frozen (or at least partially), and the water in the red cup remains at room temperature. Given this information, the blue cup with the water that has been placed in the freezer is more likely to have a crack in it.

On the peninsula, the oldest human-related relics (10,000 b.c. ) are Stone Age tools of the Negritos. These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo. They practiced a slash-and-burn agriculture of yams and millet, a technique that exhausted the soil and imposed a semi-nomadic existence from one jungle clearing to another.

Movie plot title: One-Eyed Jacks Movie plot: Rio (Marlon Brando) (also called \\"The Kid\\"), his mentor Dad Longworth (Karl Malden), and a third man called Doc rob a bank of two saddlebags of gold in Sonora, Mexico. The robbery is successful, but Mexican Rurales track them and catch them celebrating in a cantina, killing Doc. Dad and Rio manage to escape. After getting cornered on a high ridge, with Rio's horse dead, Rio figures the Rurales will be \\"swarming all over us inside an hour.\\" Deciding that one partner might take the remaining pony, ride to a jacalito down the canyon about five miles and return with fresh mounts, they gamble for it, with Rio fixing the deal so his pal Dad can be the one to go. Dad gets to a corral, strapping the swag bag onto a fresh pony, but he gets second thoughts. He casts one eye towards a point on the ridge sure to be taken by the Rurales, and with the other he gazes off in the opposite direction out past a low-lying treeline towards the border and safety. One way leads to danger and a poor chance at surviving with half the booty, the other towards a virtual certainty with all of it. After a decidedly short moment of reflection, he leaves his friend to be taken by Rurales. Rio is arrested and transported to prison by way of the jacalito, where he learns firsthand of Dad's betrayal from the owner. Rio spends five hard years in a Sonora prison, giving him ample time to mull over Dad's betrayal before escaping with new partner Chico Modesto (Larry Duran) and going hunting for him. When he locates him, Longworth has used his wealth to become the sheriff of Monterey, California. Instead of ambushing Dad, Rio gives him a chance to explain why he left him back in Mexico, pretending he had never been captured to put him off-guard. Longworth's awkward self-serving story is easily seen through.

A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha √ó piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint, Mentha spicata. The many cultivated varieties of wheat are the result of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids. Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes. This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes. How do some plants avoid cross pollination?","completion":"Some plants avoid cross pollination by having special features or mechanisms that prevent the pollen from their own flowers to reach and work on their own stigma, like a lock and key system.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: Look at the number in standard form. Separate the digits. Identify each place value name. Multiply the left digits by the appropriate value. Divide the right digits by the appropriate value. Write your final answer. Article:","completion":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding Place Value and Standard Form Introduction Place value and standard form play a critical role in our understanding of numbers and their application in various mathematical computations. Without proper knowledge of the place value system, we would find it almost impossible to work with numbers effectively. In this article, we will explore the process of looking at numbers in standard form, separating the digits, identifying the place value names, multiplying and dividing by the appropriate values, and finally writing the answer. By the end of this article, you will have a clear understanding of how place value and standard form contribute to the essence of numbers and their manipulation. Step 1: Look at the number in standard form Before we jump into separating digits and identifying place value names, it is crucial to understand what standard form means. In mathematics, a number is said to be in standard form when it is written as a whole number followed by a decimal point and any decimal digits that may exist. For example, the number 7,456 is in standard form, and so is the number 1.25. Step 2: Separate the digits Once you have identified the number in standard form, the next step is to separate the digits. Separating the digits helps to recognize each digit's individual contribution when determining the overall value of the number. For instance, let's take the number 1,528. Separating the digits would give us 1, 5, 2, and 8. This separation allows us to work with each digit independently, which is important in comprehending place value. Step 3: Identify each place value name After separating the digits, assign a place value to each digit. Place value names are based on the powers of 10. The rightmost digit has a place value of 1 (10^0), the next digit to the left has a place value of 10 (10^1), and so on. Here are some common place value names for whole numbers: 1's (ones) place: 10^0 = 1 10's (tens) place: 10^1 = 10 100's (hundreds) place: 10^2 = 100 1,000's (thousands) place: 10^3 = 1,000 10,000's (ten thousands) place: 10^4 = 10,000 For decimals, the place value names go as follows: 1/10 or 0.1 (tenths) place: 10^(-1) 1/100 or 0.01 (hundredths) place: 10^(-2) 1/1,000 or 0.001 (thousandths) place: 10^(-3) 1/10,000 or 0.0001 (ten thousandths) place: 10^(-4) Step 4: Multiply the left digits by the appropriate value Once you have identified the place values, multiply each digit by its corresponding place value. For example, for the number 1,528, the computation would be: (1 x 1,000) + (5 x 100) + (2 x 10) + (8 x 1). Step 5: Divide the right digits by the appropriate value (for decimals) If the number has decimal places, divide each digit by their corresponding place value. For instance, for the number 0.325, the computation would be: (3 √∑ 10) + (2 √∑ 100) + (5 √∑ 1,000) Step 6: Write your final answer Finally, sum up the calculations from Steps 4 and 5 to obtain the final answer. For the number 1,528, our final answer would be: 1,000 + 500 + 20 + 8 = 1,528 For the number 0.325, our final answer would be: 0.3 + 0.02 + 0.005 = 0.325 It is essential to learn and practice these steps to gain a deep understanding of place value and standard form. This knowledge will prove invaluable in various mathematical operations and help you build a strong foundation for further mathematical studies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A hellish inferno at a downtown Los Angeles apartment building has caused hellish gridlock in for commuters this morning after two major highways had to be closed - adding an hour or more to the drive to work for many Angelinos. More than 250 firefighters are on the scene at 909 West Temple Street near the interchange of the 110 Freeway and the 101 Freeway. Authorities closed both highways, which are major thoroughfares through downtown Los Angeles, after the blaze started about 1.20am Pacific Time. The 101 Freeway was reopened before rush hour, but much of the northbound 110 remained shut off into Monday afternoon. Scroll down for video. Los Angeles Fire Department said more than 250 firefighters are battling a blaze, which can be seen for miles around. Firefighters do not yet know what caused the massive blaze, which towered over downtown Los Angeles on Monday morning. The fire engulfed an apartment tower that was under construction and spread to at least two other buildings before crews could bring it under control. The blaze at the seven-story building filled the surrounding area with smoke, causing the the 110 Freeway and the 101 Freeway to close. The northbound lanes of the 110 Freeway remained shut through Monday morning because firefighters feared that the smoldering remains of the building could collapse on to the highway. 'Just imagine that major artery - which is about eight miles long that takes people downtown and into Hollywood, Glendale, Burbank. To shut that off. We‚Äôre adding another hour of commute,' California Highway Patrol spokesman Edgar Figueroa told the Los Angeles Times. Traffic slowed to a crawl more than three miles from the highway shut down and alternate routes and other major highways soon became choked with traffic Monday morning. One angry commuter, naming downtown streets, could be heard ranting: 'First is shut down and Temple is shut down. Downtown is basically shut down.' Most of the inferno was brought under control in 90 minutes, though firefighters remained worried that the smoking wreckage could collapse on to the 110 northbound. Three lanes of the highway were finally reopened about 10.15am - well after rush hour. Smoke and flames could be seen billowing up from the blaze for miles around - dwarfing even the skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles. Rubble: The wood frame apartment building burned quickly and was reduced to little more than cinders. Much of the debris fell on the 110 Freeway, causing the northbound lanes of the major artery to close. Firefighters say they were shocked by how quickly and uncontrollably the blaze spread. Five stories of wood frame construction were fully engulfed in just minutes. Two other building - both of which house municipal offices - were damaged by the fire. One of the buildings - a 16-story high-rise - had all but two floors damaged by smoke and water. The flames cross the 110 freeway and melted road signs. Only three lanes of the highway were open by Monday afternoon. Witnesses from as far away as West Hollywood reported seeing the fire. 'This is a historic fire, what we as firefighters would call \\"a career fire.\\" It's huge. I really can't remember a building fire this big and I have been with the department for 13 years,' Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman David Ortiz told NBC News. The inferno grew so intense, that it spread to a 16-story office tower nearby and damaged another adjacent building - both of which house municipal offices for Los Angeles County. Three floors of the 16-story tower caught fire and only the building's emergency sprinkler system saved it from being completely engulfed. Firefighters say 14 of the 16 floors have at least water and smoke damage. The building houses several county departments, including Parks and Recreation Department. Another building, Los Angeles County Health Services,. Scorched asphalt: Flames and smokes poured across the 110 and 101 freeways, causing authorities to shut down both until the fire could be contained on Monday morning. The chief of LA's fire department tweeted this picture of his men bringing the blaze under control. Inferno: The fire is burning at a building site planned to be a tall residential structure. Downtown: The fire turned an apartment complex near a key Los Angeles interchanged to cinders. The fire was sparked in the partially built Da Vinci apartment tower. No one was inside at the time and there have been no injuries reported. Fire fighters do no yet know what caused the blaze. The 1.3million-square-foot building had two floors of concrete construction with five floors of wood-frame construction on top. It encompassed nearly an entire city block. Damage is estimated to be in the millions. The Da Vinci was meant to be a luxury high-rise development with shops and offices on the bottom two floors and apartments on the top. The fire all but leveled the apartment building and burned several floors of another high-rise. The fire broke out just down the block from a LAFD fire station. Firefighters emerged from the station house to see the blaze. Parts of the 110 Freeway were charred and remained close into rush hour on Monday morning. The seven-storey building, at 909 West Temple Street, is slated to be residential with offices on the ground floor.

It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. - The Five Families refers to the five major New York City organized crime families of the Italian American Mafia. The term was first used in 1931, when Salvatore Maranzano formally organized the previously warring factions into what are now known as the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese, and Lucchese crime families, each with demarcated territory, organizationally structured in a now-familiar hierarchy, and having them reporting up to the same overarching governing entity. Initially (in the summer of 1931), that governing entity was a \\"capo di tutti capi\\" (boss of all bosses), but that September the role was replaced by The Commission, which continues to govern American Mafia activities in the United States and Canada. - Rhode Island, officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Rhode Island is the smallest in area, the eighth least populous, and the second most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states, following New Jersey. Its official name is also the longest of any state in the Union. Rhode Island is bordered by Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound. The state also shares a short maritime border with New York. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Carlo \\"Don Carlo\\" Gambino (August 24, 1902 October 15, 1976) was an Italian-born American gangster heavily involved in La Cosa Nostra. Translated as 'this thing of ours', \\"LCN\\" is otherwise known as the American Mafia. He is notable for being boss of the Gambino crime family, which is still named after him. After the 1957 Apalachin Convention he unexpectedly seized control of the Commission of the \\"American Mafia\\". Gambino was known for being low-key and secretive. In 1937 Gambino was convicted of tax evasion but had his sentence suspended. He lived to the age of 74, when he died of a heart attack in bed \\"in a state of grace,\\" according to a priest who had given him the Last Rites of the Catholic Church. He had two brothers, Gaspare Gambino, who later married and was never involved with the Mafia and is not to be confused with another Gaspare Gambino who was a mafioso in Palermo, and Paolo Gambino who, on the other hand, had a big role in his brother's family. - Anthony Megale ( August 1 , 1953 -- July 21 , 2015 ) , also known as \`\` The Genius '' , \`\` Tony Connecticut '' , \`\` Machiavelli '' , \`\` Mac '' , \`\` The Brain '' , \`\` Mr. T '' , and \`\` Gas Man '' was a Connecticut mobster who became the acting underboss of the Gambino crime family . - The American Mafia, often referred to as the Italian Mafia or Italian Mob, (commonly shortened to the Mafia or Mob) and also known as the Italian-American Mafia, La Cosa Nostra (LCN), or the American Cosa Nostra, is an influential, highly organized Italian-American criminal society. The organization is often referred to by members as Cosa Nostra (\\"our thing\\"). It originated and developed from the original \\"Mafia\\" or \\"Cosa nostra\\", the Sicilian Mafia, though eventually encompassing other non-Sicilian Italian-American gangsters and organized crime groups of Italian origin in the United States and, to a lesser extent, Canada. The father of American organized crime is generally considered to be Sicilian-American criminal Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano. - The Gambino crime family (pronounced ) is one of the \\"Five Families\\" that dominates organized crime activities in New York City, United States, within the nationwide criminal phenomenon known as the Mafia (or \\"Cosa Nostra\\"). The group, which went through three bosses between 1910 and 1957, is named after Carlo Gambino, boss of the family at the time of the McClellan hearings in 1963, when the structure of organized crime first gained public attention. The group's operations extend from New York and the eastern seaboard to California. Its illicit activities include labor and construction racketeering, gambling, loansharking, extortion, money laundering, prostitution, fraud, hijacking, pier thefts, and fencing. - Money laundering is the process of transforming the profits of crime and corruption into ostensibly 'legitimate' assets. In a number of legal and regulatory systems, however, the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime, and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions. Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with \\"source\\" of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with \\"destination\\" of funds) when regulating the financial system. - Connecticut is the southernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Connecticut is also often grouped along with New York and New Jersey as the Tri-State Area. It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. Its capital city is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. The state is named for the Connecticut River, a major U.S. river that approximately bisects the state. The word \\"Connecticut\\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for \\"long tidal river\\". - Underboss (also capo bastone or sotto capo) is a position within the leadership structure of Sicilian and American Mafia crime families. The underboss is second in command to the boss. The underboss is sometimes a family member, such as a son, who will take over the family if the boss is sick, killed, or imprisoned. - Extortion (also called shakedown, outwrestling, and exaction) is a criminal offense of obtaining money, property, or services from an institution, through coercion. It is sometimes euphemistically referred to as a \\"protection racket\\" since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for \\"protection\\" from (real or hypothetical) threats from unspecified other parties. Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime groups. The actual obtainment of money or property is not required to commit the offense. Making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense. Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force, but additionally, in its formal definition, means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant. - The Connecticut River is the longest river in the New England region of the United States. Flowing roughly southward for through four U.S. states, the Connecticut rises at the U.S. border with Quebec, Canada, and discharges at Long Island Sound. Its watershed encompasses five U.S. states and one Canadian province via 148 tributaries, 38 of which are major rivers. Discharging at per second, the Connecticut produces 70% of Long Island Sound's fresh water. 'anthony megale' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'occupation'?

I really really want to give this place more than 2 stars because I have been to other locations and liked them quite a bit. And truthfully the food was quite good. However the service was severely, SEVERELY lacking. Positives: Like I said, food was good. Drinks were brought promptly, etc. etc. Negatives: Our waitress. She said she was new, so maybe the blame should ultimately be placed on the management for lack of adequate training. First off, we had a table of 7 and she said for tables of 8 or more they don't do separate checks. So when we repeated that we only had 7 at our table, she still gave us attitude about having to split checks. I know it's a pain in the butt but no one in our party had cash.... Then she forgot a few of our drinks. They were brought promptly but when you forget a few, and also forget the waters we ordered and never come back to check on us again until you bring our food out, we may have a problem.

When we went to order our food, a guy we were with asked what came on his sandwich and she replied \\"well you can read can't you?\\" Um. Ok. Then our food came out. We ate it, liked it, and then sat there for about a half hour after we had all finished eating. We were upstairs and there was almost nobody else up there so I'm not sure why it took so long for her to come back and pick up our plates (or ask us if we wanted more drinks?) She finally came back and we asked for the checks, she brought them and we paid. And then sat there again for about a half hour. At this point we were all super frustrated. It took a bartender to realize how long we'd been sitting there and he finally came and took care of our checks. UGH. All in all, I love there food and that they cater so well to us gluten free folk.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: Elmhurst is a residential neighborhood in the southernmost part of Oakland, California. Originally a separate town, it was annexed by Oakland in 1909, and today is considered part of East Oakland. It lies at an elevation of 39 feet (12 m). It contains the Eastmont Town Center. Hypothesis: A lot of people live in Elmhurst.","completion":"From the given context, we can generate the hypothesis that Elmhurst is a populated area, as it is mentioned as a residential neighborhood. However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, we need to consider several factors and arguments that could either support or refute this hypothesis. Supporting Arguments: 1. Residential status: Since Elmhurst is described as a residential neighborhood, it is reasonable to assume that there might be a significant number of people living in the area. 2. Presence of commercial amenities: Mention of the Eastmont Town Center as part of Elmhurst indicates that there are commercial facilities available in the area. These facilities could cater to the needs and preferences of residents, suggesting a substantial population living there. 3. History of incorporation: Elmhurst was annexed by Oakland in 1909, which implies that it has been established as a neighborhood for over a century. This long history could lead to more opportunities for growth and development, potentially leading to a higher population in the area. Refuting Arguments: 1. Lack of specific data: The context provided does not offer any specific data or figures related to the population of Elmhurst. As a result, we cannot confidently affirm that \\"a lot of people\\" live in the area. 2. Elevation and geographical factors: Although the elevation of the area (39 feet) is mentioned, this information on its own does not necessarily indicate any information about the population density. Moreover, the general geographical size of Elmhurst is not provided, which makes deducing its population size difficult. 3. Comparison with nearby areas: To have a better understanding of whether \\"a lot of people\\" live in Elmhurst, it would be helpful to compare Elmhurst's population with that of neighboring areas and the entire city of Oakland. As we do not have this data from the context, we cannot make an accurate comparison and conclusion on its population density. In conclusion, while the hypothesis that a lot of people live in Elmhurst seems plausible due to the residential and commercial attributes mentioned in the context, there is insufficient data provided to confidently confirm or reject this hypothesis. A more accurate assessment would require specific details related to population size and density, geographical information, as well as comparisons with nearby communities or the broader Oakland area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Scrape the Rust Now, it's time to remove the extra rust from the carpet. Find a butter knife from the kitchen (make sure to ask an adult for help) and gently scrape away the rust. Be careful not to poke or damage the carpet! Step 3: Lemon Juice and Salt Magic In this step, we're going to transform our rust stain with lemon juice and salt. Wet the stained area with a little bit of lemon juice. Then, sprinkle some salt on top. Just like magic, the salt and lemon juice will start working on the rust stain. Step 4: Hot Water Power After letting the lemon juice and salt mixture sit for a while, it's time to pour hot water onto the carpet. Ask an adult to heat up 2 cups (470 mL) of water and help you pour it onto the stained area. Make sure the water is not too hot, as we don't want to burn the carpet or hurt ourselves. Step 5: Blot with a White Towel Grab a clean white towel and gently press it onto the wet area of the carpet. This will help soak up the extra water and rust residue. Keep repeating this step until the towel doesn't pick up any more rust color. Step 6: Tough Stains Need Extra Help Sometimes, rust stains can be really stubborn. If the stain is still there after trying the steps above, mix a little bit of lemon juice, white vinegar, and salt. Apply this mixture onto the tough stain and then repeat Steps 4 and 5. And there you have it, kids and parents! With patience and teamwork, you can remove rust stains from your carpet and make it look beautiful again. Remember, it's always a good idea to ask for help from a grown-up when using things like hot water, sharp objects, or cleaning supplies. Happy cleaning!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When director Antoine Fuqua rolls into a community to shoot a movie, he becomes part of that community. Filmmaker Antoine Fuqua began a program to foster young moviemakers in poor communities. This isn't the case of a Hollywood filmmaker cherry-picking glamorous locations like Beverly Hills or Manhattan. Fuqua's interests lie a few miles away, in the grittier section of town. For his 2001 blockbuster, \\"Training Day,\\" he took stars Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke and shot in South-Central Los Angeles -- deep in the 'hood. And last year, the housing projects in Brooklyn's Brownsville district were key to his latest feature, \\"Brooklyn's Finest.\\" Hawke stars once again, this time alongside Richard Gere, Don Cheadle and Wesley Snipes. He was always with the kids -- him and","completion":"his team, engaging with the community, teaching them about filmmaking, and offering inspiration and motivation. Fuqua's mission went beyond just making movies; he aimed to empower underprivileged youth with the skills and opportunities necessary to find their own voices and tell their own stories. Understanding the importance of representation and diversity, Fuqua knew that the most authentic stories about these communities could only come from those who lived there. So he devised an idea for his filmmaking program ‚Äì to seek out promising individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, offering them hands-on training, mentorship, and the chance to learn the ins and outs of the film industry. His program provided workshops on directing, screenwriting, cinematography, and editing, as well as masterclasses with accomplished filmmakers and actors. Participants gained invaluable experience, networking opportunities, and perhaps most importantly, the confidence to pursue careers in film. Fuqua's program also collaborated with local schools, community centers, and non-profit organizations to ensure maximum community engagement and support. As the years went by, word of Fuqua's program spread, and the success stories of young filmmakers who emerged from the program began to pile up. Some of these talented individuals found work in major Hollywood productions, while others were inspired to create their own independent films that showcased the reality of life in their communities ‚Äì stories of hope, resilience, and progress. Fuqua remained committed to his vision, knowing the impact that such a program could have on the lives of countless young people and the communities they called home. As far as he was concerned, it wasn't just about creating opportunities for up-and-coming filmmakers from underrepresented backgrounds, but also about fostering dialogue and understanding between people from different walks of life. By giving these young individuals the chance to have their voices heard ‚Äì and allowing their visions to reach a wider audience through cinema ‚Äì Fuqua believed that the power of storytelling could be harnessed to challenge stereotypes, break down barriers, and ultimately create a more inclusive and empathetic world. In this way, Antoine Fuqua, the director who chose to immerse himself in the grittier sections of town, not only made groundbreaking and powerful films, but also emerged as a fervent advocate for diversity and representation, striving to making a significant impact in the lives of countless young filmmakers. His dedication to fostering talent in underprivileged communities serves as a shining example of how the power of cinema can be used to bring about positive change and inspire future generations to chase their dreams."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: In God We Trut Context: A naive monk, Brother Ambrose (Feldman), is sent by the abbot on a mission to raise 5000 in order to save their monastery from closing. He goes to Hollywood where he encounters a number of eccentric characters. He is at first robbed and later befriended by con artist Dr. Sebastian Melmoth (Boyle), and meets a prostitute named Mary (Lasser) who lets him stay at her apartment. Mary grows to care for Ambrose and seduces him while he is taking a cold shower to try to alleviate his lustful thoughts about her. While he is in Hollywood, he visits several churches including a service at the Church of Divine Profit, performed by the televangelist Armageddon T. Thunderbird (Kaufman) in which he sees the focus of the sermon being a request for money in exchange for salvation. Ambrose is angered by this message and tries to meet a number of times with Thunderbird, being ejected each time. Dr. Melmoth and Ambrose travel the city in a modified school bus, in which they hold church services for donations. During one service, the brakes of the bus release and the bus rolls downhill into a river. The passengers escape safely in the river and are shown on the local news being baptized by the pair, which catches Thunderbird's attention. He prays to G. O. D. for guidance and it tells him to work with Ambrose to make more money because Ambrose is an innocent and has a clean image. Thunderbird has his minions kidnap Ambrose and bring him to his office where he outlines a plan for his own brand of church on wheels. He says he will pay Ambrose the 5000 the monastery needs if he assists him. While they are talking, Thunderbird mentions that G. O. D. (Richard Pryor) audibly talks to him when he prays to him and Ambrose is surprised because he himself has never heard from God in this way. Ambrose agrees to work with Thunderbird and they go across the country from town to town holding services in their own bus.

The Titans (like the Bills) were 7-7 and also hunting for a wildcard berth. In the first quarter, Buffalo scored first with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 21-yard FG. Tennessee would respond with Vince Young completing a 22-yard pass to Bobby Wade. The Bills came back with Willis McGahee's 1-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Titans regained the lead with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 42-yard and a 20-yard FG. Afterwards, the Bills came back with Lindell kicking a 36-yard and a 45-yard FG.

The website www.space.com lists the disadvantages of living in space. Here are some of them. When astronauts work outside the station during spacewalks, they have to wear special gloves. The gloves are very tight. They can hurt the astronauts' fingernails and even make them fall off. In space, you don't have many choices in what you eat. It's hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not OK to eat bread because it leaves crumbs . Crumbs could fly around everywhere. In space, it is impossible to have a good shower because water can fly all over the ship and break the machines. Astronauts have to use a special water-shooting gun and a washcloth. Astronauts lose their bone strength quickly during their stay in space. So far, there is no way to solve this problem. They do exercise while they're in space to try to keep their bones strong as long as possible. Perhaps the hardest part of life in space is the feeling of loneliness. Astronauts sometimes have to spend weeks and even months away from Earth. They miss their friends and families. What's the hardest part of life for astronauts in space? A) They feel very lonely.

At 52, the 6-foot-tall comedienne and actress has experienced more success in the last five years of her career than most actors could dream of for their entire life. Her role as Sue Sylvester on the hit television series \\"Glee\\" has won her critical praise and accolades including a Screen Actor's Guild Award, Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy Award. Likewise, Lynch's personal life is experiencing its own renaissance. In 2010, she married Dr. Lara Embry and in doing so became a second mom to daughters Haden and Chase. With the ease of a seasoned vet, Lynch masterfully balances bawdy with heart. If you missed her outrageous turn as a lesbian dog trainer in \\"Best in Show\\" or lampooning fellow funny lady Roseanne during a Comedy Central roast, you might have caught her as the voice of Calhoun in the recent Disney movie \\"Wreck-It Ralph.\\" For her next adventure, Lynch moves from the screen to the page, hoping to entertain kids of all ages with the new holiday book \\"Elfbot.\\" CNN: Tell me about \\"Elfbot.\\" Lynch: Oh, it's great! It's an audio book that Barnes & Noble is offering. It's a great reverse Pinocchio story where the toymaker wants to become a toy. It's a lot of fun. We're hoping to start a holiday tradition. CNN: And I hear it's a family affair? Lynch: Yes, my daughter Haden is on it. Actually, we all know each other very well, and Kenny G is on it. The director is my best friend. CNN: Is it scary or exciting to see your child possibly getting into showbiz? Lynch: Scary. There's a part of me that had to find my own way. I started from kind of an obscure place, and I really wanted it. I think that adds to my level of professionalism. ... But, I just have to have faith in the goodness of my kids, and she's a great kid. I have this thing about me, because I came up from nowhere, that she should too, but you know what, that's not her path. CNN: You have come a long way, all the way from Dolton, Illinois, to the red carpets of Hollywood. Do you still pinch yourself? Lynch: Every day! And it's a plethora of things. I pinch myself every day, and there's a part of me that's always like, \\"wow!\\" CNN: When you hosted \\"Saturday Night Live\\" and went completely nude for that digital short, I remember thinking, \\"this woman is fearless.\\" Was there a moment in your life when you just decided to be completely unapologetic for your creative choices? Lynch: Oh, absolutely. It was when I was doing improv at Second City. You're doing these sets afterwards, and sometimes it's like the bigger choice you make, the bigger you fall on your face. I think my work started to seem profound when I started making huge choices. Yes, some of them were too huge, where you lose people and you lose reality, but I think you have to go that far in order to know what you can do -- what's inside of you. CNN: I hope someone was recording those big moments. Lynch: I remember playing Queen Margaret in \\"Richard III\\" in Chicago's Shakespeare Company. Usually, that character is cut because she is so bombastic. Well, I wanted to keep her in! So I did and a review came out that said when I was finished, there was no scenery left! So yeah. CNN: Cleared the room, did you? Lynch: Exactly. It was huge. CNN: Sue Sylvester knows how to clear a room. What's going on over at \\"Glee\\" these days? Lynch: Well, we have these new kids, and I'm absolutely floored by their talent. I love the fact that we're following the gang in New York, you know, Rachel and the kids. The writers have really stepped up. It's a new show this year but with all the same principles. It's all about raising your voice in song and having each other's back, and I think that's why it's resonated so strongly. CNN: The show's diverse themes have been a lightning rod for praise and criticism. It reminds me of a modern \\"All in the Family.\\" Do you ever feel like Ryan Murphy has taken the baton from Norman Lear? Lynch: You know, I hadn't made that connection, but I think that's really apt. Norman Lear was really ahead of his time. \\"All in the Family\\" was all about progress and was so groundbreaking. Why didn't things take off from there? But, I think you're absolutely right. Ryan is on the line and pushing people. We have a transgender character on \\"Glee,\\" and we're showing the realism in that -- the struggle with the kids and the parents to accept him. Ultimately, they do, and they cast him as Rizzo in \\"Grease.\\" And, of course, I ruin it all! You know, it's Sue's own prejudice, her own fear that someone will be ridiculed, whereas the kids feel strong enough. CNN: You've become a role model to millions of people but especially gay women. Did you set out to champion gay rights? Lynch: It's not something I ever set out to do, but I'm glad I can. I really have to thank all those that came before me. They made it possible. People like Ellen and Rosie. There are so many people out there every day working for all of us. CNN: It sounds like the themes of acceptance and inclusiveness on \\"Glee\\" really line up with your own personal views. Lynch: Oh, very much! I always wished I had something like \\"Glee\\" when I was growing up. I'm glad there are kids living out there in not-so-friendly parts of the country who have \\"Glee\\" to watch. They can see that there is hope and that it does get better and that there are people who have your back. You just have to find them.

Obama focused part of this speech on the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that Congress passed days after 9/11 and that gave President George W. Bush the authority to go to war in Afghanistan. Obama looks to Congress to bolster legal case for Syria strike. No one in Congress who voted for this resolution at the time realized that he or she was in effect authorizing in Afghanistan what would become America's longest war. Nor did they realize that they were giving a virtual blank check to the president to wage covert U.S. wars in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen where, according to data compiled by the New America Foundation, thousands have been killed in CIA drone strikes with almost no input from Congress. During his defense speech, Obama vowed to help end the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that set in motion the seemingly endless war the U.S. has been fighting since 2001. This is some of the context of Obama's decision to go to Congress to seek authorization for a military strike on Syria. Obama has wanted to leave office in 2016 as the president who had made it harder, not easier, for future presidents to go to war unilaterally without the input of Congress. In going to Congress for authorization of any military operation in Syria, we see Obama the former constitutional law professor at work, but we also see Obama the pragmatist. Opinion: Obama's Syria dilemma. The Obama administration could have always made the argument in the past few days that it could justify attacking the regime of Bashar al-Assad on humanitarian grounds to prevent further massacres of the Syrian people with chemical weapons despite the fact that there was no international authorization for attacking Syria and no congressional resolution sanctioning such an attack. But that argument would be a novel one as a matter of international law, and it would not be particularly compelling as a matter of domestic politics when the American public seems, at best, split on whether the U.S. should deploy force in Syria. Unilateral U.S. military actions are, of course, generally uncontroversial after an attack on American targets by a foreign power or group. President Bill Clinton didn't seek congressional approval for the cruise missiles he launched at al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan in 1998 after the terrorist group's attacks on two U.S. embassies in Africa. Nor did President George H.W. Bush go to Congress to sign off on his invasion of Panama in 1989, which he authorized because a U.S, Marine had recently been killed there and tens of thousands of other Americans living in the country were purportedly at risk. Opinion: U.S. needs U.N. approval on Syria. Syria hasn't attacked any U.S. targets or citizens, so the argument that an attack on the Assad regime is designed to protect American interests or lives is moot. That leaves the Obama administration with the option of extracting some kind of authorization for an attack from international bodies such as the United Nations, NATO or the Arab League. As is now well-known, there isn't a snowball's chance in hell of getting a U.N. authorization since Russia and China have continuously made clear they would veto such a resolution. There also seems little possibility, for the moment, that NATO will authorize a \\"humanitarian\\" mission as it did in Kosovo in 1999 to roll back Serbian aggression there. And even if there was such an authorization, right now a major NATO member, the United Kingdom, couldn't participate because the British Parliament voted against such a mission on Thursday. Indeed, NATO said Monday it wants a \\"firm international response\\" in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria, but that it won't take any military action itself. The Arab League, which signed off on the operation to topple Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, has so far not signaled a readiness to authorize war against Syria. The League said the world community should take action against those responsible for the use of chemical weapons but did not specify if it would endorse military action by the U.S. or other parties. That said, the usually hypercautious Saudis publicly urged war on Sunday. In going to Congress for the Syria authorization, we see not only the former constitutional law professor and pragmatist in Obama, but also the calculated risk taker. On matters of considerable importance where the potential payoff is large, Obama has shown he is willing to take risks. Think no further than his decision two years ago to authorize a Navy SEAL raid to capture or kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, a raid he undertook against the advice of Vice President Joe Biden and then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. If that operation had gone poorly, as a number of Obama's top national security officials believed it could, Obama might now be splitting his time between Chicago and Hawaii. For Obama, a congressional authorization on the use of force in Syria would help him if he needs to authorize additional military actions down the road in Syria. It would also help him if he feels compelled to go to war with Iran. Of course, if he doesn't get such an authorization, he will endure the same kind of humiliation that British Prime Minster David Cameron has just gone through in Parliament. Is it 'High Noon' for Obama on Syria? Obama has, however, no doubt tried to game out how this vote might play out. He probably calculates that for Republican skeptics in Congress, they will have to explain to the American public why it is that they will not sanction military action on Syria after its large-scale use of chemical weapons while they continue to describe Syria's closest ally, Iran, and its nuclear weapons program -- which still has yet to produce any nuclear weapons-- as a grave threat to the world. We can be sure that in the next days, the administration will make the argument that if you let Syria take a pass on its large-scale and repeated use of chemical weapons, you can forget any chance of slowing or ending Iran's nuclear program, something that is a matter of great importance for much of the Republican Party. For those on the left of the Democratic Party in Congress who are generally skeptical of U.S. military actions, Obama can essentially ask, \\"If not now, when?\\" At what point will self-described liberals intervene to stop the use of weapons so vile that they have been banned by the civilized world for almost a century?

Obama took risks for important matters, like authorizing the Navy SEAL raid to capture or kill Osama bin Laden. Getting a congressional authorization for using force in Syria would help him if he needed to authorize more military actions or go to war with Iran. The administration may argue that if Syria isn't punished for using chemical weapons, it would be harder to slow or end Iran's nuclear program."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both Bath and Glasgow have everything to play for, with qualification to the knock-out stage of the Champions Cup up for grabs. It is remarkable that, along with Toulouse, all three teams can finish first, second or third so the group is on a knife-edge. It is still in the hands of Toulouse as, if they win in Montpellier, they win the group and Bath and Glasgow are playing for second. But stranger things have happened and Montpellier look like they have improved under Jake White, so they‚Äôll give Toulouse a real challenge. Finn Russell could be the key for Glasgow against Bath in the European Champions Cup on Sunday. Both Bath and Glasgow know that a win is vital if they are to have any chance of progressing and things would be even better if the win came with a bonus point as well. Those circumstances mean we should have a cracker of a game, with both teams throwing everything at each other. Bath are extremely confident after their amazing performance last week in Toulouse which gave them a bonus-point win, but Glasgow had a good result last week too against Montpellier ‚Äî albeit without getting the bonus point. Bath go into this game as clear favourites for a number of reasons ‚Äî they look to be at full-strength whilst Glasgow have severe problems in the back row, they are playing at home and have momentum on their side. There are some fantastic match-ups throughout the teams that will go a long way to determining the outcome of the match. Here are just three:. George Ford v Finn Russell. Without doubt, if both stay fit, these two will start for their respective countries at stand-off in the Six Nations. Ford was immense last week, mixing his game up beautifully, kicking well when he needed to and seeing when things were on to attack, even when deep within his own 22. They are different physically, Russell is much taller, but they are very similar in how they play the game. Russell faces a battle for supremacy against Bath fly half George Ford. Both kick and pass well and they are both very brave in defence; they both attack the line at pace, too, which creates so much space out wide for the outside backs. They love to attack, have good awareness when things are on or not and they will have a go. This is a big test for Russell in his young career because he needs to try and get the upper hand over Ford, no small task the way the Englishman is playing. Ford can be put under pressure though, the big Premiership sides like Northampton and Saracens have really asked questions of him and he has not coped well. What does not help Russell is that his back row is decimated and they have a hooker playing openside. Back three. I have bundled the back three together because all three match-ups are good. The wingers ‚Äî Matt Banahan and Horacio Agulla against Tommy Seymour and DTH van der Merve ‚Äî all share many of the same qualities; size, power, and, above all, pace. Tommy Seymour (left) skipping past Montpelier's Benoit Sicart in their clash last weekend. They all work very hard off the ball as well, popping up on the other wing and usually being in the right place at the right time. The Glasgow wingers just shade it when it comes to form, DTH scored a hat trick last week and Seymour has been on fire all season. I have high expectations of the full-back contest between Anthony Watson against Sean Maitland. I am a big fan of Watson, who glides across the ground effortlessly but with genuine pace. Give him space and he can be devastating. Maitland announced this week that he is leaving at the end of the season to join London Irish so he will want to justify this by playing well. He has been more of a winger recently but he likes the space that full-back gives you and he can have a huge impact on this game. Back row. I don‚Äôt think there is much between the two sides in general, apart from in the back row. Glasgow have been devastated by injury here and it is such a shame. I would have loved to have seen Josh Strauss, Rob Harley and Adam Ashe take the field but all are injured along with Ryan Wilson, Chris Fusaro and Tyrone Holmes. This means that Warriors are fielding a second row, a hooker and a centre in the back row! Glasgow Warriors head coach talks to the press ahead of his side's forthcoming clash with Bath. Leone Nakarawe, Fraser Brown and Richie Vernon would not have expected to play together in such a big game but they are and they will need to produce miracles against a very good Bath back row. At openside Francois Louw was brilliant last week in Toulouse, running great support lines and being strong in defence, and this is the one position that might settle this game. Fraser Brown is a good player but he is a hooker, not an openside. My concern for Glasgow is that Louw could dominate things in attack and defence because he is a wily old fox and he could get to Finn Russell in defence with no recognised back row to defend him. Highlights:","completion":"- Bath and Glasgow will play an important match on Sunday. - The game is important because the winner gets closer to the knock-out stage of the Champions Cup. - If Toulouse wins another game, they'll be in first place, but Bath and Glasgow still have a chance. - Both teams had good games last week and are strong. - Some top players to watch are Ford, Russell, Banahan, Agulla, Seymour, and Maitland. - Injuries have hurt Glasgow's back row, so they need their other players to do extra well in the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake. Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain‚Äôs abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn‚Äôt enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower retention rate of memories. Sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning. Furthermore, some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory. Therefore, it is important to get the proper amount of sleep so that memory can function at the highest level. One of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test. Additionally, data obtained from neuroimaging studies have shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day, suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What is the role of the neocortex whe it relates to memory?","completion":"The role of the neocortex in relation to memory is crucial for the processing, storage, and retrieval of information. The neocortex is the largest part of the cerebral cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain that plays a key role in various cognitive functions, including memory, attention, perception, thought, and consciousness. When it comes to memory, the neocortex is involved in several aspects: 1. Encoding: The neocortex receives information from various sensory inputs and converts this information into a format that can later be stored and recalled. It helps in processing and organizing new experiences and information, which is then encoded and distributed across different areas of the neocortex. 2. Consolidation: As mentioned in the previous response, the neocortex plays a significant role in memory consolidation, particularly during sleep. The hippocampus replays the events of the day and sends this information to the neocortex. The neocortex processes this information and integrates it into existing memory networks, thereby solidifying new memories and transferring them to long-term memory storage. 3. Retrieval: When it's time to recall information, the neocortex is involved in the retrieval process. It helps retrieve memories by reactivating the neural connections formed during the encoding and consolidation processes. This reactivation aids in constructing the memory and bringing it back to conscious awareness. 4. Storage: The neocortex is also believed to be the primary storage site for long-term memories, particularly semantic and episodic memories. It stores information in a distributed manner, with different components of a memory stored in various regions, depending on the type and content of the memory. For example, memories related to visual information may be stored in the visual cortex, while memories related to language may be stored in the language areas of the neocortex. In summary, the neocortex plays a critical role in the formation, consolidation, storage, and retrieval of memories, making it an essential structure for our cognitive abilities and overall functioning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question: What is a type of hill? Here are possible answers to this question: - mountain - flat land - pool - valley - flat ground I believe the correct choice is \\"mountain\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"mountain\\", and I'll provide a detailed explanation for this choice along with a brief overview of the other options listed. A hill is a naturally raised area of earth that has a more gradual slope compared to a mountain. Although hills and mountains share similar characteristics, the key difference lies in their size and elevation. Typically, a hill has a lower elevation and a less steep slope than a mountain. Now, let's analyze each of the alternatives: 1. Mountain: As we discussed, mountains are larger and more elevated than hills. They usually have a steeper slope and often form part of mountain ranges. Mountains can be formed by various geological processes, such as tectonic plates colliding, volcanic activity, or erosion by weather and rivers. Both mountains and hills contribute to the earth's terrain diversity, and due to their elevated nature, they play essential roles in defining regional climates and ecosystems. Among all the given options, \\"mountain\\" is the closest and most accurate answer to the question, being similar to a hill by being a raised area of earth but different in terms of size, elevation, and slope gradient. 2. Flat land: This option is quite the opposite of a hill. Flat land describes a terrain that does not have significant elevation or slope and is mostly level. Flat land can be found in various landscapes like plains, deserts, or plateaus. It plays an essential role in agriculture, urban development, and transportation, as it's more accessible and easier to build on. 3. Pool: A pool is a small body of still water, either natural or artificial. It's not related to hills in terms of landscape features. Rather, pools or ponds can be found on various terrains, including hills or flatlands, depending on the water source and accumulation. 4. Valley: A valley is a low-lying area between hills or mountains, typically with a river or stream running through it.

In addition, you‚Äôll get a more intense color payoff, and the color will go on more smoothly, so it will be easier to blend. If you don‚Äôt have eyeshadow primer, use regular face primer instead. If any of the eyeshadow or mascara spilled onto your cheeks, sweep it away with a large makeup brush. Use big, fast strokes to avoid smearing it into your skin. If you do happen to accidentally smear your eyeshadow, use a cotton swab dipped in makeup remover to erase the mistake, and then use your blending brush to fix any lines in your makeup.","completion":"Eyeshadow primer is a special makeup helper that makes your eyeshadow stay longer, look brighter, and go on smoother, like painting on an easy-to-color surface.

Chris Palko was born in Wurzburg, Germany, to American parents. His father was stationed on a West German military base as a member of the military police. Palko lived there until the age of four when his father was dishonorably discharged for selling and using heroin, and the family was sent back to the United States where they lived in Middletown, New York. His father would often force Palko to pull homemade tourniquets around his arm as he injected heroin. When Palko was released from the hospital at eighteen, he pursued a career as a rapper, giving himself the stagename \\"Alex\\", after the protagonist of Anthony Burgess' novel A Clockwork Orange. After hiring a manager and recording a demo, he was introduced to rapper Pete Nice, and Cage was featured on the 1993 album Dust to Dust. Pete Nice also introduced Palko to radio personality Bobbito Garcia, who featured Palko on his program several times, increasing his reputation among New York's underground hip hop scene, where he became associated with KMD, Kurious Jorge, K-Solo, Godfather Don, Necro, Artifacts, Pharoahe Monch and El-P. Palko signed a recording contract with Columbia Records, but frequently recorded while intoxicated, and the label found his efforts to be unsatisfactory. Palko briefly put his career on hold and his drug use increased. When Garcia founded the label Fondle 'Em Records, he offered Palko a record deal, and Cage released a single featuring the songs \\"Radiohead\\" and \\"Agent Orange\\" in 1997, to success and acclaim. Following the release of The Slim Shady EP in December 1997, Palko accused Detroit-based rapper Eminem of imitating his style. After several more singles with Fondle 'Em, Palko met Mr. Eon and DJ Mighty Mi of The High & Mighty, and the trio formed the group Smut Peddlers, releasing the album Porn Again on Rawkus Records in 2001. The album peaked at #10 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, #43 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #184 on the Billboard 200, while its single \\"That Smut\\" peaked at #9 on the Hot Rap Singles chart and #96 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart.

KANSAS CITY, Missouri (CNN) -- President Bush drew parallels between the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the potential costs of pulling out of Iraq in a speech Wednesday. President Bush draws parallels Wednesday between the cost of pulling out of Iraq and \\"the tragedy of Vietnam.\\" \\"Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left,\\" Bush told members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, at their convention in Kansas City, Missouri. \\"Whatever your position in that debate, one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like 'boat people,' 're-education camps' and 'killing fields,' \\" the president said. Gergen said he did agree with Bush in one respect, though: \\"He's right, initially when we pulled back in","completion":"Vietnam, there was a terrible price paid by innocent people.\\" As the debate over the Iraq war intensified, public sentiment started to sway, closely mirroring that of the Vietnam War. The public called for a strategy change in Iraq, and the government began discussing potential exit strategies to bring troops home while helping Iraq maintain its stability. Eventually, the government decided on a gradual withdrawal of troops, coupled with a continued support to the Iraqi government through diplomatic means and training of their security forces. The transition took place cautiously and systematically, with both U.S. military advisors and the Iraqi government working closely to prevent any power vacuum or collapse of infrastructure. Despite the similarities to the Vietnam War, the outcomes following the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq were decidedly different. Widespread panic and violence did not engulf the country as had been the case in Vietnam. While pockets of instability and terrorism remained, the Iraqi government, with the support of its citizens, was able to maintain control and restore a level of normalcy to the country. While the parallels between the two conflicts raised concerns about the aftermath of withdrawal, careful planning and cooperation between the U.S. and the Iraqi government largely avoided the worst of the potential consequences of pulling out of Iraq. The nation continued its steady journey towards democracy and freedom, striving to move on from the scars of war and establish a brighter future for its people. In the end, the story concluded with the U.S. withdrawing responsibly, leaving Iraq in a significantly better position than Vietnam experienced half a century before. The lessons learned from the Vietnam War served as a crucial guide in ensuring that the outcome in Iraq was less chaotic and paved the way for a more stable political climate."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

To do this, we can add 7r to both sides: -r + 7r + 18 = -7r + 7r This simplifies to: 6r + 18 = 0 Step 2: The next step is to isolate 'r' by getting rid of '18' on the left side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 18 from both sides: 6r + 18 - 18 = 0 - 18 This simplifies to: 6r = -18 Step 3: Lastly, to solve for 'r', we need to eliminate '6' in '6r'. To do so, we can divide everything by 6: 6r / 6 = -18 / 6 After executing this division, we get the final answer: r = -3 So, the solution to your math problem, -r + 18 = -7r, is r = -3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Timur was born in Transoxiana near the city of Kesh (modern Shahrisabz, Uzbekistan) some 80 kilometres (50 mi) south of Samarkand, part of what was then the Chagatai Khanate. His father, Taraqai, was a minor noble of the Barlas, a Mongolian tribe that had been turkified in many aspects. According to Gerard Chaliand, Timur was a Muslim, and he saw himself as Genghis Khan's heir. Though not a Borjigid or a descendent of Genghis Khan, he clearly sought to invoke the legacy of Genghis Khan's conquests during his lifetime. Context: Timur is regarded as a military genius, and as a brilliant tactician with an uncanny ability to work within a highly fluid political structure to win and maintain a loyal following of nomads during his rule in Central Asia. He was also considered extraordinarily intelligent - not only intuitively but also intellectually. In Samarkand and his many travels, Timur, under the guidance of distinguished scholars, was able to learn the Persian, Mongolian, and Turkish languages. (according to Ahmad ibn Arabshah, Timur didn't know Arabic) More importantly, Timur was characterized as an opportunist. Taking advantage of his Turco-Mongolian heritage, Timur frequently used either the Islamic religion or the law and traditions of the Mongol Empire to achieve his military goals or domestic political aims. Timur, mostly considered a barbarian, in fact was a well learned king, and did enjoy the company of scholars --he was tolerant and generous to them against his nature. Once Persian poet Hafez wrote a ghazal whose verse says if this Turk accept his homage: --For the black mole on his cheekI would give the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara Timur upbraided him for this verse and said; \\"By the blows of my well tempered sword I have conquered the greater part of the world to enlarge Samarkand and Bukhara, my capitals and residences; and you pitiful creature would exchange these two cities for a mole\\". Hafez replied \\"O Sovereign of the world, it is by the state of similar generosity that I have been reduced, as you see my present state of poverty.\\" It is reported that the King was amazed by the witty answer and the poet departed with magnificent gifts. Timur used Persian expressions in his conversations often, and his motto was the Persian phrase rasti rusti (rsty rsty, meaning \\"truth is safety\\" or \\"veritas salus\\").

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who signed a declaration stating that \\"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\\"? from the following article ? Shackleton's February 1907 announcement that he intended to base his expedition at the old Discovery headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. \\"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work,\\" he wrote, adding: \\"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\\". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.Shackleton's initial reply was accommodating: \\"I would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself\\". Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. \\"I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound\\", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided \\"what limits he puts on his own rights\\". To this Shackleton replied: \\"There is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further\\".The matter was unresolved when Scott returned from sea duty in May 1907. Scott pressed for a line of demarcation at 170¬∞ W‚Äîeverything to the west of that line, including Ross Island, McMurdo Sound, and Victoria Land, would be Scott's preserve. Shackleton, with other concerns pressing on him, felt obliged to concede.

He would not touch the coast of Victoria Land at all.

The group's membership has had at least a dozen changes over the years, including a period from 1976 to 1981 when the band performed and recorded as the Dirt Band. Constant members since the early times are singer-guitarist Jeff Hanna and drummer Jimmie Fadden. Multi-instrumentalist John McEuen was with the band from 1966 to 1986 and returned during 2001 departing once again in November 2017. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was founded around 1966 in Long Beach, California by singer-guitarist Jeff Hanna and singer-songwriter guitarist Bruce Kunkel who had performed as the New Coast Two and later the Illegitimate Jug Band. Trying, in the words of the band's website, to \\"figure out how not to have to work for a living,\\" Hanna and Kunkel joined informal jam sessions at McCabe's Guitar Shop in Long Beach. There they met a few other musicians: guitarist/washtub bassist Ralph Barr, guitarist-clarinetist Les Thompson, harmonicist and jug player Jimmie Fadden, and guitarist-vocalist Jackson Browne. As Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the six men started as a jug band and adopted the burgeoning southern California folk rock musical style, playing in local clubs while wearing pinstripe suits and cowboy boots. Their first paying performance was at the Golden Bear in Huntington Beach, California. Browne was in the band for only a few months before he left to concentrate on a solo career as a singer-songwriter. He was replaced by John McEuen on banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and steel guitar. McEuen's older brother, William, was the group's manager, and he helped the band get signed with Liberty Records, which released the group's debut album, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band during 1967. The band's first single, \\"Buy for Me the Rain,\\" was a Top 40 success, and the band gained exposure on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, as well as concerts with such disparate artists as Jack Benny and The Doors. A second album, Ricochet, was released later during the year and was less successful than their first. Kunkel wanted the band to \\"go electric\\", and include more original material. Bruce left the group to form WordSalad and Of The People. He was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Chris Darrow. By 1968, the band adopted electrical instruments anyway, and added drums. The first electric album, Rare Junk, was a commercial failure, as was their next, Alive. The band continued to gain publicity, mainly as a novelty act, making an appearance in the 1968 film, For Singles Only, and a cameo appearance in the 1969 musical western film, Paint Your Wagon, performing \\"Hand Me Down That Can o' Beans\\". The band also played Carnegie Hall as an opening act for Bill Cosby and played in a jam session with Dizzy Gillespie.

However, modern English usage often prefers using gender-neutral language, such as \\"themselves\\" rather than \\"himself\\" when referring to a person of unspecified gender. Step 5: Decide if the sentence is grammatically accurate: - The sentence has a clear subject, verb, and pronoun usage, making it grammatically acceptable. However, because of possible gender-neutrality concerns, some may argue for a more inclusive alternative like \\"Everyone should be able to defend themselves.\\" The given possible answers are: [A]. unacceptable.

Which full-size SUV from General Motors platform was Hummer H2 based on Answer:","completion":"The Hummer H2, a full-size SUV produced by General Motors (GM) under the Hummer brand, was based on the GM GMT820 platform. This platform was also shared by other full-size SUVs and trucks manufactured by General Motors, particularly the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon. The GMT820 platform is a body-on-frame construction, which means that the body and chassis are separate components, with the body mounted on top of the frame. This design is traditional for full-size SUVs and trucks, as it provides excellent durability, off-road capabilities, and utility. The Hummer H2 benefited from the GMT820's robustness and engineering by taking advantage of its heavy-duty chassis and suspension components. The Hummer H2 was introduced in 2002 as a more practical and accessible sibling to the larger and more cumbersome Hummer H1, which was based on the military's High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV/ Humvee). While the H2 was still a massive and intimidating presence on the road, it shared its underpinnings with other more conventional SUVs and trucks. This allowed the H2 to offer relatively better on-road manners, improved fuel efficiency, and superior passenger comfort compared to the H1. The connection between Hummer H2, Chevrolet Tahoe, and GMC Yukon was not limited to the platform. They also shared powertrain and, to some extent, interior components. The H2 came equipped with a 6.0-liter V-8 engine initially, which later upgraded to a 6.2-liter V-8 engine. This engine was shared with GM's other full-size SUVs and trucks. However, despite their mechanical similarities, the three vehicles had decidedly different target markets, with the Tahoe and Yukon catering to families and luxury buyers, while the Hummer H2 appealed to those seeking adventure and an imposing, rugged image. The Hummer H2 had a production run from 2002 to 2009, with the last few units sold until 2010. The brand was discontinued as part of General Motors' financial restructuring, as the company focused on more fuel-efficient and practical vehicles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"If your kitten keeps sneezing, it's important to understand the potential causes and the steps you should take to address the issue. 1. Possible causes: Kittens can sneeze for a variety of reasons, including: a. Upper respiratory infections: These are caused by viruses or bacteria which affect the kitten's nasal passages, sinuses, and throat. b. Allergies: Like humans, kittens can be allergic to certain environmental factors such as pollen, dust, mold, or even certain foods. c. Irritants: Smoke, dust, or strong smells can cause sneezing in kittens. d. Foreign objects: Sometimes small items or debris can become lodged in the kitten's nose, leading to sneezing. e. Dental problems: Infections or issues with teeth can cause sneezing if they affect the nasal passages. 2. Steps to take: a. Monitor your kitten's overall health. Keep a close eye on their behavior, appetite, and energy levels to determine if their sneezing is accompanied by other symptoms. b. Check the environment. Ensure the kitten's living space is clean, free of dust, and well-ventilated. Remove strong-smelling substances or potential irritants. c. Consult your veterinarian. If the sneezing persists or worsens, or if your kitten displays other symptoms like coughing, nasal discharge, or difficulty breathing, contact your veterinarian for a thorough examination and appropriate treatment. As for people sneezing a lot after waking up in the morning, this could be caused by a variety of factors: 1. Allergies: Morning sneezing may be due to allergens that have accumulated in your bedding or in the air, such as dust, pollen, or pet dander. 2. Dry air: During sleep, your nasal passages may become dry due to the air in your bedroom, causing irritation and sneezing upon waking. 3. Change in temperature: When you wake up, your body's temperature rises, which can sometimes cause sneezing as your body adjusts to the change. 4. Infections: A sinus infection or a cold may cause sneezing in the morning as your nasal passages are congested. To answer your last question, these two situations are not the same. While both involve sneezing, the first question is specific to kittens and potential causes related to their health and environment. The second question relates to people sneezing upon waking and deals with human physiology and environmental factors.

THW Require the Provision of Cannabis in Any State Funded Medical Program What argument could one make about this debate topic?","completion":"Step 1: Understand the debate topic The topic is about requiring any state-funded medical program to provide cannabis as an option for treatments, medications, or therapies. Step 2: Identify the key stakeholders The primary stakeholders involved would be patients, medical professionals, state-funded medical programs, the government, and the pharmaceutical industry. Step 3: Research the benefits and risks of cannabis use in medical programs To craft an effective argument, gather evidence about the potential benefits and risks associated with cannabis use for medical purposes. This could involve looking into existing studies, statistics, and expert opinions that discuss the effectiveness of cannabis in treating various medical conditions, its side effects, and the potential for addiction. Step 4: Develop a strong argument based on the research Argument: One can argue that the provision of cannabis in any state-funded medical program is beneficial because it can lead to better patient outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and increased access to alternative treatment options. Step by step justification: 1. Better patient outcomes: Several studies have shown that cannabis can effectively treat a wide range of medical conditions, such as chronic pain, muscle spasms, epilepsy, and more. Incorporating cannabis into state-funded medical programs could improve patient outcomes by providing an alternative treatment option for those who have not found relief from traditional medications or therapies. 2. Reduced healthcare costs: When used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan, cannabis may help reduce the need for more expensive medications or medical interventions. With healthcare costs continuously increasing, state-funded programs could potentially save money by offering cannabis as an alternative treatment option. 3. Increased access to alternative treatment options: Many patients struggle to access medical cannabis due to high costs, lack of insurance coverage, or limited availability. By including it in state-funded medical programs, we would ensure that more individuals have access to the potential benefits of medical cannabis regardless of their socioeconomic status. Step 5: Address potential counterarguments A strong argument should address possible counterarguments. Opponents might argue that cannabis use has risks, such as addiction or side effects that would outweigh the potential benefits. They may also argue that more research is required before fully integrating cannabis into state-funded programs. Acknowledge these concerns and provide counter-points based on the research, such as the fact that the benefits of medical cannabis, when used responsibly and under professional supervision, outweigh the risks. Additionally, emphasize the importance of making evidence-based decisions, and that cannabis should be considered as an option in state-funded medical programs based on the existing studies and expert opinions."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Venetian artist Jacopo de' Barbari, whom Durer had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and Durer said that he learned much about the new developments in perspective, anatomy, and proportion from him. De' Barbari was unwilling to explain everything he knew, so Durer began his own studies, which would become a lifelong preoccupation. A series of extant drawings show Durer's experiments in human proportion, leading to the famous engraving of Adam and Eve (1504), which shows his subtlety while using the burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces. This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name. Durer made large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the Betende Hande (English: Praying Hands, c. 1508 Albertina, Vienna), a study for an apostle in the Heller altarpiece. He also continued to make images in watercolour and bodycolour (usually combined), including a number of still lifes of meadow sections or animals, including his Young Hare (1502) and the Great Piece of Turf (1503, both also Albertina).

These may include research on teaching methodologies, classroom management, and effective use of resources. Justification: Academic research provides a solid foundation for drawing evidence-based conclusions on the effectiveness of quality education. 2. Collect statistical data on student achievement in different states: Compare educational achievement data from states with high-quality education systems against those where the quality is comparatively lacking. Key data may include literacy rates, graduation rates, and standardized test scores. Justification: Examining the educational outcomes of students from different states enables us to make informed conclusions about the effectiveness of high-quality state-managed education systems. 3. Analyze case studies of successful state interventions: Document instances where state education management has improved educational quality in struggling schools with specific initiatives. These case studies may include school turnaround programs, using proven teaching methods, or increasing educational resources.

Justification: Educators are directly involved in the education process and thus can provide valuable insights into the implications of high-quality state-managed education. 5. Research international comparisons: Compare the United States' educational performance with other countries' education systems, emphasizing those with higher ranks and more successful outcomes. Investigate the factors contributing to their success and how these can be incorporated into the state-managed education system in the United States. Justification: International comparisons provide a wider context and suggest that improvements in state-managed education quality can lead to better global competitiveness.

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation.

This is especially true of younger relatives. Look through their friend lists. If she's on Facebook, it's likely she will be friends with her family members. Again, remember that the name's rarity has to be factored in. If she was named Jane, but her brother was named Tobias, you may have more luck trying to find him because of his name's rarity. Also, men don't change their last names through marriage usually, so searching for her father or brother or other male relatives is a good bet. Can you find any of these? If so, you could add them and ask them if they know about her. See if you have mutual friends with her. Facebook has a ‚Äúmutual friends‚Äù feature that Facebook uses to match you with a name.

Given these facts, male dogs use_ in urine to mark their territory. among the following options: - ammonia - Chemical energy - proteins - semiochemicals - animals - heat produced - nitric oxide - They have thick fur A:","completion":"Male dogs use semiochemicals in urine to mark their territory. Semiochemicals are chemical signals that are used to convey information between organisms, and they can be further divided into two main categories: pheromones and allelochemicals. Pheromones are chemicals released by a member of a particular species that can affect the behavior or physiology of another member of the same species, while allelochemicals are chemical signals exchanged between organisms belonging to different species. In the case of male dogs, they release specific pheromones in their urine to communicate with other dogs in the area. When a male dog urinates on an object, such as a tree or lamppost, it leaves behind a scent that contains its unique blend of pheromones. These pheromone-laden urine marks serve a variety of purposes, including claiming territory and making other dogs aware of his presence. Urine marking is a form of scent communication mainly associated with male dogs, as they are likely to engage in this behavior to assert dominance, advertise breeding status, and establish boundaries within their environment. It is not uncommon for female dogs to engage in urine marking as well, but it is less frequent than in males. The pheromones present in the urine of male dogs are not limited to just one compound but are a complex mixture of chemicals that can carry various types of information. Some common pheromones found in dog urine include androstenone, a hormone produced in the testes and associated with sexual attraction and dominance, and specific volatile fatty acids, which help to preserve the scent of the pheromone chemicals in the urine so that the message can persist for a longer period. Given the importance of pheromones in urine marking for male dogs, it is clear that the correct answer among the given options is semiochemicals. While other substances, such as ammonia, proteins, or nitric oxide, may be present in the urine, they are not primarily responsible for the communicative function of urine marking in dogs, which is facilitated by semiochemicals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Negative Review: The Enchanted Journey, directed by the relatively unknown John Smith, aimed to capture the magic of family-friendly animation, but unfortunately, it fell short in a number of ways. Firstly, the storyline proves to be incredibly generic and uninspired. It follows a group of woodland creatures embarking on a journey to stop an evil wizard from destroying their forest home. The overused plot convention leaves the audience feeling as if they have seen it all before, making it hard to maintain interest in the story. In terms of animation, the movie tries to introduce a unique style to set it apart from the usual CGI-heavy fare. However, the result appears dated and lacks the finesse and sophistication viewers have come to expect. The animation falls short in terms of detail and smoothness, leading to a visually underwhelming experience. Moreover, the voice acting leaves much to be desired, as the characters sound more like low-rate impersonations of the original actors than anything else. Their emotive range is limited, diminishing the chance to truly connect with the characters. This lackluster performance is not helped by the poorly written dialogue that is riddled with clich√©d one-liners and forced humor. The soundtrack provides little solace, with generic tunes that barely complement the visuals on screen. Instead of engaging the audience and immersing them in the magical world, it serves as a constant distraction and reminder of the film's shoddy production. In conclusion, The Enchanted Journey struggles to define itself as a memorable animated movie, falling short in its visuals, voice acting, and plot. It leaves viewers with a sense of dissatisfaction and disappointment, making it hard to recommend to audiences of any age. ii. Positive Review: The Enchanted Journey, directed by up-and-coming filmmaker John Smith, might not be the most innovative animated movie out there, but it retains a certain charm that harkens back to classic storytelling. The movie brings a refreshing blend of old-school animation and a simple plot to engage the whole family. At its core, the storyline is a straightforward tale of good versus evil, centering around a group of woodland creatures who set out on a quest to save their forest home from an evil wizard. While it may not break any new ground in terms of narrative, it remains engaging thanks to its heartfelt characters and sincere storytelling. One of the film's more unique aspects is its choice of animation style. Harking back to the pre-CGI era, the hand-drawn animation lends an endearing, nostalgic quality to the film. The visuals appear more like a lovingly crafted storybook brought to life, which might resonate with older audiences and pique the interest of younger viewers accustomed to slick, CGI-heavy productions. The voice acting may not be top-notch, yet it provides a genuine feeling of earnestness to the characters. Sometimes the lack of polish in the performances lends an organic and approachable tone, making it easier for the audience to connect with the characters. Lastly, the soundtrack, although not groundbreaking, comfortably accompanies the visuals and provides a suitably enchanting backdrop for the story. It doesn't steal focus from the narrative, ensuring that viewers can fully immerse themselves in the world of the film. In summary, The Enchanted Journey is an undeniably nostalgia-driven animated film that offers a charming cast of characters and a simple plot. It might not compete with the high-budget productions of today, but it serves as a pleasant reminder of a simpler time in movie storytelling, making it a worthy addition to a family movie night."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The day goes smoothly until Jack is visited by a collection agency, claiming that he owes 95,000 in debts to their online gambling site. He trusts a colleague to take care of it (as he is convinced of some form of identity theft, which is later found out to be true and used to later set up Jack with a motive for robbing the bank) and goes out for a drink with colleague Harry Romano and potential employer, Bill Cox. Harry leaves in a taxi and Jack gets in his car. Unexpectedly, Cox follows him into the back seat. Cox then goes on to tell Jack that his family is being held hostage at their home to ensure Jack's cooperation. He then points a gun to Jack's head and forces him to drive home. Upon their arrival, Jack sees that, although his family is unharmed, they are under heavy watch by Cox's henchmen.

Onlookers watched in awe as the mongrel circled and sniffed the lifeless pup after finding it in a ditch where it had been left to rot in the midday sun. But rather than leave it to scavengers, who would inevitably have torn it limb from limb, she spent more than three minutes gently raking sand over the corpse with her snout with extraordinary care. But there were no sermons, ceremony or quiet reflection at this impromptu canine burial service... not even a bark. Scroll down for video. Tender: Onlookers watched in awe as the mongrel came across the lifeless pup in a roadside ditch where it had been left to rot in the sun. Loving care: But rather than leave it to scavengers, who would inevitably have torn it limb from limb, she spent more than three minutes raking sand over the corpse with her snout with painstaking tenderness.

Background: Immanuel Kant (; German: [I'ma:nue:l kant]; 22 April 1724 - 12 February 1804) was a German philosopher who is a central figure in modern philosophy. Kant argues that the human mind creates the structure of human experience, that reason is the source of morality, that aesthetics arises from a faculty of disinterested judgment, that space and time are forms of human sensibility, and that the world as it is \\"in-itself\\" is independent of humanity's concepts of it. Kant took himself to have effected a \\"Copernican revolution\\" in philosophy, akin to Copernicus' reversal of the age-old belief that the sun revolves around the earth. Context: In \\"Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch\\", Kant listed several conditions that he thought necessary for ending wars and creating a lasting peace. They included a world of constitutional republics. His classical republican theory was extended in the Science of Right, the first part of the Metaphysics of Morals (1797). Kant believed that universal history leads to the ultimate world of republican states at peace, but his theory was not pragmatic. The process was described in \\"Perpetual Peace\\" as natural rather than rational: The guarantee of perpetual peace is nothing less than that great artist, nature...In her mechanical course we see that her aim is to produce a harmony among men, against their will, and indeed through their discord. As a necessity working according to laws we do not know, we call it destiny. But, considering its designs in universal history, we call it \\"providence,\\" inasmuch as we discern in it the profound wisdom of a higher cause which predetermines the course of nature and directs it to the objective final end of the human race. Kant's political thought can be summarized as republican government and international organization. \\"In more characteristically Kantian terms, it is doctrine of the state based upon the law (Rechtsstaat) and of eternal peace. Indeed, in each of these formulations, both terms express the same idea: that of legal constitution or of 'peace through law'. Taken simply by itself, Kant's political philosophy, being essentially a legal doctrine, rejects by definition the opposition between moral education and the play of passions as alternate foundations for social life. The state is defined as the union of men under law. The state rightly so called is constituted by laws which are necessary a priori because they flow from the very concept of law. A regime can be judged by no other criteria nor be assigned any other functions, than those proper to the lawful order as such.\\" He opposed \\"democracy,\\" which at his time meant direct democracy, believing that majority rule posed a threat to individual liberty. He stated, \\"...democracy is, properly speaking, necessarily a despotism, because it establishes an executive power in which 'all' decide for or even against one who does not agree; that is, 'all,' who are not quite all, decide, and this is a contradiction of the general will with itself and with freedom.\\" As with most writers at the time, he distinguished three forms of government i.e. democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy with mixed government as the most ideal form of it. Question: Was he criticized?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Immanuel Kant faced criticism for his ideas and theories. While his work has been influential in shaping modern philosophy, some thinkers have critiqued his views on various subjects. Some of the notable criticisms and responses to Kant's work include the following: 1. Friedrich Nietzsche criticized Kant's moral philosophy, particularly the notion of the categorical imperative. Nietzsche believed that Kant's emphasis on duty and universal moral laws was too rigid and failed to account for the complexities of human nature and individual motivations. In contrast, Nietzsche advocated for a more flexible and individualistic approach to morality. 2. G.W.F. Hegel criticized Kant's transcendental idealism, which posited that our knowledge is shaped by the structure of our minds and limited to our subjective experience. Hegel argued that this view unnecessarily separates the human mind from the world and creates a dualism between the noumenal (the world as it is \\"in itself\\") and the phenomenal (the world as it appears to us) realms. Instead, Hegel proposed a dialectical process where the mind and the world are interrelated and mutually inform each other. 3. Postmodern philosophers, such as Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard, have critiqued Kant's emphasis on reason and the objective nature of truth. They argue that such notions are products of specific historical and cultural contexts, rather than universal principles that hold true for all of humanity. Postmodern thinkers emphasize the importance of considering multiple perspectives and subjective interpretations, which challenges Kant's foundational approach to knowledge and ethics. 4. Some political philosophers and theorists took issue with Kant's ideas on democracy and his preference for a mixed government. While Kant was opposed to direct democracy as he saw it as a form of despotism, critics argue that his views do not account for the development of representative democracy, which has become the predominant form of democratic governance in modern times. Critics also point out that the mixed government model can be problematic, as it may lead to a concentration of power and potential abuses, as seen in some historic examples such as the French Ancien R√©gime. In conclusion, while it is undeniable that Immanuel Kant has left a lasting impact on the field of philosophy, his work has also faced critique from various angles. His theories on morality, knowledge and political governance have all been subjected to scrutiny and debate by subsequent thinkers. It's important to recognize that philosophical ideas, even those as influential as Kant's, are subject to revision and reinterpretation in light of new perspectives and evolving intellectual contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: whens the last time someone has been to the moon?","completion":"The last manned moon landing occurred during the Apollo 17 mission, which was the sixth and last mission of NASA's Apollo program to successfully land humans on the lunar surface. Apollo 17 was launched on December 7, 1972, and the lunar module, named \\"Challenger,\\" touched down on the moon on December 11, 1972, at 19:54:57 UTC. The crew of Apollo 17 consisted of Commander Eugene Cernan, Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt, and Command Module Pilot Ronald Evans. Cernan and Schmitt spent a total of about 75 hours on the lunar surface, conducting three extravehicular activities (EVAs) or moonwalks, while Evans remained in orbit around the moon aboard the Command Module \\"America.\\" During their time on the moon, Cernan and Schmitt carried out various experiments, collected samples, and captured photographs of the lunar terrain. The two astronauts traveled more than 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) in the Lunar Roving Vehicle and gathered approximately 110 kilograms (242 pounds) of rock and soil samples, including a unique orange-colored soil found at the Shorty Crater. They also deployed a series of scientific instruments, such as a seismometer to study lunar earthquakes, and a gravimeter to measure variations in the moon's gravitational field. Apollo 17 marked the end of the Apollo program and the conclusion of manned lunar landings in the 20th century. As the final words before departing the moon, Commander Eugene Cernan said, \\"As I take these last steps from the surface for some time to come, I'd just like to record that America's challenge of today has forged mankind's destiny of tomorrow. And as we leave the Moon and Taurus-Littrow, we leave as we came, and, God willing, we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind.\\" With that, Cernan and Schmitt boarded the lunar module, and the ascent stage lifted off from the moon on December 14, 1972, at 22:54:37 UTC. No human has set foot on the moon since Apollo 17. However, plans for future manned moon missions are currently being developed by various countries and organizations, including NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the lunar surface by the mid-2020s."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I love science fiction, I am fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation. I figured a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable. I could not have been more wrong: The story (or actually the lack there of) was completely uninspired and lacks imagination - while imagination usually is the biggest component of any science fiction story. The dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives new meaning to the term 'bad performance'. Bad acting wouldn't have been such a huge problem if only 'director' Bilal didn't take himself so seriously; all the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic, it looks like Bilal really thinks he has made a piece of art here. Well, there's no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk, only pretentiousness! This man should really stick to making comics, since he fails on all possible accounts as a director. Worst of all is the terrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience. The graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in 'Van Helsing' look like live actors! And since half the characters are CGI-animated, it is quite a problem that the CGI-effects look so fake. If the Egyptian Gods actually exist then Bilal's a dead guy, since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie.

Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the given sentence from the movie review - \\"more a gunfest than a rock concert\\" - it is not definitive whether the movie was seen positively or negatively, since the statement, by itself, does not convey an explicit positive or negative sentiment. However, there is some information that can provide us with a preliminary indication of the critic's thoughts on the film. The sentence seems to be pointing out that the movie featured more violence (as suggested by the term \\"gunfest\\") than perhaps what was expected or advertised (implied by \\"rock concert\\"). A \\"gunfest\\" refers to a heavy display of gun-related violence, while a \\"rock concert\\" usually signifies a strong emphasis on music, energy, or entertainment. The comparison of the two expressions might hint at the critic's disappointment or dissatisfaction with an imbalance between the movie's violent aspects and its entertainment or musical elements. To conclude, it could imply that the film was heavy on action and guns rather than focusing on other promising or exciting aspects that were expected or desired by the audience. However, without additional information or context about the movie or the critic's overall impression, it is difficult to determine whether this comment was intended to be positive or negative, as different viewers may have different preferences when it comes to the balance of action and entertainment elements in a movie. Some might enjoy a movie packed with action and guns, and thus see this statement positively. Others who prefer storyline, character development, or music, might interpret this statement as negative. So, it would be beneficial to gather more background information or look for other statements and opinions expressed in the review, to definitively ascertain whether the movie was perceived positively or negatively."},{"prompt":"Information: - Charing Cross denotes the junction of Strand, Whitehall and Cockspur Street, just south of Trafalgar Square in central London.

Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases. Mike was visiting the African Savannah.

TJ had been placed in charge of the children when the kids' grandmother, Katherine, left home on July 15 and will watch the children while the legal proceedings play out in a California court. TJ Jackson, 34, is the son of Tito Jackson and the late Delores Martes Jackson. TJ and his older brothers, Taj and Taryll, form the R&B group 3T. Jackson is married with three children, a boy and two girls. Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian of Michael Jackson's children A 1995 article in People described the brothers' childhood as normal despite their famous father, uncle and aunts. Taj Jackson told the magazine: \\"My mom made sure that we had a real childhood, with birthday parties, baseball, family outings, all that stuff.\\" They were close to their Uncle Michael. \\"He's like a third parent to us,\\" Taj told People in 1995. Eventually the brothers went along on one of his tours and decided to form a singing group and were recording their first album in 1994 at the time of their mother's death. Initially it was believed Delores Martes Jackson, who had divorced from Tito Jackson in 1993, drowned in a swimming pool, but the case was reopened, and her sons in 1995 filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against a man they accused of killing her. Three years later, Donald Bohana was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison, according to People magazine.

When the army solved the problem, they didn't know what to do with the remaining corpses and sent them to Uneeda by mistake. Soon, they forgot the reclaim the living corpses from the medical supply company Uneeda.

Please answer the following question: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...

They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips. Would PepsiCo potatoes be less or more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods'? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers. These GMO potatoes have been genetically engineered for specific attributes, such as increased herbicide tolerance. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. Considering the genetic modifications made to the PepsiCo potatoes, we can infer that: 1. The PepsiCo potatoes have been genetically engineered to be herbicide-tolerant, which means they can tolerate exposure to herbicides like glyphosate without being harmed. 2. The non-GMO potatoes supplied by Kettle Foods have not been genetically engineered for herbicide resistance and, thus, may not tolerate herbicides to the same extent as the GMO potatoes. Based on these points, it is likely that the PepsiCo potatoes would be more herbicide-tolerant than the Kettle Foods potatoes, due to the genetic modifications made to enhance their herbicide resistance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Shane Farberman knows how to clown around. He‚Äôs been doing it professionally for 32 years. But it‚Äôs not his funny chops giving Farberman, known better by his clown name, Doo Doo, worldwide attention. Rather, he‚Äôs being recognized for his quick thinking in an incident far more serious than his usual work. It happened around 3 p.m. on Sunday, as Farberman was driving back from a day‚Äôs work with two clown colleagues in the backseat. Around Front and Portland Sts., Farberman said he saw a man jumping on cars. ‚ÄúRight away, I called 911 [and] said ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a guy in distress,‚Äô‚Äù he said. The man ran down to Bathurst Street, and Farberman, after being asked where he was by the emergency operator, followed him in his car. As he turned the corner, he saw the man take a swipe at two women walking the opposite direction in the street. ‚ÄúThey started walking a little quicker. They obviously knew something was up. And the guy turns around and starts chasing them,‚Äù he said. At that point, Farberman, still in full clown makeup and dress, rolled down his windows and yelled for the women to get in his car. ‚ÄúI screamed and screamed like 20 times, ‚ÄòGet in my car,‚Äô‚Äô he said, adding he only realized after how bizarre the moment must have been for the women. ‚Äú[They‚Äôre] looking at a black hummer, and a clown screaming ‚ÄúGet in! Get in!‚Äù The women dove into Farberman‚Äôs car, squeezing in with the two other clowns in the backseat, while the man followed soon after and started pounding on the car. ‚ÄúHe was kicking, smashing it, and all of a sudden he ripped my mirror off. He looked like Jack Nicholson in [The Shining],‚Äù he said. While everybody in the car was screaming at the man trying to get in, police arrived and subdued him. A police spokesperson was unable to say whether charges were laid, or whether more information would be released. Coincidentally, Farberman had a dashboard camera, given to him as a gift a week earlier by his son, and captured the whole incident on it. A CityNews crew who arrived on the scene got the footage before it was seized by police. The news story has since gone viral, and Farberman said he woke up Monday to a media circus and roughly 12,000 emails from all over the world. ‚ÄúI thought ‚ÄòI‚Äôll go through [the emails].‚Äô I sat down for 15 minutes. I did 10,‚Äù he said. While Doo Doo has had his share of fame, notably as the clown in the Adam Sandler movie Billy Madison, Farberman is still new to worldwide attention. He received a celebratory scroll from the city, as well as a reception with City councillor Norm Kelly on Monday. Kelly said he was struck by Farberman‚Äôs bravery. ‚ÄúYou give an additional definition to the word clown. You weren‚Äôt clowning around. You were acting decisively and bravely,‚Äù Kelly told Farberman while giving him the scroll. Like most people suddenly famous for a good deed, Farberman said he doesn‚Äôt consider his actions particularly heroic. ‚ÄúIf you watch the video, you see how terrified we were ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm very humbled. I believe that people should look out for people,‚Äù he said. Doo Doo the Clown is not the first costumed hero to grace our streets. Here are some of the GTA‚Äôs other caped crusaders.

Well done,‚Äù Coun. Norm Kelly told Doo Doo the clown at city hall Monday as he presented him with a scroll. For his part, Doo Doo said he didn‚Äôt even realize he was still in costume when he snapped into action. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even think of me being in clown (costume). I‚Äôve been doing this for 32 years, so I forget that I‚Äôm in costume when I‚Äôm out there in between shows. Yeah ‚Äì it was a no-brainer,‚Äù Doo Doo the clown told CP24 Monday. The incident happened near Bathurst and Front streets Sunday afternoon as Doo Doo, a well-known clown on the Toronto scene who also appeared in the film ‚ÄòBilly Madison,‚Äô was between shows. ‚ÄúI had a carload of clowns and I was driving one of them back to Union Station and as we turned the corner, I saw this man jumping on cars. He was wearing just shorts, no shoes, no socks and a shirt,‚Äù Doo Doo said. The clown called 911 and then turned his vehicle to keep an eye on the man. Dash cam video of the incident obtained by The Toronto Sun showed the man shoving one of the women, walking a few metres and then turning around and running to pursue them. That‚Äôs when Doo Doo is heard on the video screaming at the women to pile into the car. ‚ÄúThe guy went crazy. He started kicking, banging, he ripped my mirror off. (The women) were lying on the back seat of my car on top of people,‚Äù Doo Doo said. ‚ÄúThe only thing that stopped him was the police ‚Äì they came from every direction and tackled him down. It took eight officers, so obviously something serious was wrong.‚Äù Doo Doo told CP24 the incident was ‚Äúpetrifying.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou now that face Jack Nicholson has (in ‚ÄòThe Shining‚Äô)? It was the scariest sight. He was out to get them. I had the door locked, but I was holding on for dear life. It was pretty scary for everybody,‚Äù he said. Nevertheless, the father and husband said he didn‚Äôt think twice about helping the women. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd ever think I‚Äôd be involved in,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI saw those two ladies ‚Äì I have a wife, I have a daughter, I have children. When I saw him running towards them after pushing them, I screamed, probably 20 times (for them to get in). You can hear me screaming.‚Äù While he acknowledged the unusual situation ‚Äúwas very bizarre,‚Äù he said the ladies didn‚Äôt hesitate when he offered his help. ‚ÄúThere was no thinking ‚Äì they ran, they jumped in,‚Äù he said. In the end, Doo Doo said, he was just grateful no one was hurt. ‚ÄúThank goodness the worst part of it is my mirror ‚Äì if that can be the worst, that‚Äôs it,‚Äù he said. Police said Monday that 25-year-old Wei Guo has been charged with two counts of assault and one count of mischief in connection with the incident. He is believed to have been under the effects of illegal narcotics at the time of the incident, police said. Messages praising bravery pour in Speaking at city hall, Doo Doo said he has been ‚Äúoverwhelmed‚Äù with the thousands of congratulatory tweets, emails and Facebook posts people have sent him from around the world. But the biggest praise, he said, came from his kids. ‚ÄúI came in last night and the first thing my daughter said was ‚ÄòDad you‚Äôre my hero.‚Äô I was bawling,‚Äù the affable clown said, flanked by two of his children.

The incident happened when Shane Farberman, better known as Doo Doo, and his fellow clowns were driving back from a performance. Farberman noticed a man jumping on cars and immediately called 911. The man started chasing two women on the street, so Farberman, still in full clown makeup, offered the women a safe place in his car. The man tried to attack Farberman's car, damaging it in the process. The police arrived at the scene promptly and apprehended the man. Interestingly, the entire incident was caught on Farberman's dashboard camera which was then handed over to the police. This unusual event has brought Farberman considerable attention and he has received messages from all over the world commending his heroic intervention. Further validating his brave deeds, he was awarded a celebratory scroll by the city and City councillor Norm Kelly praised Farberman for his decisive and brave actions.

Initially modeling his writing style on the songs of Woody Guthrie, the blues of Robert Johnson, and what he termed the \\"architectural forms\\" of Hank Williams songs, Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it \\"with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry\\". Paul Simon suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: \\"[Dylan's] early songs were very rich ... with strong melodies. 'Blowin' in the Wind' has a really strong melody. He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while. He defined the genre for a while.\\"When Dylan made...

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration. - A levee,, dike, dyke, embankment, floodbank or stopbank is an elongated naturally occurring ridge or artificially constructed fill or wall, which regulates water levels. It is usually earthen and often parallel to the course of a river in its floodplain or along low-lying coastlines. - The Patea River is in Taranaki in the North Island of New Zealand. It runs for 105 kilometres from the eastern slopes of Mount Taranaki, passing east through Stratford before swinging south and reaching the South Taranaki Bight near the town of Patea. - A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks. Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to as a \\"bayou\\", \\"beck\\", \\"branch\\", \\"brook\\", \\"burn\\", \\"creek\\", \\"crick\\", \\"ghyll\\", \\"gill\\", \\"kill\\", \\"lick\\", \\"mill race\\", \\"race\\", \\"rill\\", \\"river\\", \\"rivulet\\", \\"run\\", \\"runnel\\", \\"streamage\\", \\"syke\\", or \\"wash\\". - New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France. The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\"). - Mount Taranaki, or Mount Egmont, is an active but quiescent stratovolcano in the Taranaki region on the west coast of New Zealand's North Island. Although the mountain is more commonly referred to as Taranaki, it has two official names under the alternative names policy of the New Zealand Geographic Board. The 2518-metre-high mountain is one of the most symmetrical volcanic cones in the world. There is a secondary cone, Fanthams Peak, , on the south side. Because of its resemblance to Mount Fuji, Taranaki provided the backdrop for the movie \\"The Last Samurai\\". - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. - Patea is the third-largest town in South Taranaki, New Zealand. It is on the western bank of the Patea River, 61 kilometres north-west of Whanganui on State Highway 3. Hawera is 27 km to the north-west, and Waverley 17 km to the east. The Patea River flows through the town from the north-east and into the South Taranaki Bight. For the former electorate from 1893 to 1963 see Patea. - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it. - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. - A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or artificial, that is usually smaller than a lake. They may arise naturally in floodplains as part of a river system, or they may be somewhat isolated depressions (examples include vernal pools and prairie potholes). Usually they contain shallow water with marsh and aquatic plants and animals. A few animals also make their home in ponds, including both alligators and beavers. The type of life in a pond is generally determined by a combination of factors including water level regime (particularly depth and duration of flooding) and nutrient levels, but other factors may also be important, including presence or absence of shading by trees, presence or absence of streams, effects of grazing animals, and salinity. - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - The South Taranaki Bight is a large bay that extends south and east from the south coast of Taranaki in New Zealand's North Island. With more symmetry than poetry or originality, it is matched by the North Taranaki Bight to the north of Cape Egmont. - Etymology is the study of the history of words, their origins, and how their form and meaning have changed over time. By extension, the term \\"the etymology (of a word)\\" means the origin of the particular word. - Retaining walls are structures designed to restrain soil to a slope that it would not naturally keep to (typically a steep, near-vertical or vertical slope). They are used to bound soils between two different elevations often in areas of terrain possessing undesirable slopes or in areas where the landscape needs to be shaped severely and engineered for more specific purposes like hillside farming or roadway overpasses. - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city. - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate. - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - A dam is a barrier that impounds water or underground streams. Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability. Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity. A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations. Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates or levees (also known as dikes) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions. - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\". - Lake Rotorangi is the largest lake in the New Zealand region of Taranaki . The reservoir was created in 1984 by the damming of the Patea River . - A reservoir (etymology: from French \\"r√©servoir\\" a \\"storehouse\\" ) is a storage space for fluids. These fluids may be water, hydrocarbons or gas. A reservoir usually means an enlarged natural or artificial lake, storage pond or impoundment created using a dam or lock to store water. Reservoirs can be created by controlling a stream that drains an existing body of water. They can also be constructed in river valleys using a dam. Alternately, a reservoir can be built by excavating flat ground and/or constructing retaining walls and levees. - Fiji ((), officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island. Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east, the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north.

Please answer the following question: Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn‚Äôt cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‚Äòeverything we knew about nutrition?‚Äô Not quite. And here‚Äôs why.

Movie title: Bloody Mama Movie plot: Young Kate Barker (Lisa Jill) is brutalized by her father and older brothers, who rape her. Thirty-five years later, the middle-aged Kate 'Ma' Barker (Shelley Winters) now brutalizes innocent people herself, while indulging her monstrous sexual appetites. She lives by robbing banks with her four sons; the pragmatic Arthur (Clint Kimbrough), the sadistic Herman (Don Stroud), the bisexual Fred (Robert Walden), and the loyal, drug-addicted Lloyd (Robert De Niro). It all begins in the late 1920s when Ma leaves her husband, George, and her Arkansas home and embarks on her own with her four sons on a robbery-murder spree to make her own fortune, while keeping them under a tight leash. When Herman and Fred are arrested and imprisoned for petty theft charges, Ma takes over the group and leads Arthur and Lloyd on a bank robbery spree to gain enough money to get her sons out of jail. The gang is joined by a gunman named Kevin (Bruce Dern) who was Fred's cellmate during his incarceration (and his strongly implied lover). The group is also joined by a local prostitute named Mona Gibson, whom Herman frequented before his imprisonment. The gang resorts to more violent action and robberies. While hiding out at a cabin in Kentucky, Lloyd comes across a young woman swimming at a nearby lake whom he sexually assaults. Not wanting the woman to report them to the police, the Barkers hold her captive and Ma eventually kills her by drowning her, despite the protests of her sons. Some time later, the gang arrives in Tennessee where they abduct a wealthy businessman named Sam Pendlebury (Pat Hingle). Holding him for a 300,000 ransom, the sons, particularly Herman, bond with their captive whom they see as the sympathetic father figure they never had. When Herman and Mona go to collect the ransom, they are chased by a pair of FBI agents and barely escape. When they find that the ransom is only half of what they originally demanded, Ma orders her sons to kill Sam rather than let him go. But none of them can bring themselves to do it...

Difference between combined and separate sewer systems? \\"Who was the first economist to have coined the term 'micro economics' and 'macro economics'?\\" OPT: --no --yes","completion":"_No Although both questions are seeking information, their content and focus are not the same. Let's break down these questions individually to explain their differences. 1. \\"Difference between combined and separate sewer systems?\\" This question is specifically asking for the differences between the two types of sewer systems. Understanding these systems is important in order to develop and maintain proper wastewater management infrastructure. Combined Sewer System: A combined sewer system collects rainwater runoff, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater into a single pipe system that transports the combined wastewater to a treatment facility. Combined sewer systems are common in older cities and experience problems in heavy rain or snowmelt periods. When the volume of wastewater exceeds the capacity of the sewer system or treatment plant, the excess wastewater may be discharged into nearby water bodies, posing pollution risks. Separate Sewer System: A separate sewer system maintains two different pipe systems for wastewater collection and management. One pipe carries sewage from homes and businesses to a wastewater treatment plant, while another pipe collects and transports stormwater runoff to surface waters like rivers, lakes, and streams. This system is designed to prevent sewage from mixing with rainwater, and thus, helps reduce water pollution and protects the environment. Additionally, separate sewer systems are less likely to experience overflow during heavy precipitation events compared to combined sewer systems. 2. \\"Who was the first economist to have coined the term 'microeconomics' and 'macroeconomics'?\\" This question focuses on the origin of the terms 'microeconomics' and 'macroeconomics,' and seeks information about the economist who established these concepts. Swedish economist Ragnar Frisch is credited with coining the terms 'microeconomics' and 'macroeconomics.' Born in 1895, Frisch played a significant role in founding the discipline of econometrics and laying the foundations for modern economic theory. He is also known as one of the founding members of the Econometric Society. Frisch introduced the terms 'microeconomics' and 'macroeconomics' in 1933 to distinguish between the analysis of individual agents' decisions (microeconomics) and the study of aggregate economic phenomena or the economy as a whole (macroeconomics). Ragnar Frisch received the first Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1969, along with Jan Tinbergen, for their pioneering work in econometrics. In summary, the first question deals with the technical aspects of wastewater management infrastructure, while the second question focuses on the origins of economic theory. Therefore, these questions do not have the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump‚Äôs predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia.

The FTC claimed that the purchasing process was confusing and unscrupulous, resulting in customers paying more than they expected for the advertised products. The Controversial BOGO Promotion The focal point of the FTC's complaint revolved around Allstar Marketing Group's BOGO promotions, used for several of its products, including the Snuggie and Magic Mesh Door. According to the FTC, the advertisements did not properly disclose the processing and handling fees that customers were required to pay during the ordering process. Consequently, customers thought they were getting a great deal, only to be surprised by additional fees. FTC's Complaint and Refund Process After a thorough investigation by the FTC, it was determined that Allstar Marketing Group's ordering process was both confusing and deceptive, leading customers to unintentionally pay more than they initially intended. As a result of the FTC's allegations, Allstar Marketing Group agreed to a settlement in 2015. The restitution will result in refunds being issued to over 218,000 customers, with the average refund amount totaling 33.14. Although the agreement was reached several years ago, refund checks are finally being mailed out to the affected customers this week. It is anticipated that the compensation will help restore consumer faith in the company and bring a sense of justice to those who were affected by the deceptive sales tactics. Consumer Awareness and Protection The case of Allstar Marketing Group highlights the importance of consumer awareness and understanding the complete terms and conditions of advertised deals. Additionally, it serves as a reminder for companies to adhere to ethical and transparent marketing practices to avoid potential legal repercussions and negative publicity. Lessons Learned and Future Outlook For Allstar Marketing Group, the 7.2 million repayment serves as a costly reminder to prioritize clear and honest communication with their customers. By taking steps to ensure transparent advertising and purchase processes in the future, the company can work towards rebuilding consumer trust and safeguarding its reputation. The repercussions faced by Allstar Marketing Group provide a lesson to other businesses as well. As consumers become increasingly savvy and litigious, companies must evolve their marketing strategies to prioritize transparency and accuracy, keeping customers fully informed of all charges and fees associated with their products and promotions. Such practices will not only protect organizations from potential legal trouble but also contribute to building long-lasting customer relationships based on trust and satisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Unfortunately , due to the collapse of Thalion , only two of the games ( Amberstar and Ambermoon ) were ever released , and Ambermoon only in a German version ( although , years later , an English version emerged which appeared to have been finished by Thalion immediately before the company closed down ; the version of the release is 1.07 , while the last German version apparently was 1.05 ) . The games were set in a fictional world called Lyramion . In Amberstar , the character is on a quest to defeat a demon by collecting an artifact called the Amberstar , which had been divided into 13 pieces and scattered all across the world . In Ambermoon , Lyramion has collided with its third moon , dividing it into a number of smaller islets . 90 years has passed since the events in Amberstar took place , and the character is the grandson of the main character in Amberstar ( the game starts with the old dying man passing on his knowledge to the character ) . The title of what was supposed to be the third and final game was disclosed by game creator Karsten K√∂per as being Ambersun . - Amberstar was the first installment in Thalion Software's never-finished Amber Trilogy, a role-playing video game franchise. Although considerably more advanced, the game had many similarities to Thalion's earlier game DragonFlight, and was by many fans thought to be a \\"sequel\\" to this game.

Then he pushed the gear to gear B, which was 600 million years from now. Then he further pushed the gear to gear C, which brought him to 800 million years from now. Finally, he pushed the gear to gear D, which brought him to 1.1 billion years from now. Though he traveled time, Rob was always on Earth all the time. and a hint : In the long term, the greatest changes in the Solar System will come from changes in the Sun itself as it ages. As the Sun burns through its supply of hydrogen fuel, it gets hotter and burns the remaining fuel even faster. As a result, the Sun is growing brighter at a rate of ten percent every 1.1 billion years. In about 600 million years, the Sun brightness will have disrupted the Carbon Cycle to the point that trees and forests (C3 photosynthetic plant life) will no longer be able to survive and in around 800 million years, the Sun will have killed all complex life on the Earth's surface and in the oceans. In 1.1 billion years' time, the Sun's increased radiation output will cause its circumstellar habitable zone to move outwards, making the Earth's surface too hot for liquid water to exist there naturally. At this point, all life will be reduced to single celled organisms. Evaporation of water, a potent greenhouse gas, from the oceans' surface could accelerate temperature increase, potentially ending all life on Earth even sooner. During this time, it is possible that as Mars's surface temperature gradually rises, carbon dioxide and water currently frozen under the surface regolith will release into the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect that will heat the planet until it achieves conditions parallel to Earth today, providing a potential future abode for life. By 3.5 billion years from now, Earth's surface conditions will be similar to those of Venus today. Please answer this question : When Rob would see more complex organisms, gear B or gear C? Answer:","completion":"Rob would see more complex organisms at gear B (600 million years from now) because at gear C (800 million years from now), the Sun will have killed all complex life on Earth's surface and in the oceans."},{"prompt":"Given a set of four words, generate the category that the words belong to.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her.

But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando.

The CCF was founded in 1932 in Calgary, Alberta, by a number of socialist, agrarian, co-operative, and labour groups, and the League for Social Reconstruction. In 1944, the CCF formed the first social-democratic government in North America when it was elected to form the provincial government in Saskatchewan. In 1961, the CCF was succeeded by the New Democratic Party (NDP). The full, but little used, name of the party was Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist). - Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \\"floor\\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election. - Graham Steele ( July 8 , 1964 , Winnipeg , Manitoba ) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician , having represented the constituency of Halifax Fairview in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 2001 - 2013 for the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party .

Tak'alik Ab'aj (; Mayan pronunciation: [takÀÄaÀàlik aÀÄ'…ìaœá] (listen); Spanish: [takaÀàlik aÀàŒ≤ax]) is a pre-Columbian archaeological site in Guatemala. It was formerly known as Abaj Takalik; its ancient name may have been Kooja. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites with both Olmec and Maya features. The site flourished in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important centre of commerce, trading with Kaminaljuyu and Chocol√°. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, petroglyphs and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments.","completion":"The modern name of Kooja is Tak'alik Ab'aj, which is a pre-Columbian archaeological site in Guatemala.

The next morning,as Mr.Li opened the office door,he found the same piece of paper on the floor.Some words were added after his words:\\"Thank you for your kindness.Anyway,you are a clever fellow.\\" Why did the owner of the ball run away quickly? A) He was afraid of Mr.Li. B) He wanted to get the ball back. C) He wanted to go home. D) He went to look for the ball. Answer:","completion":"A) He was afraid of Mr.Li. The owner of the ball likely ran away quickly because he was afraid of Mr. Li's reaction to being hit on the head by the ball. It is possible that the boy was worried about facing potential consequences, such as being scolded or punished, for causing harm to Mr. Li. This fear could have led the boy and his friends to rapidly flee the scene and disappear. Additionally, the boy's response on the note left by Mr. Li the next morning, expressing gratitude for Mr. Li's kindness and referring to him as \\"a clever fellow,\\" further suggests that the boy was relieved at not facing a negative outcome and appreciated Mr. Li's understanding and lenient response to the situation.

Movie title: The Lake House Context: Kate Forster is a Doctor in 2006, living alone in Chicago. She has moved into an apartment after living in a house built next to a scenic lake in a secluded countryside area. She writes a letter to the next tenant asking that they forward any mail, and that the paw prints and the box in the attic have always been there. The tenant Alex Wyler reads the letter, but finds no paw prints, no box and no sign of life within the last 5 years, so disregards the letter until a few days later when he is redoing the paint on the handrails and a stray dog, whom Alex takes in and names Jack although the dog is female, trots through the brown paint and leaves its paw prints all the way to the front door. He writes to Kate asking more about these incidents and leaves the letter in the mail box.On Valentine's Day 2006, Kate visits the Lake House after having a gentleman die in her arms after being hit by a bus, but finds the Mail Box Flag is up. She reads Alex's letter and states her current address, also stating it is 2006, not 2004 from which Alex's letter arrives from. Alex attends her 'current address' but finds a construction site that won't be finished for another 18 months, and they both slowly realize they are communicating from two years apart, with only the Mailbox to communicate from.As Kate and Alex continue to correspond through the mailbox, they find themselves falling in love. Because Kate is in the future, she can tell Alex specific places to look for her in 2004. On one occasion, she asks Alex to bring her back something important (a gift from her father; her favorite novel by Jane Austen called Persuasion), which she left two years ago during a train station meeting with her then-beau, Morgan. Alex goes to the station and finds the item and sees Kate with long hair. Even though he has the item, he does not place it in the mailbox to return it to her.

Input: By Jonathan MorrisBBC News, Plymouth Lead workers, stonemasons, coppersmiths, glaziers and conservators have been busy sprucing up the centrepiece of the 11th Century Buckfast Abbey. The church was rebuilt in 1932 but the entire abbey and grounds are getting a makeover to mark the abbey's millennium in 2018. Restoration of the church, with a new limestone floor, is costing about ¬£4m, according to the abbot, David Charlesworth. Elsewhere, new workshops have been built, a terrace has been added to the restaurant and there are big plans to increase accommodation for visitors. It is a huge turnaround from the 1980s when the monastery was in serious financial difficulties. And underpinning it all is the success of Buckfast Tonic Wine, which is made at the abbey. \\"Clearly there were financial problems,\\" said Abbot Charlesworth, 62, who has been at the abbey since he was a would-be monk aged 18. \\"And there is no great fund in the Vatican that doles out money. \\"A monastery is an independent entity which happens to be linked to Rome.\\" At the beginning of the 1980s, the monastery produced the tonic wine, but \\"it was not the industry which it is today\\", said the abbot. From a team of about 20 lay staff in the 1980s, the abbey now employs 123 across its shops, cafes, maintenance departments and a modern winery, opened two years ago. The abbey's charitable trust, chaired by the abbot, is a 34% shareholder in the wine's seller, J Chandler and Co, and gets a royalty fee for every bottle sold. Last year the trust received ¬£6.6m, which includes income from other activities such as the shops, restaurant, a conference centre and accommodation. The conference facilities are located in the abbey's former prep school, along with an interactive education centre that draws in 11,000 young visitors a year. The conference centre is on the site of a former preparatory boarding school. A former monk and headmaster, Gregory Miller, 80, was given a suspended prison sentence earlier this year for making and possessing indecent images of children. The abbey community at the time spoke of its \\"betrayal and dismay\\" and said \\"there is absolutely no place for this totally unacceptable behaviour\\". Ordained priest William Manahan, 80, was jailed for 15 months in 2007 for sexually abusing boys at the school between 1971 and 1978. Another monk at the abbey, Paul Couch, was convicted in 2007 of two serious sexual offences and 11 indecent sexual assaults against boys at the school and was jailed for 10 years and nine months. Bishop Christopher Budd ordered an investigation by the NSPCC after Christopher Jarvis, 49, who was employed by the Diocese of Plymouth to investigate sex abuse allegations, was jailed for a year in 2011 after admitting 12 counts involving indecent images. The school closed in 1994, with the abbey saying it had become financially unviable. Abbot Charlesworth said that today the tonic wine was the \\"biggest part\\" of the abbey's income. \\"We use the income to consolidate what we are doing here, particularly to make sure the buildings are in good order.\\" Father James Courtney, the abbey bursar, is the only monk still involved in the Buckfast production which is staffed by three lay workers. \\"I look in from time to time and say you're all doing very well,\\" he said. \\"Monks have been making drinks for centuries. Dom Perignon invented champagne and Chardonnay was invented by monks. \\"I feel a lot of satisfaction with the winery. \\"A lot of hard work and resources have gone into what I think is the right direction.\\" Adjoining the abbey is a huge former wool spinning plant which the abbey bought earlier this year. Details of the plant's future are unclear, but the abbey hopes to create more jobs there. The number of monks has declined - there were about 40 when the Abbot Charlesworth was elected abbot in 1992. Now there are 15. \\"Monasteries don't exist in bubbles, they exist in societies,\\" he said. \\"It is a society that might talk a lot about spiritual things but it's a pick and mix way of dealing with it \\"If I get bored with pilates, yoga, evangelical, fundamentalism, Christianity, Judaism, whatever, I can dump it. \\"It's a very restless society and therefore it's very difficult for people to commit themselves to this way of life. \\"So if you look at the bigger picture it's not surprising.\\" He has established a house of \\"vocational discernment\\" - a sort of stepping stone into monastic life without any commitment. There are summer schools too - and other events aimed at bringing more people into the monastery. And like Abbot Charlesworth, who arrived as a teenager, he hopes that some will stay. \\"All these things are bringing people here so they can investigate the potential of Buckfast and whether they have a part in something like this,\\" he said. \\"But it is not about numbers, but the spirit of those here.\\" Output:","completion":"Part #1: Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary Usage: The 11th century Buckfast Abbey is undergoing a ¬£4 million restoration and expansion to mark its upcoming millennium in 2018.

Write an article based on this \\"China's foreign ministry has confirmed that police are investigating artist Ai Weiwei for suspected economic crimes.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: China's Foreign Ministry Confirms Police Investigation into Artist Ai Weiwei for Alleged Economic Crimes Introduction: China's foreign ministry has recently confirmed that the country's police force is conducting an investigation into renowned artist and activist Ai Weiwei, following suspicions of economic crimes. This announcement raises several concerns about the relationship between artistic freedom, activism, and government control in China, as well as the implications of such investigations on both the artist's career and on a larger scale, the country's international relations. Background: Ai Weiwei is a prominent Chinese contemporary artist and political activist. His artworks, which often combine elements of Chinese tradition with modern materials and techniques, have been exhibited worldwide, earning him international acclaim. However, his bold criticism of the Chinese government's policies and human rights record, both through his art and public statements, has made him a controversial figure in his homeland. In the past decade, Ai has faced various forms of suppression, including arrests, travel restrictions, and the demolition of his Shanghai studio. Despite these setbacks, he maintains a strong global following and remains dedicated to his activism, often addressing issues related to censorship, surveillance, and political repression. The Investigation: According to Chinese authorities, Ai Weiwei is currently under investigation for suspicions of economic crimes. While specific details of the alleged crimes have not been revealed, it is widely believed that they may include tax evasion or mismanagement of his art foundations. The artist denies any wrongdoing and has voiced his belief that the investigation is a thinly veiled attempt to curtail his activism and intimidate him into silence. Those familiar with China's legal system may argue that it is not uncommon for the government to use economic crime charges as a tool to suppress dissenting voices. The recent arrest of legal activist Xu Zhiyong on similar charges illustrates this concern. Additionally, such actions may also serve to deter others from speaking out against the government. Implications for Artistic Freedom and Activism in China: This latest move by the Chinese government raises further concerns about the limited scope of artistic freedom and activism in the country. By investigating Ai Weiwei on charges of economic crimes, authorities appear to be sending a message to other artists and activists that criticizing the government can have severe consequences. As a result, this investigation not only attempts to silence Ai Weiwei but may also serve as a chilling deterrent to other potential critics. Moreover, as Ai Weiwei's influence extends beyond China's borders, the investigation may have wider ramifications for the country's international relations. His supporters in the global art community and human rights organizations have expressed their concern over his treatment, which could negatively impact China's reputation in these circles. Diplomatic tensions may also arise as countries with more liberal values may view the investigation as an egregious violation of human rights. Conclusion: The investigation of Ai Weiwei for suspected economic crimes underscores the complex relationship between art, activism, and government control in China. As a high-profile figure with an international following, Ai Weiwei's case has the potential to bring attention to issues of artistic freedom, censorship, and the abuse of power within the country. However, the outcome of this investigation remains uncertain ‚Äî it could either have a chilling effect on artists and activists in China or galvanize others to rally behind Ai Weiwei, resulting in an amplified call for reform and greater freedom of expression. In any case, the actions of the Chinese government and the international community's response to this case will be closely watched, with lasting repercussions for artistic freedom and political dissent in China and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer?","completion":"The German surname Schwarzkopf literally means \\"black head\\" in English. The name is a compound word derived from two separate German words: \\"schwarz\\" which means \\"black\\" and \\"kopf\\" which means \\"head.\\" It is a descriptive name that likely originated as a nickname for someone with dark hair or a dark complexion. The Schwarzkopf surname is an example of a type of surname known as a \\"descriptive\\" or \\"nickname\\" surname. During the Middle Ages in Germany, as the population increased and people were living in closer proximity to one another, it became necessary to differentiate individuals with the same given name. Surnames were adopted and took various forms, such as occupational (derived from a person's job), patronymic (derived from a person's father's name), topographical (derived from a person's geographic location), or descriptive/nickname (derived from a person's physical appearance or personal characteristics). In the case of Schwarzkopf, the descriptive nature of the name likely evolved over time. For instance, the name may have initially been used to describe someone with distinctive dark hair or a dark complexion, and this description eventually became the individual's identity and was passed down to their descendants. It's important to note that while this name suggests a person had a certain appearance or characteristic, it does not necessarily mean that all people with this surname share those same qualities today. Although the Schwarzkopf surname originated in Germany, it has spread to other countries due to immigration and cultural exchange. The name can now be found in various forms in countries such as Austria, Switzerland, and the United States. One notable person with the Schwarzkopf surname is Hasso Plattner, a German entrepreneur and co-founder of the software company SAP SE. Another famous Schwarzkopf was General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr., the United States Army general who led coalition forces during the Gulf War in 1991. Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, a German-born opera singer, also bore this name, as did Hans Schwarzkopf, a German chemist who founded the company Schwarzkopf & Henkel, which produces hair care products and is now under the Henkel brand. In conclusion, the German surname Schwarzkopf literally translates to \\"black head\\" and originated as a descriptive nickname based on a person's physical appearance, specifically referring to dark hair or a dark complexion. As with many surnames, its meaning and origin provide a glimpse into the historical context and cultural evolution that shaped the identities of individuals and families throughout history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: The railroads opened up the Great Plains for settlement, for now it was possible to ship wheat and other crops at low cost to the urban markets in the East, and Europe. Homestead land was free for American settlers. Railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established. Immigrants poured in, especially from Germany and Scandinavia. On the plains, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves; they clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, feeding the hired hands, and, especially after the 1930s, handling paperwork and financial details. During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After approximately one generation, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New technology including sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women regarding farm bookkeeping, and home economics courses in the schools. what did the railroads make it easy to do?","completion":"The railroads made it easier to open up the Great Plains for settlement by providing efficient and low-cost transportation of goods, particularly wheat and other crops. This allowed the settlers to ship their produce to urban markets in the East and Europe, expanding their potential customer base.

This was further bolstered by the influx of immigrants, primarily from Germany and Scandinavia. With the railroads in place, operating a farm or ranch became a more feasible endeavor for both families and single individuals. The integration of women into the workforce allowed families to more effectively manage the numerous chores required for maintaining a farm, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing housework, and taking care of hired hands. Over time, technological advancements like sewing and washing machines enabled women to transition towards more domestic roles. This shift in women's role within the family was reinforced by the scientific housekeeping movement, which promoted a focus on domesticity through various media outlets, government extension agents, county fairs, advice columns, and home economics courses in schools. Overall, the railroads facilitated the expansion and development of the Great Plains region by providing critical transportation infrastructure to a previously underserved area, enabling the exchange of goods, and fostering the growth of rural communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself. Fullback Don Billingsley has a rocky relationship with his father, who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. DC‚Äôs new motto: Why buy when you can rent? FORTUNE ‚Äî Owning once trumped renting, but the collapse of the U.S. housing market changed all that. Newly strapped consumers took it upon themselves to redefine the American dream, making it socially acceptable to mail in a rent check instead of a mortgage payment. Now, it seems Washington policymakers might have finally caught on. The Obama administration is exploring several options to help stabilize the nation‚Äôs troubled housing market ‚Äî including turning thousands of government-owned foreclosures into rental properties. The Federal Housing Finance Agency is seeking input from investors on how it could offer homes owned by mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae for rent. As of now, the details of the proposal are as unclear as its potential effects on the deeply troubled housing market. Still, it would be a profound about-face for the U.S. government. Policies explicitly encouraging home ownership date back to the Great Depression. During the crisis of the 1930s, when half of all mortgages went into default, a series of federal measures were enacted to help troubled homeowners, laying the foundation for a government active in the housing market. Over the last half-century, Freddie and Fannie had a similar mandate, expanding homeownership but also getting caught in the 2008 crisis, ultimately requiring rescue. With a growing bailout that could ultimately cost as much as 389 billion, the administration is looking for a better way forward. Selling the homes the government now owns sure hasn‚Äôt worked out. (Freddie and Fannie still own or guarantee about half of the nation‚Äôs mortgages and nearly all new mortgages.) As of the end of June, the government-owned roughly 248,000 foreclosed homes, mostly concentrated in California, Georgia, Florida and Arizona. About 70,000 are for sale. Generally, sales of homes have languished despite government subsidies and tax breaks. What‚Äôs more, the so-called shadow inventory stands to depress home prices even further. There is currently about a nine-month supply of properties in the housing market. And with 4.1 million more mortgages that are at least 90 days delinquent or in foreclosure, an additional 10.5 months of supply is expected to flood into the housing market. That could send home prices even further into free fall. That‚Äôs where rentals come in. Demand for rentals has been steadily rising, making it a natural place for policymakers to look for solutions. The rental vacancy rate during the three months ending in June was 5.5%, down from its peak of 7.5% during the first three months of 2009. By contrast, vacancies in homes for sale held steady at 3.5% during the same period, even as home prices have fallen about 30% since their 2006 peak. Given the excess inventory and the steady rise in rental prices, it may be the best place for the government to start. Bill Wheaton, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology‚Äôs Center for Real Estate, argues this would take hundreds of thousands of homes for sale off the market and therefore help stabilize prices. Additionally, it would slow the rise in prices for rentals, a good thing given how financially constrained many households still are as they continue to deleverage from years of over-spending. ‚ÄúIt could really make a difference,‚Äù Wheaton says, adding that the government should sell its properties to investors and create incentives for them to rent rather than sell for a period of time. What‚Äôs more, residential construction is at record lows. And with U.S. population growth at 1% a year, it‚Äôs certainly possible that a robust market for rentals could absorb much of the housing market‚Äôs excess supply. ‚ÄúIt has the potential to have a greater impact on the market than anything they‚Äôre doing currently,‚Äù says Chris Mayer, a real estate professor at Columbia University and a fan of the idea. Such a plan has its fair share of potential problems though. Demand for rentals might not be enough to absorb all the excess inventory. And buying up homes in bulk might pose a logistical challenge for investors, as foreclosed properties cluster and dot across the country. The nation‚Äôs biggest banks and mortgage lenders have also amassed a huge empire of homes resulting from foreclosures totaling more than 872,000 homes ‚Äî almost twice as many as when the financial crisis began in 2007, according to RealtyTrac, a real estate data provider. The idea also represents one additional major shift, that Washington lawmakers finally realize a new wave of homebuyers isn‚Äôt going to materialize any time soon to save the housing market. And if that‚Äôs the case, renters may in fact be Washington‚Äôs best hope in the short-term.

To elaborate further on the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge, it holds historical significance as an example of a rare 19th-century engineering design, in addition to being the oldest bridge in the area. The Whipple truss design was developed by Squire Whipple, an American civil engineer, in 1841. This design became popular for its efficiency, being used primarily for the construction of railroad bridges during the mid-19th century. The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was built in 1874 by the Clarke County Virginia Construction Company and was later relocated from its original position over the South Branch of the Potomac River to its present location in Capon Lake. The bridge spans 203 feet in length and features timber and iron Whipple truss. The total length of the bridge, including the approaches, is 312 feet. Due to its historical and architectural significance, the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.

It became apparent that there were two distinct situations occurring simultaneously that hindered the success of their conversation. 1) Jeffrey had no interest in giving answers: It was evident that Jeffrey was growing increasingly disinterested in the discussion, perhaps due to his perception that the topic at hand was trivial or not worth his time. This lack of enthusiasm on his part made it difficult for him to provide any meaningful input or feedback, causing the conversation to stall without any resolutions. As a result, his unwillingness to give answers only exacerbated the situation, as Matthew continued to seek a clear direction or guidance to address the issue at hand. This disengagement from Jeffrey only served to further alienate Matthew, as he struggled to navigate through the problem on his own without any support or insights from Jeffrey. 2) Matthew had no interest in giving answers: On the other hand, Matthew appeared equally uninterested in contributing to the conversation, leading to his reluctance in providing any valuable input on his thoughts or feelings about the issue. This lack of input created a one-sided conversation where Jeffrey found himself speaking at Matthew, rather than conversing with him. This disinterest from Matthew might have stemmed from various factors such as feeling overwhelmed by the issue, a belief that the problem was unsolvable, or even the perception that Jeffrey was not a reliable source of guidance. Whatever the reason, Matthew's unwillingness to provide answers likewise perpetuated the breakdown of communication between the two parties. In conclusion, the unsuccessful attempt by Jeffrey to communicate with Matthew about the issue was mainly due to the combined disinterest in providing answers from both parties. As neither individual was willing to actively engage in the conversation and find common ground, the breakdown in communication escalated, ultimately leaving the issue unresolved and potentially straining their relationship.

First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A. Which would have higher specific gravity, item A or item B? Answer:","completion":"The specific gravity is a relative measure used to compare the densities of different substances with respect to a reference substance, typically water. In this case, we are looking to compare the specific gravities of item A (the Earth) and item B (a surface rock sample). To determine this, let's first analyze the composition and characteristics of item A (the Earth) and item B (the surface rock sample). Item A: The Earth The Earth is a complex structure with several layers, including the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. Each layer is made up of various materials with different densities. As we go deeper towards the Earth's center, the pressure and temperature increase, resulting in an increase in density. Earth's mean density is approximately 5.52 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm¬≥). Item B: Surface Rock Sample Surface rocks, like the sample collected by John, typically come from the Earth's crust. The crust is the outermost and thinnest layer, comprising of less dense materials such as silicates and oxides. Common rocks seen on Earth's surface include granite and basalt with their densities ranging from 2.5 to 3.3 g/cm¬≥. Now, let us compare the specific gravities of Earth (item A) and the surface rock sample (item B). Since specific gravity is a relative measure, we can calculate the specific gravity of each item using the following formula: Specific Gravity = (Density of Substance) / (Density of Reference Substance) In our case, the reference substance is water, with a density of approximately 1 g/cm¬≥. Specific Gravity of item A (the Earth) = 5.52 g/cm¬≥ / 1 g/cm¬≥ = 5.52 Specific Gravity of item B (surface rock) = Let's consider a range between 2.5 to 3.3 g/cm¬≥ / 1 g/cm¬≥ = 2.5 to 3.3 By comparing the specific gravity values, we can conclude that item A (the Earth) has a higher specific gravity than item B (the surface rock sample). The higher specific gravity of Earth is due to its denser layers, like the outer and inner cores, which contribute to its overall density. In contrast, the surface rocks are from the Earth's crust, which is made up of comparatively less dense materials and therefore has a lower specific gravity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A family in a camper van stops in the middle of the road to argue about directions, and Hart must swerve to avoid them, going off the road and crashing. A patient at the nearby Keloid Clinc for Plastic Surgery witnesses the accident and calls for an ambulance. At the clinic, Murray Cypher (Joe Silver) pitches a promising franchising deal to Dr. Dan Keloid (Howard Ryshpan) and his wife Roxanne (Patricia Gage). Keloid is unconvinced, afraid that he'll become the \\"Colonel Sanders of plastic surgery\\". Just then, an ambulance containing Hart and Rose arrives. Hart has a broken hand, separated shoulder, and a concussion, but Rose, having been pinned under the motorcycle, is more severely injured. Dr. Keloid recognizes that Rose needs immediate surgery and decides to perform a radical procedure on her, one which uses morphogenetically neutral grafts of her own skin to patch the injured tissues in and on her chest and abdomen. The treated skin will be able to form new tissue of whatever type it is grafted to, but it also might lead to cancer.A month or two passes. Hart has already gone home to Montreal, but Rose still remains in a coma at the Keolid Clinic. Then one night, one of the other patients, Lloyd Walsh (J.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What two fleets were involved in the Battle of Bornholm? from the following article ? Early in March 1676, a Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish‚ÄìDutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of R√ºgen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25‚Äì26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of √ñland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of √ñland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The...

A man is chopping coriander leaf. A man is playing a guitar.","completion":"I would rate the similarity between these two sentences at a 1 out of 5. The main reason for this low similarity rating is that the actions described in each sentence are significantly different: 1. \\"A man is chopping coriander leaf\\" - This sentence is describing an action related to cooking or food preparation. Chopping coriander leaves involves using a knife and cutting board, and the activity takes place in a kitchen or a similar location. 2. \\"A man is playing a guitar\\" - This sentence is describing a musical activity, where the person is playing an instrument (guitar) rather than doing something related to cooking/food preparation. This activity may typically occur in a range of locations, such as at home, in a concert, or during a practice session in a music studio. Although both sentences have the subject \\"A man\\" in common, the verbs and objects are completely dissimilar. The verbs (\\"chopping\\" and \\"playing\\") signify actions that belong to entirely different domains (cooking and music, respectively). The objects involved (\\"coriander leaf\\" and \\"guitar\\") also have no apparent connection, as one is a type of herb and the other is a musical instrument. Because the primary actions and objects in these sentences are notably distinct, it is reasonable to assign a similarity rating of 1, indicating that the two sentences are not very similar to each other."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The mighty fane, with its three massive towers, rises majestically over the red roofs of the town. Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness.

A government-sponsored coup last year made Bruce Iwasaki and Neal Dudovitz the kings of Los Angeles County's federally funded legal aid community. The two men emerged atop a changed landscape that resulted from a decade of begging for a share of shrinking public dollars doled out by an unsympathetic GOP-controlled Congress. That era was capped in 1998, when the Legal Services Corp. forced 275 legal aid providers nationwide to combine into 179. To comply with the orders from their main funding source, a new species of poverty lawyer emerged - a tech-savvy and button-down breed who swapped neighborhood walkin offices for toll-free phone lines, self-help kiosks and Internet access to legal advice. While some organizations made the dramatic change look effortless, for others, it did not come easy. And few programs provide more dramatic illustrations of the promise and pitfalls of government-funded legal services than Los Angeles County's two largest providers of federally funded services - Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and Pacoima-based Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County. From his offices in Koreatown, Iwasaki, a soft-spoken former O'Melveny & Myers attorney, quietly engineered a merger between a much smaller Legal Aid Society of Long Beach and his program, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. The merger was completed peacefully within a year of the federal order. Today, the programs operate seamlessly, offering new innovations - including toll-free multilingual phone advisers, expanded hours for domestic-violence clinics, and renewed immigration and consumer aid - built on the foundations of the old program.

A 2000 United States Department of the Treasury study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that 467 billion of mortgage lending was made by Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)-covered lenders into low and mid level income (LMI) borrowers and neighborhoods, representing 10% of all U.S. mortgage lending during the period. The majority of these were prime loans. Sub-prime loans made by CRA-covered institutions constituted a 3% market share of LMI loans in 1998, but in the run-up to the crisis, fully 25% of all sub-prime lending occurred at CRA-covered institutions and another 25% of sub-prime loans had some connection with CRA. In addition, an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in 2009, however, concluded that the CRA was not responsible for the mortgage loan crisis, pointing out that CRA rules have been in place since 1995 whereas the poor lending emerged only a decade later. Furthermore, most sub-prime loans were not made to the LMI borrowers targeted by the CRA, especially in the years 2005‚Äì2006 leading up to the crisis. Nor did it find any evidence that lending under the CRA rules increased delinquency rates or that the CRA indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub-prime lending.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: It's 1941, and newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles, who also directed and co-wrote the script) is dead. The opening shots show Xanadu, Kane's vast, elaborate, and now unkempt estate in Florida. Interspersed with segments of his newsreel obituary are scenes from his life and death. Most puzzling are his last moments: clutching a snowglobe, he mutters the word \\"rosebud.\\" Kane, whose life was news and whose newspapers not only reported but formed public opinion, was central to his time, a larger-than-life figure. The newsreel editor feels that until they know who or what Rosebud is they won't have the whole story on Kane. He assigns a reporter called Thompson (William Alland) to investigate Rosebud.Thompson digs into Kane's life and hears a lot of stories, but none of them reveal the meaning of Rosebud. The reporter sees Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), the tycoon's ex-wife; she's drunk and won't speak to him. Then he reads the unpublished memoirs of Mr. Thatcher (George Coulouris), Kane's early financial adviser and childhood guardian, who later became a prime target of the Kane newspapers' trust-busting attacks. In one of many flashbacks, the Thatcher memoir shows Kane's mother signing guardianship of the boy and his fortune over to Thatcher, despite his father's objections. When Charles objected violently to being sent away with Thatcher, Kane Sr. remarked, \\"what the kid needs is a good thrashing.\\" Mrs. Kane responded, \\"That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him.\\" (Some present-day fans of the film interpret this to mean that Mr. Kane was abusive. 1940s audiences were more likely to have believed that Mrs. Kane was over-protective and that if Charles had been allowed to grow up enjoying the love and discipline of his parents, his life would have turned out better.)Years later, as he was about to get control of his business affairs, Kane's interest in newspapers was piqued when he noticed that he owned the struggling New York Daily Inquirer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:What is your favorite color? Do you like yellow, orange, and red? If you do, you must be an optimist , a leader, an active person who enjoys life, people and excitement. Do you prefer grays and blues? Then you are probably quiet, shy and you would rather follow than lead. If you love green, you are strong-minded and determined. You wish to succeed and want other people to see you are successful. At least this is what psychologists tell us, and they should know, because they have been seriously studying the meaning of color preference , and the effect that colors have on human beings. They tell us that we don't choose our favorite color as we grow up. If you happen to love brown, you did so as soon as you opened your eyes, or at least as soon as you could see clearly. A yellow room makes us feel more cheerful and more comfortable than a dark green one, and a red dress rings warmth and cheer to the saddest winter day. On the other hand, black is depressing . Light and bright colors make people not only happier but more active. It is a fact that factory workers work better, harder, and have fewer accidents when their machines are painted orange rather than black or dark gray.

Strong blade, the serrated edge stays sharp, and the blunted tip is great for prying things. Seatbelt cutter is sharp and works well, but I generally just use the blade. Window punch is a great help on wrecks.Just bought another one for my brother for Christmas Answer:","completion":"Upon analysis of the contents of the review, it is clear that the customer is satisfied with the product. There are several indications within their statement to highlight this satisfaction. Firstly, the customer mentions that they have been using the knife for 6 years, which suggests long-term use and durability - both qualities that typically make a product satisfying to a customer over time. They also took the time to explicitly list the qualities they appreciate about the knife. For instance, they mention a strong blade and a serrated edge which stays sharp, demonstrating that the effectiveness and reliability of the knife meet their expectations. They also note that the blunted tip is good for prying things, further showing satisfaction with the functionality of the product. The customer confirms that the seatbelt cutter on the knife is sharp and works well, and while they prefer using the blade, the comment speaks positively to the multi-functionality of the knife. Additionally, the customer praises the window punch as a 'great help on wrecks'. This not only shows satisfaction with the knife's usefulness in emergency situations but also illustrates their satisfaction with how effectively the knife works as a tool in stressful scenarios. Moreover, perhaps one of the strongest indicators of customer satisfaction is that the customer said that they have purchased another one of these knives for their brother as a Christmas gift. This illustrative action shows that they not only appreciate the knife but also consider it of high enough quality to give it as a present. In conclusion, both the explicit praise the customer gives to the different parts of the knife and the fact that they liked it enough to buy it as a gift for someone else strongly signal that the customer was very satisfied with the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I was happy with the price of 19.99 and thought that was a good deal, however I forgot to check the price of shipping, as I was in such a rush to get all of my Christmas shopping done. The total cost of the castle ended up being around 48, which was way over-priced. Unfortunately by the time I noticed how much shipping was it was too late, I had already paid.Another problem that I have is that the overall quality of the castle is very poor. Most of the parts (you have to put it together) did not fit together properly during assembly.

Touch Britain, along with much of Northern Europe and the Far East, has a \\"non-contact\\" culture. In those countries, there is very little physical contact in people's daily talks. Even brushing someone's arm by accident is the reason for an apology. However, in the high-contact cultures of the Middle East, Latin America, and southern Europe, physical touch is a big part of daily life. What's more, there are different standards for who touches whom and where. In much of the Arab world, men hold hands and kiss each other in greeting, but would never do the same with a woman. In Thailand and Laos, it is taboo to touch anyone's head, even children's. In South Korea, elders can touch younger people with force when trying to get through a crowd, but younger people can't do the same. Eye contact In most Western countries, frequent eye contact is a sign of confidence and attentiveness . We may think that a conversation partner who looks away is either not listening to us or lying. Of course, this is not the standard around the world. In many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, the unbroken eye contact would be considered impolite and rude.

He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between ¬£20,000 and ¬£30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around ¬£7,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25 m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and, in all likelihood, were two of those who shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary. Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night, while the journalist J P Eddy suggests that Svaars was among those present. Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman who wrote a history of the events, considers that those present consisted of Gardstein, Smoller, Peters and Dubof, with a second group in case the work needed to continue into the following day, which included among their number Sokolow and Svaars. Rumbelow considers a third group on standby, staying at Hoffman's lodgings, to have comprised Hoffman, Rosen and Osip Federoff, an unemployed locksmith.

Let's evaluate both options: (i) Hold pressure on the area where you're bleeding until the blood stops. (ii) Squeeze the area that's bleeding until the blood stops. Option (i) involves applying direct pressure to the bleeding site. This method aligns with the general guideline for first-aid treatment of bleeding, which is to apply pressure over the wound to facilitate clotting. Direct pressure helps control blood flow from the injured blood vessels, allowing a clot to form and eventually stop the bleeding. This method is also easy to apply and typically does not cause additional harm to the injured area. Option (ii) suggests squeezing the bleeding area, which may not always be recommended as it can cause additional pain and damage to the injured tissues. Moreover, squeezing the area may not be as effective in terms of controlling blood flow and allowing a clot to form properly.

In the preseason, Hertl scored 3 goals and 1 assist, and joined Joe Thornton and Brent Burns on a line, filling the hole created by Raffi Torres' injury. Hertl made his NHL debut against the Vancouver Canucks on 3 October, 2013 and tallied his first career point with an assist on a goal by Brent Burns. At age 19, Hertl became the first teenager to play in a season opener for the Sharks since Marc-√âdouard Vlasic in 2006. Hertl scored his first two NHL goals in the next game on 5 October 2013, against Mike Smith of the Phoenix Coyotes; Hertl became the youngest player to score 2 goals for the Sharks in one game since Patrick Marleau on 17 March 1999. On 8 October 2013, Hertl registered 4 goals against the New York Rangers in a 9‚Äì2 victory, making him the fourth youngest player in the NHL to record a four-goal game (19 years, 330 days old) after Jimmy Carson did in the 1987‚Äì88 NHL season with the Los Angeles Kings (19 years, 254 days old). Hertl also became the first Shark to score four goals in one game since Owen Nolan in 1995. Hertl was eventually named the October Rookie of the Month, scoring eight goals, which led all rookies, and 11 points in 13 games. However, on 19 December against the Kings, Hertl injured his knee after a collision with Dustin Brown, and is reported to miss at least a month. Hertl had surgery on his MCL and PCL in his right knee on 31 December. A former NHL trainer stated that the \\"best-case scenario\\" for Hertl's return was approximately twelve weeks, though Kevin Kurz of CSN Bay Area wrote that Hertl could be out for six to nine months. On 11 April 2014, Hertl was cleared to return to the Sharks against the Colorado Avalanche, ending a 45-game absence. On 17 April, against the Kings, Hertl scored his first career playoff goal.

In June, fearing imminent arrest, Souther defected to the Soviet Union by flying from the United States to Rome, where the Soviet intelligence services transferred him to Moscow. Initially, Soviet counterintelligence units were suspicious of Souther's defection and feared that he was a double agent for the CIA, but he was cleared shortly afterwards. On 2 October 1986, Souther was granted Soviet citizenship in a decree from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and adopted the Russian name Mikhail Yevgenyevich Orlov. Souther was well-received by the Soviet authorities, gifting him an apartment in Moscow and a dacha on the outskirts of the city, and promoting him to the rank of major in the KGB ‚Äì one of few foreign spies to be commissioned as an officer in the agency. Souther became actively engaged in scientific activities, developed his own English teaching program, walked around Moscow a lot, and travelled to other Soviet cities. Souther met and befriended other foreign Soviet intelligence agents that had defected including Kim Philby and George Blake. Souther married a Russian woman named Elena, an English teacher at the Intelligence Institute, and they had a daughter named Alexandra. In early 1989, Souther was awarded an Order of Friendship of Peoples for his contributions in the intelligence services following a petition from the KGB leadership. Passage 3:The Norse-Gaelic Clan Donald traces its descent from D√≤mhnall Mac Raghnuill (d. circa 1250), whose father Reginald or Ranald was styled \\"King of the Isles\\" and \\"Lord of Argyll and Kintyre\\". Ranald's father, Somerled was styled \\"King of the Hebrides\\", and was killed campaigning against Malcolm IV of Scotland at the Battle of Renfrew in 1164. Clan Donald shares a descent from Somerled with Clan MacDougall, who traces their lineage from his elder son, Dugall mac Somhairle. Their dynasties are together commonly referred to as the Clann Somhairle. Furthermore, they are descended maternally from both the House of Godred Crovan and the Earls of Orkney, through Somerled's wife Ragnhildis √ìlafsd√≥ttir, daughter of Olaf I Godredsson, King of Mann and the Isles and Ingeborg Haakonsdottir daughter of Haakon Paulsson, Earl of Orkney. It remains uncertain if the Clann Somhairle are also descendants in some manner, through one or another of the above dynasts, of the House of Ivar, but this is commonly argued.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: what is the first area mentioned? Context: During the middle decades of the 18th century, there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the Indian subcontinent, the Carnatic Wars, as the English East India Company (the Company) and its French counterpart, the Compagnie fran√ßaise des Indes orientales, struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the Mughal Empire. The Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies, left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India. France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India. In the following decades the Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the British Indian Army, the vast majority of which was composed of Indian sepoys.

Summarize this article: A first-half onslaught began after five minutes, when Stevie Mallan volleyed in the opener, then delivered for Gary McKenzie to head home. Stephen McGinn tapped in a cross, before Kyle Magennis and Lewis Morgan scored either side of half-time. Paul Cairney and Farid El Alagui grabbed consolations for Ayr, before Cammy Smith completed the rout. The Buddies have played a game fewer than United, and boast a significantly superior goal difference. Mallan kicked things off in style, cracking a sweet, low volley from 18 yards into Greg Fleming's bottom-right corner. The midfielder turned provider for Saints' second, whipping in a cross for MacKenzie to bullet home, before McGinn stabbed in the third from Stelios Demetriou's delivery. Mallan jinked past two Ayr defenders, but struck the post with his shot shortly after, but St Mirren stretched their lead eight minutes before the break, when Magennis raced onto a diagonal pass to evade keeper Fleming and fire home from an acute angle. Morgan made it five seven minutes into the second half, coolly picking his spot from 18 yards out. The 20-year-old was stretchered off injured with 20 minutes to play - the only real negative for Buddies manager Jack Ross. Ayr staged a mini-revival in the final quarter, with Cairney, then El Alagui finding the net, but Smith bundled home number six for Saints, completing an emphatic performance that has given their Championship survival hopes a massive shot in the arm. St Mirren manager Jack Ross: \\"I understand my responsibility to give supporters the product on the pitch - we're doing that. \\"The results and performances won't always be perfect, but as long as we play in that manner, the support will come from the stands. That's happened regularly, home and away, over the past few months. \\"We're still in the most difficult position in the league, I understand that, but from where we were two or three months ago - we were dead and buried, a lot of people had written us off, we were double-figure points adrift, we're back with a real opportunity to stay in this league, which would be a terrific achievement.\\" Ayr United manager Ian McCall: \\"St Mirren thoroughly deserved to win and I don't think the margin flattered them. I'm not making excuses for myself, but two or three of the players are carrying injuries from the Dunfermline game and haven't trained, so that was a catch-up. \\"We've got two home games coming up, and all this means is that we have to win both of them, rather than just one. \\"I'm not under pressure in the slightest.

Dallas Cowboys RB Joseph Randle arrested on drug charge Updated FEB 05, 2015 6:47a ET The Cowboys like to argue that Joseph Randle is more knucklehead than troublemaker. But that can be a fine line ‚Äî and he's accused of crossing it again. Police say the running back ‚Äî a potential successor to NFL rushing champ and free agent DeMarco Murray ‚Äî was arrested in his native Wichita, Kansas, on Tuesday after authorities responded to a domestic-violence call at a hotel at about 3 a.m. Police said Randle's apparent girlfriend reported she and Randle were arguing. When police arrived, according to KAKE-TV, they found marijuana in the room and arrested Randle on suspicion of marijuana possession, according to AP. Wichita police spokesman Lt. James Espinoza said Randle was arrested early Tuesday after the 22-year-old mother of Randle's child called 911 to report she fought with him in a hotel room. Espinoza said the woman showed no signs of being injured. According to Randle's agent, Erik Burkhardt, Randle was not arrested and he denies there was any violence charge. Joseph Randle was NOT arrested. He was cited with a ticket, and the police officer then left his hotel room. There was zero \\"violence\\" of any kind, domestic or otherwise. He was asking 3 ppl to exit his room, who didn't want to leave. (Cont) It was loud. Cops were called. Ticket issued. People and officer left. He went to bed. NBC Sports' Pro Football Talk blog had this to say regarding the discrepancy: However, PFT contacted Lt. James Espinoza, the Wichita Police spokesperson, and he confirmed that although Randle wasn‚Äôt booked and didn‚Äôt have a mug shot taken, he was arrested and given a notice to appear in court. ‚ÄúHis agent can say what he wants to. Here in Wichita, Kansas, it‚Äôs considered an arrest,‚Äù Espinoza said. Espinoza said that the police originally arrived on the scene for a domestic violence call but saw no reason to make a domestic violence arrest. He said police will continue to investigate. Randle was arrested in October 2014 on accusations of shoplifting underwear and cologne from a Dallas area mall. \\"I'm just trying to take full responsibility and really just move on from it,\\" he said in October of the shoplifting incident. \\"It's the biggest mistake I've ever made in my life. ... I've never been in any kind of trouble in my whole life.\\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Information: - The micrometre (International spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures; SI symbol: m) or micrometer (American spelling), also commonly known as a micron, is an SI derived unit of length equaling 1√ó10 of a metre (SI standard prefix \\"micro-\\" = 10); that is, one millionth of a metre (or one thousandth of a millimetre, 0.001 mm, or about 0.000039 inch). The symbol m is sometimes rendered as um if the symbol cannot be used, or if the writer is not aware of the distinction. - Radioactive waste is waste that contains radioactive material. Radioactive waste is usually a by-product of nuclear power generation and other applications of nuclear fission or nuclear technology, such as research and medicine. Radioactive waste is hazardous to most forms of life and the environment, and is regulated by government agencies in order to protect human health and the environment. - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population. - Disinfectants are antimicrobial agents that are applied to non-living objects to destroy microorganisms that are living on the objects . Disinfection does not necessarily kill all microorganisms , especially resistant bacterial spores ; it is less effective than sterilization , which is an extreme physical and / or chemical process that kills all types of life . Disinfectants are different from other antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics , which destroy microorganisms within the body , and antiseptics , which destroy microorganisms on living tissue . Disinfectants are also different from biocides -- the latter are intended to destroy all forms of life , not just microorganisms . Disinfectants work by destroying the cell wall of microbes or interfering with the metabolism . Sanitizers are substances that simultaneously clean and disinfect . Disinfectants are frequently used in hospitals , dental surgeries , kitchens , and bathrooms to kill infectious organisms . Bacterial endospores are most resistant to disinfectants , but some viruses and bacteria also possess some tolerance . In wastewater treatment , a disinfection step with chlorine , ultra-violet ( UV ) radiation or ozonation can be included as tertiary treatment to remove pathogens from wastewater , for example if it is to be reused to irrigate golf courses . An alternative term used in the sanitation sector for disinfection of waste streams , sewage sludge or fecal sludge is sanitisation or sanitization . - An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - A biocide is defined in the European legislation as a chemical substance or microorganism intended to destroy, deter, render harmless, or exert a controlling effect on any harmful organism by chemical or biological means. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses a slightly different definition for biocides as \\"a diverse group of poisonous substances including preservatives, insecticides, disinfectants, and pesticides used for the control of organisms that are harmful to human or animal health or that cause damage to natural or manufactured products\\". When compared, the two definitions roughly imply the same, although the US EPA definition includes plant protection products and some veterinary medicines. - Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats.

Such a solution is called a buffer. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid or a base and its salt. Both components must be present for the system to act as a buffer to resist changes in pH. Commercial buffer solutions, which have a wide variety of pH values, can be obtained. I am facing a new situation today: John is a scientist in a large pharmaceutical company. He devices many useful products using his knowledge of chemistry. Today, he has four solutions in front of him, solution A, solution B, solution C, and solution D. Solution A is a buffer, but solution B is not a buffer. Solution C is acidic, but solution D is not acidic. He needs to figure out what each solution does. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which solution would resist changes in pH, solution A or solution B?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article, a buffer is a solution of a weak acid or a base and its salt, and it is capable of resisting large changes in pH when relatively small amounts of acid or base are added to them.

Take up relaxation exercises to keep you calm.\\"","completion":"Title: Stay Organized and Embrace Relaxation: A Guide to a Calmer, More Efficient Life Introduction: In an increasingly fast-paced world, we may find ourselves feeling overwhelmed and stressed out by the mounting demands of our every day lives. To create a sense of balance and enjoy a higher quality of life, it is crucial to stay organized and invest time in relaxation exercises that keep you calm. This article will delve into the importance of organization and relaxation, offering effective tips and methods to help you create a positive change in your daily life. The Importance of Staying Organized: 1. Increased productivity: By staying organized, you are better equipped to manage tasks effectively and efficiently, ultimately increasing your productivity. An orderly environment enables easier access to essential tools and materials, saving you time and maintaining focus on the job at hand. 2. Reduced stress: A cluttered environment can often make for a cluttered mind, leading to unnecessary stress and anxiety. When you are organized, you gain more control over your environment and tasks, thereby reducing feelings of stress and overwhelm. 3. More leisure time: With everything in its rightful place, you no longer have to waste time searching for misplaced items or trying to remember details of your daily tasks. This frees up time for rest, relaxation, and the pursuit of hobbies or passions you previously didn't have the time for. 4. Improved decision-making: Staying organized helps create mental clarity and provides an accurate view of your tasks and projects. This allows for better decision-making, prioritization, and allocation of available resources. The Importance of Relaxation Exercises: 1. Stress relief: Relaxation exercises are essential for alleviating stress and combating the negative effects of living in a high-pressure society. They help to regulate cortisol levels in the body, reducing the physical and mental impact of stress. 2. Improved emotional well-being: By providing a respite from the daily grind, relaxation exercises help promote emotional well-being and mental clarity. This leads to a more balanced life and a better understanding of your emotions and thoughts. 3. Enhanced focus and concentration: Relaxation exercises allow the brain to rest, recharge, and recoup, leading to sharper focus and concentration. In turn, this improves productivity and the ability to tackle complex tasks more effectively. 4. Better physical health: Stress can take a toll on your physical health, leading to potential issues such as high blood pressure, heart disease, gastrointestinal problems, and more. Engaging in relaxation exercises allows the body to recover and maintain optimal health. Effective Tips and Methods for Organization and Relaxation: 1. Set clear goals: Establish both short-term and long-term goals to help break your tasks into manageable chunks and prioritize what needs to be accomplished first. Regular assessment and adjusting of these goals can also help you maintain focus and motivation. 2. Use a calendar and scheduling tools: Maintain a calendar to keep track of important dates, appointments, and tasks. Utilize scheduling tools and apps to organize your daily and weekly to-do lists. 3. Organize your living and working spaces: Create designated areas for work and relaxation. Keep work-related items away from your relaxation areas and ensure your physical environment remains clutter-free. 4. Practice time management: Allocate specific amounts of time for each task and try to stick to that schedule. Utilize techniques such as the Pomodoro Technique or the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks and manage your time effectively. 5. Engage in mindfulness exercises: Mindfulness techniques, such as meditation, deep breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation, promote calmness and help relieve stress. Set aside time daily or weekly for these exercises and notice the positive impact on your well-being. 6. Pursue hobbies that promote relaxation: Find activities that bring you joy and help you unwind. These could include artistic pursuits, reading, gardening, cooking, or any other activity you enjoy that makes you feel relaxed and content. 7. Establish a regular sleep schedule: A good night's sleep is vital for overall health, mental clarity, and the ability to remain organized. Aim for seven to nine hours of sleep each night and strive to maintain a consistent bedtime and wake-up time. Conclusion: Staying organized and incorporating relaxation exercises into your daily life are essential in helping you become more efficient and calmer. By implementing these strategies, you will not only reduce stress and increase your productivity, but also experience enhanced mental clarity and improved overall quality of life. With commitment and practice, you'll soon find that balancing organization and relaxation leads to a calmer, happier, and more fulfilling existence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Combine the \\"d\\" terms: 0 = (-36*d + 46*d) + 50 Since -36*d and 46*d are like terms, we can sum them: 0 = (46 - 36)*d + 50 0 = 10*d + 50 2. Now, let's isolate \\"d\\". To do this, we need to get rid of the constant term on the right side of the equation. Subtract 50 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 50 = 10*d + 50 - 50 -50 = 10*d 3. Now, we have a simple equation with just one term containing \\"d\\": -50 = 10*d To solve for \\"d\\", divide both sides of the equation by 10: -50 / 10 = 10 * d / 10 -5 = d So, the solution to the equation is d = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century.","completion":"The kingdom that converted to Christianity before Alodia was Nobadia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who is using the pseudonym 'Lydia Doherty?' Movie plot title: 88 Minutes Movie plot: Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Jack Gramm (Al Pacino) testifies at the trial of suspected serial murderer Jon Forster (Neal McDonough), dubbed \\"The Seattle Slayer\\" by police. Gramm's testimony and expert psychiatric opinion are crucial to help convict Forster of the attempted killing of Janie Cates and the murder of Joanie Cates, who was drugged, hanged upside down, and killed after the killer broke into her home. After receiving his conviction by the jury, Forster taunts Gramm, saying \\"Tick-tock, Doc.\\" Nine years later, as Forster's execution date approaches, several similar torture murders with very similar circumstances occur. Gramm is questioned by a lawyer from the Attorney General's office as well as FBI Special Agent Frank Parks (William Forsythe) about his connection to the latest victim, Dale Morris, a former psychology student of Gramm's with whom he was at a party the night before, just hours before her death. On the way to his class, Gramm receives a phone call from someone using software to distort their voice, threatening he has 88 minutes to live. He later reports the call to his secretary Shelly (Amy Brenneman) and has her put together a risk assessment profile of potential perpetrators. Gramm receives another threatening phone call while teaching and becomes suspicious of his students, particularly Mike Stempt (Benjamin McKenzie). The Dean of students, Carol Johnson (Deborah Kara Unger), interrupts the class to evacuate the building due to a bomb threat called in. As he evacuates the lecture hall, Gramm finds a written threat on the overhead projector in the classroom as well as on his car, which has been vandalized in the parking garage.

Most legal theorists believe that the rule of law has purely formal characteristics, meaning that the law must be publicly declared, with prospective application, and possess the characteristics of generality, equality, and certainty, but there are no requirements with regard to the content of the law. Others, including a few legal theorists, believe that the rule of law necessarily entails protection of individual rights. Within legal theory, these two approaches to the rule of law are seen as the two basic alternatives, respectively labelled the formal and substantive approaches. Still, there are other views as well.

Tinariwen (Tamasheq: , with vowels , pronounced tinariwen \\"deserts\\", plural of tenere \\"desert\\") is a Grammy Award-winning group of Tuareg musicians from the Sahara Desert region of northern Mali. The band was formed in 1979 in Tamanrasset, Algeria, but returned to Mali after a cease-fire in the 1990s. The group first started to gain a following outside the Sahara region in 2001 with the release of The Radio Tisdas Sessions, and with performances at Festival au Desert in Mali and the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Their popularity rose internationally with the release of the critically acclaimed Aman Iman in 2007. In 1998, Tinariwen came to the attention of the French world music ensemble Lo'Jo and their manager Philippe Brix. That group traveled to a music festival in Bamako and met two members of the Tinariwen collective. In 1999 some members of Tinariwen traveled to France and performed with Lo'Jo under the name Azawad. The two groups organized the January 2001 Festival au Desert in Essakane, Mali with Tinariwen as the headliners, and in close cooperation with the Belgian Sfinks Festival. The festival brought much outside attention to Tinariwen. By the end of 2001, Tinariwen had performed at WOMAD and Roskilde. Their debut CD, The Radio Tisdas Sessions, was recorded by Justin Adams and Jean-Paul Romann at the radio station of the same name (the only Tamashek-speaking station in Kidal, Mali) and released in 2001. It was Tinariwen's first recording to be released outside of northern Africa. Since 2001 Tinariwen have toured regularly in Europe, North America, Japan, and Australia; often appearing at large world music/alternative festivals like Glastonbury, Coachella, Roskilde, Les Vieilles Charrues, WOMAD, FMM Sines, and Printemps de Bourges. Tinariwen gained more attention overseas in 2004, with their first UK performance at the largest free African music festival in the country, Africa Oye. Their 2004 album Amassakoul (\\"The Traveller\\" in Tamashek) and its 2007 follow-up Aman Iman (\\"Water Is Life\\" in Tamashek) were released worldwide and gained the notice of celebrity fans including Carlos Santana, Robert Plant, Bono and the Edge of U2, Thom Yorke of Radiohead, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Henry Rollins, Brian Eno, and TV On The Radio. In 2005 Tinariwen received a BBC Award for World Music, and in 2008 they received Germany's prestigious Praetorius Music Prize. Also since 2001, the Tinariwen collective has added several younger Tuareg musicians who did not live through the military conflicts experienced by the older members but have contributed to the collective's multi-generational evolution. New members include bassist Eyadou Ag Leche, percussionist Said Ag Ayad, guitarist Elaga Ag Hamid, guitarist Abdallah Ag Lamida, and vocalists Wonou Walet Sidati and the Walet Oumar sisters. The band's 2009 album Imidiwan (Tamashek for \\"Companions\\") was recorded in a mobile studio by Jean-Paul Romann in the village of Tessalit, Mali.
